Print This Email This Update : Fournier regrets ' breezy ' correspondence with Rove
In its investigation of the misleading accounts that initially surrounded Pat Tillman 's death and Jessica Lynch 's rescue the House Oversight Committee on Monday shed some light on the White House 's press- management apparatus and the chummy relationship between Karl Rove and AP scribe Ron Fournier .
The report details the Bush administration 's exploitation of Tillman 's death and suppression of evidence that the former football pro who joined the Army Rangers after 9/11 was killed by friendly fire .
In the day 's after Tillman 's death , on April 22 , 2004 , the committee examined e-mails from the White House 's communications team , including some exchanges with reporters .
Commentators and reporters contacted the White House to offer advice .
For example , Wall Street Journal columnist Peggy Noonan e-mailed the White Houses Director of Strategic Initiatives , Peter Wehner , recommending that he find out what faith Tillman practiced and have the president go by that church and light a candle or say a prayer . 
Karl Rove exchanged e-mails about Pat Tillman with Associated Press reporter Ron Fournier , under the subject line H - E - R - O . 
In response to Mr. Fourniers e-mail , Mr. Rove asked ,  How does our country continue to produce men and women like this ,  to which Mr. Fournier replied ,  The Lord creates men and women like this all over the world .
But only the great and free countries allow them to flourish .
Keep up the fight .
White House staff exchanged more than 200 e-mails concerning Tillman 's death , according to the Oversight Committee report ( .pdf ) .
Fournier appears not to have written anything about Tillman in the months after his death , according to a database search .
Now the AP 's acting Washington bureau chief , Fournier said Monday : " I was an AP political reporter at the time of the 2004 e-mail exchange , and was interacting with a source , a top aide to the president , in the course of following an important and compelling story .
I regret the breezy nature of the correspondence . "
The committee 's draft report does not indicate who initiated the e-mail exchange between Rove and Fournier , and hence who would have written the " H - E - R - O " subject line .
A committee spokeswoman did not immediately respond to a request for more information .
The 51 - page examination reveals a White House more interested in crafting a good story around Tillman and Army Pvt. Jessica Lynch , whose capture and rescue in the early days of the Iraq war was dramatized in official White House and Pentagon pronouncements .
Our nation also has an inviolate obligation to share truthful information with a soldiers family and the American people should injury or death occur ....
That standard was not met in either Corporal Tillmans or Private Lynchs cases .
The revelation of Fournier 's casual e-mails with Rove comes the same day that Politico 's Michael Calderone has outlined changes Fournier is introducing as AP 's Washington bureau chief with a new model he calls " accountability journalism . "
He initially promoted the idea in an essay in the AP 's internal newsletter .
After briefly leaving daily journalism to pursue a Web startup and teach at Harvard , Fournier returned to the Associated Press earlier this year , where he is now its acting bureau chief .
His plan is for AP reporters to call out public officials when they break promises or fail to provide for the people who elected them .
Examples include a piece accusing Barack Obama of choosing " winning over his word , " and a Fournier dispatch about Hurricane Katrina that excoriated the Bush administration .
It began :  The Iraqi insurgency is in its last throes .
The economy is booming .
Anybody who leaks a CIA agent 's identity will be fired .
Add another piece of White House rhetoric that does n't match the public 's view of reality :
Help is on the way , Gulf Coast . 
Calderone says the new approach is causing some hesitancy in AP , which traditionally has specialized in a straight forward recounting of the facts .
 I think theres mixed feelings  theres reluctance ,  said an AP staffer .
 The AP has always been a just - the - facts type of organization ,  the staffer added , where even star political reporters typically play a more behind - the - scenes role than those at other papers .
And it was Johnson who hired the majority of reporters in Washington , meaning they re now following not just a new leader but a new agenda .
The pictures are the first to be released by police
Police have been excavating the chamber at the Haut de la Garenne former children 's home over the past week .
Around 160 people claim they were abused at the home and a child 's remains were found under a floor in a stairwell last Saturday .
Forensic experts are continuing to sift evidence and suspect there may be four bricked - up chambers .
' Significant finds '
Dozens of people have come forward in the last week claiming they were abused while at the centre .
The allegations date back to the 1970s and 1980s and some are from more than 40 years ago .
There have been accusations that people were kept in solitary confinement , raped and beaten .
Police believe there may be as many as four chambers
Detectives said their investigation of the first cellar had uncovered two " significant finds " - reportedly shackles and a bath .
Police have used a digger to take off layers of soil but investigations were scaled down on Sunday to give forensic teams a break .
Twelve detectives from forces across England and Wales have been called in to help with the investigation .
Deputy police chief Lenny Harper told reporters on Saturday that police had been able to substantiate " to some degree " reports that someone had been approached by a former care worker and intimidated .
" I can't emphasise too much that anyone approaching victims or witnesses in this case could well be found to be perverting the course of justice , " he warned .

You know that we are living in scary times .
Terrorist groups are metastasizing all over the globe .
Al Qaeda has re-established its bases in Pakistan and Afghanistan .
Hizbullah , Hamas and other radical Islamic groups are gaining strength .
You hear this stuff all the time , on television and on the campaign trail .
Amid the din , it 's hard to figure out the facts .
Well , finally we have a well - researched , independent analysis of the data relating to terrorism , released last week by Canada 's Simon Fraser University .
Its findings will surprise you .
It explains that there is a reason you 're scared .
The U.S. government agency charged with tracking terrorist attacks , the National Counterterrorism Center ( NCTC ) , reported a 41 percent increase from 2005 to 2006 and then equally high levels in 2007 .
Another major , government - funded database of terrorism , the Memorial Institute for the Prevention of Terror ( MIPT ) , says that the annual toll of fatalities from terrorism grew 450 percent (! ) between 1998 and 2006 .
A third report , the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism ( START ) , also government - funded , recorded a 75 percent jump in 2004 , the most recent year available for the data it uses .
The Simon Fraser study points out that all three of these data sets have a common problem .
They count civilian casualties from the war in Iraq as deaths caused by terrorism .
This makes no sense .
Iraq is a war zone , and as in other war zones around the world , many of those killed are civilians .
Study director Prof. Andrew Mack notes ,
" Over the past 30 years , civil wars in the Democratic Republic of Congo , Angola , Liberia , Sierra Leone , Uganda , Bosnia , Guatemala , and elsewhere have , like Iraq , been notorious for the number of civilians killed .
But although the slaughter in these cases was intentional , politically motivated , and perpetrated by non-state groups - and thus constituted terrorism as conceived by MIPT , NCTC , and START - it was almost never described as such . "
To take just two examples , Mack pointed out that in 2004 , the Janjaweed militia killed at least 723 civilians in Sudan ( as documented by independent studies ) .
The MIPT recorded zero deaths in Sudan from terrorism that year ; START counted only 17 .
In Congo in 1999 , independent studies identified hundreds killed by militia actions .
The MIPT notes zero deaths that year from terrorism ; and START , seven .
Including Iraq massively skews the analysis .
In the NCTC and MIPT data , Iraq accounts for 80 percent of all deaths counted .
But if you set aside the war there , terrorism has in fact gone way down over the past five years .
In both the START and MIPT data , non-Iraq deaths from terrorism have declined by more than 40 percent since 2001 .
( The NCTC says the number has stayed roughly the same , but that too is because of a peculiar method of counting . )
In the only other independent analysis of terrorism data , the U.S. - based IntelCenter published a study in mid-2007 that examined " significant " attacks launched by Al Qaeda over the past 10 years .
It came to the conclusion that the number of Islam - ist attacks had declined 65 percent from a high point in 2004 , and fatalities from such attacks had declined by 90 percent .
The Simon Fraser study notes that the decline in terrorism appears to be caused by many factors , among them successful counterterrorism operations in dozens of countries and infighting among terror groups .
But the most significant , in the study 's view , is the " extraordinary drop in support for Islamist terror organizations in the Muslim world over the past five years . "
These are largely self - inflicted wounds .
The more people are exposed to the jihadists ' tactics and world view , the less they support them .
An ABC / BBC poll in Afghanistan in 2007 showed support for the jihadist militants in the country to be 1 percent .
In Pakistan 's North - West Frontier province , where Al Qaeda has bases , support for Osama bin Laden plummeted from 70 percent in August 2007 to 4 percent in January 2008 .
That dramatic drop was probably a reaction to the assassination of Bena - zir Bhutto , but it points to a general trend in Pakistan over the past five years .
With every new terrorist attack , public support for jihad falls .
" This pattern is repeated in country after country in the Muslim world , " writes Mack .
" Its strategic implications are critically important because historical evidence suggests that terrorist campaigns that lose public support will sooner or later be abandoned or defeated . "
The University of Maryland 's Center for International Development and Conflict Management ( I wish academic centers would come up with shorter names ! ) has released another revealing study , documenting a 54 percent decline in the number of organizations using violence across the Middle East and North Africa between 1985 and 2004 .
The real rise , it points out , is in the number of groups employing nonviolent means of protest , which increased threefold during the same period .
Why have you not heard about studies like this or the one from Simon Fraser , which was done by highly regarded scholars , released at the United Nations and widely discussed in many countries around the world - from Canada to Australia ?
Because it does not fit into the narrative of fear that we have all accepted far too easily .

Model Ruslana Korshunova Dies After Nine Story Fall
Twenty year old supermodelKazakhstani of Russian descent , died after falling nine stories from her apartment building in Lower Manhattan yesterday .
Korshunova , who has graced the covers of Vogue and Elle magazine , was found on Water Street in the financial district .
Witnesses reported hearing a loud noise just prior to her body being discovered in the street .
Law enforcement officers are investigating her death as a possible suicide , though it was first believed that the model had been hit by a car .
Developing story ...
To read Scott Nelson ( Other Voices , June 13 ) , it is clear that he thinks every living species , including every now - extinct species , lived within walking distance of Noah 's house .
Then again , maybe part of him recognizes the absurdity of that story , which motivates him to slur evolution in order to lower it to the established invalidity of a literal creation folk tale .
But if we see a boulder at the bottom of a hill and various observable and measurable bumps and divots leading down to it instead of a single solid trench , we can still figure out how it got there .
Yet Mr. Nelson and his ilk strive to characterize the scientific method and atheism as a religion in a ploy to dissuade school districts and science teachers from teaching not only observed facts but also the beauty and majesty evident in those facts .
And he appeals to fear by positing some causal relationship between " atheistic evolution " ( which phrase does not even make sense ) and historical atrocities .
Well , I dare say no atrocity ever resulted from too much critical thinking .
And atheism is a religion like not collecting stamps is a hobby .
So , while the scientific method cannot be taken as some proxy for morality , our society 's educational system must not be held hostage by willful ignorance or kept from celebrating the scientific method in , of all places , science classes .
Science may make Mr. Nelson uncomfortable , but that does not justify his attempt to subvert it .

Six days early , and accompanied by the sound of clinking glasses and sighs of cautious relief from meteorologists , Japan 's annual cherry blossom season has arrived .
The petals were once a wartime fascist emblem symbolising the transience of the soul and the closeness of death .
But today , the blossoming of the sakura – as the Japanese call these ornamental trees – is one of the more life - affirming and beloved of this nation 's annual rituals .
The pink flowers herald the start of spring and a new cycle of growth .
For many , it is an opportunity to ponder the age - old bonds between humanity and nature , the fragility of existence and nearness of death .
Primarily , though , it 's a chance to party in celebration of the end of winter .
Millions of Japanese over the weekend will spread blue sheets under sakura trees , pull out beer , sake and food , and toast the spring under showers of petals .
Sakura parties are one of the highlights of the Japanese calendar , and a rare break from some of the longest working hours in the world – so getting it right is taken very seriously indeed .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Because the blossoming will last only for about a week , predicting the exact day of its arrival is a science .
Get it wrong and thousands of office parties and family outings go awry , weeks of planning are wrecked and millions of workers return to work disappointed on Monday morning .
Shares have been known to rise and fall on the basis of a good sakura forecast .
For half a century , the Meteorological Agency has plotted the sakura front across Japan .
Last year it got it disastrously wrong , forecasting the arrival 15 days early .
This year the agency 's supercomputer has competition from more old - fashioned methods : thousands of volunteers have snapped pictures of the sakura buds opening across the country and emailed them to a rival survey .
By next week , most of the blossoms will have gone and life will be back to normal .
CHAPTER FOUR - The Federal Advisory Council
In steamrolling the Federal Reserve Act through the House of Representatives , Congressman Carter Glass declared on September 30 , 1913 on the floor of the House that the interests of the public would be protected by an advisory council of bankers .
" There can be nothing sinister about its transactions .
Meeting with it at least four times a year will be a bankers ’ advisory council representing every regional reserve district in the system .
How could we have exercised greater caution in safeguarding the public interest ? "
Carter Glass neither then nor later gave any substantiation for his belief that a group of bankers would protect the interests of the public , nor is there any evidence in the history of the United States that any group of bankers has ever done so .
In fact , the Federal Advisory Council proved to be the " administrative process " which Paul Warburg had inserted into the Federal Reserve Act to provide just the type of remote but unseen control over the System which he desired .
When he was asked by financial reporter C.W. Barron , just after the Federal Reserve Act was enacted into law by Congress , whether he approved of the bill as it was finally passed , Warburg replied , " Well , it has n’t got quite everything we want , but the lack can be adjusted later by administrative processes . "
The council proved to be the ideal vehicle for Warburg ’s purposes , as it has functioned for seventy years in almost complete anonymity , its members and their business associations , unnoticed by the public .
Senator Robert Owen , chairman of the Senate Banking and Currency Committee , had said , as quoted in The New York Times , August 3 , 1913 before passage of the act : " The Federal Reserve Act will furnish the bank and industrial and commercial interests with the discount of qualified commercial paper and thus stabilize our commercial and industrial life .
The Federal Reserve banks are not intended as money making banks , but to serve a great national purpose of accommodating commerce and businessmen and banks , safeguard a fixed market for manufactured goods , for agricultural products and for labor .
There is no reason why the banks should be in control of the Federal Reserve system .
Stability will make our commerce expand healthfully in every direction . "
Senator Owen ’s optimism was doomed by the domination of the Jekyll Island promoters over the initial composition of the Federal Reserve System .
Not only did the Morgan - Kuhn , Loeb alliance purchase the dominant control of stock in the Federal Reserve Bank of New York , with almost half of the shares owned by the five New York banks under their control , First National Bank
National City Bank
National Bank of Commerce
Chase National Bank
Hanover National Bank , but they also persuaded President Woodrow Wilson to appoint one of the Jekyll Island group , Paul Warburg , to the Federal Reserve Board of Governors .
Each of the twelve Federal Reserve Banks was to elect a member of the Federal Advisory Council , which would meet with the Federal Reserve Board of Governors four times a year in Washington , in order to " advise " the Board on future monetary policy .
This seemed to assure absolute democracy , as each of the twelve " advisors " , representing a different region of the United States , would be expected to speak up for the economic interests of his area , and each of the twelve members would have an equal vote .
The theory may have been admirable in its concept , but the hard facts of economic life resulted in a quite different picture .
The president of a small bank in St. Louis or Cincinnati , sitting in conference with Paul Warburg and J.P. Morgan to " advise " them on monetary policy , would be unlikely to contradict two of the most powerful international financiers in the world , as a scribbled note from either one of them would be sufficient to plunge his little bank into bankruptcy .
In fact , the small banks of the twelve Federal Reserve districts existed only as satellites of the big New York financial interests , and were completely at their mercy .
Martin Mayer , in The Bankers , points out that , " J.P. Morgan maintained correspondent relationships with many small banks all over the country . "
30 30 Martin Mayer , The Bankers , Weybright and Talley , New York , 1974 , p. 207
The big New York banks did not confine themselves to multi-million dollar deals with other great financial interests , but carried on many smaller and more routine dealings with their " correspondent " banks across the United States .
Apparently secure in their belief that their activities would never be exposed to the public , the Morgan - Kuhn , Loeb interests boldly selected the members of the Federal Advisory Council from their correspondent banks and from banks in which they owned stock .
No one in the financial community seemed to notice , as nothing was said about it during seventy years of the Federal Reserve System ’s operation .
To avoid any suspicion that New York interests might control the Federal Advisory Council , its first president , elected in 1914 by the other members , was J.B. Morgan , president of the First National Bank of Chicago .
Rand McNally Bankers Directory for 1914 lists the principal correspondents of the large banks .
The principal correspondent bank of the Baker - Morgan controlled First National Bank of New York is listed as the First National Bank of Chicago .
The principal correspondent listed by the First National Bank of Chicago is the Bank of Manhattan in New York , controlled by Jacob Schiff and Paul Warburg of Kuhn , Loeb Company .
James P. Morgan also was listed as a director of Equitable Life Insurance Company , also controlled by Morgan .
However , the relationship between First National Bank of Chicago and these New York banks was even closer than these listings indicate .
On page 701 of The Growth of Chicago Banks by F. Cyril James , we find mention of " the First National Bank of Chicago ’s profitable connection with the Morgan interests .
A goodwill ambassador was hastily sent to New York to invite George F. Baker to become a director of the First National Bank of Chicago . "
31 ( J.B. Forgan to Ream , January 7 , 1903 . ) 31 F. Cyril James , The Growth of Chicago Banks , Harper , New York , 1938 In effect , Baker and Morgan had personally chosen the first president of the Federal Advisory Council .
James P. Morgan ( 1852 -1924 ) also shows the obligatory " London Connection " in the operation of the Federal Reserve System .
Born in St. Andrew’s , Scotland , he began his banking career there with the Royal Bank of Scotland , a correspondent of the Bank of England .
He came to Canada for the Bank of British North America , worked for the Bank of Nova Scotia , which sent him to Chicago in the 1880 ’s , and by 1900 he had become president of the First National Bank of Chicago .
He served for six years as president of the Federal Advisory Council , and when he left the council , he was replaced by Frank O. Wetmore , who had also replaced him as president of the First National Bank of Chicago when Morgan was named chairman of the board .
Representing the New York Federal Reserve district on the first Federal Advisory Council was J.P. Morgan .
He was named chairman of the Executive Committee .
Thus , Paul Warburg and J.P. Morgan sat in conference at the meetings of the Federal Reserve Board during the first four years of its operation , surrounded by the other Governors and members of the council , who could hardly have been unaware that their futures would be guided by these two powerful bankers .
Another member of the Federal Advisory Council in 1914 was Levi L. Rue , representing the Philadelphia district .
Rue was president of the Philadelphia National Bank .
Rand McNally Bankers Directory of 1914 listed as principal correspondent of the First National Bank of New York , the Philadelphia National Bank .
First National Bank of Chicago also listed Philadelphia National Bank as its principal correspondent in Philadelphia .
The other members of the Federal Advisory Council included Daniel S. Wing , president of the First National Bank of Boston , W.S. Rowe , president of the First National Bank of Cincinnati , and C.T. Jaffray , president of the First National Bank of Minneapolis .
These were all correspondent banks of the New York " big five " banks who controlled the money market in the United States .
Jaffray had an even closer connection with the Baker - Morgan interests .
In 1908 , to reinvest the large annual dividends from their First National Bank of New York stock , Baker and Morgan set up a holding company , First Security Corporation , which bought 500 shares of the First National Bank of Minneapolis .
Thus Jaffray was little more than a wage - earning employee of Baker and Morgan , although he had been " selected " by stockholders of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis to represent their interests .
First Security Corporation also owned : 50,000 shares of Chase National Bank
5400 shares of National Bank of Commerce
2500 shares of Bankers Trust
928 shares of Liberty National Bank , the bank of which Henry P. Davison had been president when he was tapped to join the J.P. Morgan firm
shares of New York Trust , Atlantic Trust and Brooklyn Trust First Security concentrated on bank stocks which rapidly appreciated in value , and paid handsome annual dividends .
In 1927 , it earned five million dollars , but paid the shareholders eight million , taking the rest from its surplus .
Another member of the initial Federal Advisory Council was E.F.
Swinney , president of the First National Bank of Kansas City .
He was also a director of Southern Railway , and lists himself in Who ’s Who as " independent in politics " .
Archibald Kains represented the San Francisco district on the Federal Advisory Council , although he maintained his office in New York , as president of the American Foreign Banking Corporation .
After serving as a Governor of the Federal Reserve Board from 1914 - 1918 , Paul Warburg did not request another term .
However , he was not ready to sever his connection with the Federal Reserve System which he had done so much to set up and put into operation .
J.P. Morgan obligingly gave up his seat on the Federal Advisory Council , and for the next ten years , Paul Warburg continued to represent the Federal Reserve district of New York on the Council .
He was vice president of the council 1922 - 25 , and president 1926 - 27 .
Thus Warburg remained the dominant presence at Federal Reserve Board meetings throughout the 1920s , when the European central banks were planning the great contraction of credit which precipitated the Crash of 1929 and the Great Depression .
Although most of the Federal Advisory Council ’s " advice " to the Board of Governors has never been reported , on rare instances a few glimpses into its deliberations were afforded by brief items in The New York Times .
On November 21 , 1916 , The Times reported that the Federal Advisory Council had met in Washington for its quarterly conference .
" There was talk about absorbing Europe ’s extension of credit to South America and other countries .
Federal Reserve officials said that to maintain a position as one of the world ’s bankers the United States must expect to be called upon to render a good deal of the service performed largely by England in the past , in extending short term credits necessary in the production and transportation of goods of all kinds in the world ’s trade , and that acceptances in foreign trade require lower discounts and the freest and most reliable gold markets . "
( The First World War was at its zenith in 1916 . )
In addition to his service on the Board of Governors and the Federal Advisory Council , Paul Warburg continued to address bankers ’ groups about the monetary policies they were expected to follow .
On October 22 , 1915 , he addressed the Twin City Bankers Club , St. Paul , Minnesota during which speech he stated , " It is to your interest to see the Federal Reserve banks as strong as they possibly can be .
It staggers the imagination to think what the future may have in store for the development of American banking .
With Europe ’s foremost powers limited to their own field , with the United States turned into a creditor nation for all the world , the boundaries of the field that lies open for us are determined only by our power of safe expansion .
The scope of our banking future will ultimately be limited by the amount of gold that we can muster as the foundation of our banking and credit structure . "
The composition of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors and the Federal Reserve Advisory Council , from its initial membership to the present day , shows links to the Jekyll Island conference and the London banking community which offers incontrovertible evidence , acceptable in any court of law , that there was a plan to gain control of the money and credit of the people of the United States , and to use it for the profit of the architects .
Old Jekyll Island hands were , Frank Vanderlip , president of the National City Bank , which bought a large portion of the shares of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York in 1914
Paul Warburg of Kuhn , Loeb Company
Henry P. Davison , J.P. Morgan ’s right - hand man , and director of the First National Bank of New York and the National Bank of Commerce , which took a large portion of Federal Reserve Bank of New York stock
Benjamin Strong , also known as a Morgan lieutenant , who served as Governor of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York during the 1920 ’s .
* * " The Federal Advisory Council has great influence with the Federal Reserve Board .
Conspicuously upon that council is J.P. Morgan , the leading member of J.P. Morgan Company and son of the late J.P. Morgan .
Every one of the twelve members of the Advisory Council , as you well know , was educated in the same atmosphere .
The Federal Reserve
Act is not only a special privilege act but privileged persons have been placed in control and are its advisors in its administration .
The Federal Reserve Board and the Federal Advisory Council administer the Federal Reserve System as its head authority , and no one of the lesser officials , even if they wished , would dare to cross swords with them . "
( FROM : " Why Is Your Country At War ? " by Charles Lindbergh , published in 1917 ) .
The above paragraph explains why Woodrow Wilson ordered government agents to seize and destroy the printing plates and copies of this book in the spring of 1918 .
The selection of the regional members of the Federal Advisory Council from the list of bankers who worked most closely with the " big five " banks of New York , and who were their principal correspondent banks , proves that the much - touted " regional safeguarding of the public interest " by Carter Glass and other Washington proponents of the Federal Reserve Act was from its very inception a deliberate deception .
The fact that for seventy years this council was able to meet with the Federal Reserve Board of Governors and to " advise " the Governors on decisions of monetary policy which affected the daily lives of every person in the United States , without the public being aware of their existence , demonstrates that the planners of the central bank operation knew exactly how to achieve their objectives through " administrative processes " of which the public would remain ignorant .
The claim that the " advice " of the council members is not binding on the Governors or that it carries no weight is to claim that four times a year , twelve of the most influential bankers in the United States take time from their work to travel to Washington to meet with the Federal Reserve Board merely to drink coffee and exchange pleasantries .
It is a claim which anyone familiar with the workings of the business community will find impossible to take seriously .
In 1914 , it was a four - day trip each way for bankers from the Far West to come to Washington for a council meeting with the Federal Reserve Board .
These men had extensive business interests which demanded their time .
J.P. Morgan was a director of sixty - three corporations which held annual meetings , and could hardly be expected to travel to Washington to attend meetings of the Federal Reserve Board if his advice was to be considered of no importance .**
** The J.P. Morgan connection has remained predominant on the Federal Advisory Council .
For the past several years , the prestigious Federal Reserve District No. 2 , the New York District , has been represented on the Federal Advisory Council by Lewis Preston .
Preston is Chairman of J.P. Morgan Company and also Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Morgan Guaranty Trust , New York .
An heir to the Baldwin fortune ( a company controlled by Morgan ) , Preston married the heiress to the Pulitzer newspaper fortune .
On February 26 , 1929 , The New York Times noted that a merger had been effected between National Bank of Commerce and Guaranty Trust , making them the largest bank in the United States , with a capital of two billion dollars .
The merger was negotiated by Myron C. Taylor , president of U.S. Steel , a Morgan firm .
The banks occupied adjoining buildings on Wall Street , and , as The New York Times noted , " The Guaranty Trust Company long has been known as one of ‘ the Morgan group ’ of banks . "
The National Bank of Commerce has also been identified with Morgan interests .

CHAPTER FIVE - The House of Rothschild
The success of the Federal Reserve Conspiracy will raise many questions in the minds of readers who are unfamiliar with the history of the United States and finance capital .
How could the Kuhn , Loeb - Morgan alliance , powerful though it might be , believe that it would be capable , first , of devising a plan which would bring the entire money and credit of the people of the United States into their hands , and second , of getting such a plan enacted into law ?
The capability of devising and enacting the " National Reserve Plan " , as the immediate result of the Jekyll Island expedition was called , was easily within the powers of the Kuhn , Loeb - Morgan alliance , according to the following from McClure ’s Magazine , August 1911 , " The Seven Men " by John Moody : " Seven men in Wall Street now control a great share of the fundamental industry and resources of the United States .
Three of the seven men , J.P. Morgan , James J. Hill , and George F. Baker , head of the First National Bank of New York belong to the so - called Morgan group ; four of them , John D. and William Rockefeller , James Stillman , head of the National City Bank , and Jacob H. Schiff of the private banking firm of Kuhn , Loeb Company , to the so - called Standard Oil City Bank group ... the central machine of capital extends its control over the United States ...
The process is not only economically logical ; it is now practically automatic .
" 32 32 John Moody , " The Seven Men " , McClure ’s Magazine , August , 1911 , p. 418
Thus we see that the 1910 plot to seize control of the money and credit of the people of the United States was planned by men who already controlled most of the country ’s resources .
It seemed to John Moody " practically automatic " that they should continue with their operations .
What John Moody did not know , or did not tell his readers , was that the most powerful men in the United States were themselves answerable to another power , a foreign power , and a power which had been steadfastly seeking to extend its control over the young republic of the United States since its very inception .
This power was the financial power of England , centered in the London Branch of the House of Rothschild .
The fact was that in 1910 , the United States was for all practical purposes being ruled from England , and so it is today .
The ten largest bank holding companies in the United States are firmly in the hands of certain banking houses , all of which have branches in London .
They are J.P. Morgan Company
Brown Brothers Harriman
Warburg , Kuhn Loeb
J. Henry Schroder
All of them maintain close relationships with the House of Rothschild , principally through the Rothschild control of international money markets through its manipulation of the price of gold .
Each day , the world price of gold is set in the London office of N.M. Rothschild and Company .
Although these firms are ostensibly American firms , which merely maintain branches in London , the fact is that these banking houses actually take their direction from London .
Their history is a fascinating one , and unknown to the American public , originating as it did in the international traffic in gold , slaves , diamonds , and other contraband .
There are no moral considerations in any business decision made by these firms .
They are interested solely in money and power .
Tourists today gape at the magnificent mansions of the very rich in Newport , Rhode Island , without realizing that not only do these " cottages " stand as a memorial to the baronial desires of our Victorian millionaires , but that their erection in Newport represented a nostalgic memorialization of the great American fortunes , which had their beginnings in Newport when it was the capital of the slave trade .
The slave trade for centuries had its headquarters in Venice , until Seventeenth Century Britain , the new master of the seas , used its control of the oceans to gain a monopoly .
As the American colonies were settled , its fiercely independent people , most of whom did not want slaves , found to their surprise that slaves were being sent to our ports in great numbers .
For many years , Newport was the capital of this unsavory trade .
William Ellery , the Collector of the Port of Newport , said in 1791 : " ... an Ethiopian cld as soon change his skin as a Newport merchant cld be induced to change so lucrative a trade .... for the slow profits of any manufactory . "
John Quincy Adams remarked in his Diary , page 459 , " Newport ’s former prosperity was chiefly owing to its extensive employment in the African slave trade . "
The pre-eminence of J.P. Morgan and the Brown firm in American finance can be dated to the development of Baltimore as the nineteenth century capital of the slave trade .
Both of these firms originated in Baltimore , opened branches in London , came under the aegis of the House of Rothschild , and returned to the United States to open branches in New York and to become the dominant power , not only in finance , but also in government .
In recent years , key posts such as Secretary of Defense have been held by Robert Lovett , partner of Brown Brothers Harriman , and Thomas S. Gates , partner of Drexel and Company , a J.P. Morgan subsidiary firm .
The present Vice President , George Bush , is the son of Prescott Bush , a partner of Brown Brothers Harriman , for many years the senator from Connecticut , and the financial organizer of Columbia Broadcasting System of which he also was a director for many years .
To understand why these firms operate as they do , it is necessary to give a brief history of their origins .
Few Americans know that J.P. Morgan Company began as George Peabody and Company .
George Peabody ( 1795 - 1869 ) ( image left ) , born at South Denvers , Massachusetts , began business in Georgetown , D.C. in 1814 as Peabody , Riggs and Company , dealing in wholesale dry goods , and in operating the Georgetown Slave Market .
In 1815 , to be closer to their source of supply , they moved to Baltimore , where they operated as Peabody and Riggs , from 1815 to 1835 .
Peabody found himself increasingly involved with business originating from London , and in 1835 , he established the firm of George Peabody and Company in London .
He had excellent entree in London business through another Baltimore firm established in Liverpool , the Brown Brothers .
Alexander Brown came to Baltimore in 1801 , and established what is now known as the oldest banking house in the United States , still operating as Brown Brothers Harriman of New York ; Brown , Shipley and Company of England ; and Alex Brown and Son of Baltimore .
The behind the scenes power wielded by this firm is indicated by the fact that Sir Montagu Norman , Governor of the Bank of England for many years , was a partner of Brown , Shipley and Company . *
Considered the single most influential banker in the world , Sir Montagu Norman was organizer of " informal talks " between heads of central banks in 1927 , which led directly to the Great Stockmarket Crash of 1929 .
* " There is an informal understanding that a director of Brown , Shipley should be on the Board of the Bank of England , and Norman was elected to it in 1907 . "
Montagu Norman , Current Biography , 1940 .
Soon after he arrived in London , George Peabody was surprised to be summoned to an audience with the gruff Baron Nathan Mayer Rothschild .
Without mincing words , Rothschild revealed to Peabody , that much of the London aristocracy openly disliked Rothschild and refused his invitations .
He proposed that Peabody , a man of modest means , be established as a lavish host whose entertainments would soon be the talk of London .
Rothschild would , of course , pay all the bills .
Peabody accepted the offer , and soon became known as the most popular host in London .
His annual Fourth of July dinner , celebrating American Independence , became extremely popular with the English aristocracy , many of whom , while drinking Peabody ’s wine , regaled each other with jokes about Rothschild ’s crudities and bad manners , without realizing that every drop they drank had been paid for by Rothschild .
It is hardly surprising that the most popular host in London would also become a very successful businessman , particularly with the House of Rothschild supporting him behind the scenes .
Peabody often operated with a capital of 500,000 pounds on hand , and became very astute in his buying and selling on both sides of the Atlantic .
His American agent was the Boston firm of Beebe , Morgan and Company , headed by Junius S. Morgan , father of John Pierpont Morgan .
Peabody , who never married , had no one to succeed him , and he was very favorably impressed by the tall , handsome Junius Morgan .
He persuaded Morgan to join him in London as a partner in George Peabody and Company in 1854 .
In 1860 , John Pierpont Morgan had been taken on as an apprentice by the firm of Duncan , Sherman in New York .
He was not very attentive to business , and in 1864 , Morgan ’s father was outraged when Duncan , Sherman refused to make his son a partner .
He promptly extended an arrangement whereby one of the chief employees of Duncan , Sherman , Charles H. Dabney , was persuaded to join John Pierpont Morgan in a new firm , Dabney , Morgan and Company .
Bankers Magazine , December , 1864 , noted that Peabody had withdrawn his account from Duncan , Sherman , and that other firms were expected to do so .
The Peabody account , of course , went to Dabney , Morgan Company .
John Pierpont Morgan was born in 1837 , during the first money panic in the United States .
Significantly , it had been caused by the House of Rothschild , with whom Morgan was later to become associated .
In 1836 , President Andrew Jackson ( image right ) , infuriated by the tactics of the bankers who were attempting to persuade him to renew the charter of the Second Bank of the United States , said , " You are a den of vipers .
I intend to rout you out and by the Eternal God I will rout you out .
If the people only understood the rank injustice of our money and banking system , there would be a revolution before morning . "
Although Nicholas Biddle was President of the Bank of the United States , it was well known that Baron James de Rothschild of Paris was the principal investor in this central bank .
Although Jackson had vetoed the renewal of the charter of the Bank of the United States , he probably was unaware that a few months earlier , in 1835 , the House of Rothschild had cemented a relationship with the United States Government by superseding the firm of Baring as financial agent of the Department of State on January 1 , 1835 .
Henry Clews , the famous banker , in his book , Twenty - eight Years in Wall Street 33 , states that the Panic of 1837 was engineered because the charter of the Second Bank of the United States had run out in 1836 .
Not only did President Jackson promptly withdraw government funds from the Second Bank of the United States , but he deposited these funds , $ 10 million , in state banks .
The immediate result , Clews tells us , is that the country began to enjoy great prosperity .
This sudden flow of cash caused an immediate expansion of the national economy , and the government paid off the entire national debt , leaving a surplus of $ 50 million in the Treasury .
33 Henry Clews , Twenty - eight Years in Wall Street , Irving Company , New York , 1888 , page 157
The European financiers had the answer to this situation .
Clews further states , " The Panic of 1837 was aggravated by the Bank of England when it in one day threw out all the paper connected with the United States . "
The Bank of England , of course , was synonymous with the name of Baron Nathan Mayer Rothschild .
Why did the Bank of England in one day " throw out " all paper connected with the United States , that is , refuse to accept or discount any securities , bonds or other financial paper based in the United States ?
The purpose of this action was to create an immediate financial panic in the United States , cause a complete contraction of credit , halt further issues of stocks and bonds , and ruin those seeking to turn United States securities into cash .
In this atmosphere of financial panic , John Pierpont Morgan came into the world .
His grandfather , Joseph Morgan , was a well to do farmer who owned 106 acres in Hartford , Connecticut .
He later opened the City Hotel , and the Exchange Coffee Shop , and in 1819 , was one of the founders of the Aetna Insurance Company .
George Peabody found that he had chosen well in selecting Junius S. Morgan as his successor .
Morgan agreed to continue the sub rosa relationship with N.M. Rothschild Company , and soon expanded the firm ’s activities by shipping large quantities of railroad iron to the United States .
It was Peabody iron which was the foundation for much of American railroad tracks from 1860 to 1890 .
In 1864 , content to retire and leave his firm in the hands of Morgan , Peabody allowed the name to be changed to Junius S. Morgan Company .
The Morgan firm then and since has always been directed from London .
John Pierpont Morgan spent much of his time at his magnificent London mansion , Prince ’s Gate .
One of the high water marks of the successful Rothschild - Peabody Morgan business venture was the Panic of 1857 .
It had been twenty years since the Panic of 1837 : its lessons had been forgotten by hordes of eager investors who were anxious to invest the profits of a developing America .
It was time to fleece them again .
The stock market operates like a wave washing up on the beach .
It sweeps with it many minuscule creatures who derive all of their life support from the oxygen and water of the wave .
They coast along at the crest of the " Tide of Prosperity " .
Suddenly the wave , having reached the high water mark on the beach , recedes , leaving all of the creatures gasping on the sand .
Another wave may come in time to save them , but in all likelihood it will not come as far , and some of the sea creatures are doomed .
In the same manner , waves of prosperity , fed by newly created money , through an artificial contraction of credit , recedes , leaving those it had borne high to gasp and die without hope of salvation .
Corsair , the Life of J.P. Morgan , 34 tells us that the Panic of 1857 was caused by the collapse of the grain market and by the sudden collapse of Ohio Life and Trust , for a loss of five million dollars .
With this collapse nine hundred other American companies failed .
Significantly , one not only survived , but prospered from the crash .
In Corsair , we learn that the Bank of England lent George Peabody and Company five million pounds during the panic of 1857 .
Winkler , in Morgan the Magnificent 35 says that the Bank of England advanced Peabody one million pounds , an enormous sum at that time , and the equivalent of one hundred million dollars today , to save the firm .
However , no other firm received such beneficence during this Panic .
The reason is revealed by Matthew Josephson , in The Robber Barons .
He says on page 60 : " For such qualities of conservatism and purity , George Peabody and Company , the old tree out of which the House of Morgan grew , was famous .
In the panic of 1857 , when depreciated securities had been thrown on the market by distressed investors in America , Peabody and the elder Morgan , being in possession of cash , had purchased such bonds as possessed real value freely , and then resold them at a large advance when sanity was restored . "

35 John K. Winkler , Morgan the Magnificent , Vanguard , N.Y. 1930
36 Matthew Josephson , The Robber Barons , Harcourt Brace , N.Y. 1934
Thus , from a number of biographies of Morgan , the story can be pieced together .
After the panic had been engineered , one firm came into the market with one million pounds in cash , purchased securities from distressed investors at panic prices , and later resold them at an enormous profit .
That firm was the Morgan firm , and behind it was the clever maneuvering of Baron Nathan Mayer Rothschild .
The association remained secret from the most knowledgeable financial minds in London and New York , although Morgan occasionally appeared as the financial agent in a Rothschild operation .
As the Morgan firm grew rapidly during the late nineteenth century , until it dominated the finances of the nation , many observers were puzzled that the Rothschilds seemed so little interested in profiting by investing in the rapidly advancing American economy .
John Moody notes , in The Masters of Capital , page 27 , " The Rothschilds were content to remain a close ally of Morgan ... as far as the American field was concerned . ’
37 37 John Moody , The Masters of Capital Secrecy was more profitable than valor .
The reason that the European Rothschilds preferred to operate anonymously in the United States behind the facade of J.P. Morgan and Company is explained by George Wheeler , in Pierpont Morgan and Friends , the Anatomy of a Myth , page 17 : " But there were steps being taken even now to bring him out of the financial backwaters -- and they were not being taken by Pierpont Morgan himself .
The first suggestion of his name for a role in the recharging of the reserve originated with the London branch of the House of Rothschild , Belmont ’s employers . "
38 Wheeler goes on to explain that a considerable anti-Rothschild movement had developed in Europe and the United States which focused on the banking activities of the Rothschild family .
Even though they had a registered agent in the United States , August Schoenberg , who had changed his name to Belmont when he came to the United States as the representative of the Rothschilds in 1837 , it was extremely advantageous to them to have an American representative who was not known as a Rothschild agent .
Although the London house of Junius S. Morgan and Company continued to be the dominant branch of the Morgan enterprises , with the death of the senior Morgan in 1890 in a carriage accident on the Riviera , John Pierpont Morgan became the head of the firm .
After operating as the American representative of the London firm from 1864 - 1871 as Dabney Morgan Company , Morgan took on a new partner in 1871 , Anthony Drexel of Philadelphia and operated as Drexel Morgan and Company until 1895 .
Drexel died in that year , and Morgan changed the name of the American branch to J.P. Morgan and Company .
LaRouche 39 tells us that on February 5 , 1891 , a secret association known as the Round Table Group was formed in London by Cecil Rhodes , his banker , Lord Rothschild , the Rothschild in - law , Lord Rosebery , and Lord Curzon .
He states that in the United States the Round Table was represented by the Morgan group .
Dr. Carrol Quigley refers to this group as " The British - American Secret Society " in Tragedy and Hope , stating that " The chief backbone of this organization grew up along the already existing financial cooperation running from the Morgan Bank in New York to a group of international financiers in London led by Lazard Brothers ( in 1901 ) . "

William Guy Carr , in Pawns In The Game states that , " In 1899 , J.P. Morgan and Drexel went to England to attend the International Bankers Convention .
When they returned , J.P. Morgan had been appointed head representative of the Rothschild interests in the United States .
As the result of the London Conference , J.P. Morgan and Company of New York
Drexel and Company of Philadelphia
Grenfell and Company of London
Morgan Harjes Cie of Paris
M.M. Warburg Company of Germany and America
the House of Rothschild , were all affiliated . "
41 Apparently unaware of the Peabody connection with the Rothschilds and the fact that the Morgans had always been affiliated with the House of Rothschild , Carr supposed that he had uncovered this relationship as of 1899 , when in fact it went back to 1835 .*

* July 30 , 1930 McFadden Basis of Control of Economic Conditions .
This control of the world business structure and of human happiness and progress by a small group is a matter of the most intense public interest .
In analyzing it , we must begin with the internal group which centers itself around J.P. Morgan Company .
Never before had there been such a powerful centralized control over finance , industrial production , credit and wages as is at this time vested in the Morgan group ...
The Morgan control of the Federal Reserve System is exercised through control of the management of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York .
After World War I , the Round Table became known as the Council on Foreign Relations in the United States , and the Royal Institute of International Affairs in London .
The leading government officials of both England and the United States were chosen from its members .
In the 1960s , as growing attention centered on the surreptitious governmental activities of the Council on Foreign Relations , subsidiary groups , known as the Trilateral Commission and the Bilderbergers , representing the identical financial interests , began operations , with the more important officials , such as Robert Roosa , being members of all three groups .
George F. Peabody History of the Great American Fortunes , Gustavus Myers , Mod. Lib. 537 , notes that J.P. Morgan ’s father , Junius S. Morgan , had become a partner of George Peabody in the banking business .
" When the Civil War came on , George Peabody and Company were appointed the financial representatives in England of the U.S. Government .... with this appointment their wealth suddenly began to pile up ; where hitherto they had amassed the riches by stages not remarkably rapid , they now added many millions within a very few years . "
According to writers of the day , the methods of George Peabody & Company were not only unreasonable but double treason , in that , while in the act of giving inside aid to the enemy , George Peabody & Company were the potentiaries of the U.S. Government and were being well paid to advance its interests .
" Springfield Republic " , 1866 : " For all who know anything on the subject know very well that Peabody and his partners gave us no faith and no help in our struggle for national existence .
They participated to the fullest in the common English distrust of our cause and our success , and talked and acted for the South rather than for our nation .
No individuals contributed so much to flooding our money markets and weakening financial confidence in our nationality than George Peabody & Company , and none made more money by the operation .
All the money that Mr. Peabody is giving away so lavishly among our institutions of learning was gained by the speculations of his house in our misfortunes . "
Also , New York Times , Oct. 31 , 1866 : Reconstruction Carpetbaggers Money Fund .
Lightning over the Treasury Building , John Elson , Meador Publishing Co. , Boston 41 , pg. 53 , " The Bank of England with its subsidiary banks in America ( under the domination of J.P. Morgan ) the Bank of France , and the Reichsbank of Germany , composed an interlocking and cooperative banking system , the main objective of which was the exploitation of the people . "
According to William Guy Carr , in Pawns In The Game , 42 the initial meeting of these ex officio planners took place in Mayer Amschel Bauer ’s Goldsmith Shop in Frankfurt in 1773 .
Bauer , who adopted the name of " Rothschild " or Red Shield , from the red shield which he hung over his door to advertise his business ( the red shield today is the official coat of arms of the City of Frankfurt ) , ( right image ) 42 William Guy Carr , Pawns In The Game , privately printed , 1956 " was only thirty years of age when he invited twelve other wealthy and influential men to meet him in Frankfurt .
His purpose was to convince them that if they agreed to pool their resources they could then finance and control the World Revolutionary Movement and use it as their Manual of Action to win ultimate control of the wealth , natural resources , and manpower of the entire world .
This agreement reached , Mayer unfolded his revolutionary plan .
The project would be backed by all the power that could be purchased with their pooled resources .
By clever manipulation of their combined wealth it would be possible to create such adverse economic conditions that the masses would be reduced to a state bordering on starvation by unemployment ...
Their paid propagandists would arouse feelings of hatred and revenge against the ruling classes by exposing all real and alleged cases of extravagance , licentious conduct , injustice , oppression , and persecution .
They would also invent infamies to bring into disrepute others who might , if left alone , interfere with their overall plans ...
Rothschild turned to a manuscript and proceeded to read a carefully prepared plan of action .
1 . He argued that LAW was FORCE only in disguise .
He reasoned it was logical to conclude ‘ By the laws of nature right lies in force . ’
2 . Political freedom is an idea , not a fact .
In order to usurp political power all that was necessary was to preach ‘ Liberalism ’ so that the electorate , for the sake of an idea , would yield some of their power and prerogatives which the plotters could then gather into their own hands .
3 . The speaker asserted that the Power of Gold had usurped the power of Liberal rulers ....
He pointed out that it was immaterial to the success of his plan whether the established governments were destroyed by external or internal foes because the victor had to of necessity ask the aid of ‘ Capital ’ which ‘ Is entirely in our hands ’ .
4 . He argued that the use of any and all means to reach their final goal was justified on the grounds that the ruler who governed by the moral code was not a skilled politician because he left himself vulnerable and in an unstable position .
5 . He asserted that ‘ Our right lies in force .
The word RIGHT is an abstract thought and proves nothing .
I find a new RIGHT ... to attack by the Right of the Strong , to reconstruct all existing institutions , and to become the sovereign Lord of all those who left to us the Rights to their powers by laying them down to us in their liberalism . '
6 . The power of our resources must remain invisible until the very moment when it has gained such strength that no cunning or force can undermine it .
He went on to outline twenty - five points .
Number 8 dealt with the use of alcoholic liquors , drugs , moral corruption , and all vice to systematically corrupt youth of all nations .
9 . They had the right to seize property by any means , and without hesitation , if by doing so they secured submission and sovereignty .
10 .
We were the first to put the slogans Liberty , Equality , and Fraternity into the mouths of the masses , which set up a new aristocracy .
The qualification for this aristocracy is WEALTH which is dependent on us .
11 . Wars should be directed so that the nations engaged on both sides should be further in our debt .
12 . Candidates for public office should be servile and obedient to our commands , so that they may readily be used .
13 . Propaganda -- their combined wealth would control all outlets of public information .
14 . Panics and financial depressions would ultimately result in World Government , a new order of one world government . "
The Rothschild family has played a crucial role in international finance for two centuries , as Frederick Morton , in The Rothschilds writes : " For the last one hundred and fifty years the history of the House of Rothschild has been to an amazing extent the backstage history of Western Europe .
" 38 ( Preface ) ...
Because of their success in making loans not to individuals , but to nations , they reaped huge profits , although as Morton writes , p. 36 , " Someone once said that the wealth of Rothschild consists of the bankruptcy of nations . "
43 E.C. Knuth writes , in The Empire of the City , " The fact that the House of Rothschild made its money in the great crashes of history and the great wars of history , the very periods when others lost their money , is beyond question .
" 44 The Great Soviet Encyclopaedia , states , " The clearest example of a personal linkup ( international directorates ) on a Western European scale is the Rothschild family .
The London and Paris branches of the Rothschilds are bound not just by family ties but also by personal link - ups in jointly controlled companies .
" 45 The encyclopaedia further described these companies as international monopolies .
The sire of the family , Mayer Amschel Rothschild , established a small business as a coin dealer in Frankfurt in 1743 .
Although previously known as Bauer * , he advertised his profession by putting up a sign depicting an eagle on a red shield , an adaptation of the coat of arms of the City of Frankfurt , to which he added five golden arrows extending from the talons , signifying his five sons .
Because of this sign , he took the name " Rothschild " or " Red Shield " .
When the Elector of Hesse earned a fortune by renting Hessian mercenaries to the British to put down the rebellion in the American colonies , Rothschild was entrusted with this money to invest .
He made an excellent profit both for himself and the Elector , and attracted other accounts .
In 1785 he moved to a larger house , 148 Judengasse , a five story house known as " The Green Shield " which he shared with the Schiff family .

Twenty - eight years in Wall Street .
The five sons established branches in the principal cities of Europe , the most successful being James in Paris and Nathan Mayer in London .
Ignatius Balla in The Romance of the Rothschilds 46 tells us how the London Rothschild established his fortune .
He went to Waterloo , where the fate of Europe hung in the balance , saw that Napoleon was losing the battle , and rushed back to Brussels .
At Ostend , he tried to hire a boat to England , but because of a raging storm , no one was willing to go out .
Rothschild offered 500 francs , then 700 , and finally 1,000 francs for a boat .
One sailor said , " I will take you for 2000 francs ; then at least my widow will have something if we are drowned . "
Despite the storm , they crossed the Channel .
The next morning , Rothschild was at his usual post in the London Exchange .
Everyone noticed how pale and exhausted he looked .
Suddenly , he started selling , dumping large quantities of securities .
Panic immediately swept the Exchange .
Rothschild is selling ; he knows we have lost the Battle of Waterloo .
Rothschild and all of his known agents continued to throw securities onto the market .
Balla says , " Nothing could arrest the disaster .
At the same time he was quietly buying up all securities by means of secret agents whom no one knew .
In a single day , he had gained nearly a million sterling , giving rise to the saying , ‘ The Allies won the Battle of Waterloo , but it was really Rothschild who won . ’ " * In The Profits of War , Richard Lewinsohn says , " Rothschild ’s war profits from the Napoleonic Wars financed their later stock speculations .
Under Metternich , Austria after long hesitation , finally agreed to accept financial direction from the House of Rothschild . "
47 46 Ignatius Balla , The Romance of the Rothschilds , Everleigh Nash , London , 1913
* The New York Times , April 1 , 1915 reported that in 1914 , Baron Nathan Mayer de Rothschild went to court to suppress Ignatius Balla ’s book on the grounds that the Waterloo story about his grandfather was untrue and libelous .
The court ruled that the story was true , dismissed Rothschild ’s suit , and ordered him to pay all costs .
The New York Times noted in this story that " The total Rothschild wealth has been estimated at $ 2 billion . "
A previous story in The New York Times ( May 27 , 1905 ) noted that Baron Alphonse de Rothschild , head of the French house of Rothschild , possessed $ 60 million in American securities in his fortune , although the Rothschilds reputedly were not active in the American field .
This explains why their agent , J.P. Morgan , had only $ 19 million in securities in his estate when he died in 1913 , and securities handled by Morgan were actually owned by his employer , Rothschild . "
47 Richard Lewinsohn , The Profits of War , E.P. Dutton , 1937
After the success of his Waterloo exploit , Nathan Mayer Rothschild gained control of the Bank of England through his near monopoly of " Consols " and other shares .
Several " central " banks , or banks which had the power to issue currency , had been started in Europe : The Bank of Sweden , in 1656 , which began to issue notes in 1661 , the earliest being the Bank of Amsterdam , which financed Oliver Cromwell ’s seizure of power in England in 1649 , ostensibly because of religious differences .
Cromwell died in 1657 and the throne of England was re-established when Charles II was crowned in 1660 .
He died in 1685 .
In 1689 , the same group of bankers regained power in England by putting King William of Orange on the throne .
He soon repaid his backers by ordering the British Treasury to borrow 1,250,000 pounds from these bankers .
He also issued them a Royal Charter for the Bank of England , which permitted them to consolidate the National debt ( which had just been created by this loan ) and to secure payments of interest and principal by direct taxation of the people .
The Charter forbade private goldsmiths to store gold and to issue receipts , which gave the stockholders of the Bank of England a money monopoly .
The goldsmiths also were required to store their gold in the Bank of England vaults .
Not only had their privilege of issuing circulating medium been taken away by government decree , but their fortunes were now turned over to those who had supplanted them . *
In his " Cantos " , 46 ; 27 , Ezra Pound refers to the unique privileges which William Paterson advertised in his prospectus for the Charter of the Bank of England : " Said Paterson
Hath benefit of interest on all the moneys which it , the bank , creates out of nothing . "
The " nothing " which is referred to , of course , is the bookkeeping operation of the bank , which " creates " money by entering a notation that it has " lent " you one thousand dollars , money which did not exist until the bank made the entry .
By 1698 , the British Treasury owed 16 million pounds sterling to the Bank of England .
By 1815 , principally due to the compounding of interest , the debt had risen to 885 million pounds sterling .
Some of this increase was due to the wars which had flourished during that period , including the Napoleonic Wars and the wars which England had fought to retain its American Colony .
* NOTE : In the United States , after the stockholders of the Federal Reserve System had consolidated their power in 1934 , our government also issued orders that private citizens could not store or hold gold .
William Paterson ( 1658 - 1719 ) himself benefited little from " the moneys which the bank creates out of nothing " , as he withdrew , after a policy disagreement , from the Bank of England a year after it was founded .
A later William Paterson became one of the framers of the United States Constitution , while the name lingers on , like the pernicious central bank itself .
Paterson had found himself unable to work with the Bank of England ’s stockholders .
Many of them remained anonymous , but an early description of the Bank of England stated it was , " A society of about 1330 persons , including the King and Queen of England , who had 10,000 pounds of stock , the Duke of Leeds , Duke of Devonshire , Earl of Pembroke , and the Earl of Bradford . "
Because of his success in his speculations , Baron Nathan Mayer de Rothschild , as he now called himself , reigned as the supreme financial power in London .
He arrogantly exclaimed , during a party in his mansion , " I care not what puppet is placed upon the throne of England to rule the Empire on which the sun never sets .
The man that controls Britain ’s money supply controls the British Empire , and I control the British money supply . "
His brother James in Paris had also achieved dominance in French finance .
In Baron Edmond de Rothschild , David Druck writes , " ( James ) Rothschild ’s wealth had reached the 600 million mark .
Only one man in France possessed more .
That was the King , whose wealth was 800 million .
The aggregate wealth of all the bankers in France was 150 million less than that of James Rothschild .
This naturally gave him untold powers , even to the extent of unseating governments whenever he chose to do so .
It is well known , for example , that he overthrew the Cabinet of Prime Minister Thiers .
"
48 The expansion of Germany under Bismarck was accompanied by his dependence on Samuel Bleichroder , Court Bankers of the Prussian Emperor , who had been known as an agent of the Rothschilds since 1828 .
The later Chancellor of Germany , Dr. von Bethmann Hollweg , was the son of Moritz Bethmann of Frankfurt , who had intermarried with the Rothschilds .
Emperor Wilhelm
I also relied heavily on Bischoffsheim , Goldschmidt , and Sir Ernest Cassel of Frankfurt , who emigrated to England and became personal banker to the Prince of Wales , later Edward VII .
Cassel ’s daughter married Lord Mountbatten , giving the family a direct relationship to the present British Crown .
Josephson 49 states that Philip Mountbatten was related through the Cassels to the Meyer Rothschilds of Frankfurt .
Thus , the English royal House of Windsor has a direct family relationship to the Rothschilds .
In 1901 , when Queen Victoria ’s son , Edward , became King Edward VII , he re-established the Rothschild ties .

Paul Emden in Behind The Throne says , " Edward ’s preparation for his métier was quite different from that of his mother , hence he ‘ ruled ’ less than she did .
Gratefully , he retained around him men who had been with him in the age of the building of the Baghdad Railway ... there were added to the advisory staff Leopold and Alfred de Rothschild , various members of the Sassoon family , and above all his private financial advisor Sir Ernest Cassel . "
50 The enormous fortune which Cassel made in a relatively short time gave him an immense power which he never misused .
He amalgamated the firm of Vickers Sons with the Naval Construction Company and the Maxim - Nordenfeldt Guns and Ammunition Company , a fusion from which there arose the worldwide firm of Vickers Sons and Maxim .
On an entirely different capacity from Cassel were businessmen like the Rothschilds .
The firm was run on democratic principles , and the various partners all had to be members of the family .
With great hospitality and in a princely manner they led the lives of grand seigneurs , and it was natural that Edward VII should find them congenial .
Thanks to their international family relationships and still more extended business connections , they knew the whole world , were well informed about everybody , and had reliable knowledge of matters which did not appear on the surface .
This combination of finance and politics had been a trademark of the Rothschilds from the very beginning .
The House of Rothschild always knew more than could be found in the papers and even more than could be read in the reports which arrived at the Foreign Office .
In other countries also the relations of the Rothschilds extended behind the throne .
Not until numerous diplomatic publications appeared in the years after the war did a wider public learn how strongly Alfred de Rothschild ’s hand affected the politics of Central Europe during the twenty years before the war ( World War I ) . "
With the control of the money came the control of the news media .
Kent Cooper , head of the Associated Press , writes in his autobiography , Barriers Down , " International bankers under the House of Rothschild acquired an interest in the three leading European agencies . "
51 Thus the Rothschilds bought control of Reuters International News Agency , based in London , Havas of France , and Wolf in Germany , which controlled the dissemination of all news in Europe .
50 Paul Emden , Behind The Throne , Hoddard Stoughton , London , 1934
51 Kent Cooper , Barriers Down , pg. 21
In Inside Europe 52 , John Gunther wrote in 1936 that any French prime minister , at the end of 1935 , was a creature of the financial oligarchy , and that this financial oligarchy was dominated by twelve regents , of whom six were bankers , and were headed by Baron Edmond de Rothschild .
The iron grip of the " London Connection " on the media was exposed in a recent book by Ben J. Bagdikian The Media Monopoly , described as " A startling report on the 50 corporations that control what America sees , hears , reads " .
53 Bagdikian , who edited the nation ’s most influential magazine the Saturday Evening Post until the monopoly suddenly closed it down , reveals the interlocking directorates among the fifty corporations which control the news , but fails to trace them back to the five London banking houses which control them .
He mentions that CBS interlocks with the Washington Post , Allied Chemical , Wells Fargo Bank , and others , but does not tell the reader that Brown Brothers Harriman controls CBS , or that the Eugene Meyer family ( Lazard Freres ) controls Allied Chemical and the Washington Post , and Kuhn Loeb Co. the Wells Fargo Bank .
He shows the New York Times interlocked with Morgan Guaranty Trust , American Express , First Boston Corporation and others , but does not show how the banking interlocks .
He does not mention the Federal Reserve System in his entire book , which is conspicuous by its absence .
Bagdikian documents that the media monopoly is steadily closing down more newspapers and magazines .
Washington D.C. , with one paper , The Post , is unique among world capitols .
London has eleven daily newspapers , Paris fourteen , Rome eighteen , Tokyo seventeen , and Moscow nine .
He cites a study from the 1982 World Press Encyclopaedia that the United States is at the bottom of industrial nations in the number of daily newspapers sold per 1,000 population .
Sweden leads the list with 572 , the United States is at the bottom with 287 .
There is universal distrust of the media by Americans , because of their notorious monopoly and bias .
The media unanimously urge higher taxes on working people , more government spending , a welfare state with totalitarian powers , close relations with Russia , and a rabid denunciation of anyone who opposes Communism .
This is the program of " the London Connection . "
It flaunts a maniacal racism , and has as its motto the dictum of its high priestess , Susan Sontag , that " The white race is the cancer of history . "
Everyone should be against cancer .
The media monopoly deals with its opponents in one of two ways ; either frontal assault of libel which the average person cannot afford to litigate , or an iron curtain of silence , the standard treatment for any work which exposes its clandestine activities .

Although the Rothschild plan does not match any single political or economic movement since it was enunciated in 1773 , vital parts of it can be discerned in all political revolution since that date .
LaRouche 54 points out that the Round Tables sponsored Fabian Socialism in England , while backing the Nazi regime through a Round Table member in Germany , Dr. Hjalmar Schacht , and that they used the Nazi Government throughout World War II through Round Table member Admiral Canaris , while Allen Dulles ran a collaborating intelligence operation in Switzerland for the Allies .

CHAPTER SIX - The London Connection
" So you see , my dear Coningsby , that the world is governed by very different personages from what is imagined by those who are not behind the scenes . "
55 -- Disraeli , Prime Minister of England during Queen Victoria ’s reign .
In 1775 , the colonists of America declared their independence from Great Britain , and subsequently won their freedom by the American Revolution .
Although they achieved political freedom , financial independence proved to be a more difficult matter .
In 1791 , Alexander Hamilton , at the behest of European bankers , formed the first Bank of the United States , a central bank with much the same powers as the Bank of England .
The foreign influences behind this bank , more than a century later , were able to get the Federal Reserve Act through Congress , giving them at last the central bank of issue for our economy .
Although the Federal Reserve Bank was neither Federal , being owned by private stockholders , nor a Reserve , because it was intended to create money , instead of to hold it in reserve , it did achieve enormous financial power , so much so that it has gradually superseded the popular elected government of the United States .
Through the Federal Reserve System , American independence was stealthily but invincibly absorbed back into the British sphere of influence .
Thus the London Connection became the arbiter of policy of the United States .
Because of England ’s loss of her colonial empire after the Second World War , it seemed that her influence as a world political power was waning .
Essentially , this was true .
The England of 1980 is not the England of 1880 .
She no longer rules the waves ; she is a second rate , perhaps third rate , military power , but paradoxically , as her political and military power waned , her financial power grew .
In Capital City we find , " On almost any measure you care to take , London is the world ’s leading financial centre . . .
In the 1960s London dominance increased . . . "
56 55 Coningsby , by Disraeli , Longmans Co. , London , 1881 , p. 252
56 McRae and Cairncross , Capital City , Eyre Methuen , London , 1963 , p. 1
A partial explanation of this fact is given : " Daniel Davison , head of London ’s Morgan Grenfell , said , ‘ The American banks have brought the necessary money , customers , capital and skills which have established London in its present preeminence ... only the American banks have a lender of last resort .
The Federal Reserve Board of the United States can , and does , create dollars when necessary .
Without the Americans , the big dollar deals cannot be put together .
Without them , London would not be credible as an international financial centre . ’"
57 Thus London is the world ’s financial center , because it can command enormous sums of capital , created at its command by the Federal Reserve Board of the United States .
But how is this possible ?
We have already established that the monetary policies of the United States , the interest rates , the volume and value of money , and sales of bonds , are decided , not by the figurehead of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors , but by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York .
The pretended decentralization of the Federal Reserve System and its twelve , equally autonomous " regional " banks , is and has been a deception since the Federal Reserve Act became law in 1913 .
That United States monetary policy stems solely from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York is yet another fallacy .
That the Federal Reserve Bank of New York is itself autonomous , and free to set monetary policy for the entire United States without any outside interference is especially untrue .
We might believe in this autonomy if we did not know that the majority stock of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York was purchased by three New York City banks : First National Bank
National City Bank
National Bank of Commerce
An examination of the principal stockholders in these banks , in 1914 , and today , reveals a direct London Connection .
In 1812 , the National City Bank began business as the City Bank , in the same room in which the defunct Bank of the United States , whose charter had expired , had been doing business .
It represented many of the same stockholders , who were now functioning under a legitimate American charter .
During the early 1800s , the most famous name associated with City Bank was Moses Taylor ( 1806 - 1882 ) .
Taylor ’s father had been a confidential agent employed in buying property for the Astor interests while concealing the fact that Astor was the purchaser .
Through this tactic , Astor succeeded in buying many farms , and also a great deal of potentially valuable real estate in Manhattan .
Although Astor ’s capital was reputed to come from his fur trading , a number of sources indicate that he also represented foreign interests .
LaRouche 58 states that Astor , in exchange for providing intelligence to the British during the years before and after the Revolutionary War , and for inciting Indians to attack and kill American settlers along the frontier , received a handsome reward .
He was not paid cash , but was given a percentage of the British opium trade with China .
It was the income from this lucrative concession which provided the basis for the Astor fortune .
57 Ibid , p. 225
58 Lyndon H. LaRouche , Dope , Inc. , New Benjamin Franklin House Publishing Co. , N.Y. 1978
With his father ’s connection with the Astors , young Moses Taylor had no difficulty in finding a place as apprentice in a banking house at the age of 15 .
Like so many others in these pages , he found his greatest opportunities when many other Americans were going bankrupt during an abrupt contraction of credit .
During the Panic of 1837 , when more than half the business firms in New York failed , he doubled his fortune .
In 1855 , he became president of City Bank .
During the Panic of 1857 , the City Bank profited by the failure of many of its competitors .
Like George Peabody and Junius Morgan , Taylor seemed to have an ample supply of cash for buying up distressed stocks .
He purchased nearly all the stock of Delaware Lackawanna Railroad for $ 5 a share .
Seven years later , it was selling for $ 240 a share .
Moses Taylor was now worth fifty million dollars .
In August , 1861 , Taylor was named Chairman of the Loan Committee to finance the Union Government in the Civil War .
The Committee shocked Lincoln by offering the government $ 5,000,000 at 12 % to finance the war .
Lincoln refused and financed the war by issuing the famous " Greenbacks " through the U.S.
Treasury , which were backed by gold .
Taylor continued to increase his fortune throughout the war , and in his later years , the youthful James Stillman became his protégé .
In 1882 , when Moses Taylor died , he left seventy million dollars .
*
His son - in - law , Percy Pyne , succeeded him as president of City Bank , which had now become National City Bank .
Pyne was paralyzed , and was barely able to function at the bank .
For nine years , the bank stagnated , nearly all its capital being the estate of Moses Taylor .
William Rockefeller , brother of John D. Rockefeller , had bought into the bank , and was anxious to see it progress .
He persuaded Pyne to step aside in 1891 in favor of James Stillman , and soon the National City Bank became the principal repository of the Rockefeller oil income .
William Rockefeller ’s son , William , married Elsie , James Stillman ’s daughter , Isabel .
Like so many others in New York banking , James Stillman also had a British connection .
His father , Don Carlos Stillman , had come to Brownsville , Texas , as a British agent and blockade runner during the Civil War .
Through his banking connections in New York , Don Carlos had been able to find a place for his son as apprentice in a banking house .
In 1914 , when National City Bank purchased almost ten per cent of the shares of the newly organized Federal Reserve Bank of New York , two of Moses Taylor ’s grandsons , Moses Taylor Pyne and Percy Pyne , owned 15,000 shares of National City stock .
Moses Taylor ’s son , H.A.C. Taylor , owned 7699 shares of National City Bank .
The bank ’s attorney , John W. Sterling , of the firm of Shearman and Sterling , also owned 6000 shares of National City Bank .
However , James Stillman owned 47,498 shares , or almost twenty percent of the bank ’s total shares of 250,000 .
[ See Chart I ]
* The New York Times noted on May 24 , 1882 that Moses Taylor was chairman of the Loan Committee of the Associated Banks of New York City in 1861 .
Two hundred million dollars worth of securities were entrusted to him .
It is probably due to him more than any other one man that the government in 1861 found itself with the means to prosecute the war .
The second largest purchaser of Federal Reserve Bank of New York shares in 1914 , First National Bank , was generally known as " the Morgan Bank " , because of the Morgan representation on the board , although the bank ’s founder George F. Baker held 20,000 shares , and his son G.F. Baker , Jr. , had 5,000 shares for twenty - five percent of the bank ’s total stock of 100,000 shares .
George F. Baker Sr. ’s daughter married George F. St. George of London .
The St. Georges later settled in the United States , where their daughter , Katherine St. George , became a prominent Congresswoman for a number of years .
Dr. E.M. Josephson wrote of her , " Mrs. St. George , a first cousin of FDR and New Dealer , said , ‘ Democracy is a failure ’ . "
59 George Baker , Jr. ’s daughter , Edith Brevoort Baker , married Jacob Schiff ’s grandson , John M. Schiff , in 1934 .
John M. Schiff is now honorary chairman of Lehman Brothers Kuhn Loeb Company .
59 E.M. Josephson , The Strange Death of Franklin D. Roosevelt , Chedney Press , N.Y. 1948
The third large purchase of Federal Reserve Bank of New York stock in 1914 was the National Bank of Commerce which issued 250,000 shares .
J.P. Morgan , through his controlling interest in Equitable Life , which held 24,700 shares and Mutual Life , which held 17,294 shares of National Bank of Commerce , also held another 10,000 shares of National Bank of Commerce through J.P. Morgan and Company ( 7800 shares ) , J.P. Morgan , Jr. ( 1100 shares ) , and Morgan partner H.P. Davison ( 1100 shares ) .
Paul Warburg , a Governor of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors , also held 3000 shares of National Bank of Commerce .
His partner , Jacob Schiff had 1,000 shares of National Bank of Commerce .
This bank was clearly controlled by Morgan , who was really a subsidiary of Junius S. Morgan Company in London and the N.M. Rothschild Company of London , and Kuhn , Loeb Company , which was also known as a principal agent of the Rothschilds .
The financier Thomas Fortune Ryan also held 5100 shares of National Bank of Commerce stock in 1914 .
His son , John Barry Ryan , married Otto Kahn ’s daughter , Kahn was a partner of Warburg and Schiff in Kuhn , Loeb Company , Ryan ’s granddaughter , Virginia Fortune Ryan , married Lord Airlie , the present head of J. Henry Schroder Banking Corporation in London and New York .
Another director of National Bank of Commerce in 1914 , A.D. Juillard , was president of A.D. Juillard Company , a trustee of New York Life , and Guaranty Trust , all of which were controlled by J.P. Morgan .
Juillard also had a British connection , being a director of the North British and Mercantile Insurance Company .
Juillard owned 2000 shares of National Bank of Commerce stock , and was also a director of Chemical Bank .
In The Robber Barons , by Matthew Josephson , Josephson tells us that Morgan dominated New York Life , Equitable Life and Mutual Life by 1900 , which had one billion dollars in assets , and which had fifty million dollars a year to invest .
He says , " In this campaign of secret alliances he ( Morgan ) acquired direct control of the National Bank of Commerce ; then a part ownership in the First National Bank , allying himself to the very strong and conservative financier , George F. Baker , who headed it ; then by means of stock ownership and interlocking directorates he linked to the first named banks other leading banks , the Hanover , the Liberty , and Chase . "
60 60 Matthew Josephson , The Robber Barons , p. 409 Mary W. Harriman , widow of E.H. Harriman , also owned 5,000 shares of National Bank of Commerce in 1914 .
E.H. Harriman ’s railroad empire had been entirely financed by Jacob Schiff of Kuhn , Loeb Company .
Levi P. Morton also owned 1500 shares of National Bank of Commerce stock in 1914 .
He had been the twenty - second vice - president of the United States , was an ex-Minister from the U.S. to France , and president of L.P. Morton Company , New York , Morton - Rose and Company and Morton Chaplin of London .
He was a director of Equitable Life Insurance Company , Home Insurance Company , Guaranty Trust , and Newport Trust .
The astounding idea that the Federal Reserve System of the United States is actually operated from London will probably be rejected at first hearing by most Americans .
However , Minsky has become famous for his theory of the " dominant frame " .
He states that in any particular situation , there is a " dominant frame " to which everything in that situation is related and through which it can be interpreted .
The " dominant frame " in the monetary policy decisions of the Federal Reserve System is that these decisions are made by those who stand to benefit most from them .
At first glance , this would seem to be the principal stockholders of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York .
However , we have seen that these stockholders all have a " London Connection " .
The " London Connection " becomes more obvious as the dominant power when we find in The Capital City 61 that only seventeen firms are allowed to operate as merchant bankers in the City of London , England ’s financial district .
All of them must be approved by the Bank of England .
In fact , most of the Governors of the Bank of England come from the partners of these seventeen firms .
Clarke ranks the seventeen in order of their capitalization .
Number 2 is the Schroder Bank .
Number 6 is Morgan Grenfell , the London branch of the House of Morgan and actually its dominant branch .
Lazard Brothers is Number 8 .
N.M. Rothschild is Number 9 .
Brown Shipley Company , the London branch of Brown Brothers Harriman , is Number 14 .
These five merchant banking firms of London actually control the New York banks which own the controlling interest in the Federal Reserve Bank of New York .
61 McRae and Cairncross , Capital City , Eyre Methuen , London , 1963
The control over Federal Reserve System decisions is also founded in another unique situation .
Each day , representatives of four other London banking firms meet in the offices of N.M. Rothschild Company in London to fix the price of gold for that day .
The other four bankers are from Samuel Montagu Company , which ranks Number 5 on the list of seventeen London merchant banking firms

Mocatta and Goldsmid Despite the huge tide of paper pyramided currency and notes which are now flooding the world , at some point , every credit extension must return to be based , in however minuscule a fashion , on some deposit of gold in some bank somewhere in the world .
Because of this factor , the London merchant bankers , with their power to set the price of gold each day , become the final arbiters of the volume of money and the price of money in those countries which must bow to their power .
Not the least of these is the United States .
No official of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York , or of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors , can command the power over the money of the world which is held by these London merchant bankers .
Great Britain , while waning in political and military power , today exercises the greatest financial power .
It is for this reason that London is the present financial center of the world .

Fed up with TV ads so loud that they send viewers scrambling to hit mute on their remotes , a Bay Area lawmaker is pushing a new bill that would force federal regulators to ratchet down the volume of commercials .
The proposal was introduced this week by Rep. Anna Eshoo , D - Palo Alto , and it is n't winning her any friends in the broadcasting or advertising industries .
But Eshoo's
House colleagues are warming to the idea , which could address a daily annoyance for millions of TV viewers .
" I 've had it with these loud advertisements , " said Eshoo , who said she was motivated after being jolted by one too many ear - splitting ads .
" If I 'm not close to my remote control to push the mute button , it practically blasts you out of the house .
It 's that annoying .
And it 's totally unnecessary . "
Eshoo is not alone in pressing the issue .
British regulators approved similar rules last month that require broadcasters to limit the " maximum subjective loudness " of TV ads after receiving complaints .
In a time of war , soaring gas prices and a slumping economy , curbing the volume of 30 - second spots might not seem like a top priority for Congress , but Eshoo insists that , unlike those issues , this problem would be simple to fix .
Her two - page bill would direct the Federal Communications Commission to write new rules within a year setting limits on the volume of ads .
Commercials could not have an " average maximum loudness " that exceeds the programming that they accompany .
The measure would apply to all spots on broadcast , cable or satellite television .
But major advertisers suggest the bill might be a solution in search of a problem .
" We get lots of complaints about various things , but I have n't really heard any complaints about this issue , " said Dan Jaffe , executive vice president in the Washington , D.C. , office of the Association of National Advertisers , a trade group that includes advertising heavyweights like Anheuser - Busch , Coca - Cola and Procter & Gamble .
Adonis Hoffman , a senior vice president for the American Association of Advertising Agencies , an industry trade group , said he believes the FCC might already have the authority to set new volume rules .
" If so , " he said , " that might obviate the need for any new legislation . "
No co-sponsors yet
Eshoo introduced the Commercial Advertisement Loudness Mitigation Act - CALM
Act for short - without much fanfare late Wednesday .
She has no co-sponsors , although she said several colleagues are interested .
The bill would go through the House Energy and Commerce Committee , of which she is a member .
An aide to the committee 's chairman , Rep. John Dingell , D - Mich . , said the bill is so new his staff is still reviewing it .
But several House members said Thursday they liked the idea .
" I 'd support it , " said Rick Boucher , D - Va. , also a member of the commerce committee .
Republican Rep. Darrell Issa of Vista ( San Diego County ) , who as the founder of a car - alarm company knows something about loud noises , called the bill a good idea .
" If your iPod can normalize the sound so you 're not turning the volume up and down , it seems like the FCC should be able to come up with common - sense rules " for TV ads , he said .
The digital difference
Rep. Bill Pascrell , D - N.J. , said he thinks that with the country shifting to digital , high - definition TV , now is a good time for broadcasters and advertisers to set their own standards for volume levels that wo n't offend viewers .
" This bill might force them to do it , " he said .
In Britain , the Broadcast Committee of Advertising Practice , which sets guidelines for the industry , decided to act to limit ads that are " excessively noisy or strident . "
The new rules go into effect July 7 .
The British panel found that advertisers use a technique called audio compression , which shrinks the dynamic range of sounds - the spectrum between loud and quiet - to keep the ad within the same volume range as that of a TV program .
But if the ad runs during a movie with a wide sound range , the ads will often blare at the highest level of sound - say , the car chase or the explosion - sending viewers diving for the remote .
Loudness unregulated
The FCC does n't regulate the volume of television programs and commercials , although it has received complaints about sound levels .
In 1984 , the agency concluded that there was no effective way to control loudness , which it said was a subjective issue for viewers .
New technology , however , makes sound levels more controllable .
Advertising agencies in San Francisco said they try to avoid the blaring sounds associated with used - car salesmen and monster - truck rallies , which can turn off consumers .
Scott Aal , creative director for Engine Company 1 , said he and his sound mixers work carefully to limit the use of loud noises .
" Some spots call for that , " Aal said .
" Maybe there is a rock band in the spot and part of the joke is how loud they are .
Or a car engine is loud and part of the story requires more volume .
So there are those times where you say , ' This should feel pretty loud . '
But I 've never had anyone suggest to me , ' We have to make this thing blast so it stands out . ' "
Chuck McBride , chief creative officer of the Cutwater ad agency in San Francisco , said his firm will lay down track after track of sound - music , background noises , dialogue .
After mixing it on high - end equipment , they run it through the small , tinny speakers used in most TV sets .
" You have to remix it so it plays well on a really small speaker , " McBride said .
" Generally that forces us down ( on volume ) .
Sometimes I 've done mixes , and I hear it on TV , and it sounded really soft .
I 've seen other ads that jump out of the TV . "
McBride , whose clients include Jeep and Ray - Ban sunglasses , said he finds loud ads annoying , too - " especially when you get those ads that start off shouting , " ' Right now , you can get so - and - so on sale ! ' "
He 'd like to see the industry set its own audio standards .
" I do n't think the federal government should regulate it , " he said .
" The ( TV ) channels should repair it because on bad cable channels , where it 's really annoying , they should fix it because it makes you think you 're watching a third - rate cable station . "
PITTSBURGH ( Reuters ) - U.S. Republican presidential hopeful John McCain proposed a summer gas tax reduction and other tax cuts on Tuesday in a bid to reassure voters he would help them navigate an ailing economy .
McCain , the expected Republican nominee for the November election , proposed the steps to boost the struggling U.S. economy , which has surpassed the Iraq war as voters ’ top concern .
The Democratic candidates quickly denounced the Arizona senator ’s ideas as a continuation of the economic policies of unpopular Republican President George W. Bush .
“ I do n’t think America can afford four more years of the failed Bush policies , and that ’s what he ’s offering , ” Illinois Sen .
Barack Obama told a gathering of construction labor unions in Washington .
Obama and his rival for the Democratic nomination , New York Sen.
Hillary Clinton , have accused McCain of being economically illiterate and out of touch with ordinary Americans ’ pocketbook concerns .
While the Democrats presented plans to boost the economy and help stave off home foreclosures early this year , McCain had not outlined specific ideas until recent weeks .
On the day when U.S. income taxes are due , McCain proposed a simpler tax code and a phase - out of the alternative minimum tax , which has increasingly snared middle - class taxpayers along with the wealthy .
With gasoline prices expected to climb beyond a new high of $ 3.39 per gallon , he asked Congress to suspend the 18.4 cent federal gas tax and 24.4 cent diesel tax from the Memorial Day holiday at the end of May to Labor Day in early September .
“ The effect will be an immediate economic stimulus -- taking a few dollars off the price of a tank of gas every time a family , a farmer or trucker stops to fill up , ” McCain said .
McCain also said he would suspend U.S. purchases of oil for the emergency stockpile known as the Strategic Petroleum Reserve because he believes the purchases are contributing to higher gas prices .
STUDENT LOAN , TAX RELIEF
McCain proposed relief for student loans and a doubling of the tax exemption for dependents to $ 7,000 .
He also proposed increased funding for the federal government ’s Medicare prescription drug program by requiring higher payments for couples who earn more than $ 160,000 .
The gas - tax holiday would cost $ 8 billion to $ 10 billion , McCain later said at a news conference .

McCain economic adviser Doug Holtz - Eakin put the total cost of the cuts at $ 195 billion , which he said would be offset largely by spending cuts and closing loopholes as well as increased tax revenue from a rise in economic growth as a result of his policies .
He said McCain believes he can balance the budget in eight years .
The Democratic Party estimated the tab at $ 4.68 trillion over 10 years when previously proposed tax cuts are included .
“ It ’s really extraordinary how fiscally irresponsible Sen. McCain ’s policies are , ” said Harvard University public - policy professor Jeffrey Liebman on a conference call organized by the Democratic Party .

Obama , who is battling Clinton for the right to represent the Democratic party in the November election , said McCain ’s new plans represented a shift from his earlier resistance to tax cuts .
“ Somewhere along the way to the Republican nomination I guess he figured he had to stop speaking his mind and start toeing the line , ” he said .
A Clinton aide denounced McCain ’s plan as a repeat of Bush policies , but Clinton herself did not mention McCain in a speech to newspaper publishers .
Instead , she touted her proposals to create millions of new jobs through spending on alternative energy and construction .
“ We ’ve got to start rewarding work instead of wealth , ” she said .
McCain used his speech not only to put some distance between him and the Bush administration but also to say both Democrats and Republicans are guilty of spending excesses .
He said his Democratic rivals would hike taxes by $ 1 trillion over a decade .
“ They have the audacity to hope you do n’t mind , ” he said in a poke at the title of Obama ’s book , “ The Audacity of Hope .

US plans to station diplomats in Iran for first time since 1979
The US plans to establish a diplomatic presence in Tehran for the first time in 30 years as part of a remarkable turnaround in policy by President George Bush .
The Guardian has learned that an announcement will be made in the next month to establish a US interests section - a halfway house to setting up a full embassy .
The move will see US diplomats stationed in the country .
The news of the shift by Bush who has pursued a hawkish approach to Iran throughout his tenure comes at a critical time in US - Iranian relations .
After weeks that have seen tensions rise with Israel conducting war games and Tehran carrying out long - range missile tests , a thaw appears to be under way .
The White House announced yesterday that William Burns , a senior state department official , is to be sent to Switzerland on Saturday to hear Tehran 's response to a European offer aimed at resolving the nuclear standoff .
Burns is to sit at the table with Iranian officials despite Bush repeatedly ruling out direct talks on the nuclear issue until Iran suspends its uranium enrichment programme , which is a possible first step on the way to a nuclear weapon capability .
A frequent complaint of the Iranians is that they want to deal directly with the Americans instead of its surrogates , Britain , France and Germany .
Bush has taken a hard line with Iran throughout the last seven years but , in the dying days of his administration , it is believed he is keen to have a positive legacy that he can point to .
The return of US diplomats to Iran is dependent on agreement by Tehran .
But President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad indicated earlier this week that he was not against the opening of a US mission .
Iran would consider favourably any request aimed at boosting relations between the two countries , he said .
US interests in the country at present are looked after by the Swiss embassy .
The British government restored its embassy in Tehran after Labour 's 1997 general election victory as part of a policy of constructive diplomacy with countries that had previously been branded rogue states .
The creation of a US interest section would see diplomats stationed in Tehran for the first time since the hostage crisis that began when hundreds of students , as part of the Iranian revolution that led to fall of the Shah , stormed the US embassy in 1979 and held the occupants until 1981 .
The special interests section would be similar to the one in Havana , Cuba .
The US broke off relations with Cuba in 1961 after Castro 's takeover but US diplomats returned in 1977 .
The special interests section carries out all the functions of an embassy .
It is , in terms of protocol , part of the Swiss embassy but otherwise is staffed by Americans and independent of the Swiss .
There has been an intense debate within the Bush administration over Iran , with the vice - president , Dick Cheney , in favour of a military strike against Iranian nuclear plants and the state department in favour of diplomacy .
The state department has been pressing the White House for the last two years to re-establish diplomatic relations with Tehran by setting up an interest section .
The state department is keen that the move should not be interpreted as a sign of weakness .
Sending Burns , who left Washington last night , to Geneva and the establishment of an interests section undercuts one of the main planks of foreign policy advocated by the Democratic presidential candidate , Barack Obama , who argues for direct negotiations with Iran .
The White House has been working in tandem over the last month with Obama 's Republican rival , John McCain .
The US has had to rely on British diplomats based in Tehran , as well as other diplomats , for information about the inner workings of Iranian politics .
Having its own staff would give them access to students , dissidents and others .
The staff would also process visa applications , at present handled by a small office in Dubai , which is difficult for Iranians to get to .
Ahmadinejad told a reporter earlier this week , in response to a question about a possible US interests section : " We will receive favourably any action which will help to reinforce relations between the peoples . "
He added : " We have not received any official request but we think that the development of relations between the two peoples is something correct . "
That sentiment was echoed last month by secretary of state , Condoleezza Rice , who told reporters : " We want more Iranians visiting the United States ... We are determined to reach out to the Iranian people . "
Iran has an interests section in Washington , which would make it harder for Tehran to deny the Americans a similar arrangement .
Rice set up a group to study the feasibility of re-establishing a presence after the idea cropped up repeatedly in discussions among Washington thinktanks .
Asked last month about the idea , she would not confirm or deny it .
But she indicated that the present arrangement where there is an American visa office for Iranians in Dubai was inadequate .
" We know that it 's difficult for Iranians sometimes to get to Dubai , " she said .
Colombia has previously accused Hugo Chavez of funding Farc Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez has called on Colombia 's Farc rebels to end their four - decade struggle and release all their hostages .
Mr Chavez , whom Colombia has accused of financing the Farc , said they were " out of step " and their war was " history " .
The Colombian government expressed surprise , but welcomed the statement .
The rebels are believed to be at their weakest point in years , following the death of their long - time leader , Manuel Marulanda , in March .
The Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia ( Farc ) hold many hostages , including about 40 high - profile ones they say they want to swap for imprisoned rebels .
At this moment in Latin America , an armed guerrilla movement is out of place
Hugo Chavez
Farc under pressure
Send us your comments
In his weekly television and radio programme on Sunday , Mr Chavez urged the Farc 's new leader , Alfonso Cano , to " let all these people go " .
" There are old folk , women , sick people , soldiers who have been prisoners in the mountain for 10 years , " he added .
The Venezuelan president said ending the rebellion could lead to a peace process between the rebels and the Colombian government .
" The guerrilla war is history , " he said .
" At this moment in Latin America , an armed guerrilla movement is out of place . "
Computer evidence Colombian Interior minister Carlos Holguin said the statement from Mr Chavez , a " great ally " of the rebels , was " surprising " .
" He is a great defender and ally of the guerrillas , so it is so surprising , " he said .
" But it 's great , and I hope Farc hears him . "
BBC Americas editor Emilio San Pedro says the message represents an about - face for Mr Chavez , who a few months ago called on the world to regard the Farc as a legitimate army rather than a terrorist group .
Our correspondent says Mr Chavez ' critics will wonder whether this change is related to allegations by Colombia 's Alvaro Uribe - who accused Mr Chavez of giving the rebels $ 300 m .
In March Colombia said it had found documents on a computer that proved Venezuela funded Farc .
The computer was seized during a raid on a Farc camp in Ecuador , in which another senior Farc leader , Raul Reyes , was killed .
Venezuela said any contacts with Farc were solely made as part of a humanitarian effort to free hostages .
Kidnap capital
The captives include Franco - Colombian politician Ingrid Betancourt and three Americans .
Earlier this year Mr Chavez negotiated the release of two key hostages , Clara Rojas and Consuelo Gonzalez .
Late last year his official mediation role was terminated by Colombian President Alvaro Uribe , who said Mr Chavez had overstepped his responsibilities .
The Farc is the oldest and largest group among Colombia 's left - wing rebels - and is one of the world 's richest guerrilla armies .
It was founded in 1964 when it declared its intention to use armed struggle to overthrow the government and install a Marxist regime .
But like most of the paramilitary groups in Colombia 's forty - year civil conflict , it has become increasingly involved in the drug trade .
Colombia is known as the " kidnap capital of the world " , with one person a day , down from 10 a day in 2002 , being snatched either for ransom or political bargaining .

Investors are losing confidence in Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae Plans announced on Sunday will see troubled US mortgage giants Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae brought under tighter government control .
Confidence in the two businesses , which are at the heart of the multi-trillion US housing market , has waned as property prices have collapsed and foreclosure levels have soared .
The US Treasury said in July it would shore up their finances if they needed help in what would be the biggest state rescue in history .
Now it is pledging trillions in financial guarantees for the two firms over the next 16 months .
What are Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac ?
They are both shareholder - owned companies mandated by the US Congress to provide funding to the housing market .
Fannie Mae is short for Federal National Mortgage Association , Freddie Mac short for Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation .
Fannie
Mae was founded in 1938 at a time when millions of families could not become homeowners , or faced losing their homes , because of a lack of mortgage funds .
It was a government agency until 1968 .
Freddie Mac was created in 1970 to provide competition to Fannie Mae .
What do they do ?
The two firms do not lend directly to homebuyers , instead buying mortgages from approved lenders and then selling them on to investors .
They guarantee or own roughly half of all the $ 12 trillion US mortgage market and this figure has been steadily increasing as other lenders have either failed or reduced their exposure to a falling market .
Almost all US mortgage lenders , from huge financial institutions like Citigroup to small , local banks , rely on Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac .
Lenders look to Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae for the funds they need to meet consumer demand for home mortgages .
By linking mortgage lenders with investors , the two firms keep the supply of money widely available and at a lower cost .
There is no direct UK equivalent to the two firms .
Why are they in trouble ?
Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have made billions in losses as the US housing market has seen a big increase in defaults and repossessions .
The firms lost more than $ 3bn alone between April and June , resulting in a sharp fall in their share values .
To cover these losses they have tried to raise funds but investors fear they may not be able to raise enough to cover their liabilities .
They have to pay out if ordinary homeowners cannot pay back their home loans , which is proving a huge drain on their finances .
How is the US government proposing to protect the firms ?
Plans approved by Congress this summer allow the government to support the two firms by expanding their access to credit and permitting the Treasury to buy shares in the companies if needed .
More radical steps have now been drawn up to place the firms in a so - called " conservatorship " .
Foreclosure rates have soared
In this scenario , the government will guarantee the firms ' debts , bring in new management and provide fresh liquidity to make the business less vulnerable to the declining market .
This process will take at least a year and will be highly expensive .
According to the Congressional Budget Office , such a move could potentially cost US taxpayers up to $ 25 bn .
Some commentators have criticised the prospect of such a giant " bailout " for companies that are privately owned .
But the Treasury hopes that taking such action will help to rebuild confidence and stability in the mortgage markets .
What would happen if they failed ?
This prospect is all but unthinkable as far as the nation 's bankers , regulators and politicians are concerned .
Should they collapse , mortgages would be harder to get hold of and much more expensive and an already enfeebled property market would be further undermined .
President George W. Bush has pledged to do all he can to support the two firms in their current form .
The two men hoping to replace him in the White House have also backed efforts to put the two firms on a sounder footing .
Barack Obama , the Democratic Presidential nominee , said action must be taken to stabilize the two firms " because the housing market , which is already weakened , would be in even worse shape if we did n't take some steps " .
For the Republicans , Presidential nominee John McCain said the two firms needed to be reconstituted .
" There 's got to be reorganization and there 's got to be some confidence that we have stopped this downward spiral , " he said .

THE Burmese government ’s criminally neglectful response to last month ’s cyclone , and the world ’s response to that response , illustrate three grim realities today : totalitarian governments are alive and well ; their neighbors are reluctant to pressure them to change ; and the notion of national sovereignty as sacred is gaining ground , helped in no small part by the disastrous results of the American invasion of Iraq .
Indeed , many of the world ’s necessary interventions in the decade before the invasion  in places like Haiti and the Balkans  would seem impossible in today ’s climate .
The first and most obvious reality is the survival of totalitarian government in an age of global communications and democratic progress .
Myanmar ’s military junta employs the same set of tools used by the likes of Stalin to crush dissent and monitor the lives of citizens .
The needs of the victims of Cyclone Nargis mean nothing to a regime focused solely on preserving its own authority .
Second is the unwillingness of Myanmar ’s neighbors to use their collective leverage on behalf of change .
A decade ago , when Myanmar was allowed to join the Association of Southeast Asian Nations , I was assured by leaders in the region that they would push the junta to open its economy and move in the direction of democracy .
With a few honorable exceptions , this has n’t happened .
A third reality is that the concept of national sovereignty as an inviolable and overriding principle of global law is once again gaining ground .
Many diplomats and foreign policy experts had hoped that the fall of the Berlin Wall would lead to the creation of an integrated world system free from spheres of influence , in which the wounds created by colonial and cold war empires would heal .
Researchers at the University of British Columbia and Vancouver Coastal Health Research Institute have discovered how tuberculosis ( TB ) bacteria hide and multiply in the human body and are working toward a treatment to block this mechanism of infection .
This discovery , published May 14 in the journal Cell Host and Microbe , describes the missing link between a TB protein and its newly discovered counterpart protein in the human body ’s white blood cells ( macrophages ) .
TB causes disease by infecting the body ’s macrophages .
Normally , macrophages engulf bacteria and then release powerful digestive enzymes that destroy the bacteria .
The researchers found that a protein secreted by TB targets a protein in the macrophage .
In doing so , TB disrupts this process , allowing it to hide and multiply within the macrophage .
The research , lead by Dr. Yossi Av - Gay , research scientist with the Immunity and Infection Research Centre at the Vancouver Coastal Research Institute and associate professor with UBC ’s Faculty of Medicine , suggests that therapies that block the activity of the TB protein in macrophages would allow the body to identify TB bacteria more easily .
This would prevent the establishment of active and latent tuberculosis and will lead to a new and more effective treatment for TB .
“ Once inside the human macrophage , TB acts as a Trojan Horse , ” says Dr. Horacio Bach , the primary author of the paper and research scientist with the Immunity and Infection Research Centre at the Vancouver Coastal Research Institute .
“ TB multiplies inside the macrophage and when released attack the human body .
By identifying this protein we are now able to expose the hiding bacteria , which will allow the macrophages to destroy them . ”
The Av - Gay lab has already taken the next step .
“ Excitingly , we have also been able to engineer a specific antibody that blocks this newly discovered TB protein , ” says Av - Gay .
“ We are now looking to collaborate with the pharmaceutical industry to come up with a therapy that can be used to block this particular mechanism , which will be an important tool in weakening TB . ”
TB is called the ultimate killer .
It is the leading cause of death among infectious diseases in the world today and is responsible for one in four adult preventable deaths , according to the World Health Organization ( WHO ) .
Ten million new cases of TB arise every year , killing close to two million people worldwide annually .
Every 20 seconds TB kills someone and approximately 4,400 people die every day .
The WHO estimates that one - third of the world ’s population is infected .
The current treatment regime involves taking multiple medications over an extended period of time .
The Canadian Institutes of Health Research , TB Veterans Charitable Foundation and the Michael Smith Foundation for Health Research provided funding for this research .
A federal grand jury in Los Angeles has begun probing three of the nation ’s largest subprime mortgage lenders in the clearest sign yet that prosecutors are investigating whether fraud and other crimes contributed to the mortgage debacle .
Grand jury subpoenas have been issued in recent weeks and months to Countrywide Financial Corp. , New Century Financial Corp. and IndyMac Federal Bank seeking a wide range of information , according to sources with direct knowledge of the subpoenas .
People familiar with the situation told The Times that the subpoenas seek e-mails , phone bills and bank records and follow interviews that federal investigators have conducted with employees and others knowledgeable about the lending operations of the three Southern California institutions , which all collapsed under the weight of bad loans .
In the case of Countrywide , the sources said , investigators have also begun looking into news reports that the firm and its former chairman , Angelo Mozilo , gave mortgage breaks to members of Congress and other influential “ friends of Angelo , ” including Richard Aldrich , an associate justice of the California Court of Appeal .

The investigations are part of a coordinated Justice Department effort that until now has focused primarily on smaller operators suspected of defrauding homeowners and mortgage lenders .
The subpoenas , while indicating that the effort is still at an early stage , show that the government is starting to take aim at the largest lenders and their executives to determine whether they were complicit in the multibillion - dollar mortgage crisis .
The sources familiar with the subpoenas spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not allowed to discuss them publicly .
The mortgage losses have regulators and law enforcement personnel gearing up for what experts say could prove to be the biggest financial fraud case since the savings and loan crisis of the 1980s .

Officials have said they are beginning to investigate whether securities investors were defrauded about the value of subprime mortgages they purchased , as well as other possible crimes such as insider trading by corporate officials who sold stock knowing their holdings were about to deflate in value .
Thom Mrozek , a spokesman for the U.S. attorney ’s office in Los Angeles , declined to acknowledge that any of the firms were being investigated or had been issued subpoenas .
However , the office , along with the FBI in Los Angeles , has been ratcheting up its scrutiny of mortgage firms .
Last month , officials created a multi-agency task force to address mortgage crimes ; it includes representatives of agencies such as the Internal Revenue Service , the U.S. Postal Inspection Service , the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp .

In a recent interview with The Times , Thomas P. O’Brien , the U.S. attorney in Los Angeles , cautioned that fraud cases involve complex facts and circumstances and are difficult to pursue .
But he also indicated that his office would move forward aggressively in appropriate circumstances .
“ As with any white - collar case , these tend to be extremely complex and take years to investigate , ” O’Brien said .
“ But this is a very high priority for me and this office and the Department of Justice . ”
The FBI has said it is examining 21 cases against corporate and other large entities related to the subprime market collapse , a 50 % increase in the number of cases in the last six months alone .

Without providing names , the bureau has said that a wide array of firms could be targeted , including securities firms , hedge fund operators , credit rating agencies , and mortgage brokers and lenders .
According to Sharon Ormsby , chief of the financial crimes section at FBI headquarters in Washington , the bureau is working closely with the Securities and Exchange Commission to identify culprits .
“ It is their regulatory oversight that allows them to see the problem first .
They will notify us if they see something unusual or suspicious or something of interest , ” she said in an interview .
“ With the [ Justice Department ] fraud section , we will meet and determine whether a parallel criminal case should occur . ”

In one such case , federal prosecutors in Brooklyn last month indicted two Bear Stearns managers on charges of defrauding investors in hedge funds that included subprime loans .
Prosecutors said last week that they intended to bring an expanded indictment in that case by early this fall .
The subpoenas to the three big Southern California mortgage lenders were issued over a period of time and focused on a variety of issues , the sources said .
In some cases , investigators amended their requests after they apparently failed to produce information of interest .

Calabasas - based Countrywide , which grew to be the nation ’s largest mortgage lender , recently was acquired by Charlotte , N.C. - based Bank of America after suffering steep losses from a disastrous foray into subprime lending .
The firm is already being sued by the attorneys general of California and Illinois for allegedly pushing borrowers into unaffordable loans and using misleading practices .
Mozilo also faces questions from regulators about the exercise of stock options that allowed him to pocket millions of dollars while Countrywide ’s fortunes worsened .
Irvine - based New Century , an early illustration of the mortgage boom and bust , has been operating under federal bankruptcy law protection since April 2007 .
In a lengthy report last March , a court - appointed examiner concluded that the bank had engaged in improper accounting that overstated its profit and allowed top executives to reap millions in inflated or undeserved bonuses .

The most recent subpoenas , sources said , were served on IndyMac , the Pasadena - based lender that was seized by federal regulators this month .
The bank specialized in what have been derisively called “ liar loans ” made to borrowers with little or no proof of income .
Its failure is expected to cost the federal deposit insurance fund $ 4 billion to $ 8 billion .
David Barr , a spokesman for the FDIC , which now runs IndyMac Bank , declined to comment on the subpoenas .
Shirley Norton , a Bank of America spokeswoman , said the firm as a policy does not comment on subpoenas .
Advertisement
Lawyers for New Century could not be reached for comment .
Despite the massive losses , legal experts said , the government faces numerous obstacles in bringing criminal cases against large firms connected to the subprime mess .
The firms were operating in a highly deregulated environment during which rising home prices long appeared to validate their aggressive lending .
“ I think the government will have a hard time ” in bringing high - profile criminal cases , said Joshua R. Hochberg , a former chief of the Justice Department fraud section and now a partner with the McKenna Long & Aldridge law firm in Washington .
“ The investment vehicles were so complex , showing that people illegally manipulated them will be very difficult . ”
Federal officials “ are looking at ways to bring cases that are easier to make . . . where you get people on tape or on e-mails saying one thing and then misleading the investing public , ” Hochberg said .
“ That is a lot easier than proving that the underlying transactions were knowingly and intentionally fraudulent . ”

Some banking consultants said it was an open question whether shoddy loan practices rose to the level of criminal wrongdoing .
“ There were a lot of bad underwriting decisions associated with those loans .
A lot should not have been made , ” said Bert Ely , an Alexandria , Va. , banking consultant .
“ What they may find is a lot of incredibly sloppy practices that are not necessarily criminal , ” Ely said .

Bush claims executive privilege to block testimony on CIA leak Associated Press
Published : Wednesday July 16 , 2008
Print This Email This President Bush has asserted executive privilege to prevent Attorney General Michael Mukasey from having to comply with a House panel subpoena for material on the leak of CIA operative Valerie Plame 's identity .
A House committee chairman , meanwhile , held off on a contempt citation of Mukasey  who had requested the privilege claim  but only as a courtesy to lawmakers not present .
Rep. Henry Waxman , chairman of the House Oversight Committee , rejected Mukasey 's suggestion that Vice President Dick Cheney 's FBI interview on the CIA leak should be protected by the privilege claim  and therefore not turned over to the panel .
" We 'll act in the reasonable and appropriate period of time , " Waxman , D - Calif . , said .
But he made clear that he thinks Mukasey has earned a contempt citation and that he'd schedule a vote on the matter soon .
" This unfounded assertion of executive privilege does not protect a principle ; it protects a person , " Waxman said .
" If the vice president did nothing wrong , what is there to hide ? "
The assertion of the privilege is not about hiding anything but rather protecting the separation of powers as well as the integrity of future Justice Department investigations of the White House , Mukasey wrote to Bush in a letter dated Tuesday .
Several of the subpoenaed reports , he wrote , summarize conversations between Bush and advisers  are direct presidential communications protected by the privilege .
" I am greatly concerned about the chilling effect that compliance with the committee 's subpoena would have on future White House deliberations and White House cooperation with future Justice Department investigations , " Mukasey wrote to Bush .
" I believe it is legally permissible for you to assert executive privilege with respect to the subpoenaed documents , and I respectfully request that you do so . "
White House spokesman Tony Fratto said Bush invoked the privilege on Tuesday .
Waxman said he would wait to hold a vote on Mukasey 's contempt citation until all members of the panel had a chance to read up on the matter .
The Bush administration had plenty of warning .
Waxman warned last week that he would cite Mukasey with contempt unless the attorney general complied with the subpoena .
The House Judiciary Committee also has subpoenaed some of the same documents from Mukasey , as well as information on the leak from other current and former administration officials .
Congressional Democrats want to shed light on the precise roles , if any , that Bush , Cheney and their aides may have played in the leak .
State Department official Richard Armitage first revealed Plame 's identity as a CIA operative to columnist Robert Novak , who used former presidential counselor Karl Rove as a confirming source for a 2003 article .
Around that time Plame 's husband , former Ambassador Joseph Wilson , was criticizing Bush 's march to war in Iraq .
Cheney 's then - chief of staff , I. Lewis " Scooter " Libby , also was involved in the leak and was convicted of perjury , obstruction and lying to the FBI .
Last July , Bush commuted Libby 's 2 1/2 - year sentence , sparing him from serving any prison time .
Libby told the FBI in 2003 that it was possible that Cheney ordered him to reveal Plame 's identity to reporters .

Update , July 21 , 2008 : This article was originally published on March 21 , 2008 and applies to first - gen iPhones running the 1.1.4 software .
If you 've upgraded your device or purchased an iPhone 3G , here 's how to jailbreak iPhone 2.0 with PwnageTool .
If you 've been waiting for Apple to officially open the iPhone and iPod touch for development , you may have been disappointed to find out that you wo n't get third - party applications until June .
That means that if you 've been aching for those killer third - party apps already available to folks with jailbroken iPhones or iPod touches , you 've still got a few more months of waiting to go .
However , by downloading and running one simple application , you could be up and running with a jailbroken iPhone or iPod touch in just under a minute .
Sound appealing ?
Here 's how it works .

The Special Sauce is ZiPhone
The application that does all the heavy lifting for you is a free , open source , cross- platform application called ZiPhone , and it can do everything from quick and simple iPhone and iPod touch jailbreaks to unlocking the iPhone for unofficial carriers ( i.e. , not AT&T ) .
I 'm going to cover the very basic jailbreaking of the iPhone and iPod touch , but the process is the same no matter what device you 're jailbreaking and what level of unlocking you want .
G/O Media may get a commission LG 75 - Inch 8K TV Buy for $ 2150 from BuyDig Use the promo code ASL250
When you 're done using ZiPhone you 'll be running a jailbroken iPhone or iPod touch with the latest 1.1.4 firmware .
Since using ZiPhone is so simple , the purpose of this post is more to demonstrate just how easy it is to jailbreak and run those third - party apps until Apple finally gives its official , official blessing in June .
Prepare Your iPhone or iPod touch for Jailbreak

First , let 's talk preparation .
If you 're working with a fresh , up - to - date device , there 's really nothing to it — you 're ready to proceed to the next step .
If you 've already jailbroken your phone once before — especially a 1.1.3 iPhone jailbreak using one of the older methods — then you should restore your iPhone or iPod touch to the latest factory firmware ( 1.1.4 ) before continuing .
When you restore , tell iTunes that want to set up the restored iPhone as a new phone rather than restoring the settings from the previously jailbroken phone .
( I can't speak for the iPod touch on this front , but the first time I used ZiPhone on my previously jailbroken iPhone without taking this step , the jailbreak resulted in some bugs . )
Now that you 're working with a fresh device , it 's time to move on to the easy part : jailbreaking .

Jailbreak Your iPhone or iPod touch in Under a Minute
Now head to the ZiPhone blog and click through on the " Click here to Download ZiPhone " link to grab the latest Windows or Mac version .

Once you download ZiPhone , you 're ready to go .
When you run the application , you 'll see a window like the one of the two images to the left .
( The first one is the Windows version , the second is the Mac version .
Click the image for a larger view . )
The simple jailbreaks ( that is , the ones that do n't unlock your iPhone for other cell phone carriers ) are pointed out in the screenshot .

Quit iTunes .
( This may not be strictly necessary , but it 's a good practice . )
Choose the option that applies to you : iPod touch jailbreak or iPhone jailbreak .
ZiPhone will cycle your device into recovery mode , perform the jailbreak , and in 45 seconds your iPhone or iPod touch will be officially and completely jailbroken .
Advertisement
Now you can go through iTunes , set up , and sync the device just as you would if it were fresh out of the box .
( Just remember not to restore your old settings if you were using a 1.1.3 jailbroken iPhone . )
When you head to your home screen for the first time , you 'll notice two new icons : the Installer .app icon — which is the application that allows you to install the best iPhone apps currently available — and a web clip icon that will take you to the ZiPhone homepage ( which you can remove if you do n't want it ) .

Should I Jailbreak with ZiPhone if I 've Already Jailbroken ?
If you 've already jailbreakon your iPhone or iPod touch , there 's no hugely compelling reason to do it again with ZiPhone .
However , I had been using a 1.1.3 jailbreak on my iPhone prior to jailbreaking with ZiPhone , and the ZiPhone jailbreak did fix the common Google Maps faux - GPS problem .
Additionally , it 's always good to run the latest firmware if and when you can , jailbroken or not .
Advertisement
That 's all there is to it .
Simple , quick , and effective .
If you 've been dying to run more apps on your iPhone or iPod but the long wait until June is more than you can stomach , jailbreaking your device is easier than ever with ZiPhone .
( Okay , maybe not quite as easy as the one - click jailbreak for 1.1.1 , but still really easy ) .

Companies get OK to annoy polar bears Associated Press
Published : Saturday June 14 , 2008

Print This Email This By DINA CAPPIELLO WASHINGTON 
Less than a month after declaring polar bears a threatened species because of global warming , the Bush administration is giving oil companies permission to annoy and potentially harm them in the pursuit of oil and natural gas .
The Fish and Wildlife Service issued regulations this week providing legal protection to seven oil companies planning to search for oil and gas in the Chukchi Sea off the northwestern coast of Alaska if " small numbers " of polar bears or Pacific walruses are incidentally harmed by their activities over the next five years .
Environmentalists said the new regulations give oil companies a blank check to harass the polar bear .
About 2,000 of the 25,000 polar bears in the Arctic live in and around the Chukchi Sea , where the government in February auctioned off oil leases to ConocoPhillips Co. , Shell Oil Co. and five other companies for $ 2.6 billion .
Over objections from environmentalists and members of Congress , the sale occurred before the bear was classified as threatened in May .
Polar bears are naturally curious creatures and sensitive to changes in their environment .
Vibrations , noises , unusual scents and the presence of industrial equipment can disrupt their quest for prey and their efforts to raise their young in snow dens .
However , the Fish and Wildlife Service said oil and gas exploration will have a negligible effect on the bears ' population .
" The oil and gas industry in operating under the kind of rules they have operated under for 15 years has not been a threat to the species , " H. Dale Hall , the Fish and Wildlife Service 's director , told The Associated Press on Friday .
" It was the ice melting and the habitat going away that was a threat to the species over everything else . "
The agency made no secret that oil and gas operations would continue in polar bear territory when it announced May 14 that melting sea ice threatened the creature 's survival .
But Interior Secretary Dirk Kempthorne assured the public that the bear population would not be harmed .
" Polar bears are already protected under the Marine Mammal Protection Act , which has more stringent protections for polar bears than the Endangered Species Act does , " Kempthorne said .
Environmentalists already suing the agency over its determination that the bear 's threatened status cannot be used to regulate global warming gases said Kempthorne 's earlier assurances were misleading .
" Now , three weeks later , Interior issues a rule under the act that we view as a blank check to harass the polar bear in the Chukchi Sea , " said Brendan Cummings , oceans program director at the Center for Biological Diversity .
He added that his group believes the new regulations are illegal .
Exploring in the Chukchi Sea 's 29.7 million acres will require as many as five drill ships , one or two icebreakers , a barge , a tug and two helicopter flights per day , according to the government .
Oil companies will also be making hundred of miles of ice roads and trails along the coastline .
" We are poorly equipped to address those risks and challenges , " said Steven Amstrup , one of the foremost experts on polar bears and a scientist at the U.S. Geological Survey 's Alaska Science Center .
" To assess what the impacts are going to be , we should know more about the bears . "
Last year , the Marine Mammal Oversight Commission , an independent government oversight agency , told the Fish and Wildlife Service it lacked the information to conclude that exploration will not affect the bear population .
The seven companies will be required to map out the locations of polar bear dens , train their employees about the bears ' habits and take other measures to minimize clashes with them .
In exchange , the companies are legally protected if their operations unintentionally harm the bears .
Any bear deaths would still warrant an investigation and could result in penalty under the law .
" These rules are essentially an insurance policy , " said Marilyn Crockett , executive director of the Alaska Oil and Gas Association , an industry group that in 2005 requested the new regulation .
" They say if you conduct your operations in accordance to the requirement in this rule , you will not be held liable for the take of the bears . "
Administration and industry officials said oil companies enjoyed similar status in the Chukchi Sea from 1991 to 1996 and in the Beaufort Sea since 1993 and there was no effect on polar bear populations .
There is no evidence of a polar bear being killed by oil and gas activities in Alaska since 1993 , according to the Fish and Wildlife Service .
Since 1960 , when the hunt for oil and gas began in Alaska , only two fatalities of polar bears have been linked to oil and gas activities in the state , the service said .
Cinematic equivalent of the TV term " jump the shark . "
It is used to refer to the moment in a film series that is so incredible that it lessens the excitement of subsequent scenes that rely on more understated action or suspense .
Such moments are felt to mark the beginning of a low point in the quality of the franchise , as it attempts to explore more absurd avenues .
" Nuke the fridge " is a reference to a scene in Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull wherein the title character incredibly survives a nuclear blast by climbing into a lead - lined refrigerator .
The fridge is blown hundreds of feet into the sky , and , when it lands , Indiana Jones opens the door and walks away completely unscathed and apparently unaffected by any radiation sickness that would surely result from being in such close proximity to a nuclear blast .
The phrase was coined by disappointed IMDB users on the Indiana Jones 4 message board at that website who believed that the franchise had , in fact , nuked the fridge , and that this scene in particular marked its turn for the worse .
The MPAA has a bee in its collective bonnet about collegiate piracy , and the group is n't about to let anything so banal as " facts " get in the way of some cathartic outrage .
How else to explain the fact that the group continues to petition members of Congress for special favors that would force colleges to make plans for offering up legal music services to students and for implementing copyright filters after the MPAA 's own data shows that schools have little to do with the overall problem ?
In a new letter this week , the MPAA continued to push its agenda in Congress , arguing that filters are n't just good for the movie business , they 're good for the schools .
The College Opportunity and Affordability Act sailed through the House last month .
The bill contains a reauthorization of key federal funding for student aid , and the MPAA managed to pack the House version with a pair of provisions that the colleges and universities in question want nothing to do with .
Another version of the bill without those provisions was passed by the Senate , and the two chambers are currently trying to hash out a compromise bill .
On March 11 , the American Council on Education sent a letter ( PDF ) on behalf of 13 higher - ed groups to Congressional leaders , urging them to reject the controversial language .
ACE said that schools had no problem telling their students about copyright and the legal and institutional penalties for violating it .
But the schools did object to wording that would " require institutions to develop plans to provide alternative music and movie services and implement technological measures to deter illegal file sharing . "
That letter pointed out that the MPAA had recently revised its own collegiate piracy numbers downward , now saying that students accounted for 15 percent of revenue lost to piracy ( instead of 44 percent ) .
But as ACE points out , only 20 percent of US college students live on campus and so " only 3 percent of MPAA losses can be attributed to college students using the campus networks . "
( The MPAA recently reported record box office revenue , indicating that piracy concerns , though real , are n't killing the movie business . )
The point was clear : schools do n't believe that they should face special obligations under the law when the part of the problem they have control over is miniscule .
The MPAA shot back this week with a letter of its own .
The Chronicle of Higher Education 's Wired Campus blog obtained a copy of the letter , which says in part , " One filtering product is now deployed at approximately 70 colleges and universities across the country , and it has demonstrated the ability to impede illegal P2P activity on a number of campus networks . "
An unnamed school also " saved $ 1.2 - million a year in terms of bandwidth and $ 70,000 in personnel costs " after using filters .
The group wants Congress to keep the two provisions .
ACE argued that filters are " largely ineffective , " and of course schools are n't anxious to have network management practices dictated to them by interested industries .
In an interview with a University of Minnesota official last week , I was told that P2P apps played an important role in numerous on - campus projects , especially those that dealt with huge scientific data sets .
The university 's preferred response to the piracy problem is to tell students what 's legal and what is not , then set per-dorm bandwidth limits that are high enough for comfortable student use but low enough that the university 's fat pipe wo n't turn into a superhighway for every P2P system on the planet .
In no way is the policy meant to create a file - swapping haven ( the school has to pay a " team of lawyers " to deal with letters from the RIAA and others already , and is n't eager for more of the same ) .
Instead , it 's designed to minimize problems for the school and for academic users while at the same time giving students the information they need to make ( hopefully ) responsible decisions .
The MPAA is right about one thing : bandwidth is expensive , and colleges know it .
But it 's wrong to suggest that schools are n't taking strong , proactive steps to minimize illicit file - swapping while still keeping the network as open as possible .
We took a detailed look at the issue last year and found that most schools already have policies in place for dealing with problems ; in fact , more than half apply some form of sanction after they learn about the very first offense .
The College Opportunity and Affordability Act , though it does not mandate implementation of its two " plans , " does take the first step down that road .
Schools continue to believe they are tackling the problem already , however , without a need for special - interest mandates .
President Bush Flip - Flops on Mortgage Bailout Bill
President Bush has flip - flopped on the mortgage bailout bill and will now sign this burden on the taxpayers into law if it reaches his desk .
He has been threatening to veto this legislation but is now clearly in public relations mode .
He wants to try to raise his approval ratings before he leaves office and he thinks that this is a means to do so .
He is now prepared to bail out people who bought houses that they could n’t afford and he is ready to make us pay for it .
President Bush is desperate , he needs to get something accomplished before he leaves office so he has decided to capitulate to the Democrats during his final months .
Will it end here , or is he so wanting of approval in his last days that he will bend over and take whatever the Democrats give him ?
What other Democrat bills is he willing to sign on to in order to improve is record low approval rating in time to gather donations for his presidential library ?
President Bush is no conservative .
Remember he is a “ compassionate conservative ” and now he is showing us his compassion by ramming this legislation down the throats of ordinary tax paying Americans who work hard to keep their families in their homes .
I have n’t written or talked about this until now but I have become ever more bitter ( maybe dissappointed is a better word ) towards the president in recent weeks , and this just tops it all off .
He spends too much money , is for amnesty , and worked with Ted Kennedy on the education bill .
The one issue that I thought would be his defining moment were his nominations to the supreme court .
But the recent Washington DC verdict on the handgun ban has made me re-think that success .
Sure the verdict was a victory for the second amendment , but is was a close call .
President Obama will easily be able to overcome President Bush ’s supreme court appointees because he will have at least two nominees of his own .
Throw that Bush victory out the window .
Normally I would say that it is n’t his fault that President Obama will have the chance to appoint supreme court judges that will reverse the good that Alito and Roberts have done , but it is his fault .
President Bush has done one thing better than anything else , he has energized the Democrat base and there is no stopping the slaughter that is going to take place in November .
He has killed the national Republican party and it now has to be built from the ground up .
It is going to be a long process but we have President Bush to thank for it .
This bill is just another reason why conservatives will stay home in November .
Conservatives stayed home in 2006 to teach Republicans a lesson but it seems like the Republicans did n’t understand the lesson .
Learning is done through repetition , and in November the lesson of 2006 will be repeated .
Will they learn then ?
According to some people , there are only 36 basic story plots that just get reused .
Others say there are merely 20 .
Some people even say there 's only one plot , but they probably just watch too many Michael Bay movies .
I like the theory that there are only seven plots .
It 's a nice round number , and the plots are vague enough that you can shoehorn anything from Citizen Kane to a cereal commercial into them .
In the spirit of oversimplifying things so that you can smugly shove human endeavors into pre-labeled slots , I 'd like to present my own , contemporary take on this premise : the Seven Basic Blog Posts .

1 . Be upset !
Terrible things are happening in one of the following : the world , the web or a television show you really like .
Make a blog post about it !
People will comment about how much they agree with you .
Then they 'll make their own blog posts about the subject , and other people will comment about how much they agree with them .
If we all work together we 'll learn that we can make a real impact on our pageviews .
2 . Buy a thing !
For too long , the mainstream media have shoved advertising down our throats .
It 's time for us to take the reins of mass communication and shove advertising down each other 's throats !
If we both see the same overproduced movies and lust after the same overpriced devices , then maybe the bitter wind of loneliness wo n't bite quite so fiercely .
3. Animals are cute !
Nobody likes animals when they act like animals .
Videos of a cat snapping a robin's neck do n't go big .
No , we like animals when we can convince ourselves that they 're just like us , only with worse spelling .
For the purposes of this category , animals also includes babies and children younger than 8 .
4. People are dumb !
Try this :
Put up videos of yourself volunteering at a soup kitchen , giving a speech at a symposium and breaking your arm in seven places doing the " shopping cart luge . "
Guess which one will get the most hits .
We like our animals to appear smarter than they really are and our humans dumber , which means that the perfect internet celebrity would be a somewhat slow - witted centaur .
In a Darth Vader outfit .
5 . Something I like , only different !
Liking new things takes so much effort .
You have to learn all these unfamiliar characters or remember completely new lyrics .
It 's much easier to like something that you already know about .
The Matrix – in cookie form !
The Lord of the Rings – if Frodo was a ninja !
The Mario Bros . theme song – played on the hollowed - out skulls of owls !
We 're already starting to see this undergo a third iteration : Star Wars , only with homemade lightsabers , only in a Weezer video !
In about 10 seconds , someone 's going to make a Lego version of that video , bringing it to the fourth level .
6 . Weird science !
This includes homemade experiments involving explosives , as well as actual scientific studies .
There are two types of scientific studies :
Ones you agree with , and ones you do n't .
If you disagree with a study , you should link to it and point out how stupid and biased it is .
If you agree , you should link to it and point out how ridiculous it is that scientists get paid to state the obvious .
Either way , you 're educating your readers that you 're smarter than science .
7 . Me , the blogger !
We 've reached an age where egotism is considered too much work .
Why discuss your hopes and fears when you can just post the results of online tests , show cartoon versions of yourself and collect " friends " ?
It 's a good thing Anais Nin was n't a blogger , or instead of a steamy tale of sexual awakening and creative fervor , we 'd just know that if she was a Ninja Turtle , she'd be Raphael .

Sad Explanations for Supernatural Phenomena
An ancient seed that germinated after being recovered from the rubble of King Herod 's pleasure palace has been dated as 2,000 years old , smashing the record for the oldest seed ever grown .
The seed was among three recovered during excavations at Masada , an imposing 2,044 - year - old clifftop fortress on the edge of the Judean desert overlooking the Dead Sea .
Researchers planted the seed three years ago after treating it with hormone - laced fertilisers .
To their surprise , it germinated and began to grow .
The plant , dubbed the " Methuselah tree " after the oldest character in the Bible , now stands 1.5 m tall .
Dates were such an important export from ancient Judea they were depicted on coins and came to symbolise the region .
According to the historian Josephus , miles and miles of hand - cultivated date forests stretched from the Sea of Galilee to the Dead Sea .
The palm two years after it germinated from a 2,000 - year - old seed .
Photograph : Guy Eisner / Science Magazine
Writing in the journal Science , a team led by Sarah Sallon , director of the Louis Borick Natural Medicine Research Centre at Hadassah Hospital in Jerusalem , reveal how they discovered fragments of the seed 's shell clinging to the plant 's roots when it was transferred to a larger pot .
The fragments were sent to the University of Zurich , where researchers dated them to around 2,000 years ago .
The team had not been able to date the seed until then , because they were reluctant to cut pieces off for testing .
" The exceptionally dry and hot climatic conditions at Masada may have prevented it from disintegrating and preserved its viability , but this still says a lot about the ability of seeds to survive , " said Sallon .
Until now , the record for the oldest seed to be grown was held by a group at the University of California who germinated a 1,300 - year - old lotus seed recovered from a sacred Buddhist lake in China .
At Hadassah Hospital , Sallon investigates traditional , plant - based medicines .
" Well over a third of Israel 's 3,000 species of plants have been used in traditional medicine by Jews and Arabs for thousands of years , " she said .
Her work has grown to include plants that have become locally extinct , as well as those which are still found in the wild .
Extracts from date palms were traditionally used to treat chest infections , gastric problems and even heart conditions .
The ancient date palm differs from modern Moroccan , Egyptian and Iraqi varieties at around half of the 399 genetic markers the researchers looked at .
It will be another couple of years before they know whether the plant can bear fruit – and so whether they will be able to cultivate it .
" We hope that one day , we 'll be able to breed it , " said Sallon .
" The fact that seeds can survive for so long under the right conditions says a lot about conservation and ways to preserve seeds for future generations , " Sallon added .
" Thank god some seeds can survive , because the way we 're busily cutting down everything on the planet , we 're sure going to need them . "
In an astoundingly ignorant interview with The Politico 's Mike Allen Tuesday , President Bush insinuated that electing a Democrat in November would lead to another attack on America , and revealed that he made the ultimate sacrifice by giving up golf shortly after the start of the Iraq War -- the timing of which he lied about .
Naturally , Keith ripped into him tonight -- with all the anger and passion you 've come to expect from a Special Comment -- for continuing this despicable fear - mongering , and for failing to understand what true sacrifice is .

Do your part in telling President Bush to " shut the hell up " : Digg It !
" Mr. President , " he was asked , " you have n't been golfing in recent years .
Is that related to Iraq ?
" Yes , " began perhaps the most startling reply of this nightmarish blight on our lives as Americans -- on our history .
" It really is .
I do n't want some mom whose son may have recently died to see the Commander - in - Chief playing golf .
I feel I owe it to the families to be as -- to be in solidarity as best as I can with them .
And I think playing golf during a war just sends the wrong signal . "
Golf , Sir ?
Golf sends the wrong signal to the grieving families of our men and women butchered in Iraq ?
Do you think these families , Mr. Bush - their lives blighted forever -- care about you playing golf ?
Do you think , Sir , they care about you ?
You , Mr. Bush , let their sons and daughters be killed .
Sir , to show your solidarity with them - you gave up golf ?
Sir , to show your solidarity with them - you did n't give up your pursuit of this insurance - scam , profiteering , morally and financially bankrupting war .
Sir , to show your solidarity with them - you did n't even give up talking about Iraq - a subject about which you have incessantly proved without pause or backwards glance , that you may literally be the least informed person in the world ?
Sir , to show your solidarity with them , you did n't give up ... your
4,000 dead Americans and your response ... was to stop playing golf !
Golf .
Not " gulf " - golf .
Full transcripts below the fold :
Finally tonight , as promised , a Special Comment on two topics a lot of us had foolishly thought , had naively hoped , we would not again have to address ... and a third topic nobody thought a president would ever seriously mention in public unless perhaps he'd just been hit in the head with something and was not in full possession of his faculties -- how he expressed his " empathy " to the families of the dead in Iraq -- by giving up golf .
The President has resorted anew to the sleaziest fear - mongering and mass manipulation of an administration -- of a public life -- dedicated to realizing the lowest of our expectations .
And he has now applied these poisons to the 2008 presidential election , on behalf of the party at whose center he and Mr. McCain lurk .
Mr. Bush has predicted that the election of a Democratic president could , " eventually lead to another attack on the United States . "
This ludicrous , infuriating , holier - than - thou and most importantly bone - headedly wrong statement came yesterday during an interview with Politico - dot - com and on - line users of Yahoo .
The question was phrased as follows : " If we were to pull out of Iraq next year , what 's the worst that could happen , what 's the doomsday scenario ? "
The President replied : " Doomsday scenario , of course , is that extremists throughout the Middle East would be emboldened , which would eventually lead to another attack on the United States .
The biggest issue we face is -- it 's bigger than Iraq -- it's this ideological struggle against cold - blooded killers who will kill people to achieve their political objectives . "
Mr. Bush , at long last , has it not dawned on you that the America you have now created , includes ' cold - blooded killers who will kill people to achieve their political objectives ' ?'
They are those in , or formerly in , your employ , who may yet be charged some day with war crimes .
Through your haze of self - congratulation and self - pity , do you still have no earthly clue that this nation has laid waste to Iraq to achieve your political objectives ?
' This ideological struggle , ' Mr. Bush , is taking place within this country .
It is a struggle between Americans who cherish freedom -- ours and everybody else 's -- and Americans like you , sir , to whom freedom is just a brand name , just like " Patriot Act " is a brand name or " Protect America " is a brand name .
But wait , there 's more .
You also said " Iraq is the place where al Qaeda and other extremists have made their stand -- and they will be defeated . "
They made no " stand " in Iraq , sir .
You allowed them to assemble there !
As certainly as if that were the plan , the borders were left wide open by your government 's farcical post- invasion strategy of ' they 'll greet us as liberators . '
And as certainly as if that were the plan , the inspiration for another generation of terrorists in another country was provided by your government 's farcical post- invasion strategy of letting the societal infra-structure of Iraq dissolve , to be replaced by an American Vice - Royalty enforced by merciless mercenaries who shoot unarmed Iraqis and then evade prosecution in any country , by hiding behind your skirts , sir .
Terrorism inside Iraq is your creation , Mr. Bush !
It was a Yahoo user who brought up the second topic upon whose introduction Mr. Bush should have passed , or punted , or gotten up and left the room claiming he heard Dick Cheney calling him .
" Do you feel , " asked an ordinary American , " that you were mis-led on Iraq ? "
" I feel like -- I felt like , there were weapons of mass destruction .
You know , " mislead " is a strong word , it almost connotes some kind of intentional -- I do n't think so , I think there was a -- not only our intelligence community , but intelligence communities all across the world shared the same assessment .
And so I was disappointed to see how flawed our intelligence was . "
Flawed .
You , Mr. Bush , and your tragically know - it - all minions , threw out every piece of intelligence that suggested there were no such weapons .
You , Mr. Bush , threw out every person who suggested that the sober , contradictory , reality - based intelligence needed to be listened to , fast .
You , Mr. Bush , are responsible for how " intelligence communities all across the world shared the same assessment . "
You and the sycophants you dredged up and put behind the most important steering wheel in the world propagated palpable nonsense and shoved it down the throat of every intelligence community across the world and punished anybody who did n't agree it was really chicken salad .
And you , Mr. Bush , threw under the bus all of the subsequent critics who bravely stepped forward later to point out just how much of a self - fulfilling prophecy you had embraced , and adopted as this country 's policy -- in lieu of , say , common sense .
The fiasco of pre-war intelligence , sir , is your fiasco .
You should build a great statue of yourself turning a deaf ear to the warnings of realists , while you are shown embracing the three - card monte dealers like Richard Perle and Donald Rumsfeld and Dick Cheney .
That would be a far more fitting tribute to your legacy , Mr. Bush , than this presidential library you are constructing as a giant fable about your presidency , an edifice you might as claim was built from Iraqi Weapons of Mass Destruction because there will be just as many of those inside your presidential library as there were inside Saddam Hussein 's Iraq .
Of course if there is one over - riding theme to this president 's administration it is the utter , always - failing , inability to know when to quit when it is behind .
And so Mr. Bush answered yet another question about this layered , nuanced , wheels - within - wheels garbage heap that constituted his excuse for war .
" And so you feel that you did n't have all the information you should have or the right spin on that information ? "
" No , no , " replied the President .
" I was told by people , that they had weapons of mass destruction ... "
People ?
What people ?
The insane informant " Curveball ? "
The Iraqi snake - oil salesman Ahmed Chalabi ?
The American snake - oil salesman Dick Cheney ?
" I was told by people that they had weapons of mass destruction , as were members of Congress , who voted for the resolution to get rid of Saddam Hussein .
And of course , the political heat gets on and they start to run and try to hide from their votes . "
Mr. Bush -- you destroyed the evidence that contradicted the resolution you jammed down the Congress 's throat , the way you jammed it down the nation 's throat .
When required by law to verify that your evidence was accurate , you simply re-submitted it , with phrases amounting to " See , I done proved it , " virtually written in the margins in crayon .
You defied patriotic Americans to say " The Emperor has no clothes " -- only with the stakes ( as you and the mental dwarves in your employ put it ) being a " mushroom cloud over an American city . "
And as a final crash of self - indulgent nonsense , when the incontrovertible truth of your panoramic and murderous deceit has even begun to cost your political party seemingly perpetual congressional seats in places like North Carolina and -- last night -- Mississippi , you can actually say with a straight face , sir , that for members of Congress " the political heat gets on and they start to run and try to hide from their votes " - while you greet the political heat and try to run and hide from your presidency -- and your legacy -- 4,000 of the Americans you were supposed to protect , dead in Iraq , with your only feeble , pathetic answer being , " I was told by people that they had weapons of mass destruction . "
Then came Mr. Bush 's final blow to our nation 's solar plexus , his last re-opening of our common wounds , his last remark that makes the rest of us question not merely his leadership or his judgment but his very suitably to remain in office .
" Mr. President , " he was asked , " you have n't been golfing in recent years .
Is that related to Iraq ?
" Yes , " began perhaps the most startling reply of this nightmarish blight on our lives as Americans -- on our history .
" It really is .
I do n't want some mom whose son may have recently died , to see the Commander - in - Chief playing golf .
I feel I owe it to the families to be as -- to be in solidarity as best as I can with them .
And I think playing golf during a war just sends the wrong signal . "
Golf , sir ?
Golf sends the wrong signal to the grieving families of our men and women butchered in Iraq ?
Do you think these families , Mr. Bush -- their lives blighted forever -- care about you playing golf ?
Do you think , sir , they care about you ?
You , Mr. Bush , let their sons and daughters be killed .
Sir , to show your solidarity with them - you gave up golf ?
Sir , to show your solidarity with them -- you did n't give up your pursuit of this insurance - scam , profiteering , morally and financially bankrupting war .
Sir , to show your solidarity with them -- you did n't even give up talking about Iraq -- a subject about which you have incessantly proved without pause or backwards glance , that you may literally be the least informed person in the world ?
Sir , to show your solidarity with them , you did n't give up your presidency ?
In your own words -- " solidarity as best as I can " -- is to stop a game ?
That is the " best " you can ?
4,000 Americans give up their lives and your sacrifice was to give up golf !
Golf .
Not " gulf " -- golf .
And still it gets worse .
Because it proves that the President 's unendurable sacrifice , his unbearable pain , the suspension of getting to hit a stick with a ball , was not even his own damned idea .
" Mr. President , was there a particular moment or incident that brought you to that decision , or how did you come to that ? "
" I remember when de Mello , who was at the U.N. , got killed in Baghdad as a result of these murderers taking this good man 's life .
And I was playing golf -- I think I was in central Texas -- and they pulled me off the golf course and I said , it 's just not worth it any more to do . "
Your one , tone - deaf , arrogant , pathetic , embarrassing gesture , and you did n't even think of it yourself ?
The great Bushian sacrifice -- an Army private loses a leg , a Marine loses half his skull , four thousand of their brothers and sisters lose their lives , you lose golf ... and they have to pull you off the golf course to get you to just do that ?
If it 's even true ...
Apart from your medical files , which dutifully record your torn calf muscle and the knee pain which forced you to give up running at the same time -- coincidence , no doubt -- the bombing in Baghdad which killed Sergio Vieira de Mello of the U - N... and interrupted your round of golf , was on August 19th , 2003 .
Yet there is an Associated Press account of you playing golf as late as Columbus Day of that year -- October 13th -- nearly two months later .
Mr. Bush , I hate to break it to you , six - and - a - half years after you yoked this nation and your place in history to the wrong war , in the wrong place , against the wrong people but the war in Iraq is Not. About .
You .
It is not , Mr. Bush , about your grief when American after American comes home in a box .
It is not , Mr. Bush , about what your addled brain has produced in the way of paranoid delusions of risks that do not exist , ready to be activated if some Democrat , and not your twin Mr. McCain succeeds you .
The war in Iraq -- your war , Mr. Bush -- is about how you accomplished the derangement of two nations , and how you helped funnel billions of taxpayer dollars to lascivious and perennially thirsty corporations like Halliburton and Blackwater , and how you sent 4,000 Americans to their deaths -- for nothing .
It is not , Mr. Bush , about your golf game !
And , sir , if you have any hopes that next January 20th will not be celebrated as a day of soul - wrenching , heart - felt Thanksgiving , because your faithless stewardship of this presidency will have finally come to a merciful end , this last piece of advice :
When somebody asks you , sir , about Democrats who must now pull this country back from the abyss you have placed us at ...
When somebody asks you , sir , about the cooked books and faked threats you foisted on a sincere and frightened nation ...
When somebody asks you , sir , about your gallant , noble , self - abnegating sacrifice of your golf game so as to soothe the families of the war dead ...
This advice , Mr. Bush ...
Shut the hell up !
The father of an 11 - year - old boy who was told that his son was not Jewish enough to be accepted at one of the country 's leading Orthodox schools has lost his claim for unlawful discrimination .
In a case with implic - ations for other faith schools , the High Court in London has ruled that the Jews '
Free School was not breaking the law when it rejected the boy 's application because his mother 's conversion to Judaism had not been recognised by the Chief Rabbi .
Mr Justice Munby said yesterday that if the father had won his case against the London school it could have rendered unlawful " the admission arrangements in a very large number of faith schools of many different faiths and denominations " .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
The boy , identified in court only as " M " , applied to attend the well - known JFS , formerly the Jews '
Free School , but was declared " not an ' approved ' Jew " .
His father said he was " appalled " that his son had been declared " not Jewish enough " to attend the school , which gains some of the best academic results in the country .
Former pupils include Jason Cheetham , also known as Jay Kay , the lead singer of Jamiroquai , and the actress Gina Bellman .
Jewish status is inherited through the mother .
M's mother , an Italian national , had converted from the Catholic faith before his birth in a conversion carried out by a Progressive synagogue .
JFS is an oversubscribed , state - maintained school with a culture and ethos based on Orthodox Judaism , and its entry criteria gives preference to children whose " Jewish status " is confirmed by the Office of the Chief Rabbi ( OCR ) .
The OCR does not recognise conversions carried out by Progressive synagogues , and therefore did not recognise M as Jewish .
In a case with implications for faith - based schools generally , M's family , supported by two other families , asked Mr Justice Munby to declare there had been unlawful discrimination .
Rejecting the legal challenge , the judge said the kind of admissions policy in question " is not materially different from that which gives preference in admission to a Muslim school to those who were born Muslim , or preference in admission to a Catholic school to those who have been baptised .
But no one suggests that such policies , whatever their differential impact on different applicants , are other than a proportionate and lawful means of achieving a legitimate end . "
The judge said JFS 's policy " of giving preference to children who are Jewish , applying Orthodox Jewish principles " was " essential " to its legitimate aim of pursuing its Orthodox ethos .

He added that , if M's father had succeeded in the case for judicial review , it would probably have rendered unlawful " the admission arrangements in a very large number of faith schools of many different faiths and denominations " .
M's parents are now divorced and the boy lives with his father , with whom he is an active member of the local synagogue and of the Masorti , a " progressive traditional " Jewish movement .
Dinah Rose QC , appearing for the family , argued that what had occurred amounted to racial discrimination , because other children were given preference if their mothers were Jewish by birth , even if they were " committed atheists " .
Ben Jaffrey , appearing for the United Synagogue , previously said there would be " very serious potential consequences " if M and his father won the case .
He said it would affect not only the JFS but more than 20 other schools and other Jewish organisations providing services in the community .
The British Humanist Association supported M's application for judicial review .
JFS is a Jewish co-educational secondary school in Kenton , north - west London .
At one time , it had more than 4,000 students attending and was known as " the largest ( or biggest ) school in the universe " .
It was founded on 13 April 1732 as a boys - only school in Ebenezer Square , London , and was moved in 1822 to Bell Lane in the East End , where it remained until the Second World War when its buildings were destroyed by German bombs .
The school was rebuilt in 1958 in Camden Town .
It moved again in 2002 to its present location .

The new 55 - meter image that was unveiled today is impressive , but does it hold any scientific value ?
A resounding yes to that question came from astronomers who helped work on this project , and given the standing room only for the oral presentation of the scientific research going into this image , plenty of other astronomers are interested in the discoveries from Spitzer ’s five - year effort of gathering infrared data of our home galaxy .
“ This is a legacy science project , ” said Barbara Whitney of the Space Science Institute , “ that shows star formation as never seen before on both the large and small scale .
Most of these star forming regions are being seen for the first time . ”
“ This is the highest - resolution , largest , most sensitive infrared picture ever taken of our Milky Way , ” said Sean Carey of NASA ’s Spitzer Science Center .
“ Where previous surveys saw a single source of light , we now see a cluster of stars .
With this data , we can learn how massive stars form , map galactic spiral arms and make a better estimate of our galaxy ’s star - formation rate , ” Carey explained .
From our vantage point on Earth , we see the Milky Way as a blurry , narrow band of light that stretches across the sky .
In the visible , we only see about 5 % of what ’s actually out there .
But with Spitzer ’s dust - piercing infrared eyes , astronomers have peered 60,000 light - years away into this fuzzy band , called the galactic plane , and saw all the way to the other side of the galaxy .
The result is a cosmic tapestry depicting an epic coming - of - age tale for stars .
While evolved stars are seen as blue , the star forming regions are seen as green .
The regions where young stars reside are revealed as “ bubbles , ” or curved ridges in the green clouds .
These bubbles are carved by the winds from the outflow of dust from the young stellar objects .
The starlets appear as yellow and red dots , and wisps of red are dust particles .
“ With these Spitzer data , we ’ve been able to catalogue more than 100 million stars , ” said Edward Churchwell of the University of Wisconsin , at Madison .
“ This picture shows us that our Milky Way galaxy is a crowded and dynamic place .
We have a lot to learn .
I ’ve definitely found a lot of things in this map that I did n’t expect to see , ” said Carey .

Iowa professor claims FBI suspects him of al Qaeda ties David Edwards and Muriel Kane
Published : Thursday February 7 , 2008

This A professor at Northwest Iowa Community College claims that the FBI is investigating students and faculty there on suspicions that pirated music , movies , and software are being sold to help fund al Qaeda .
College President William Giddings acknowledges that law enforcement officers were asked to look into problems with excessive bandwidth use and possible illicit file - sharing , but he expressed bewilderment at allegations of an al Qaeda connection .
The al Qaeda story comes from computer science professor Steven Gifford , who says that he was visited by the FBI and " they told us the college had alleged that my students and I were running a piracy ring .
We were downloading , cracking and re-selling software , movies and music and were doing this in support of al Qaeda terrorists . "
" I was a little stunned , " Gifford stated .
" There would be no benefit to me to do anything to harm my country .
... I am a patriot . "
Gifford , who has been on paid administrative leave since January 25 over budget issues , suggested that the real problem might be that he is about to become president of the faculty association and the administration does n't like him .
He accused college president William Giddings of wanting " to humiliate and intimidate me . "
President Giddings was reluctant to make any comment about Gifford .
He said he did not know who the target of the FBI investigation was but that it definitely did not involve terrorism .

BEIRUT ( Reuters ) - Israel and Hezbollah have signed a U.N. - mediated prisoner exchange deal and the date for the swap will be settled this week , a Lebanese political source and the Israeli prime minister ’s office said on Monday .
A Palestinian boy ( L ) holds a picture depicting Lebanese prisoner Samir Qantar during a protest in Gaza City calling for the release of prisoners held in Israeli jails July 7 , 2008 .
REUTERS / Ismail Zaydah
The Lebanese source said Hezbollah leader Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah and Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert had both signed the deal under which the Jewish state will release five Lebanese prisoners and Hezbollah will hand over two Israeli soldiers .
Hezbollah seized the soldiers -- army reservists Ehud Goldwasser and Eldad Regev -- during a cross- border raid that triggered the 2006 war between the Iranian - backed group and Israel .
Hezbollah has given no word on their condition , although they are widely presumed dead .
The Lebanese source said he expected the exchange to take place by the middle of next week .
“ We expect the deal to move ahead , and it is possible we will have Regev and Goldwasser back in Israel next week , ” a senior Israeli government official in Jerusalem said .
The Israeli government statement said the completion of the deal still depended on the a number of components being finalized , after which Olmert ’s cabinet would vote to give it final approval .
Under the deal , which was negotiated by a German intelligence officer , Israel will also hand over the bodies of around 200 Arabs killed while infiltrating northern Israel while Hezbollah would return body parts of Israeli soldiers killed in south Lebanon in 2006 .
The dead include Palestinian and Lebanese guerrillas killed in decades of conflict with Israel and the bodies of eight Hezbollah fighters .
An Israeli army spokeswoman said the exhumation of bodies began on Monday and that it would take a number of days to complete the process .
The Lebanese prisoners include Samir Qantar , the most prominent held by Israel .
He is serving a life sentence for killing a policeman as well as a man and his 4 - year - old daughter during a 1979 raid on the northern coastal town of Nahariya .
Nasrallah said last week he expected the exchange to take place around the middle of the month .
LONDON ( MarketWatch ) --
To paraphrase a recent newsmaker , America 's mortgage chickens are coming home to roost .
The incipient collapse of Freddie Mac FRE , - 0.64 % and Fannie Mae FNM , +0.85 % will in all likelihood dump an additional $ 5 trillion in debt onto the national books by making explicit the companies ' dependence on the American taxpayer as their ultimate backstop .
No glib politician , let alone Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson , will be able to talk their way out of this one .
And the world 's leading sources of capital , China and the Gulf oil states are n't about to sign on to support the political priorities of Washington , D.C. politicians looking to subsidize home ownership and get themselves re-elected .
Instead , America is just going to have to work its way through this mess on its own .
It will not be a pleasant process .
Wall Street will cherry - pick the productive mortgages , and the rest will be dumped on everyone else 's doorstep .
People who did n't borrow cheap money they could n't afford and who paid their mortgages on time , will nonetheless have to pony up more taxes to cover the losses incurred by their profligate fellow citizens at the prodding of an elected class that sought to extend homeownership to every American capable of casting a vote .
Maybe , just maybe , the political class will finally have to own up to making some difficult choices : eliminating a couple of aircraft carriers for a start , and that $ 100 billion a year they spend on the department of education .
It might be a good idea to scrap that new air tanker contract too , given that they can't seem to get it awarded anyway .
If they had any real guts , they 'd use this occasion to get rid of the mortgage interest deduction .
After all , given that Congress ' popularity rating is in single digits already , why not take advantage of the opportunity ?
And if the Iraqis can't use their oil wealth to outsource their internal security needs with oil pushing $ 150 a barrel , they 're never going to be able to .
A high school teacher of mine used to say it did n't matter how much money the government borrowed because it was a measure of how much faith Americans had in their future .
We 're about to find out .

A senior European official directly involved in the diplomacy also welcomed the decision to send Mr. Burns , the State Department ’s third - ranking official , calling it a “ major change ” in American policy .
Dana M. Perino , the White House press secretary , said it was Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice who had approached the president about sending Mr. Burns .
One official , speaking on condition of anonymity , said that Ms. Rice had decided to test Iran ’s willingness to consider an international package of incentives meant to coax Iran into making concessions on its nuclear program .
The combination of diplomacy and increasing sanctions , including those by the European Union against Iran ’s largest bank last month , had produced some signals within Iran that it might being softening its stance , and Ms. Rice “ decided it was a chance to press the advantage , ” the official said .
Vice President Dick Cheney and other senior aides discussed the idea as well , said the official , who was not identified because he was speaking about internal discussions .
The extent of American involvement remains unclear .
Mr. McCormack described Mr. Burns ’s participation in the talks as “ a one - time - only deal . ”
Ms. Perino would not rule out additional meetings with the Iranians , saying it depended on the outcome of the meeting .
Some administration officials have even discussed whether to post American officials in Iran without established diplomatic relations , as in Cuba , but have said a decision has not yet been made .
The presence of an American at the talks this weekend may help quiet the mounting calls in both the United States and Israel for military strikes against Iran because of its recent expansion of its uranium enrichment program and its unwillingness to fully explain its suspicious past nuclear activities .
In Tehran , Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , Iran ’s supreme leader , said Wednesday that his country had “ clearly defined red lines ” that had to be respected in negotiations , a reference to Iran ’s insistence that it has the right to peaceful nuclear energy .
BEIJING , May 15 ( Reuters ) -
The death toll from China 's massive earthquake could reach more than 50,000 , the official Xinhua news agency reported on Thursday , quoting rescue headquarters .
Already some 20,000 are confirmed dead as a result of Monday 's 7.9 magnitude quake , but tens of thousands more remain buried in rubble in areas of the worst - hit province of Sichuan that rescuers are only just beginning to reach .

In America these days , political humour is a field of egg shells interspersed with a few safe stepping stones .
The row over the New Yorker 's cover showed the limits of political humour Jokes about Hillary , although less compelling now than when she was still running for President , are one such stone .
So are jokes about Bill , although his once famously errant libido seems to have become distinctly off - off Broadway .
President Bush continues to provide a rich reservoir of humour .
He is the open strip - mine of satire : cheap , easy access and in no immediate danger of running dry - no offshore drilling required .
Jibes about Senator McCain's age practically fill the nocturnal airtime of the comedy shows .
Self - deprecating
What all the above politicians - with the possible exception of Bill Clinton - have in common is that they relish ( or pretend to relish ) making fun of themselves .
Towards the end of her campaign , Hillary was practically doing stand - up .
President Bush partially built his re-election strategy on sending up his mangling of the English language , becoming the first successful candidate in US history to turn inarticulacy and poor grades into an electoral asset .
Even the glowering Dick Cheney likes to crack a joke at his own expense .
He tells a hilarious one about holding his hand on his heart during the National Anthem only to find every doctor in the audience rushing towards him with a defibrillator .
Mr McCain likes to say that he is " older than dirt and has more scars than Frankenstein " .
If politics is a minefield , then satire , self - deprecating jokes and irony are its minesweepers and detonation teams .
The magazine was not making fun of Mr Obama , it was ridiculing the people who think he might be a Muslim
Send us your comments
The extraordinary fuss over the front cover of this week 's New Yorker magazine , which shows Barack Obama dressed in traditional Muslim garb , his wife Michelle looking like a cross between a Colombian Farc guerrilla and Jimi Hendrix , and an American flag burning in the Oval Office fireplace , illustrates the perils of Obama humour for the hallowed guild of comedians and for the candidate .
Firstly , if you have to explain a joke ad nauseam , as the editor of The New Yorker David Remnick and his supporters have been forced to do , then it probably was not very funny in the first place .
In fact , most people seemed to have missed the joke .
The magazine was not making fun of Senator Obama ; it was ridiculing the people who think he might be a Muslim , who believe that a fist bump is the terrorists ' version of a high - five and who are convinced that if Mr Obama refuses to willingly wear a flag pin he might as well put a match to the Stars and Stripes .
In other words , the New Yorker was making fun of those " bitter " , poor white people who " cling " to guns and religion that Mr Obama referred to in a speech in April .
And as we now know , that fragile , thin - skinned group of voters is off limits .
" He 's a Red Neck .
Do n't hurt his feelings ! "
Crass and tasteless
In fact the only safe rule is to stick to telling jokes about your own ethnic , religious , gender , salary , allergy group .
Do n't go off - piste .
Ever . Although The New Yorker cover did not touch overtly on Mr Obama 's African - American origins , any hint of racial stereotyping is , of course , an absolute no - go area .
Can you imagine if last week 's comments about Obama 's " nuts " had been made by a white man ?
There would have been demands for his scalp .
Talk show hosts like Jay Leno " have treated Mr Obama like a Faberge egg "
He would have been forced to resign , go into hiding , while being compared to the lynch mobs of the darkest days of racial hatred .
As it happened , Jesse Jackson was merely ridiculed for being crass and tasteless .
I believe his comments were so absurd that they actually cried out for a quick - witted , perhaps even gently crude response from Mr Obama himself .
Yes - forgive me , readers - but this was an opportunity missed for a candidate who needs to remind voters that he is more than just the rhetorical embodiment of nouns like Hope and Change .
Pincer movement Barack Obama used to be funny .
Who can forget his comment about smoking and inhaling dope : " Of course I inhaled .
I thought that was the point ! "
When he introduced himself to the American public he used to start most of his speeches with a quip about how his wife was really the boss and would not let him run for office unless he quit smoking .
This was funny because it jelled with Michelle 's feisty image .
Nowadays Barack Obama is boxed in by a pincer movement of political correctness : his race on one flank , his squeaky - clean image as the torch - bearer of hope and change on the other .
The guardians of Mr Obama 's saintly image do not tolerate satire of any sort and the New Yorker cover has merely reinforced those limits .
Joke about Barack Hussein Obama at your peril !
This is bad news for late night comedians , who treat Obama as if he was a fragile Faberge egg .
But it is even worse news for the candidate himself .
If he is no longer making fun of himself , because he is too busy proving to the nation that he is a serious commander - in - chief - in - waiting and if his followers regard humour as apostasy , then the man is in danger of becoming an icon on a pedestal .
And we know what happens to them .
Voters , especially in this country , like to imagine that they can have a beer with their President , even though any attempts to do so will probably result in a half nelson from the secret service .
Al Gore failed to pass that test .
So did John Kerry .
And although Obama is really quite down to earth and millions of Americans would love to sit down with him for a drink and a chat , they might be too awestruck and hamstrung to think of anything to say , for fear of sounding crass , offensive or stupid .
Policies apart , therein lies a danger .
If unchecked it breeds a resentment that could express itself in the privacy of the ballot booth with a vote for the grumpy old maverick who looks as if he would be happy to down vodka shots with you , even if his doctors did not allow it .

Analysis
The story is that the world is heating up - fast .
Prominent people at NASA warn us that unless we change our carbon producing ways , civilisation as we know it will come to an end .
At the same time , there are new scientific studies showing that the earth is in a 20 year long cooling period .
Which view is correct ?
Temperature data should be simple enough to record and analyze .
We all know how to read a thermometer - it is not rocket science .
Previously we looked at how US temperature data sets have been adjusted - with more recent versions of historical data sets showing a steeper rise in temperature than they used to .
Here , we 'll be looking at current NASA data and why their temperature maps appear hot -red , even when others are cool - blue .
To recap the earlier article , the graph below shows additional adjustments to the data set since the big " correction " in 2000 .
We observe that the data has been consistently adjusted towards a bias of greater warming .
The years prior to the 1970s have again been adjusted to lower temperatures , and recent years have been adjusted towards higher temperatures .
NASA 's published data is largely based on data from the US Historical Climatology Network ( USHCN ) , which derives its data from thermometer readings across the country .
According to USHCN literature , the raw temperature data is adjusted to compensate for geographical movements in the weather stations , changes in the 24 - hour start / end times when the readings are taken , and other factors .
USHCN is directly affiliated with the Oak Ridge National Laboratories ' Carbon Dioxide Information Analysis Center , an organisation which exists primarily to promote the idea of a link between CO2 and climate .
The map below shows what the raw unadjusted USHCN temperature trends for the US in the 20th century looked like .
20th century temperature trends - USHCN raw data ( lots of blue )
Prior to any adjustments , more than half the US shows declining temperatures over the 20th century - blue and green colors - i.e. the US is cooling down .
However , subsequent to the adjustments the country goes dominantly warmer ( red and yellow ) - as seen in the image below .
20th Century temperature trends - USHCN raw data ( lots of red )
Below is a video showing the USHCN adjustments in action .
Divergence
So how does NASA 's data compare with other temperature sources ?
As we explained in our earlier article , NASA data is derived from a grid of ground - based thermometers .
During the last thirty years , we also have the benefit of more sophisticated technology - satellites which can indirectly record temperatures across most of the planet .
The satellite data is from Remote Sensing Systems ( RSS ) and the University of Alabama at Huntsville ( UAH ) .
In 1998 ( left side of the graph below ) NASA and the satellite data sources RSS and UAH all agreed quite closely - within one - tenth of a degree .
Ten years later - in March 2008 - NASA is reporting temperature anomalies more than 0.5 degrees warmer than UAH .
The divergence between NASA and UAH has increased at a rate of 0.13 degrees per decade ( red lines below . )
In contrast , RSS has converged with UAH over the period and is now within 0.02 degrees ( blue lines below . )
Differences between reported temperature anomalies , NASA , RSS and UAH - with UAH as the baseline .
Lost Continents
The divergence is now quite striking .
Looking closer at March 2008 , NASA 's data shows the month as the third warmest on record .
In sharp contrast , UAH and RSS satellite data showed March as the second coldest on record in the southern hemisphere , and just barely above average for the whole planet .
How could such a large discrepancy occur ?

Discrimination against British servicemen and women wearing their uniform in public will become a criminal offence under Government proposals outlined yesterday .
Courts will impose tougher punishments on anyone who assaults or threatens a serviceman wearing the Queen 's uniform - targeting them will be an " aggravating factor " in sentencing .
Other measures designed to boost recognition and respect for the forces include more homecoming parades for units returning from war and a drive to encourage thousands more school pupils to train as military cadets .
Scroll down for more ...
There will also be a new National Armed Forces and Veterans Day from June next year , although ministers have yet to decide if it will be a bank holiday .
All 175,000 servicemen and women will be encouraged to wear their uniforms in public to boost the visibility of our shrinking forces .
The plans follow a study into The National Recognition of our Armed Forces , carried out at Gordon Brown 's request by former Tory MP Quentin Davies .
It comes amid growing concern over the lack of public understanding or support for the military after years of controversial wars abroad .
Last year , the head of the Army , General Sir Richard Dannatt , warned that a lack of public appreciation risked sapping the willingness of troops to serve in war zones .
The report cites examples of negative attitudes to troops in uniform , including an Army officer who was refused entry to Harrods when he arrived in uniform after a Remembrance Day ceremony .
Troops returning from Afghanistan have been told to change into civilian clothes before landing at Birmingham Airport .
In Peterborough , RAF personnel were banned from wearing uniform in the town after incidents of verbal abuse .
The report says this contrasts sharply with attitudes in the U.S. and Canada , " where members of the public greet returning troops warmly and appreciatively . "
It calls for legislation making it an offence for public services or private companies to discriminate against anyone in military uniform - putting such treatment on a legal par with racial or sexual discrimination .
Armed Forces Minister Bob Ainsworth said such cases were " totally and utterly unacceptable " .
The report also calls for a major expansion in cadet organisations .
It says the social benefits of " team effort , purposeful endeavour and meeting physical challenges " go far beyond military training , with cadets much less likely to commit crimes as teenagers or later in life .
Scroll down for more ...
The move will be controversial , however , particularly as young cadets receive weapons training .
Christine Blower , acting general secretary of the National Union of Teachers , called for " a protocol " to limit Defence Ministry involvement in schools .
She said youngsters " with limited job prospects " were being targeted for military careers .
Liberal Democrat spokesman Nick Harvey said : " Many of these proposals are good common sense and should be welcomed .
Scroll down for more ...
" But we must never let pageantry obscure the hard facts about the way the Government treats our Armed Forces .
" An Armed Forces Day will ring hollow for forces families who still have to put up with sub- standard housing . "
A day for heroes : Call up the cadets
From next year a special day will be earmarked to recognise servicemen and women and veterans .
It will be a focus for open days and special parades .
It is likely to be the last Saturday in June , unless ministers agree to a new bank holiday - in which case it would be the last Friday or Monday .
Troops in the parades will have another day off in lieu .
In addition , every unit or ship returning from combat will have a chance to stage a homecoming parade , with local authorities laying on a reception for troops and their families .
Such parades have become increasingly popular but the practice is patchy , often depending on individual officers or local councillors .
Medal ceremonies could also be held publicly , rather than inside camps .
Only 130,000 schoolchildren - one in 50 - are part of cadet groups , either in the Combined Cadet Force at school or the Sea Cadets , Army Cadet Force or Air Training Corps outside .
Just 260 of the 6,400 secondary schools have CCF units , almost all of them grammar or private schools .
Ministers want to do " everything possible " to encourage more comprehensives and city academies to join up .
Cadets receive adventure training , basic drill and weapons training and education about the armed forces , learning key skills such as teamwork and physical fitness .
Youngsters will also be taught about the role and work of the military as a compulsory part of the national curriculum .

Polite Fascism Contracts The Right To Vote
They wear their robes but leave the hoods off , the polite justices of the Supreme Court .
They write decisions then issue them in a formal setting , behind the columns of a capitol monument , with a history that confers a dignity not deserved .
The Court embodies the dilemma of our modern culture .
The most awful acts are committed with bland justification by polite people who hide behind institutional trappings ; for the sake of the few , at the expense of the many .
When a vital right is denied to any group or class of citizens , the people suffer a great loss .
They must endure mean spirited laws put forward as rational policy then contend with the dual reality of apparently legitimate institutions conducting blatantly illegitimate attacks on the people .
Brutal bigots and snarling attack dogs have been replaced with somnolent justices affirming the outrages of smiling politicians and the bureaucrats who follow their orders .
The net result is the quiet evisceration of our most important rights in a manner that puts the people into a light trance of continual acceptance .
The struggle for voting rights in the 1960 's represents one of the finest periods in our nation 's history .
There was a rapid awakening to the decades of harsh reality endured by black citizens in the South .
Most startling to the majority , unaware of this culture of injustice , was the near total absence of the right to vote for black citizens .
The issue of voting rights was and is fundamental to our political consciousness .
The blatant violation of those rights , the effort to keep almost all black citizens from voting , created a national outrage .
Unaffordable poll taxes just to vote , " literacy " tests arbitrarily administered to fail members of one race only , frequent intimidation at the polls , and the other flagrant indignities provided an immediate education to those who read , watched and listened .
This generated broad support for voting rights legislation to expand the franchise to all citizens .
Most of those who had the rights were unable to tolerate the outrages they saw inflicted on their fellow citizens .
Those who endured the violations laid down their bodies ; risked and gave their lives .
They would no longer tolerate the attack on their very existence as men and women of equal stature from those who abused them .
March on Washington for civil rights , 1963 .

The Voting Rights Act of 1965 passed with overwhelming majorities in the U.S. Senate and the House of Representatives .
It was sponsored in the Senate by the Republican leader , and was implemented with a certainty and clarity that shocked the perpetrators of a fraudulent election system .
Voting rights did not confer the benefits of social justice .
However , those rights did move to correct a key systemic inequality of political participation .
We were awake as a nation for a brief period , unified in the demand for the right to vote .
The struggle to expand the franchise has been ongoing throughout our history from white male property owners to all white males .
For a period after the Civil War , both black and white males voted until white supremacy regained control in the old South .
The women 's suffrage movement was the last major expansion of the franchise before the great civil rights movement of the 1960's and beyond which demanded voting rights for blacks and then Latinos .
A new trend has emerged , one that takes the nation back to the post -Reconstruction period of the 1880's when black citizens lost their recently gained right to vote and participate in civic life .
Contracting the Vote
The April 28 , 2008 decision upholding Indiana 's photographic identification ( photo ID ) law by the Supreme Court of the United States is a major blow to voting rights .
Bush versus Gore dissenter , Justice John Paul Stevens , spoke for the majority .
In Crawford et al. versus the Marion County Board of Elections et. al. , the Court decided that Indiana 's law was constitutional since it represents what may be a valid concern by the state , even though Stevens ' acknowledged that Indiana presented no evidence of in - person “ voter fraud ” , the alleged “ threat ” that made the law necessary .
Justice Stevens and the majority failed to consider that the Indiana law was passed on a straight party - line vote with only Republican legislators supporting it and all Democrats opposing .
Why was it a party line vote ?
Like many other voter identification laws , Indiana 's version is clearly biased against potential Democratic voters and constituencies .
The Court majority was unimpressed by the fact that many voters wo n't have a photographic identification , according to a number of studies .
The Court ignored a recent study showing Indiana 's law will restrict the vote and that photo identification requirements are associated with 10 % less turnout than is seen with less restrictive verifications .
Indiana 's Voter Identification Law
The Court decision allows the Indiana law to stay in place .
In order to vote , the law requires that registered voters present a current state or federal identification with a photograph that bears a name matching the voter 's name on the registration records .
Indiana is one of the seven states requiring photographic identification ( photo ID ) .
The other states are Florida , Georgia , Hawaii , Indiana , Louisiana , Michigan , and South Dakota .
Voters who show up in person without a photo ID are offered a provisional ballot .
The voter must return to the election board by noon ten days after the election with proof of identification , i.e. , photo ID .
Failing that , the voter must sign an affidavit asserting that either he or she can't afford the identification or has a religious objection to being photographed .
If there is no other challenge , the vote is counted .
Sound complicated ?
How many would go through all these steps to cast a ballot ?
Why should anyone be required to do so ?
You do n't need a photo ID at if you vote by absentee - by - mail ( 11 % of Indiana voters used absentee - by - mail or in - person in the 2008 Indiana presidential primary ) .
In addition , if you ’re confined to your home or a facility for medical reasons or if you have a disability and ca n’t get to your precinct , a member of the state “ travel board ” will bring you a ballot and take your vote .
There is no requirement for photo ID in either of these instances .
The False Alarm of Voter Fraud Used to Restrict the Vote
Voter fraud refers to in - person voting by individuals unqualified to vote .
The alleged phenomenon of " voter fraud ' is the justification for restrictive voter identification laws like Indiana's .
Voter identification laws specify the identification that voters present before they 're allowed to cast a ballot .
Supposedly , tight voter identification laws reduce voter fraud .
Of course , if there is no voter fraud to speak of , there 's no legitimate justification to risk the right to vote by restrictive identification laws .
Voter fraud differs from election fraud , which refers to the wholesale theft of elections through manipulation of voting and tabulating machines , gerrymandering ( the distortions of districts to secure elections ) , and other methods of rigging an entire election .
The Bush Justice Department made a major effort to document an epidemic of voter fraud .
The U.S. Attorneys had extensive training and intense encouragement to make cases .
The failed results of this effort are well documented and apparent from the total convictions displayed in the chart below .
The political manipulations behind this effort were one of the causes of the U.S. Attorney 's scandal .
Does voter fraud happen at any degree of frequency ?
Are there hordes of unqualified voters who manage to vote illegally without detection ?
From The Politics of Voter Fraud , L.C. Minnite ( p. 9 )
Federal statistics show hardly any voter fraud prosecutions by the Department of Justice .
Where 's the epidemic of voter fraud or even a significant problem ?
This evidence should be definitive .
Only 38 cases of voter fraud were prosecuted from October 2002 through September 2005 .
Fourteen cases were dismissed and 24 resulted in guilty pleas or convictions .
There were 120 million voters casting ballots in the 2004 election .
Add the total number of voters in all the other federal elections between October 2002 and September 2005 .
The total prosecutable cases of voter fraud that the U.S. Department of Justice could find consisted of 38 charged and 24 convicted .
There is no epidemic of voter fraud .
It is imperative that we understand that the voter fraud epidemic is a pure fabrication and fantasy .
Since voter fraud barely exists , there is no rationale for tightening voter identification requirements .
Given the real risk of reducing turnout there is every reason to avoid any additional laws that inhibit voters and voting .
Yet twenty - five states have significant voter identification requirements , including seven that mandate official photo identification .
The Court gave a green light to all states to create meaningless identification requirements if it serves the majority interests in state legislatures .
Photo ID 's as an Effective Barrier to Voting
A statewide survey of 1,000 registered voters was conducted in Indiana in 2007 by the Institute for the Study of Ethnicity and Race , University of Washington .
The study measured the impact of Indiana 's new voter identification requirement , the law upheld by the Supreme Court .
The highly pertinent results below show the clear bias of the law :
Data from Tables 1.1 , 1.1.b , and 2.1 ( pp. 18-19 )
Six percent fewer black registered voters reported sufficient voter identification for Indiana elections .
Of the general population , a pool for new voters , nearly 12 % fewer black citizens have sufficient identification .
In addition , the Indiana study found that 21 % of registered voters without a high school diploma lacked sufficient identification to vote while 11.5 % with a college diploma lacked sufficient identification .
Most pertinent to the 2008 presidential election , the study confirmed the political bias of the Indiana voter identification law .
The study concluded :
" Among registered voters with valid ID , 41.6 % consider themselves Republican8 and 32.5 % are Democrats .
In contrast , among registered voters without proper ID , 34.8 % are Republican and 38.0 % are Democrats .
Beyond the exclusion of certain demographic groups outlined above , this data suggests that a greater number of Democrats are excluded from voting under Indiana ’s voter identification laws . ( p. 12 ) .
A major study on the impact of voter identification was conducted by scholars at Rutgers University and the Moritz School of Law , Ohio State University .
The authors analyzed 2004 election data from around the country .
Turnout in states with photo ID requirements was 58.1 % compared with 64.2 % in states that required voters to give their name as the main requirement ( Rutgers , 2006 ) .
That 's 10 % lower turnout associated with a photo identification requirement .
Summary data from Rutgers Study ( p. 6 )
In 2004 , turnout was 10 % higher in states where voter identification
involved stating one 's name than in states where a photo ID was required .
The researchers backed out states with photo ID requirements and found that Latino and black turnout was down disproportionately in states with another intensive identification requirement , signing an affidavit stating that you are the voter that you claim to be ( Rutgers , p. 11 ) .
A recent study on Georgia 's voter identification law was conducted by scholars at the University of Georgia , Athens .
They looked at the most common voter identification , a driver 's license .
Race and age ( being black , being young ) were associated with the absence of a driver 's license .
Blacks had a much higher probability than whites of lacking a driver 's license .
Registrants without drivers ' licenses were 50 % less likely to vote in a general election .
Those without photo ID were significantly more likely to vote in Democratic rather than Republican primaries .
These findings show the highly partisan impact of the requirement for photographic voter identification .
This evidence is clear .
Voter ID laws have a negative effect on minorities and , it appears , younger and less educated voters as well .
The requirement reduces turnout and , by doing so , it reduces the right of citizens to vote , all to prevent a non existent crime .
Partisan Evidence , Partisan Decision
In deciding for Marion County and the state of Indiana , the majority cited evidence from the federal Election Assistance Commission ( EAC ) .
The politically appointed commission administers the Help America Vote Act ( HAVA ) .
HAVA provides funding and sets standards for the nation 's voting technologies , voter registration databases , and other election systems .
The EAC actively sought to suppress then rewrite two reports it had commissioned that showed voter fraud to be insignificant and found voter intimidation at polling places to be a problem .
The EAC has a troubled record and is a source highly biased in favor of the current administration .
The Court cited the Carter - Baker Commission on Federal Election Reform co-chaired by James A. Baker III , who was the architect of the heavy - handed 2000 Republican effort that forced Bush into the White House .
This effort included delaying tactics like the famous " preppy riot , " and other subterfuges to see that the Florida vote was not verified through a recount .
The Commission also came under harsh criticism for the photo ID recommendation .
This is hardly a serious source unless name - dropping is a criterion .
Most remarkably , the Court admitted that there was very little evidence proving that voter fraud even exists .
In footnote 12 of the Stevens ' opinion , the Court evaluated evidence of voter fraud in Indiana and found no evidence of in - person voter fraud , the entire rationale for the law .
Stevens went looking elsewhere and claimed that " There remains scattered evidence of voter fraud . "
And he found it -- one instance -- in the 2004 Washington gubernatorial race .
Nineteen " ghost voters " were discovered ( based on an oral opinion by a local judge ) and a news report mentioned of one individual attempting in - person voter fraud .
Twenty examples of voter fraud are all the Court could muster to affirm a law that may affect the vote of millions and change elections .
( See comment on footnotes 11 , 12 , and 13 )
" But if a nondiscriminatory law is supported by valid neutral justifications , those justifications should not be disregarded simply because partisan interests may have provided one motivation for the votes of individual legislators . "
Justice John Paul Stevens , Majority Decision , Crawford et al. v. Marion County Election Board et al. , Apr. 28 , 2008
The partisan sources and justifications used to support Judge Stevens ' ruling should not be disregarded either .
The evidence selection process speaks volumes about the Court 's intention to contract rather than expand the franchise
In addition to biased evidence , a most compelling argument for the partisan nature of the decision is found in the Indiana law .
As mentioned , absentee by mail and absentee by hospitalization or due to disability voters do not have to present a photo ID when they vote .
Are absentee and in - person voters at equal risk for committing voter fraud ?
If so , then the Indiana law creates two classes of voters : in - person voters who are subjected to more restrictive voter identification and absentee voters who have less restrictive identification standards .
This is a glaring inconsistency .
It gives an advantage to those who choose to vote absentee .
Is there some reason to believe that this class of voters is inherently more honest than in - person voters ?
If not , using the Court 's own logic , the failure to identify and act on that inconsistency shows a less than serious attitude toward the supposed threat of " voter fraud . "
This decision resurrects a trend in voting rights not seen since the post -Reconstruction era following the Civil War .
During the decade following the Compromise of 1877 , black participation in civic life in the South was reduced to an absolute minimum by deliberate plan .
The plan ’s goal was to severely restrict the voting rights of black citizens .
Resurrecting the " Redeemer " Coalition
The " Compromise of 1877 " settled the protracted dispute over the 1876 presidential election between Democrat Samuel J. Tilden and Republican Rutherford B. Hayes .
Tilden had more popular votes but there was a dispute over the Electoral College count .
A " blue ribbon " commission spent months trying to settle the dispute .
Finally , a " compromise " emerged .
Tilden withdrew his claim on the presidency in return for a promise by Hayes to withdraw federal authority from the South .
This ended the participation of black citizens in elective politics as voters , candidates , and office holders .
During Reconstruction , blacks voted in large numbers , won elective office , and served at all levels of government .
This multi-cultural democracy ended just a few years after the compromise when white domination returned to the South .
The Democratic Party of the South was the political arm of this effort , while the Ku Klux Klan and other groups carried out paramilitary and terror functions ( murder , rape , lynching , etc. ) .
Those participating in the political arm were known as " The Redeemers , " whites who sought “ redemption ” from the difficulty they experienced sharing power with black citizens .
A true moment of redemption for white supremacy came when the Supreme Court of the United States issued the Williams versus Mississippi decision .
This decision allowed other states in the South and elsewhere to adopt the voter suppression provisions of the Mississippi Constitution which were specifically designed to restrict the voting rights of black citizen ’s rights and minimize their participation in civic life .
Plaintiff Williams sought to have his murder conviction overturned because he'd not been tried by a jury of his peers .
A black citizen , Williams pointed out that juries were chosen on the basis of voter rolls .
When they registered to vote , blacks were routinely discriminated against through a variety of means , including the literacy test required to register .
White registrars routinely failed blacks and passed whites regardless of the results .
Williams argued that he had not received a trial by jury of his peers , since black Mississippians were systematically excluded from the jury .
The Court failed to take this obvious fact into account and decided :
[ The Mississippi Constitution and laws ] " … do not on their face discriminate between the races , and it has not been shown that their actual administration was evil ; only that evil was possible under them . "
Williams v. Mississippi , Supreme Court of the U.S. , Apr. 25 , 1898
The justices either did n't know or did n't care that the Mississippi Constitution had been constructed by the Redeemers and others with the specific intent of keeping black voters from voting .
The affirmation of the Mississippi Constitution by the U.S. Supreme Court in Williams was followed by the spread of that document 's deliberately conceived methods of voter suppression and voter disenfranchisement to states throughout the South and the nation .
Poll taxes , literacy tests , and felon disenfranchisement had their origins in this document , one the Court affirmed .
While detached from their historical origins , provisions of the Mississippi Constitution of 1890 are well placed in state constitutions across the country .
A Court and Government against the People
The Court must have known that the millions at risk of losing their voting rights are predominantly black , less educated , and young .
Yet the Court made the most political decision since it held its own " election of nine " in 2000 to give Bush the presidency .
This Court also resurrected a doctrine that discriminates against minority citizens that mirrors the Williams versus Mississippi case of 1898 .
The Court 's majority redeemed the once - vanquished doctrine of restricting and contracting the vote .
This is the Court that allows torture by federal authorities ; sits idly by as habeas corpus is removed from our laws ; allows our votes to be counted in private by partisan corporations ; sanctions illegal wars declared only by the president ; and rarely misses an opportunity to support the interests of large corporations over those of citizens .
Now the Court is collaborating with those who would restrict the vote .
In order to remain connected to reality , it 's time to admit and proclaim the obvious fact -- our country is approaching a lawless state .
The highest court issued a blatantly political decision that denies the vote in a way that places one political party at a significant disadvantage as we approach a presidential election and , more importantly , threatens to disenfranchise millions .
As it did this , the Court denied the most fundamental tenet of our political history -- the right of all citizens to select their representatives .
Today it 's the poor and minorities .
Which segment of the population will be losing its right to vote next ?
How will the people ever fully restore the vanishing right of habeas corpus ( see note ) and other civil liberties ?
How will the movement for social justice ever be revitalized ?
Election fraud has now been expanded in scope to include the nation 's highest court , which has become the enemy of the people .
Justice Stevens should read his own words from his dissent in Bush versus Gore :
" Although we may never know with complete certainty the identity of the winner of this year 's Presidential election , the identity of the loser is perfectly clear .
It is the Nation 's confidence in the judge as an impartial guardian of the rule of law . "

UPDATED 3:35 P.M. : The Christian Science Monitor , which hosted today 's press breakfast with Carly Fiorina , just posted some edited video of the event .
Here 's the link .
-----
When it comes to presidential politics , Barack Obama has all the buzz on the Internet .
He has raised record amounts of money online .
He hired a Facebook co-founder to help leverage social networking for his White House push .
And just today , Nielsen Online declared that the Illinois Democrat had an online " head start " ( PDF download ) on his Republican opponent , John McCain .
Obama drew nearly twice as many blog mentions in June , and his website attracted 2.3 million unique visitors in May , compared with 563,000 for McCain's .
But although McCain admitted to TechCrunch 's Michael Arrington that he was computer illiterate , the Arizona senator has a big name making the case that he's the right choice for the high - tech industry : former Hewlett - Packard Chief Executive Carly Fiorina .
McCain knows the importance of technology to the economy and has an economic plan to encourage the type of innovation the industry thrives on , Fiorina said this morning in Washington , D.C. " That 's why I think he has been so consistently on the side of issues that impact our innovative capability , " she said .
" He has consistently said we should make the R&D tax credit permanent ....
He has consistently said we should ban permanently Internet taxation . "
Fiorina was touting McCain 's new economic program during a breakfast with journalists sponsored by the Christian Science Monitor .
She has become such an ardent and visible supporter of McCain that her name has appeared frequently on the list of McCain 's possible vice presidential choices .
While that may be a long shot given her lack of government experience , others have talked up Fiorina as a potential Commerce secretary should McCain win the presidency .
Reporters could n't let Fiorina go without pressing her on the veep question ...
( CNN ) -- Iran 's United Nations delegation accused the Security Council of " emboldening " an Israeli official into threatening to attack Iran over its nuclear weapons development program , according to Iran 's state - run media .
Israeli Deputy Prime Minister Shaul Mofaz is the country 's main liaison with the United States .
" The Israeli regime has been emboldened due to carelessness and silence of the Security Council , " the delegation said in a letter to U.N. Secretary - General Ban Ki-moon and the U.N. Security Council , the Islamic Republic News Agency reported Saturday .
The letter was a reaction to a story printed Friday by Israel 's largest mass - circulation daily , which quotes Deputy Prime Minister Shaul Mofaz threatening to attack Iran if it continues to develop nuclear weapons .
" The window of opportunity has closed .
The sanctions are not effective , " said Mofaz , who was born in Iran in 1948 .
" There will be no alternative but to attack Iran in order to stop the Iranian nuclear program . "
The tough rhetoric , published in Yediot Ahronot , has political resonance in Israel amid talk that Mofaz has begun jockeying to replace embattled Prime Minister Ehud Olmert as the ruling Kadima Party 's leader and prime minister .
At least one Cabinet member , Defense Minister Ehud Barak , has called for Olmert to step down because of allegations arising from a corruption inquiry .
Do n't Miss Israeli politician threatens Iran with attack over nukes
Mofaz , Israel 's transport and road safety minister , is the main Israeli liaison with the United States on strategic issues , and his views on security have great import .
He is a former defense minister , a former armed forces chief and a member of Israel 's Security Cabinet .
Iran insists that its nuclear program is for peaceful purposes , namely to create energy .
In the past , it has described interactions with the U.N. 's nuclear watchdog as positive .
But the most recent report by International Atomic Energy Agency hints at frustrations from the agency 's investigators , who say Iran is withholding critical information that could determine whether it is trying to make nuclear weapons .
Aside from Israel , Iran 's nuclear program has spurred concerns in the United States and much of the West .
After the IAEA released a similar report in March scrutinizing the program , the U.N. Security Council voted to impose new sanctions on Iran over its nuclear program .
Shortly after last month 's report was released , Ali Larijani , formerly Iran 's top nuclear negotiator , was overwhelmingly elected as parliament speaker -- and immediately warned that Tehran may reconsider cooperating with the IAEA .
Meanwhile , Iran 's ambassador to France , Ali Ahani , said talks are the best way to approach the nuclear program , IRNA reported .
" The only solution to Iran 's nuclear case is negotiation and confidence building , " Ahani told former French envoys at Sorbonne University in Paris .
" We suspended our enrichment activities for two years voluntarily .
We even accepted additional protocol , which authorized IAEA to visit Iran 's nuclear facilities whenever they wanted , " he added , according to IRNA .
" Iran is not seeking an atomic weapon , but it is following its rights as specified in the ( Nuclear ) Non-Proliferation Treaty , " he said .

Fino a quando faceva il comico era divertente .
Poi ha cominciato a esagerare , forse trascinato dalla sua stessa foga , quell ’ardore che mette nei suoi spettacoli e ora nei suoi comizi .
Non credo che tutto quello che dice siano cavolate , non è nella mia natura ; spesso ha delle buone intuizioni , ha il merito di sollevare una discussione su molti problemi che altrimenti rimarrebbero nel silenzio .
Alcune idee sono giuste : è sbagliato il modo di proporle .
Io non credo che sia giusto insultare , sbeffeggiare , snobbare e odiare nessuno .
Nemmeno chi la pensa esattamente al contrario di te .
Grillo riesce a intercettare un malumore diffuso , e lo trasforma in movimento popolare usando un linguaggio volgare ( da volgo , popolo ; ma anche offensivo ) , semplificando e appiattendo la realtà , che è molto più complessa di un “ sono tutti uguali ” e di un “ vaffanculo ” .
Parla di democrazia e libertà di informazione , ma se analizziamo bene il fenomeno Grillo , capiamo come questi due elementi siano alquanto distanti dal personaggio .
Viviamo in una società che ha delle regole e ha previsto dei modi per partecipare alla sua gestione : la politica non è eliminabile , ( purtroppo ) non siamo più ai tempi delle poleis greche dove la democrazia era diretta .
Lì i cittadini erano 10.000 , non milioni e milioni .
Ognuno ha diritto a dire la sua , ci mancherebbe altro , ma non si può pensare che tutti abbiano un ruolo attivo nella determinazione delle scelte per il Paese .
I referendum sono un buono strumento , ma non se ne può fare uno ogni settimana .
Grillo sembra che non abbia idea di come funzionano le istituzioni ; pare tutto un magna - magna all ’italiana maniera , appunto .
Parla di libertà di espressione e di informazione : ma allora perchè rifiuta le interviste ?
Perchè dice che i media non gli danno spazio , quando lui lo rifiuta ?
Per poi lamentarsi ?
Perchè il suo sito è un blog , dove ogni post ha migliaia di commenti e tra i quali ci si perde perchè tutti parlano di tutto tranne che dell ’argomento ?
Non è la forma giusta .
Perchè modera alcuni commenti e non risponde mai ?
Le sue sono idee imposte dall ’alto alle persone che lo seguono : perchè nei suoi post non ci sono mai link a fonti o dati ?
Sono d’accordo sul fatto che i media non ci dicono tutto , ma lui ci dice tutto ?
Nessuno possiede la Verità .
Parliamo delle sue proposte :
Abolizione dell ’
Ordine dei giornalisti : in teoria giusto , ma non credo sia questo il problema dell ’informazione .
L’Ordine è nato per assicurare un minimo di credibilità a chi pubblica notizie .
Negli ultimi anni la spinta di internet si è fatta sempre più forte , i blog e i siti di news sono diffusissimi .
Ma il fatto che tutti possano dire la loro basta a classificare queste opinioni come notizie ?
Secondo me no .
Credo che senza un qualche controllo in ingresso di chi scrive su testate “ ufficiali ” assisteremmo ad un’ulteriore decadimento della qualità dell ’informazione ( anche Mauro la pensa così , lui che giornalista lo è davvero ) .
Si potrebbe parlare a lungo del rapporto tra stampa tradizionale e Internet : ma questo è un altro discorso !
Abolizione dei contributi pubblici all ’editoria : anche qui , in linea di massima è un’idea condivisibile perchè spesso questi aiuti vanno a giornali di partito con poche migliaia di copie vendute , spesso non sono giustificati .
Basta con questa storia che i giornali sono servi ( servi ! che brutta parola ) dei partiti : ricevono i soldi dallo Stato , non dai partiti .
Non è la stessa cosa .
I giornali e le televisioni non dovrebbero avere nei loro consigli di amministrazione politici , banche e imprenditori : questo si , ma i finanziamenti ai giornali non sono il modo peggiore in cui sprechiamo soldi pubblici .
Abolizione della legge Gasparri ( chiamiamola col suo nome per favore , è il Decreto Legislativo 31 luglio 2005 , n. 177 ) vedete che qualcosa di buono la dice ? 🙂
In questo caso sono pienamente d’accordo , credo che la legge sia un disastro soprattutto per la regolazione degli spazi televisivi .
Ma siccome non so , non parlo , non come fanno molti .
Ribadisco : si può essere d’accordo o meno sulle sue proposte , sicuramente ha il merito di creare una discussione .
Ma se la discussione fosse civile sarebbe molto meglio : non sopporto questo qualunquismo becero e volgare , la semplificazione di realtà che sono ben più complesse di quanto Grillo e ognuno di noi possa credere di conoscere .
E’ difficile esprimere il proprio pensiero su un argomento complesso e che può essere visto sotto molti punti di vista come questo ; è difficile concentrare il proprio pensiero in poche righe ( sicuramente avrò dimenticato qualcosa ; posso aver sbagliato qualcosa ; lasciate un commento e ditemi come la pensate ! ) .
E’ difficile farlo in modo pacato e civile : ma è necessario .
Certo , sarebbe più semplice un bel vaffanculo !
For the last few years the message we ’d heard from our relatively liberal media is about how powerful is the U.S. president and how important are leader motives in determining policy outcomes .
Specifically , we ’ve heard that U.S. outcomes are bad because of Bush ’s despicable motives [ added : and incompetence ] —
Bush has personally destroyed Iraq , New Orleans , the global environment , the deficit , oil and food prices , drug prices , the housing market , the mortgage industry , civil rights , and so on .
Odds are we will soon have a president Obama , and with him the outcomes wo n’t be much different – U.S. presidents do n’t control that much after all .
So we will soon hear the media talking a lot more about how limited is presidential power and how important is other context in determining outcomes —
Obama tried but was thwarted by congress , foreigners , interest groups , the weather , complexity , and so on .
Just wait for it .
Added 5 Jun :
We expect media to prefer a Democrat over a Republican president if we think they are more Democratic than Republican , in current political terms .
We need make not reference to US or world public opinion .
In general an ambiguous supporting argument should be read as making the weakest claim necessary to give the desired support – no further disclaimers should be needed .

You may have heard the news that Louisiana 's governor recently signed an " Academic Freedom " bill , the first such bill to pass in a recent string of efforts to allow public school teachers to push non-scientific alternatives to evolution .
( I previously wrote about Missouri 's failed version . )
All of these bills claim to promote academic freedom for public school teachers to teach the Intelligent Design movement 's so - called evidence against evolution .
But the concept of academic freedom in a high school curriculum makes no sense .
In the New Scientist story linked to above , Josh Rosenau of the National Center for Science Education points out that " if you look at the American Association of University Professors ' definition of academic freedom , it refers to the ability to do research and publish . "
The whole point of academic freedom is , like tenure , to protect independent scholars and scientists from having their work suppressed , manipulated , or managed by administrators or other people outside the research community who might want to pressure scholars to alter their conclusions or not research unfavorable topics .
It 's based on the premise that science and scholarship work best when the researchers themselves , as a community , make judgments about the intellectual merit of a scholar 's work .
It 's a way to prevent those with administrative or political power from skewing what is supposed to be disinterested research .
At a healthy research institution , you do n't have the dean telling a psychology professor she can't study relationship health in same - sex couples , or the local mayor pressuring the university to rein in a professor studying the effects of poverty on disease rates in inner-city children .
The point is that nobody decides what a scientist should work on except the scientist himself and that scientist 's peers who review the work .
That 's not to say academic freedom prevents researchers from being wrong or biased , but those errors and biases are supposed to be counteracted by intellectual competition within a community of researchers .
Academic freedom is vital for healthy scholarship , but there are some obvious cases where it does n't apply - most notably in situations where the scholar is not supposed to decide for himself what the content of a research project or lecture should be .
Some ( but by no means all ) government science jobs , for example , are n't meant to be independent research positions , and those scientists do n't have the same freedom to lecture and publish that academic scientists do .
But most obviously , academic freedom does n't apply to anyone , high school teachers or professors , teaching classes whose content is set to meet certain curriculum standards .
A physics professor does not have the freedom to disregard a department - mandated curriculum in a Freshman physics class , and a high school teacher does not have " academic freedom " to set aside a state or school - board mandated science curriculum in favor of that teacher 's favorite topics .
What would be the point of that kind of academic freedom anyway ?
What is it supposed to accomplish ?
Real academic freedom is meant to keep outside pressure from skewing the work of independent researchers , but in a high school class , the teacher is paid to teach what 's expected .
Giving teachers freedom to disregard the established curriculum in required courses serves no purpose except to allow nuts like the cross- burning John Freshwater to preach their crazy ideas to a captive audience of public school children .
So when advocacy groups make the argument that we should give school teachers more academic freedom , we need to ask them just what exactly that academic freedom is supposed to protect - because academic freedom is not a virtue in and of itself .
In just about every case , you 'll find that the real reason for the calls for academic freedom is to permit these teachers to get around the state - mandated curriculum that they are being paid to teach .
The UN wants to investigate torture allegations at the camp
The special rapporteur on torture , Manfred Nowak , said the claims were rumours at this stage , but urged the US to co-operate with an investigation .
He said the UN wants lists of the places of detention and those held .
The comments come five days after the UN accused the US of stalling on their requests to visit Guantanamo Bay .
Investigators have been asking to visit the jail in Cuba to carry out checks into allegations of human rights abuse .
The UN said for over a year there had been no response to its requests , and it would begin an inquiry into alleged abuses with or without US co-operation .
Washington had yet to grant their request , Mr Nowak said .
He told the BBC there were a number of allegations from reliable sources that the US was holding terrorist suspects in secret places of detention , including vessels abroad .
He said that according to the reports , the ships were believed to be in the Indian Ocean .
Mr Nowak said the charges of secret detention camps were very serious , amounting to enforced disappearances .
People can smell thousands — perhaps even millions — of different scents .
Yet scientists know that in the nose , there are only about 400 different types of odor receptors — proteins that capture scented molecules so that smells can be identified .
Thus , there is n’t , obviously , one type of receptor that responds to a rose , while another jumps for jasmine .
So how can we smell so much , with so few types of receptors ?
The answer is that cells mix and match .
Each nerve cell in the nose can sense more than one odor , but picks up the smell to a different degree .
An odor 's unique signature depends on which cells respond to it , and how intensely .
What happens when you inhale a rose is that a group of cells is stimulated , and that group sends a combination of signals to the olfactory bulb — the site at the very front of the brain where smell perception takes place .
This unique combination of signals tells the brain the odor is the smell of a rose .
How the olfactory bulb interprets this signal as the smell of a rose is not well understood , but scientists do have some insights into the process .
For example , many researchers have used brain scans to see what areas of the brain become active after people are exposed to different smells .
It is unclear , however , whether that activation corresponds to recognizing a given smell .
And other factors — for example our past experiences with certain smells , and whether we liked them or were turned off — also play a role in how we perceive them .
In other words , a rose is a rose is a rose , as Gertrude Stein wrote , but not always to our nose .
In January 2002 it was reported on the Irish news that a woman 's body had been found in a rented house in Donnybrook , Dublin .
Her name was Rosemary Toole and , police said , she had been suffering from depression .
Her suicide would probably have gone unreported were it not for the fact that she 'd been spotted at Dublin airport a day earlier , picking up two jolly - seeming Americans at arrivals .
The three of them were then seen drinking Jack Daniels and coke at the Atlantic Coast Hotel in County Mayo .
At one point - other drinkers later testified to the police - Toole stood up to go to the toilet and did a jig at the table .
The next day she was dead and that night the two mysterious Americans , one wearing a dog collar , left Dublin .
The Irish police released the names of their suspects .
They were seeking the arrest and extradition of the Reverend George Exoo and his partner Thomas McGurrin , of Beckley , West Virginia , for the crime of assisting a suicide , which , under Irish law , carries a maximum prison sentence of 14 years .
I telephoned Exoo to ask if I could follow him around .
I imagined myself as being pro-assisted suicide , although I did n't know much about the ins and outs .
But it seemed only fair to let someone kill themselves and have a reverend at their side if that is what they wanted .
The Irish prosecutors struck me as draconian and anachronistic .
I was n't alone in believing this : radio phone - in shows across Ireland were ablaze with callers supporting Toole 's right to kill herself with a reverend at her side .
And so , at dawn on a Monday in 2003 , Exoo and I set off in his clapped - out old Mercedes towards Baltimore ( a five - hour drive ) to visit a new prospective client , Pam Acre , who said she had been suffering from chronic fatigue syndrome since the 70s and was considering killing herself later in the year .
Exoo was paying for the petrol even though he was broke .
He said he asked for donations from his clients but often did n't get them , but he did n't care because this was his calling .
" I 've never done anything as important as this in my ministry , " he told me en route .
" I think it 's the reason I was placed on this planet .
I 'm a midwife to the dying , for those who want to hasten their deaths . "
Exoo was cheerful , quite giggly , a gay , liberal , libertarian Unitarian preacher , cultured , funny , charming .
He said he often carried around a large , gas - filled inflatable alligator to his " exits " in case the police stopped him on the way .
He often used gas as a suicide method .
With the alligator , he could pretend he was a children 's party entertainer .
But lately he had begun phasing the alligator out .
" It made me feel conspicuous , " he said .
" Part of the thing is that I want to not be noticed .
I 'm always careful and I always work quietly , like the Lone Ranger .
I do so generally at night and for the most part I make it look like they just died in their sleep .
I 'll prop a book up on their lap so it looks like they just expired .
But if I 'm carrying a big alligator people are going to notice me . "
" Plus , " I said , " surely the last thing your clients would want to see in the minutes before death is a large inflatable alligator coming through the door . "
" Exactly , " said Exoo .
So that was why he no longer kept an alligator in the boot of his car .
There was something Laurel and Hardy - ish about Exoo .
Earlier he had demonstrated the gas method for me by attaching a hose to the end of a gas tank , but he did something wrong in the preparation and the gas tank practically exploded , shooting the hose across the room and whiplashing his stomach .
We all shrieked .
" Does this happen when you 're helping people ? " I asked , aghast .
" This has never happened before , " Exoo replied , a bit sheepishly .
Acre lived in a decrepit old country cottage in the outskirts of Baltimore .
She looked as crumbling as her house .
She was 59 but she acted 30 years older .
She let us in .
We all sat on her sofa .
" Tell me about your illness , " Exoo asked her .
" This is a difficult disease to cope with , " Acre replied , " because they run all the tests and they come back negative .
Then they decide that ... "
" It 's all in your head , " said George .
" Right , " said Pam .
They smiled at each other .
" They start wanting you to go to psychiatrists , " said Acre .
" But of course that 's totally useless . "
" Sure , " said Exoo , softly .
" Sure . "
Exoo was n't , I noticed to my surprise , saying anything to Acre that might possibly dissuade her from committing suicide .
Instead they talked about the " mechanics of the dying " ( what pills and gas and apparatus Acre would need ) and she seemed delighted to have someone there who did n't question her symptoms or intentions at all .
Then she turned to me .
" I 've learned what I can from this , " she said , indicating her skinny , frail body .
" I do n't judge much of anybody for anything .
Because until you walk in somebody else 's shoes you do not know . "
Exoo told me he drifted into assisting suicides in the early 90s when he was a Unitarian minister in Pittsburgh .
Unitarianism is a middle - class , liberal religion and Pittsburgh is a tough , working - class town , so he did n't have many parishioners .
He would look at his tiny congregation and wonder if he was wasting his life .
One day a parishioner approached him and said , " My husband has got ALS [ amyotrophic lateral sclerosis , a form of motor neurone disease ] and your name has been given to me as someone who might help . "
" It was that vague , " Exoo said .
" But I knew what she meant .
Two weeks later he said to his wife , ' It 's time .
Call George Exoo . ' "
That 's how Exoo found his calling .
He says he has gone on to assist 102 people , including Acre , who killed herself , with Exoo at her side , a few months after our visit .
In early 2004 , Irish police formally instigated extradition proceedings against Exoo .
They asked the FBI to arrest him .
Exoo telephoned me .
Could I come to Seattle ?
He had something he wanted to tell me .
It was all quite cloak and dagger .
I met him in the lobby of a Seattle airport hotel .
There was a slightly weird smile on his face .
" What is it ? " I asked him .
" I 've ordered a magic potion because I certainly do n't intend to travel to Dublin , " he replied .
" So I may be the first right - to - die martyr . "
There was a silence .
Exoo gave me a big , profound look .
I did n't know what to say .
It was a bit of an awkward moment .
" Other than that , " I said , " how are you ? "
" Fine , " he said .
" So , anyway , maybe I should call you over to Beckley for the big event . "
I narrowed my eyes .
He wanted to kill himself and he wanted me on hand to chronicle it .
" I do n't want to , " I said .
He looked a bit disappointed .
Exoo was in Seattle for a private meeting of international right - to - die activists .
The biggest names in the movement were here , such as Derek Humphry , a former British Sunday Times journalist who wrote a bestselling memoir , Jean 's Way , about helping his terminally ill wife commit suicide in 1975 .
Jean 's
Way pretty much began the movement : a network of right - to - die groups inspired by it sprang up across the world in the late 70s .
These activists meet once a year in an anonymous hotel somewhere to discuss advances in suicide technologies .
" It 's very hush - hush , " Exoo said .
" I 'm surprised they 're letting you in . "
The delegates sat around a table in a conference room .
Exoo began by announcing his intention to martyr himself rather than face extradition .
Then he scanned the room .
I think he was expecting an outpouring of shock and sympathy but in fact people seemed much more interested in what method he was intending to use .
" My curiosity is why would you go with a drug approach ? " one delegate asked him , and then the others leaned forward , paying attention .
Exoo 's reply was that , when one uses gas , the person killing themselves often tries to involuntarily remove the apparatus once they 're unconscious , and he has to hold their hands down , and he " did n't want to involve anyone else in my passing " .
He then changed the subject , saying that Toole in Dublin had promised to send him a message from beyond the grave .
The message would somehow take the form of roses .
And she fulfilled the promise the day after she died .
" What happened was Thomas [ Exoo 's partner ] and I flew out the next morning to Amsterdam , " he said , " and a man brushed by us on the street .
He had roses flung over his shoulder .
I 've never seen anybody with so many roses .
There must have been 10 dozen roses !
And Thomas said , ' There she is !
There she is ! ' "
There was a silence .
Then Dr Pieter Admiraal , a pioneering Dutch advocate of euthanasia , coughed grumpily and said , " Oh , dear George .
To meet somebody with roses in the Netherlands is not so extreme because we are growing them to export to the whole world . "
There was laughter from the others .
" And now you are in trouble , " Admiraal added .
" Maybe God can help you . "
" Maybe so , " snapped Exoo .
That evening I approached Admiraal for an interview .
We talked for a while about Exoo 's idealism .
" He 's too good for this world , " Admiraal said .
Then he added , " I 've been observing him for a long time , and I 've asked our psychiatrists to observe him ... "
He paused .
He was obviously weighing up whether to tell me whatever was on his mind .
" He is , " he finally said , " in my opinion , enjoying the death of another person .
And that 's dangerous .
I have the strong impression that he wants to be there and see something dying .
Well , he can not help that .
It 's his character .
It 's a kind of phobia to enjoy death .
And that 's why he says , ' I will commit suicide . '
Because he will want to die at that moment . "
( Later , Admiraal clarified this .
He said he did n't mean Exoo derived psychopathic pleasure from being around death .
Instead , he thought Exoo was too in love with the afterlife .
He believed in it too much and the pleasure he got was from clapping and cheering his clients to this better place . )
I did n't know what to think .
I hoped Admiraal was being overdramatic because I had considered myself pro-assisted suicide , and once your mind is set on something it can be hard to do a 180 - degree turn .
Still , my own doubts had been creeping in .
For instance , I 'd noticed that very few of Exoo 's clients were terminally ill .
Most were depressed or suffering from psychosomatic diseases .
When I asked him about his client list he said , " Many of my colleagues will avoid such persons like the plague but I feel a very strong identity with the story of the good samaritan .
I stop while others walk by and ignore their pleas . "
How , I wondered , did Exoo and his clients find each other ?
After the conference , I visited Humphry , father of the modern right - to - die movement .
He is from Wiltshire but now lives in Oregon .
" Once or twice a week , " Humphry explained , " I get very strange people on the telephone who are anxious to commit suicide because of their depression or sad lives .
When they get your number they want to talk and talk .
And they call again and again .
And they also call all the other right - to - die groups . "
Humphry said that the mainstream right - to - die groups will tell them , " ' We can't help you .
It 's not within our parameters because you are n't terminally ill . '
But they pursue you .
They call and call .
And eventually someone will say , ' George Exoo will probably help you . '
And that gets them off the phone and on to George . "
" Is n't that terrible ? " I asked .
" Oh , yes , " said Humphry .
Three years passed .
Even though the Irish government was pressing the FBI to arrest Exoo , they did n't .
Meanwhile he was travelling around America helping non-terminally ill people die .
In the spring of 2007 a package arrived .
It was a video .
I went into my office , closed the door , put it into the VCR and pressed play .
Exoo 's messy office blurred fuzzily on to the screen .
Then he skulked into shot from behind the camera , looking as if he had been awake for days .
He said , " Now , what I 'm going to do is call my friend Shirley who is out in a western state in a motel . "
And he picked up the phone and dialled and it became obvious what was going to happen .
A woman called Shirley was sitting in a motel room in Arizona waiting for his call .
She had a bottle of poison in front of her and he was going to guide her through her suicide .
He said , " Hey , Shirley .
This is George .
The hour has come that we 've been planning . "
He had n't bugged the phone so I could only hear his end of the conversation .
" I know you 're nervous , " Exoo said .
" You 've never done this before .
But that 's all right .
We 're going to get through this .
It 's time for you to " - he sighed - " drink the potion that 's in front of you .
It 's bitter and horrible tasting so it 's important that you chugalug it right down .
I ask you to raise that glass and I want you to know how honoured I am to be with you at this moment . "
There was a silence of perhaps 10 seconds .
Then Exoo 's voice hardened : " I know it 's bitter .
Just keep drinking .
Put your finger over your nose and get it all down . "
He was talking to Shirley like someone would talk to a child who had disobeyed him .
Then he began to chant a Buddhist chant : " Gate , Gate , Parasamgate ... "
( Gone .
Gone .
Gone completely beyond . )
After five minutes he said , " Shirley ?
Can you hear me ? "
Then he looked into his camera .
He said , " I think I heard the phone drop .
Which would mean she is probably now gone . "
He shrugged slightly .
" And that 's it .
That 's the way it 's done . "
He leaned over and turned off the camera .
Exoo 's irritable attitude towards Shirley was startling but it was n't totally unexpected .
He had , he told me , behaved in a similar manner towards Acre .
She too had prevaricated , and he told her he was n't leaving town until he had " finished " guiding her through her suicide .
I 'm sure Exoo was n't encouraging reluctant clients to kill themselves - I 'm sure the choice was always theirs - but he did seem to speak impatiently at them during apparent moments of hesitation .
In May 2007 Exoo began teaching a friend , Susan ( not her real name ) , the ropes .
He said he needed an assistant in case he was arrested or killed himself .
We arranged to meet at Susan 's house in North Carolina .
I arrived before Exoo .
Susan lived alone , a middle - aged lady with a collection of plastic lizards .
While we waited I asked her how they met .
" I was bitten by a brown recluse spider in 1993 , " she replied .
" It was so painful I wanted to die . "
She said she called the official right - to - die groups , " but they would n't help me . "
" Because you were n't terminally ill ? "
" Yeah , they rejected me , " she said .
" But then somebody said , ' You might want to call George . '
Kind of like under the counter . "
Susan said she would have killed herself with Exoo 's help - he was perfectly willing - but she could n't find anyone to look after her pet snake .
Eventually , they got talking .
If she was n't going to be his client , perhaps she should be his assistant .
Then Exoo arrived .
He had a second job now , buying up houses that had been seized by the banks , and then selling them on for a quick profit , although he had n't managed to sell any yet .
It was oddly nice to see him .
We joked about how he could provide his clients with the full service : he could sell them a house and when the banks foreclosed he could help them kill themselves .
For all the ambiguities , he was fun to be around .
And he was a strange mix , often going to the ends of the Earth to help people in distress , but also getting cross with them if they seemed hesitant about killing themselves .
I said to him , " In the Arizona tape , Shirley said , ' It 's bitter , ' and you snapped , ' Drink it !'
" Absolutely , " he replied .
" Because I 'd been through that argument with her before . "
" She 'd tasted it before ? " I asked .
" Yeah , " he said .
He was getting annoyed with me .
" I 'd been with her twice before in person .
What kind of bull twaddle is that ?
If you 're serious you 're going to drink it and not whine about it ! "
" But this was somebody who did n't know whether to kill themselves , " I said .
" Just drink it , " he said .
" Three or four swallows and you 're going to go to sleep .
Permanently .
In 10 minutes you 'll be off this planet .
Yes , I was probably pressing her to some extent .
But I was pressing her to make up her mind one way or another because I can't go flying across the country week after week and have nothing come of it .
I want her to either go on and live her life , or check out .
But it 's her choice .
It 's not mine . "
We went for lunch .
Susan had told me that morning that her multiple chemical sensitivities ( triggered by the 1993 spider bite ) were so severe there was only one local restaurant she could eat in where the atmosphere did not set off her symptoms .
But we ate in another restaurant - an all - you - can - eat buffet - and she was fine .
She ate all she could .
I began to see Susan as living proof that Exoo really should n't help people like Susan kill themselves .
After lunch I told him about the view - held by some psychologists who had observed him - that he was out of his depth and it was a slippery slope and he should stop .
" And what 's the slippery slope I 'm on ? " he asked sharply .
" Not being able to stop helping people because you see it as your calling and you like to be there at the moment of death because you get something out of it .
And you may consequently be encouraging them towards suicide . "
" Bullshit , " he said .
" It just has n't happened .
Otherwise these people would n't be hanging on for years and years and years . "
And that part seemed to be true : he claimed to have clients who had been prevaricating for years .
Exoo drove off to do some real estate business and I was left alone with Susan .
We sat on her porch .
And she said something extraordinary .
She said that unbeknown to Exoo she had set up her own suicide business and was willing to help practically anyone if the price was right .
" I see this as a business , " she said .
" George sees it as a calling .
There 's a big difference there .
For me it 's no cash , no help . "
She said her price was approximately $ 7,000 .
" You 're bound to get it wrong , are n't you ? " I said .
" And help someone who should n't be helped . "
Susan shrugged .
" Probably , at some point , yes , " she said .
She said Exoo 's worst crime was his financial imprudence : that he 'll help people who can't afford to pay .
" George will get to a point where he 'll run out of money , " she said .
" He wo n't scale down the expensive cuts of meats every night .
He would rather kill himself than economise . "
" He seems quite keen on killing himself , " I said .
" I think he 'll do it soon , " said Susan .
" And that 's why I 've been pressing him to give me a list of his current clients . "
A few weeks passed .
Then I got an early morning call from Susan .
She said the FBI had just arrested Exoo .
His partner McGurrin had woken up to find Exoo and two men standing there .
They said , " We 're putting George in prison until we can take him to Ireland . "
A few weeks after that ( I later learned ) Susan flew to New Zealand to help a depressed , non-terminally ill woman she had met on the internet commit suicide .
The woman had previously asked a mainstream right - to - die group called Dignity NZ to help her , but they had refused .
" I was of the impression that she needed assistance in living rather than advice on how to end her life , " Dignity NZ 's founder , Lesley Martin , later explained to me in an email .
She added , " I imagine you are developing a good understanding of what an absolute mess the euthanasia underground is .
Unfortunately , there are ' gung - ho ' individuals involved [ she meant Susan ] who , in my opinion , treat the matter of assisting someone to die as an exciting relief from the boredom of their own lives and do so completely ill - equipped and dismissive of the responsibility we have of ensuring that people who need mental health assistance receive it , while still working towards humane legislation that addresses the real issues . "
I visited Susan and asked her what had been wrong with the New Zealand woman .
" She had some sort of breathing disorder , " she said , " and the doctors there would n't give her the medication that she needed .
I happened to take the same medication .
I gave her a little bit of mine and she was fine . "
" But you helped her commit suicide , even though you helped her breathe better ? " I asked .
" Yeah , " said Susan .
" Is n't that ironic ? "
" You should n't do it , " I said .
" Somebody 's got to pay the bills so you can have some water in that glass you 're drinking , " she said .
I had agreed to protect Susan 's identity before I knew she was going around the world helping people die for money .
On October 25 2007 a federal judge in Charleston , West Virginia , freed Exoo .
He decreed that because assisted suicide is not a crime in 25 of the 50 states , he could n't allow the Irish prosecutor to try him in Dublin .
I visited Exoo one last time .
I thought there would n't be any more twists and turns in this story about the messy assisted suicide underground , but he offered one .
" You know I provided you with a tape ? "
He meant the Shirley / Arizona telephone tape .
" That was not a real deathing .
I was talking to a dial tone . "
I looked at him askance .
" You 're a very good actor , " I said .
" I wanted to give you an example of how I would work with somebody , " he shrugged .
" And she was the only possibility . "
He explained that Shirley was a real person , and he really had visited her on many occasions , and that she really had prevaricated .
All that was true .
" She really is now dead , " he added , sounding quite triumphant .
He said she killed herself in Kingman , Arizona , while he was in prison .
( The Kingman police later confirmed this . )
I think Exoo was stupid to fake that tape and that someone who helps people decide whether or not to kill themselves should n't play weird games like that .
The things I liked most about Exoo when I first met him six years ago - his libertarian , maverick qualities - are actually the things that are most worrying about him .
· Jon Ronson 's documentary , Reverend Death , is on Channel 4 on May 19 at 10 pm .
What made the Ameritrade data breach particularly memorable was not that 6.3 million customers had their personal info compromised .
No , what made it memorable was that the company had received multiple warnings from IT professionals over more than a year that its database had been compromised -- yet took no action before the bits hit the fan last fall .
And here 's what will make the settlement of a resultant class - action lawsuit memorable , provided a judge overcomes his nausea and eventually blesses the deal :
Of the nearly $ 2 million Ameritrade would pay for its sins , almost all of it would wind up in the pockets of plaintiff 's lawyers .
What would those victimized get ?
A year 's worth of spam blocking service .
David Kravets writes in Wired :
A federal judge on Friday declined to approve a proposed settlement of a class - action representing as many as 6.3 million TD Ameritrade customers whose privacy was breached when hackers stole personal identifying customer information .
U.S. District Judge Vaughn Walker was concerned whether the deal , which gives more than $ 1.8 million in legal fees to the plaintiff 's attorneys , would provide any real benefits to the class of online brokerage customers .
The judge had other concerns as well , including a contention from lead plaintiff Matthew Elvey that he had been coerced into accepting the terms of the deal despite his belief that it was inadequate .
( Elvey elaborates on the weaknesses here . )
Recap : Swimming pools and private - school tuition for the lawyers and their families ; warm bucket of spit for Ameritrade customers whose inboxes ballooned with spam after the dam broke .
Of course , this is pretty much the way things go in class - action lawsuits where the individual members of the class incur damages that are relatively minor and / or difficult to quantify .
But it 's still a less - than - satisfying outcome for those on the receiving end of Ameritrade 's sloppiness and stubborn refusal to listen to what experts were telling them .
And none of this comes as much of a surprise to Josh Fritsch , an IT security veteran who was among those sounding alarms in early 2006 that Ameritrade had a problem .
Fritsch was also among the Ameritrade customers victimized , but not a party to the lawsuit .
" In the end , ( the suit is ) not going to matter much , " Fritsch tells me .
" Any real compensation for carelessness with personal data will never be offered , and the token concessions which are made are basically useless . "
" If Ameritrade were serious about making amends for their error ( and ignoring the error for so long ) they would publicly disclose the full results of their investigation , thus ' proving ' their claim that there was no real problem , " he adds .
" They would also offer a choice of free service from them ( such as free trades ) or free service with a competing broker ( at Ameritrades ' expense ) if the victim elects to find service elsewhere .
This would rebuild trust , prove honesty , and demonstrate a sense of caring for their clients . "
Likelihood of that happening ?
" Do n't hold your breath . "
In today 's earlier list of five extensions you wo n't need in Firefox 3 , we said you wo n't need any special toolbars , third - party apps , Greasemonkey scripts , or extensions to get Firefox to use webapps to open certain types of links .
This means that when you click on an email address that uses the standard mailto : email protocol , Firefox 3 itself can launch Gmail instead of a desktop app .
By default , the Firefox RC 1 only comes with Yahoo Mail as a possible mailto : link handler , which leaves Gmail users out in the cold — unless you know how to set it up by hand .
Here 's how to configure Firefox 3 to use Gmail as your default mailto : application handler .
Advertisement
Ready to set up Gmail ?
Roll up those sleeves .
Open Gmail in Firefox .
In the tab where Gmail is loaded , copy and paste the following snippet of JavaScript into your address bar : javascript:window.navigator.registerProtocolHandler ( " mailto " , " https://mail.google.com/mail/?extsrc=mailto&url=%s " , " GMail " )
If you are a Google Apps user , use this code instead , but replace example.com with your domain name : javascript:window.navigator.registerProtocolHandler ( " mailto " , " https://mail.google.com/a/example.com/mail/?extsrc=mailto&url=%s " , " GMail " ) Firefox 3 will ask permission to add Gmail as default mailto handler .
Click the Add Application button , as shown .

** Updated 5/21 **
If this trick does n't work for you , go into about : config and make sure that network.protocol-handler.external.mailto is set to its default value true .
*** Updated 5/21***
To remove the Gmail handler , in Firefox 's Tools menu , choose Options .
( Mac users , go to the Preferences dialog . )
In the Applications tab , search for mailto .
From the drop - down of mailto handlers , choose Applications Details , as shown .
Here you can select a webapp handler and Remove it using the button .

Trac Installation Guide for 0.11
Trac is written in the Python programming language and needs a database , SQLite , PostgreSQL , or MySQL .
For HTML rendering , Trac uses the Genshi templating system .
What follows are generic instructions for installing and setting up Trac and its requirements .
While you can find instructions for installing Trac on specific systems at TracInstallPlatforms ?
on the main Trac site , please be sure to first read through these general instructions to get a good understanding of the tasks involved .
Short – Install a released version
For the quick install , make sure you have Python - 2.5 , easy_install and SQlite - 3.3.4 installed ( or above ) .
sudo easy_install Trac==0.11
Requirements – also older versions possible
To install Trac , the following software packages must be installed :
Python , version >= 2.3 if using mod_python together with xml - related things , use python - 2.5 .
expat is namespaced there and does not cause apache to crash any more ( see here for details ) .
For RPM - based systems you might also need the python - devel and python - xml packages .
See instructions in TracOnWindows / Python2.5 ?
, version >= 2.3 setuptools , version >= 0.6
, version >= 0.6 Genshi , version >= 0.4.1
, version >= 0.4.1
You also need a database system and the corresponding python drivers for it .
The database can be either SQLite , PostgreSQL or MySQL ( experimental ) .
. optional if some plugins require it : ClearSilver
For SQLite
SQLite , version 3.3.4 and above preferred .
, version 3.3.4 and above preferred .
If not using Python - 2.5 : PySQLite , version 1.x ( for SQLite 2.x ) or version 2.x ( for SQLite 3.x ) , version 2.3.2 preferred .
For details see PySqlite ?
Note :
It appears that PySQLite 2.x is required for Trac 0.9+/SQLite 3.x if you plan to use the ‘ trac - post - commit - hook . py ’ script available from the ‘ contrib ’ section of the source repository .
Note : Users of Mac OS
X please take care ; the Apple - supplied SQLite contains additional code to support file locking on network filesystems like AFP or SMB .
This is not presently ( 3.3.6 ) in the mainline sources , so if you build your own SQLite from source it will not function correctly on such filesystems – typically it gives the error “ database is locked “ .
A patch is available for version 3.3.6 , based on Apple ’s code , otherwise you ’re probably best off using the Apple supplied version ( presently 3.1.3 ) .
For PostgreSQL
PostgreSQL
psycopg2 or pyPgSQL
Warning : PostgreSQL 8.3 uses a strict type checking mechanism .
To use Trac with the 8.3 Version of PostgreSQL , you will need trac - 0.11 or later .
For MySQL
Warning : MySQL support is currently still experimental .
That means it works for some people , but several issues remain , in particular regarding the use of unicode and the key length in the repository cache .
See MySqlDb ? for more detailed information .
MySQL , version 4.1 or later
, version 4.1 or later MySQLdb , version 1.2.1 or later
Optional Requirements
Version Control System
Please note : if using Subversion , Trac must be installed on the same machine .
Remote repositories are currently not supported .
Subversion , version >= 1.0 . ( versions recommended : 1.2.4 , 1.3.2 or 1.4.2 ) and the corresponding Python bindings .
For troubleshooting , check TracSubversion ?
Trac uses the SWIG bindings included in the Subversion distribution , not PySVN ( which is sometimes confused with the standard SWIG bindings ) .
If Subversion was already installed without the SWIG bindings , on Unix you ’ll need to re- configure Subversion and make swig - py , make install - swig - py .
There are pre-compiled bindings available for win32 .
, version >= 1.0 . ( versions recommended : 1.2.4 , 1.3.2 or 1.4.2 ) and the Python bindings .
For troubleshooting , check TracSubversion ?
Support for other version control systems is provided via third - parties .
See PluginList ? and VersioningSystemBackend ?.
Web Server
A CGI - capable web server ( see TracCgi ) , or
a FastCGI - capable web server ( see TracFastCgi ) , or
- capable web server ( see TracFastCgi ) , or Apache with mod_wsgi ( see TracModWSGI ? )
This should work with Apache 1.3 , 2.0 or 2.2 and promises to deliver more performance than using mod_python .
A little less mature than mod_python .
with ( see TracModWSGI ?)
Apache with mod_python 3.1.3 + ( see TracModPython )
When installing mod_python the development versions of Python and Apache are required ( actually the libraries and header files )
with ( see TracModPython )
For those stuck with Apache 1.3 , it is also possible to get Trac working with mod_python 2.7 ( see TracModPython2.7 ? ) .
This guide has n’t been updated since 0.84 , so it may or may not work .
Other Python Utilities
docutils , version >= 0.3.9 for WikiRestructuredText .
, version >= 0.3.9 for WikiRestructuredText .
Pygments for syntax highlighting , also SilverCity and / or Enscript may still be used .
Note that SilverCity 0.9.6 has a bug that breaks Python syntax highlighting in Trac .
Until an update is made available , we recommend using version 0.9.5 .
for syntax highlighting , also and / or may still be used .
pytz to get a complete list of time zones , otherwise Trac will fall back on a shorter list from an internal time zone implementation .
Attention :
The various available versions of these dependencies are not necessarily interchangable , so please pay attention to the version numbers above .
If you are having trouble getting Trac to work please double - check all the dependencies before asking for help on the MailingList ? or IrcChannel ?.
Please refer to the documentation of these packages to find out how they are best installed .
In addition , most of the platform - specific instructions ?
also describe the installation of the dependencies .
Keep in mind however that the information there probably concern older versions of Trac than the one you ’re installing ( there are even some pages that are still talking about Trac 0.8 ! ) .
Installing Trac
One way to install Trac is using setuptools .
With setuptools you can install Trac from the subversion repository ; for example , to install release version 0.11b2 do :
easy_install http://svn.edgewall.org/repos/trac/tags/trac-0.11b2
But of course the python - typical setup at the top of the source directory also works :
$ python ./setup.py install
Note : you ’ll need root permissions or equivalent for this step .
This will byte - compile the python source code and install it as an .egg file or folder in the site - packages directory of your Python installation .
The .egg will also contain all other resources needed by standard Trac , such as htdocs and templates .
The script will also install the trac - admin command - line tool , used to create and maintain project environments , as well as the tracd standalone server .
Advanced Options
To install Trac to a custom location , or find out about other advanced installation options , run :
easy_install -- help
Also see Installing Python Modules for detailed information .
Specifically , you might be interested in :
easy_install -- prefix= / path/to/installdir
or , if installing Trac to a Mac OS X system :
easy_install -- prefix=/usr/ local -- install -dir=/ Library / Python/2.5/site-packages
The above will place your tracd and trac - admin commands into /usr / local / bin and will install the Trac libraries and dependencies into / Library / Python / 2.5 / site - packages , which is Apple ’s preferred location for third - party Python application installations .
Creating a Project Environment
A Trac environment is the backend storage where Trac stores information like wiki pages , tickets , reports , settings , etc .
An environment is basically a directory that contains a human - readable configuration file and various other files and directories .
A new environment is created using trac-admin :
$ trac - admin / path / to / myproject initenv
trac - admin will prompt you for the information it needs to create the environment , such as the name of the project , the type and the path to an existing source code repository , the database connection string , and so on .
If you ’re not sure what to specify for one of these options , just leave it blank to use the default value .
The database connection string in particular will always work as long as you have SQLite installed .
Leaving the path to the source code repository empty will disable any functionality related to version control , but you can always add that back when the basic system is running .
Also note that the values you specify here can be changed later by directly editing the TracIni configuration file .
Note :
The user account under which the web server runs will require write permissions to the environment directory and all the files inside .
On Linux , with the web server running as user apache and group apache , enter :
chown -R apache.apache /path/to/myproject
Running the Standalone Server
After having created a Trac environment , you can easily try the web interface by running the standalone server tracd :
$ tracd -- port 8000 / path/to/myproject
Then , fire up a browser and visit http://localhost:8000/ .
You should get a simple listing of all environments that tracd knows about .
Follow the link to the environment you just created , and you should see Trac in action .
If you only plan on managing a single project with trac you can have the standalone server skip the environment list by starting it like this :
$ tracd -s -- port 8000 / path / to/ myproject
Running Trac on a Web Server
Trac provides three options for connecting to a “ real ” web server : CGI , FastCGI and mod_python .
For decent performance , it is recommended that you use either FastCGI or mod_python .
If you ’re not afraid of running development code , you can also try running Trac on mod_wsgi ?.
This should deliver even better performance than mod_python , but the module is not considered stable just yet .
Configuring Authentication
The process of adding , removing , and configuring user accounts for authentication depends on the specific way you run Trac .
The basic procedure is described in the Adding Authentication section on the TracCgi page .
To learn how to setup authentication for the frontend you ’re using , please refer to one of the following pages :
TracStandalone if you use the standalone server , tracd .
. TracCgi if you use the CGI or FastCGI methods .
TracModPython if you use the mod_python method .
Trac 0.11 & SVN on Mac OS X Leopard ( 10.5 )
TracOnLeopardServer ?
Using Trac
Once you have your Trac site up and running , you should be able to browse your subversion repository , create tickets , view the timeline , etc .
Keep in mind that anonymous ( not logged in ) users can by default access most but not all of the features .
You will need to configure authentication and grant additional permissions to authenticated users to see the full set of features .
Hillary Clinton Murders
March 27 , 2007

Partial List from US Intelligent Agents who will testify with evidence of Hillary and Bill Clinton 's murders .
The Asian Age , a newspaper based here , argued in an editorial last week that Mr. Bush ’s “ ignorance on most matters is widely known and openly acknowledged by his own countrymen , ” and that he must not be allowed to “ get away ” with an effort to “ divert global attention from the truth by passing the buck on to India . ”

The purchases and disposal of food by typical American shoppers have tongues wagging bitterly at Indian research institutes .

The developing nations , and in particular China and India , are being blamed for global problems , including the rising cost of commodities and the increase in greenhouse gas emissions , because they are consuming more goods and fuel than ever before .
But Indians from the prime minister ’s office on down frequently point out that per capita , India uses far lower quantities of commodities and pollutes far less than nations in the West , particularly the United States .
Explaining the food price increases , Indian politicians and academics cite consumption in the United States ; the West ’s diversion of arable land into the production of ethanol and other biofuels ; agricultural subsidies and trade barriers from Washington and the European Union ; and finally the decline in the exchange rate of the dollar .
There may be some foundation to Indians ’ accusations of hypocrisy by the West .
The United States uses  or throws away  3,770 calories a person each day , according to data from the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization collected in 2001 - 3 , compared with 2,440 calories per person in India .
Americans are also the largest per capita consumers in any major economy of the most energy - intensive common food source , beef , the Agriculture Department says .
And the United States and Canada lead the world in oil consumption per person , according to the Energy Information Administration , an Energy Department agency .
When it comes to trade , Western farming subsidies undercut agricultural production in fertile areas of Africa , India ’s commerce minister , Kamal Nath , said in a telephone interview , repeating the point that Americans waste more food than people in many other countries .
We ’re all about choice when it comes to death here on GroovyGreen .
Sure , you do n’t have much say in how you ’ll go , but you can definitely make sure your exit is packaged just right .
Take for instance these eco-friendly custom cardboard coffins from Creative Coffins .
Each one is made from 60 % recycled paper plus wood pulp sourced from sustainable forests , contains only natural starch - based glues ( no screws , bolts , tape , or other fittings ) , handles made from natural woven cotton , and is completely non -toxic .
Better yet , you can have them custom designed — or choose from any number of beautiful designs already on the site .
My favorites are the “ Gone To Seed ” theme or the “ Box of Candy ” design — mainly because it would be really funny to see some kid ’s face if they thought it was a giant box of candy .
Ok , probably not .
Lucky Grills ' escape has been described as " miraculous "
A koala has survived being hit by a car and then dragged for several miles with its head stuck in the vehicle 's front grill , officials in Australia say .
They say the male koala was found with his bottom sticking out of the grill of a woman 's car near Brisbane .
The animal was taken to a wildlife hospital in Queensland where tests showed it was not badly hurt .
The lucky creature - believed to be several years old - was nicknamed Lucky Grills after his ordeal .
The driver said she had noticed a koala on the road but drove on when she failed to see anything in her rear view mirror .
The trapped animal was only spotted when the driver pulled up at a railway station on the outskirts of Brisbane .
" Somehow the force of the impact propelled him through the grill .
That sort of wedged him there .
That is why he did n't come adrift .
The rest of his body was dangling , " spokeswoman Carolyn Beaton of the Australian Wildlife Hospital told the AFP news agency .
She added that " an examination showed that he was in good health and had no serious injuries " .
CBS scrubs a second McCain flub from interview broadcast David Edwards and Nick Juliano
Published : Thursday July 24 , 2008
Print This Email This Update : DNC slams McCain for calling Iraq ' first ' post -9/11 conflict Keeping up with John McCain 's foreign policy gaffes is becoming a cottage industry these days , and a progressive radio host has caught another slip - up from the Republican presidential nominee talking about the war on terror .
And keeping those flubs away from viewers is occupying plenty of network news editors ' time .
Young Turks host Cenk Uygur noticed that his confusion about the timeline of the " surge " in Iraq was n't McCain 's only gaffe in his interview with CBS news this week .
McCain seemed to forget the war in Afghanistan preceded the invasion of Iraq ; either that or he did n't think it was a major conflict .
" The fact is we had four years of failed policy .
...
We were losing the war in Iraq .
The consequences of failure .
The defeat of the United States of America in the first major conflict since 9/11 would have had devastating impacts throughout the region and the world , " McCain told CBS anchor Katie Couric .
" Was Afghanistan not major enough for him ? "
Uygur asks .
Like his previous flub , CBS edited this misstatement from its broadcast .
The full version of the interview , which only aired online , also saw McCain wrongly crediting the surge with sparking the " Anbar Awakening , " in which tribal leaders began to turn against al Qaeda in Iraq .
The Anbar Awakening gaffe was edited out and replaced with McCain 's scurrilous attack accusing Democratic nominee Barack Obama of caring more about winning the election than winning a war .
Crooks & Liars notes that bit of editing violated CBS 's own Standards & Practices because they edited in an answer from an earlier question and changed the meaning of McCain 's statement .
The latest bit of tricky editing does not seem to have changed McCain 's overall meaning , and virtually all interviews are edited before they are broadcast .
It seems the network in this case simply saved McCain from a bit of embarrassment in front of the evening news audience .
Uygur is willing to give McCain the benefit of the doubt in this case , and assumes he does actually know the war in Afghanistan started more than a year before Iraq .
" In all likelihood , this was a simple mental mistake for McCain , among a litany of others recently , " Uygur writes .
" But it does go toward state of mind .
They never saw Afghanistan as a priority . "
The Democratic National Committee was less forgiving toward the GOP nominee .
" It is disappointing that John McCain doesnt recognize that the war in Afghanistan was not only the first major conflict after 9/11 , and is in fact a major front in the fight against terrorism , " DNC spokeswoman Karen Finney said in an e-mail to reporters a few hours after Uygur 's article was posted .
" No wonder John McCain doesnt understand why the American people are looking for new leadership that will bring the war in Iraq to a responsible end so we can direct the resources we need to getting the job done in Afghanistan . "
Uygur posted the following video to YouTube Thursday :
This video is from CBS 's Evening News , broadcast July 22 , 2008 .

A transcript of the exchange follows , with the some parts cut from the CBS broadcast hightlighted : Couric : Senator McCain , Sen. Obama says , while the increased number of U.S. troops contributed to increased security in Iraq , he also credits the Sunni awakening and the Shiite government going after militias .
And says that there might have been improved security even without the surge .
What 's your response to that ?
McCain : [ Sen .
Obama has indicated that by his failure to acknowledge the success of the surge , that he would rather lose a war than lose a campaign .
...]
I do n't know how you respond to something that is such a false depiction of what actually happened .
Colonel McFarlane ( phonetic ) was contacted by one of the major Sunni sheiks .
Because of the surge we were able to go out and protect that sheik and others .
And it began the Anbar awakening .
I mean , that 's just a matter of history .
Thanks to General Petraeus , our leadership , and the sacrifice of brave young Americans .
I mean , to deny that their sacrifice did n't make possible the success of the surge in Iraq , I think , does a great disservice to young men and women who are serving and have sacrificed .
They were out there .
They were protecting these sheiks .
We had the Anbar awakening .
We now have a government that 's effective .
We have a legal system that 's working , although poorly .
And we have progress on all fronts , including an incredible measure of security for the people of Iraq .
There will still be attacks .
Al Qaeda 's not defeated .
But the progress has been immense .
And to not recognize that , and why it happened , and how it happened , I think is really quite a commentary .
Couric : A commentary on what ?
McCain : That Sen. Obama does not understand the challenges we face .
And not understand the need for the surge .
And the fact that he did not understand that , and still denies that it has succeeded , I think the American people will make their judgment ....
Couric : Sen. Obama also told me , Sen. McCain , that the money spent on those additional troops , on the surge , might have been more effective had it gone to Afghanistan or even to a better energy policy in the United States .
What 's your response ?
McCain :
The fact is we had four years of failed policy .
We were losing .
We were losing the war in Iraq .
The consequences of failure and defeat of the United States of America in the first major conflict since 9/11 would have had devastating impacts throughout the region and the world .

From an email from Rep. Robert Wexler 's office :
Judiciary Committee Officially Requests Scott McClellan Testimony for Friday , June 20
Wexler Plans Tough Questions About Possible Obstruction of Justice By Cheney , Rove , and Libby
( Washington , DC ) Today Congressman Robert Wexler ( D - FL ) applauded the decision by Judiciary Committee Chairman John Conyers to invite former White House Press Secretary Scott McClellan to testify under oath about the shocking revelations and possible illegal actions by members of the Bush Administration that he detailed in his book What Happened : Inside the Bush White House and Washington ’s Culture of Deception .
Immediately following the book ’s release , Congressman Wexler called for Congress to investigate the charges made by McClellan regarding the Bush Administration ’s campaign to go to war with Iraq and efforts by Karl Rove and Scooter Libby to possibly obstruct justice during the Valerie Plame matter .
“ The earth - shattering admissions made by Scott McClellan in his new book warrant a sober and thorough hearing in the House Judiciary Committee and he should immediately accept the Committee ’s request for his testimony , ” said Congressman Wexler .
“ The allegations made by McClellan that Karl Rove , Scooter Libby , and possibly even Vice President Dick Cheney , together conspired to obstruct justice by lying about their role in the Plame case relates directly to the core of US executive power and the Constitution .
If true , the allegations made by McClellan could amount to an obstruction of justice charge for Scooter Libby and Karl Rove .
President Bush signed into law Monday a bill that will provide $ 62.5 M for high energy physics .
At Fermilab this morning director Pier Oddone announced the end of plans for involuntary layoffs of some 140 employees at the lab .
Any remaining funds , according to the language of the bill , can be used to support new neutrino research projects ; the Nova experiment was among the casualties of the omnibus appropriations in late December 2007 .
This is fantastic news for Fermilab , where , with the LHC startup imminent , time is running out to make a dramatic new discovery .
The Tevatron is running very well and the experiments are accumulating piles of high quality data .
It 's make - or - break time .
The supplemental bill included $ 162 billion for funding the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq , and $ 3.6 billion of non-war - related funding .
( So , somehow , this post I am writing here is reminding me of an old Monty Python skit , where a newscaster says " And now the news for Wombats .
No wombats were killed today in an accident involving .... " )
The supplemental bill failed to include the $ 160 million US contribution to ITER , and so leaves the US in default on our international agreement .
This will compromise for years to come our ability to participate as a reliable partner in large international scientific projects .
There are " some people so famous , so much the focus of media attention and public conversation , that they cease to be viewed by many as human beings .
Britney has joined them . "
Alastair Campbell 's point applies to anyone who is recognisable to the general public by their first name .
At the time , he was worried that Tony and Cherie had achieved this non -human status .
Now , it applies to Gordon .
The Prime Minister is already into the chicken - house phenomenon , which hit Tony Blair in his eighth year as Prime Minister .
When I worked in a chicken shed , one of our jobs was debeaking the birds , cutting off the tips of their beaks to stop them pecking each other .
If this were n't done often enough , the overcrowded chickens would draw blood – and when a spot of blood showed , the other birds would peck until its guts were spilled .
I thought Blair was looking bloody in 2004 .
I remember Gordon Prentice ( Lab , Troublemaker Central ) asking him in the Commons that October if he could think of " a single dramatic act of renewal that would make the British public sit up and take notice " .
He meant resign , a coded offensiveness that not even Frank Field has yet attempted on Blair 's successor .
In the face of this broiler madness , it was an extraordinary achievement on Blair 's part not only to win the general election – with Gordon Brown 's help , for the benefit of those sour critics who say that Brown has never won a democratic mandate – but to stay on for a further two years after that .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
It must be doubted whether Brown has that sort of regenerative capacity .
Our opinion poll today wo n't help .
It finds that 57 per cent of respondents – and 43 per cent of Labour voters – agree that " the Labour Party has to change leader if it is to have a chance of winning the next election " .
Yet it is worth standing back for a moment to wonder at the ferocity of the contempt that Brown already invites , and which will surely hand the Conservatives this week their first by - election seat won from Labour since Mitcham and Morden in 1982 .
( And that was a special case .
Whenever an MP defects to another party , they are asked , " Why do n't you stand down and fight a by - election in your true colours ? "
To which the honest answer is : " Because of what happened to Bruce Douglas - Mann in Mitcham and Morden . "
He defected to the SDP , did the honourable thing , and lost to Angela Rumbold . )
Plainly , Brown has not performed brilliantly as Prime Minister .
But then , he has not done much wrong either .
He is being compared to Anthony Eden , who made a misjudgement of Suez that served the nation badly and lied about it in the Commons .
Or to John Major , who presided over drift at home and appeasement in the Balkans .
Neither comparison is remotely fair – at least , not yet .
It is true that Blairite ultras , such as me , have long expounded the view , ascribed to Blair by Lord Levy , that Brown could not win against David Cameron .
But I hope that I have always focused on Brown 's judgements rather than his personality .
I have given him credit for the handling of Northern Rock , for example , which Cameron would have done no better .
I feel completely at odds with the air of anger and vindictiveness towards Brown that seems to hang over the voters of Crewe and parts of the media .
The fury over the scrapping of the 10 p tax rate is out of all proportion to the numbers of losers and the amount they have lost .
It was a symbol of other resentments , which is why it was unassuaged – as our poll also finds – by last week 's tax changes , from which 22 million people gain .
The pool of anti-politician sentiment in this country can be both reflected and magnified by the increasingly short - cycle , high - opinionated media .
This is a problem that goes beyond the personality and leadership qualities of Brown .
Although the Brownite ultras were contemptuous at the time , they should have listened more carefully when Blair made a speech criticising the media just before he stood down .
Blair had identified a problem .
It sounded petulant , inevitably , and the analysis was shallow : " Today 's media , more than ever before , hunts in a pack .
In these modes it is like a feral beast , just tearing people and reputations to bits . "
He was also cowardly to name only The Independent as an example , when , as Alastair Campbell confirmed later , the real target was the Daily Mail .
Yet he was on to something , and Brown now finds himself on the receiving end of that very something .
The media - voter feedback loop has become overwhelmingly negative .
The BBC is the measure of this , the weathervane .
It was not just John Humphrys , whose incivility on the Today programme seemed designed ( unsuccessfully ) to provoke the temper that has been written about but never seen in public .
Other , less obviously calculated slights last week included the close - up of Brown 's bitten and ink-stained fingers on the 10 o'clock news , and the shot on Newsnight of the Prime Minister snapping from one fixed grin to another when a producer clapped .
If the BBC is a pointer , pretending not to be in the fight , the real beasts are the newspapers .
Brown faces a toxic combination of Rupert Murdoch and the Mail group , both of whom are playing with him , and The Guardian , whose columnists are bitter at his failure to be Clement Attlee .
The Sun endorsed Boris Johnson for Mayor of London , a trial run for a switch to the Conservatives nationally at some point in the next two years .
Paul Dacre , the editor of the Mail , continues to maintain cordial personal relations with the Prime Minister , but these have decreasingly little effect in restraining the anti-Labour tone of his newspaper .
If Brown is brought down by the frenzied , pecking chickens , how long will the next leader last ?
Brown was given the benefit of the doubt for three months before the beaks started to come for him .
Plainly , some politicians can survive against this relentless media culture longer than others .
Blair , it should be remembered , had a broadly favourable press for eight years ( 1994 to 2002 ) and then survived for another five .
Barack Obama has enjoyed even more extravagantly messianic delusions – not his own , but those projected on him by the media .
But Cameron , or David Miliband , or James Purnell ?
How long would they last ?
As Campbell said of the treatment of Britney , Diana , Madeleine and Beckham : " Perhaps the phenomenon is beyond healing . "
Headlines in Florida , Oklahoma , Tennessee and California are once again telling the tales of adult women arrested for having sexual relations with teenage boys .
Public reaction to such cases is changing , authorities say , and there is an increasing recognition of women as sexual abusers .
Plenty of people still say “ this boy has got it made , ” but now more people are saying “ this is really a problem , ” said Judy Berman , senior manager of the Department of Justice ’s Center for Sex Offender Management , which will soon issue a report on female sex offenders .
Cases now making headlines are reminiscent of Seattle teacher Mary Kay Letourneau , who was 34 and the married mother of four when she started having sex with a 12 - year - old male student .
Letourneau served seven years in prison and has announced plans to marry Vili Fualaau , now 22 , with whom she has had two children .
More recent headlines include Florida teacher Debra LaFave , 23 ; Oklahoma basketball coach Elisa Nielson , 29 ; Tennessee physical - education teacher Pamela Turner , 27 ; and California teacher trainee Margaret De Barraicua , 30 .
Each of the four was charged with sexual assault of a male student aged between 12 and 16 .
Police say Mrs. De Barraicua was arrested in the act , in her car , while her toddler son sat inside in his car seat .
On March 2 , police in Braxton County , W.Va. , arrested Toni Lynn Woods , a 37 - year - old middle - school teacher , and charged her with having sexual relations with five students younger than 16 .
The number of female inmates doing time for sex offenses has doubled in recent years :
In 1991 , there were 647 women in prison for rape and other sexual offenses ; in 2002 , there were 1,300 female sex offenders , according to prisoner reports collected by the Department of Justice ’s Bureau of Justice Statistics .
However , sex offenders remain a small percentage of female inmates .
“ We do n’t really think there are more sex offenders .
We think the reporting has gotten better , ” said Allison Taylor , executive director of Texas ’ Council on Sex Offender Treatment .
What kind of woman seeks sex with teenage boys ?
In the past , researchers have relied on four concepts : “ Boundary crossers ” who seek affirmation , affection or something else from a vulnerable partner ; women who are emotionally disturbed or mentally ill ; women who are predatory pedophiles ; and women who are committing sexual offenses at the behest of someone else , usually an adult male .
Much more research is needed , “ as many women wo n’t fit into those categories , ” Ms. Berman said .
Author and sex counselor Douglas Weiss sees adult women who seek sex from teenage boys as pedophiles .
As with males , female pedophiles feel ill - equipped for intimate relationships with other adults , “ so they begin to sexualize younger people ” — especially students or children in their care who are unlikely to reject them or control them , said Mr. Weiss , who is executive director of Heart to Heart Counseling Centers in Colorado Springs .
These women have a “ grooming ” process for their young victims — they pick vulnerable boys and “ befriend them , stroke their hair , touch their body , affirm them , ” said Mr. Weiss , who has written a book , “ She Has a Secret : Understanding Female Sexual Addiction . ”
Boys are harmed by such crimes because “ what they ’ve learned is that sex is not about love , it ’s not about relationships , it ’s not about spiritual or emotional connections ; it ’s about two bodies being crammed together as objects , ” he said .
Such acts do n’t make a boy feel “ lucky , ” said Mr. Weiss , who said he had been sexually victimized as a minor .
“ You usually feel guilt and shame and awkwardness afterwards .
And you feel more alone than before because you did n’t connect to the person .
It was just an act . ”
American culture , laws , policies and public opinion seldom consider women as sexual predators or teenage boys as victims .
“ The words ‘ sexual assault ’ and ‘ sexual aggression ’ tend to conjure up an image of a male perpetrator and a female victim , ” Myriam S. Denov wrote in the Journal of Sex Research in 2003 .
Many state laws still assume that sex perpetrators are men , which makes it hard to prosecute women for rape or other sexual crimes .
Lawmakers have now begun to recast sex - crimes laws in neutral terms .
But public opinion about sex between older women and teenage boys still reflects the views of 1940s sex researcher Alfred C. Kinsey , who believed , in the words of one former assistant , “ that some child - adult contacts were not harmful and possibly even beneficial . ”
“ Unfortunately , in our society there has long been the myth that boys enjoy sex and they would be crazy not to accept it from anywhere they can get it , ” said Maria Molett , executive director of the Counseling Institute of Texas .
Female sexual deviancy is just as real and damaging as male sexual deviancy , said Ms. Molett , recalling how one of her clients — an ex-teacher — had convinced herself that the teenage boy she assaulted loved her .
“ It took me quite a few years to get her to recognize that this child was not in love with her , did not want to marry her and , in fact , was extremely traumatized by her and even tried to kill himself , ” she said .

A new study from the University of Washington suggests that media industry trade groups are using flawed tactics in their investigations of users who violate copyrights on peer - to - peer file sharing networks .
Those trade groups , including the Motion Picture Association of America ( M.P.A.A. ) Entertainment Software Association ( E.S.A. ) and Recording Industry Association of America ( R.I.A.A. ) , send universities and other network operators an increasing number of takedown notices each year , asserting that their intellectual property rights have been violated under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act .
Many universities pass those letters directly on to students without questioning the veracity of the allegations .
The R.I.A.A. in particular follows up some of those notices by threatening legal action and forcing reported file - sharers into a financial settlement .
But the study , released Thursday by Tadayoshi Kohno , an assistant professor , Michael Piatek a graduate student , and Arvind Krishnamurthy , a research assistant professor , all at the University of Washington , argues that perhaps those takedown notices should be viewed more skeptically .
The paper finds that there is a serious flaw in how these trade groups finger reported file - sharers .
It also suggests that some people might be getting improperly accused of sharing copyrighted content , and could even be purposely framed by other users .
In two separate studies in August 2007 and May of this year , the researchers set out to examine who was participating in BitTorrent file - sharing networks and what they were sharing .
The researchers introduced software agents into these networks to monitor their traffic .
Even though those software agents did not download any files , the researchers say they received more than 400 take - down requests accusing them of participating in the downloads .
The researchers concluded that enforcement agencies are looking only at I.P. addresses of participants on these peer - to - peer networks , and not what files are actually downloaded or uploaded — a more resource - intensive process that would nevertheless yield more conclusive information .
In their report , the researchers also demonstrate a way to manipulate I.P. addresses so that another user appears responsible for the file - sharing .
An inanimate object could also get the blame .
The researchers rigged the software agents to implicate three laserjet printers , which were then accused in takedown letters by the M.P.A.A. of downloading copies of “ Iron Man ” and the latest Indiana Jones film .
“ Because current enforcement techniques are weak , it is possible that anyone , regardless of sharing content or using BitTorrent , could get a D.M.C.A. takedown notice claiming they were committing copyright infringement , ” said Mr. Piatek .
In their paper , the researchers argue for greater transparency and public review of Big Media ’s intellectual property enforcement actions .
“ Our study scientifically shows that flaws exists , ” said Mr. Kohno , an assistant professor in the university ’s Computer Science and Engineering department .
“ It ’s impossible to prove that other flaws do n’t exist , especially since current industry practices are so shrouded in mystery .
Ultimately , we think that our results should provide a wake - up call for more openness on the parts of content enforcers . ”
A man puts his laundry into a washing machine , part of an art istallation in Berlin 's city center , in a file photo .

LONDON ( Reuters ) - A washing machine using as little as a cup of water for each washing cycle could go on sale to environmentally conscious Britons next year .
Xeros Ltd , which has been spun out of the University of Leeds to commercialize the technology , said on Monday the new machines would use less than 2 percent of the water and energy of a conventional washing machine .
Plastic chips are used to remove dirt and stains from clothes , leaving them dry and reducing energy consumption as there is no need to use a dryer after the washing cycle , Xeros said in a statement .
The firm , which recently secured investment of almost 500,000 pounds ( $ 984,400 ) from IP Group Plc , told Reuters the price of the new machines was “ not expected to be dramatically different from ( conventional ) washing machines . ”
Washing machine usage has risen by 23 percent in the past 15 years .
The average UK household uses almost 21 liters of water daily on clothes washing , 13 percent of daily household water consumption , according to Waterwise , a non-government organization focused on decreasing water wastage in Britain .
A typical washing machine uses about 35 kilograms of water for every kilogram of clothes , in addition to the power needed to heat the water and dry the clothes
There are more than two million washing machines sold in Britain annually , with a value of about 1 billion pounds , Xeros said .

Reese hotly contends that no job shortage exists for Cisco professionals and has evidence that some behind - the - scenes funny business takes place that actually keeps Cisco pros from finding new jobs .
Brad also offered some sure - fire methods for any network pro to find employment nirvana .
Brad_Reese : Hi everyone .
Moderator - Julie :
While we are waiting for questions to come in , here 's a pre-submitted question :
Do employers really understand the difference between a qualified network design engineer or architect and a CCIE ?
Some people have both , but many are not good engineers .
Brad_Reese : I think employers understand what they need , but it is rare for one person to possess aptitude in both requirements .
Being able to translate business requirements into technology is what Cisco itself is constantly trying to master .
So how can a single person be expected to do it ?
A jack of all trades and master of none so to speak ( like yours truly ! ) .
joey :
How is the industry implementing Cisco network access control ?
What is your opinion for the future of Cisco NAC in the data center or enterprise ?
Brad_Reese : Most experts have told me that Cisco has been a failure in NAC , do you agree ?
servergirl : I have been working in networking for a couple of years now .
But my role and company IT structure limits me to local LAN technologies .
I do not have the opportunity to get hands - on experience with WAN or firewall technologies .
As I look at job opportunities online , pretty much every posting requires good experience with everything under the sun .
So even though I have gotten my foot in the door of networking , I still feel stuck .
How do I overcome the experience requirements gap ?
( FYI , I do have my CCNA , and am currently working on my CCNP . )
Brad_Reese :
This question is my cup of tea indeed .
Upload your CV / Resume to BradReese.com and clearly state on your CV the technologies that you are interested in pursuing and whether you will relocate to pursue job opportunities that match your interest .
Do n't be shy about letting prospective employers know where your technology interests are at heart .
greenie :
What do you recommend for a MCSE and MCSA person that has the CCNA and wants to move into more Cisco certification .
What will be best area to study to give me a leg up for future jobs ?
I am presently studying for the CCNP .
Brad_Reese : Pick the technology area that interests you the most .
If VoIP bores you then do n't pursue it .
Do n't chase money .
The money will chase you if you 're very good at what you do .
So when a technology area is becoming " hot " look into it .
But if the technology bores you and / or does not get you excited , do n't pursue it .
Stick to what gets your blood boiling , to what makes you excited about getting up everyday !
doordie : Brad , I 'm curious .
Have you noticed any trends in the resumes posted on BradReese.com ?
By trends , I mean the types of skills people bring to the table or the types of goals / jobs they 're looking to find , as well as demographics -- age , etc .
Brad_Reese : Doordie , I see that worldwide Cisco Certs RULE !
Cisco Certified Network Engineers need to let the world know that YOU are available and what your career goals are .
That way employers will CONTACT YOU .
Most of the trend that yours truly is seeing is that Cisco Certified Network Engineers are looking for new challenges .
And unfortunately , Cisco is trying to keep those individuals with their current employers and NOT facilitating new opportunities for those engineers with other Cisco channel partners or even Cisco customers !
jrensink78 : Are you seeing a current Cisco skills shortage in the industry as some have mentioned ?
How do you see the 5 - 10 year future of the networking job industry shaping up ?
Brad_Reese : No , I see Cisco manufacturing the " image " that there is a skills shortage !
Bobcert :
On the subject of shortage of skills ( or not ) , we are seeing lots of open opportunities in the market not being filled .
In your opinion what is the reason ?
Is it not because there is not enough qualified professionals out there ?
Brad_Reese : Bobcert , Cisco makes it impossible for highly qualified Cisco Certified Network Engineers to " jump " to another Cisco channel partner !
CP3 : Why is Cisco saying there is a talent shortage ?
Brad_Reese : CP3 , Because Cisco is artificially restricting the movement of Certified Professionals between Cisco channel partners .
NetSavvy : Actually I believe it is widely reported that the demand for networking skills outstrips the supply worldwide .
Do you believe that this is true ?
Brad_Reese : NetSavvy , Cisco is widely reporting the shortage .
Is it real when Cisco itself is NOT doing what it can to facilitate opportunities for engineers unhappy at a current Cisco channel partner and want a new opportunity ?
Cisco is protecting the " bad " employment policies of its channel partners and penalizing the " good " policies of other channel partners by NOT facilitating the movement of certified engineers among channel partners .
doordie :
So , can we expect to see some sort of backlash to Cisco 's support of its channel partner 's bad employment policies -- and how that impedes people from moving from one job to the next ?
Or , is this more of the same -- with people taking it because Cisco IS networking ?
Brad_Reese : Doordie , yours truly had a Cisco Gold Partner ask me to REMOVE a resume / CV of one of its employees without that employee 's consent .
Yours truly REFUSED .
Would Cisco refuse such a request from a gold partner ?
Doubt it !
doordie : I do n't get it .
Why does Cisco care whether a CCNE moves from one employer to the next ?
Brad_Reese : Usually a pay increase is involved too .
Guess when your channel partners are " margin challenged , " Cisco feels the next pocket to pick are those of Cisco Certified Network Engineers .
Yours truly has stated numerous times that this a DANGEROUS GAME that Cisco is playing !
servergirl :
If I wanted to apply for a job overseas , how hard is that ?
Do companies in India and China want U.S. network folks ?
Brad_Reese : Not hard .
At BradReese .
Com , we currently we have CVs from Cisco Certified Network Engineers in 55 different countries .
Nisse :
Do you think manufacturing the " image " of the 80's -- will it get too big for itself ?
Brad_Reese :
The only entity that can kill Cisco is Cisco .
At some point Cisco might succeed at killing itself , or at the very least severely wounding itself .
Yours truly believes that network professionals are much better at adapting than Cisco .
The single biggest problem Cisco needs to overcome in order to stay competitive is being Cisco .
Will Cisco be able to adapt as quickly as network professionals ?
Only time will tell .
doordie : I read about virtualization everywhere .
What do I need to know about virtualization at the network level ?
Do I need to understand this technology in order to further my career in networking ?
Brad_Reese :
You need to understand it and understand it well , and you already appear to know that .
CidI : I am currently working in LAN / WAN and I am wondering if a move to security is a good move ?
I am concerned about not getting as much variation in the equipment I work with though .
I am interested in both , just looking for a smart future .
Brad_Reese :
Why not test the waters before committing to anything ?
Upload your resume , indicate on your CV what technology areas you wish to pursue and see what happens .
Moderator - Julie : Pre-submitted question :
What 's your favorite Cisco scandal ?
What does it say to you about the company ?
Brad_Reese : Formerly it was the $ 830 million tax evasion scandal in Brazil .
Today my favorite scandal is the gradually evolving Cisco worldwide talent shortage misinformation campaign being orchestrated by Cisco .
Rus :
What is your take on certified skills pay ( versus non-certified ) ?
As the gap narrows , do you feel that certification , overall , will become less relevant in terms of career value ?
Brad_Reese : Rus , most employers are still using the certs to eliminate your CV / resume , at least online .
So they are still valuable .
You need the certs as a way of getting past the first fortress wall .
CP3 : Do you see more demand for security pros rather than general network engineers ?
Brad_Reese : Every employer is different , if the employer needs a general network engineer than you better know more then just security .
tony : Hi Brad .
I took my CCNA training about year back and could not sit for my CCNA exam .
I have an institute certificate from where I took the training .
Also I want to have job as soon as possible .
Is there any way where I can join as a trainee or intern and after having entry - level experience get the certification ?
Or is there any other way or path ?
I want to work on technology as soon as possible .
Is my institute certificate helpful in any way getting entry level job ?
Brad_Reese : Tony , send out your resume and indicate what you are trying to accomplish .
I believe you will be pleasantly surprised by the response from prospective employers .
tony : Thank you for all your guidance .
I also want to know the difference between CCENT and Network +?
Which one should I study at this point ?
And can I contact you if I need further guidance ?
Brad_Reese : Tony , yours truly has yet to receive ( out of 445 CV / Resumes ) a single CV that indicates a CCENT .
However , lots of Network +
Certs are on those CVs .
Does that help provide direction ?
Moderator - Julie : So , while Brad types answers to questions , he has asked me to ask your opinions on a few items .
What do you think the hottest skills will be for you in your area ?
What do you think of IPv6 ?
Moderator - Julie :
In answer to questions about hot skills and the future of IPv6 .
Nisse : says that IP v6 will be cold for another 2 - 3 years still .
Tony : says security and IPv6 are the hottest skills and IPv6 will be a revolution in technology which will open many closed portals .
Tony says it is his dream to be an expert in security and understand IP v6 completely , but does n't know how to begin .
Tony , try starting with Jeff Doyle 's blog on Cisco Subnet .
He 's an IP v6 guru and he 's written a couple of books on it .
BT : Hi , I am a beginner to the world of networking !
I am currently pursuing my Master 's in electrical engineering and have dealt with lot of theoretical stuff about networking but I still feel I do n't have the practical skill set I need .
I am working towards my CCNA now , and I would like to have some advice on what would be the best path to choose .
I am interested in LAN / WAN administration .
Brad_Reese : BT , start by letting the world know of your plans by putting your resume out there and specifying that you have an interest in LAN / WAN administration .
jake :
What role does a Bachelor 's or Masters degree have in the future of IT jobs ?
Brad_Reese : Degrees are becoming more of a requirement everyday , so they are extremely important !
Nisse :
What do you think of Cisco using more and more different OSes in various equipment ?
I thought CatOS was enough ;-)
Brad_Reese : Cisco is obviously trying to meet customer requirements and creating the OS to meet those requirements .
Is it pretty ?
NO !
But Cisco needs to be responsive to their customer demands and that of prospective customers .
prodigy : An article in Network World showed how Cisco was pointing on Juniper IOS and Juniper was pointing on CISCO IOS .
What do you have to say about that ?
Brad_Reese : Prodigy , any good competition for Cisco is good for Cisco and Juniper is great competition .
Cisco and Juniper need each other to keep themselves from becoming like the U.S. automobile industry .
servergirl : How do you compare the market for CISCO versus Juniper ?
Are more employers looking for Juniper skills -- are more network pros saying they have Juniper skills on their resumes ?
Brad_Reese :
The demand is definitely for Cisco talent , however , Juniper Certs give you extra value and if Juniper technology excites you , go for it !
Nisse :
Is CCIE still worth it to pursue for an experienced network engineer ?
Brad_Reese : Nisse , CCIEs carry a lot of prestige wherever they go .
If YOU enjoy the technology go for it .
If YOU do n't , concentrate on what interests YOU !
NetSavvy : Do CompTIA certs carry any weight when looking for an entry level networking position ?
Thinking of Network +?
Brad_Reese : NetSavvy , it must because tons of CVs uploaded to BradReese .
Com indicate prominently their CompTIA Certs .
Moderator - Julie : NetSavvy ( and everyone else ) , the topic of which certs to take next ( particularly security ones ) was also addressed by Adam Gordon in a recent Network World chat .
Check out the transcript .
mk : Brad , what is the networking / security job market in Denver , CO like .
Planning to move there if I get a similar position .
yes , I will post my Resume on bradReese.com
Brad_Reese : Indicated on your CV where you would like to relocate to and also the technology that YOU wish to pursue .
That way YOU will have a leg - up in letting prospective employers know that YOU are motivated !
prodigy : I am working as a software integrator , but I wan to move into WAN Networking / Technologies .
I do have CCNA certification , but it expired last year .
My question is how can I get the CCNP if I do n't have a valid CCNA certification ?
Also how do I enter WAN security -- do I have to take a PIX or CSSP test and if yes , what are the pre-reqs for that .
Brad_Reese : I recommend that you ask this question in the Cisco Training Forum at Cisco 's NetPro website .
Moderator - Julie : Our time is up .
Thank you for coming !

Brad_Reese :
Thank you everyone , enjoyed this opportunity to chat with you !
I 've mentioned BradReese .
Com quite a few times .
The actual URL to post Cisco resumes is http://www.bradreese.com/cisco-resumes.htm.
Hope to hear from you !
Also check out these recent chat transcripts :
1 . You have one goal : be epic .
2 . Let no sound be lonely .
If there 's a guitar solo , harmonize it .
If there 's singing , make it a choir .
3. Keyboards offer a way to add thousands of different textures to a song .
Find two of those that you like and use them on every song you write .
4 . In a power metal world , everything steel is good , and anything good must be compared to steel .
5 . You are not bound to sing about Satan , evil , and / or darkness .
6 . You are bound to sing about dragons , freedom , and / or power metal .
7. Remember how no sound should be alone ?
Same goes for albums .
Everything can have a sequel !
8 . You are allowed to be blonde .
9 . Swords enhance your credibility and your performance .
Be sure to carry one regardless of whether or not you know anything about using one .
10 .
Pick a theme and stick to it .
Manowar are warriors of true metal , and they do n't get to sing about anything else .
Rhapsody has their Algalord chronicles .
Hammerfall has their steel , hammers , and templar .
Running Wild has pirates .
Blind Guardian has Tolkein .
None of them are allowed to sing about anything else .
11 . If you have to sing about something else , put together a side project to do it .
Avantasia is the perfect model .
12 . Ballads are permissible .
13 .
That does n't mean your ballads can suck .
14 .
The longer a song is , the more epic it is .
See rule # 1 .
15 . More solos means more epic .
16 . If at all possible , be Michael Kiske .
17 .
If this is not possible , pretend to be Michael Kiske .
18 . Your album cover should include at least one of the following : fire , steel , weird glowing magical items , irregularly muscular men , fists thrust into the air , weaponry , magic creatures ( preferably dragons ) , or bright beams of light around somebody / something .
19 . ' Grim ' and ' necro ' do n't apply here ; they just make you look silly .
Now go back to singing your 20 minute epic about dragonslaying !
20 . Power metal depends on power chords .
21 . 16th notes are the only notes .
22 . Unless you 're singing , in which case you are not permitted to hold a note for any less than 2 bars .
23 . Keyboards get solos , too .
24 .
If you ca n't be Michael Kiske , you can at least be Timo Tolkki .
25 . Actually , do n't be Timo Tolkki .
26 .
In case you did n't know , " symphonic " is synonymous with " epic . "
See rule # 1 .
27 .
Just because 300 bands before you have already done " epic , " there 's always room for more .
28 . Songs come in two tempos : metal and ballad .
29 .
You are officially the only group of people who can refer to themselves as ' mighty ' without being laughed at .
Much .
30 .
Audiences need to be able to sing along .
Make it catchy .
31 . Sing in English , even though your fan - base will be comprised entirely of Brazilians , Germans , Japanese , Swedes , and Finns .
See rule # 30 : if it 's not catchy , it 's harder to sing in a language that is not your first .
32 . Play in as many bands as possible .
More side projects and guest appearances means more epic !
33 . Tight .
Pants .
34 .
You do n't have to detune your guitars .
35 .
Though you probably should drop them a half - step .
36 . Unfortunately , you need at least two guitar players .
How else are you going to have dueling guitar solos ?
37 . Keyboards may substitute for one guitar player , as long as they can solo .
38 . Fortunately , you do n't need a bass player !
Or at least , you never have to use the same bassist twice .
39 .
Begin all songs with one big swelling chord on the keyboard .
40 . Acoustic guitars are allowed .
Sometimes .
41 . It 's not a tour , it 's a crusade !
42 . Layer your vocals , hundreds upon hundreds of times .
Do n't worry about them live .
43 .
Never use mundane words in your lyrics .
Nothing is epic if you do n't use words like " majesty , " " glorious , " " magical , " and so on .
44 . Wizards !
You need wizards !
45 .
Although your costume does not require corpse paint , it will require a cape , lots of jewelry , and the aforementioned swords .
46 . Unless you are Manowar , in which case you are too metal for clothing .
47 . Come to think of it , do n't be Manowar .
48 . Wear armor if at all possible .
Hammerfall can give you an idea of the variety of acceptable armors , ranging from leather to ring - mail .
49 .
Songs do n't begin at full speed .
Gradually work your way into an epic frenzy .
50 .
Hail true metal !
51 . Acoustic guitars are for intros and bridges .
Then crush them with steel .
52 . Epic .
Tight .
Pants .
53 .
Higher vocals are epic vocals .
Female lead singers are great for this .
54 .
So , male lead singes should sound like female singers .
See rule # 52 .
55 .
True warriors can tell the difference between albums .
56 . Concept albums are totally epic .
Nobody will ever see it coming .
57 .
Liner notes must include pages of backstory , either of your epic saga of conquest over dragons and evil or of your epic battles with alcoholism while recording the album .
58 . Drugs are n't metal .
59 .
Beer , however , can be served in all kinds of true metal ways .
60 . " Flagons of ale . "
It 's appropriate to your fantasy - riddled lyrics , and it almost looks like " dragons , " so you score extra points .
61 . Since you can't get away with grunts , growls , and other troll - like noises , you will have to sing .
62 . Your accent will show as a consequence .
63 .
To compensate , sing about killing trolls .
Preferably with the swords that you carry onstage .
64 . More sequels = more epic .
See rule # 7 .
65 . Guest vocalists , guest guitarists , and any special appearances from outside your band will make your sound more epic , even if the track sounds just like all the other songs on the album with an extra solo .
666 . Norsk Arysk Blak Metal !
Rahhh !!!
67 . Begin songs at half - tempo , and then , when listeners least expect it ( i.e. at exactly the same time it happens in all your other songs ) kick into full speed complete with double - bass and power chords .
68 . Bass players : one note .
Really fast .
69 .
But include one enormous crazy - ass bass fill before the chorus , even though the production will bury you so far in the mix that most people wo n't realize your band has a bass player .
70 .
Just because you do n't play black metal does n't mean you can't use Tolkein .
71 . Whenever you short of ideas , pick up your Dungeons and Dragons books .
You might as well be the first band to sing about owlbears .
72 . Never leave Europe .
73 .
For purposes of rule # 72 , Japan may be counted as part of Europe .
74 . Oh , and South America was colonized by Europeans , so it can count too .
75 . Orchestras make a great addition to your album .
Since you can't afford one , find a new patch on your keyboard .
76 .
If your live album does not have the crowd singing all the harmony parts for you , you are n't epic enough to justify a live album .
77 .
If you are European , use as many archaic English words in your lyrics as you can .
Obfuscation is epic !
78 .
If you are South American , your lyrics should be closer to standard English , though nobody will ever read them .
79 .
If you are U.S. American , you probably are n't actually a power metal band .
Sing about tanks , or something .
80 .
If you are Italian , write some lyrics in Latin .
Your American fans wo n't be able to tell the difference between your Italian lyrics and your Latin ones , but Latin is epic .
81 . Remember , shaving is epic , haircuts are not .
82 . Entire albums must be recorded in the same key .
83 .
For that matter , entire careers may also be recorded in the same key .
84 . Guitarists , remember : dun da - da dun da - da dun da-da
85 . Make your band logo very angular , but perfectly legible .
86 . More than a logo , you need a mascot .
87 .
He need not be distinguishable from Eddie , but he does need to be on all your album covers .
88 . At your first gig , if you feel a " rising force " , do be sure not to get it all over your audience .
89 .
Record your best songs unplugged , and sell them as an EP .
90 .
Do not expect anyone to buy the EP .
91 . Remember , power metal fans are not gay .
They are just comfortable with their masculinity .
92 . Sing along .
93 .
Do n't get caught singing along .
94 . Glitter is not epic .
95 . Neither is body oil .
See rule # 47 .
96 .
If you see a black metaller in the woods pretending to be a troll , see rule # 9 and rule # 63 .
97 .
In your liner notes , thank everybody you toured with , even if they 're Stratovarius .
98 . Complain about Stratovarius constantly even though you 've bought all their albums and listen to them more than anything else in your collection .
99 .
Power metal must be pure ; do not mix it with other metal styles .
100 .
To repeat : be epic .
101 .
I ran out of funny things to say way back at rule # 52 , but any less than 101 rules would so not be epic .

During his speech on economic competitiveness today , in Flint MI , Barack Obama proposed that every American should have access to high speed broadband Internet service .
“ As part of this commitment to infrastructure , we need to upgrade our digital superhighway as well .
When I looked at that map of the world mounted on the screen at Google , I was struck at first by the light generated by Internet searches coming from every corner of the earth , ” Obama said .
“ But then I was struck by the darkness .
Huge chunks of Africa and parts of Asia where the light of the information revolution has yet to shine .
And then I noticed portions of the United States where the thick cords of light dissolved into a few discrete strands .
It is unacceptable that here , in the country that invented the Internet , we fell to 15th in the world in broadband deployment , ” he continued .
Advertisements
Obama pointed out that lack of high speed Internet access hurts America ’s global competitiveness , “ When kids in downtown Flint or rural Iowa ca n’t afford or access high - speed Internet that sets back America ’s ability to compete .
As President , I will set a simple goal : every American should have the highest speed broadband access – no matter where you live , or how much money you have .
We ’ll connect schools , libraries and hospitals .
And we ’ll take on special interests to unleash the power of wireless spectrum for our safety and connectivity . ”
On tech issues one of the biggest differences between the two candidates is net neutrality .
Put it in its most simple terms , net neutrality is the principle that a broadband network should be neutral , and should not restrict content , sites , or platforms .
Right now all content is available on the Internet on an equal basis , but the telecom companies would like to impose a tiered service model like they currently do with television stations .
The result of this plan would be that not all content would be equally available .
McCain supports the telecom companies , saying last month , “ When you control the pipe you should be able to get profit from your investment . ”
Obama supports net neutrality legislation , and judging from his remarks today , views the Internet not in terms of a profit making tool , but as an information network that is critical to America ’s global competitiveness .
While McCain is out to protect corporations , Obama wants to build a more globally competitive America .
To me , this puts the choice between the two candidates in stark black and white terms .
Obama ’s full speech can be found here .
TOYAKO , Japan ( CNN ) -- President Bush on Sunday defended his decision to attend next month 's Olympics opening ceremony in Beijing , saying that to boycott " would be an affront to the Chinese people . "
President Bush speaks with Prime Minister Yasuo Fukuda at a Sunday news conference in Toyako , Japan .
Speaking to reporters ahead of this week 's summit of the Group of Eight industrialized nations in Japan , Bush said he did not need to skip the ceremony to show his position on religious freedom and human rights in China .
He said if he failed to attend the Games it would " make it more difficult to be able to speak more frankly with the Chinese leadership . "
Bush said he would raise concerns when he meets Chinese President Hu Jintao at the Olympics , but he was also " looking forward to cheering the U.S. athletes . "
He said it was good for them " to see their president waving that flag . "
Japan 's Prime Minister Yasuo Fukuda also said he would attend the opening ceremony despite concerns about human rights in China that prompted some other European leaders to boycott the event .
Bush and Fukuda took questions from reporters at the picturesque lakeside resort of Toyako on the northern island of Hokkaido , where the G - 8 summit will begin Monday .
Watch Bush , first lady arrive in Japan »
Bush said he and Fukuda discussed the United States ' recent decision to lift some sanctions against North Korea and remove the communist nation from the State Department 's list of state sponsors of terror .
Bush assured Japan that the issue of North Korea 's past kidnappings of Japanese citizens will not be ignored by the United States .
He told Fukuda that he was " fully aware of the sensitivity of the issue in your country " and that " the United States will not abandon you on this issue . "
North Korea has admitted to abducting 11 Japanese citizens -- to teach its spies Japanese language and culture -- but had insisted the abduction issue was resolved .
Holding a book about a young Japanese girl abducted by North Korea , Bush said as the father of two girls he " ca n't imagine what it would be like to have a daughter disappear . "
Bush said North Korea 's recent destruction of a water - cooling tower at its now - defunct nuclear facility and its declaration outlining its plutonium program are positive steps , but there are " more to be taken . "
Lifting sanctions would not weaken the pressure on North Korea to be forthcoming on the abduction issue or in nuclear negotiations , the U.S. president said .
Bush said North Korea remains the most sanctioned nation in the world and that " delisting did not get rid of their sanctions . "
Fukuda , who is chairing the G - 8 meetings , said global warming would be high on the agenda but that he could not predict what might result from this week 's talks .
Fukuda said he believes the United States " has not lost its sense of direction " on the issue .
" Our views are gradually converging , " he said .
Bush said the United States " will be constructive " in the global warming talks " but if China and India do not share that same aspiration , we 're not going to solve the problem . "
Bush said the United States and Japan leads the world in research on clean technologies .
He said Japan 's advances in battery technology will some day mean that Americans " will use batteries in cars that look like cars , not golf carts . "
As world leaders began arriving for the summit , more than 1,000 people protested in northern Japan against the event .
Demonstrators urged leaders to take urgent measures to stop global warming , grant indigenous people greater rights , combat world poverty and battle discrimination .
Watch police tangle with protesters »
Soaring oil and food prices and possible steps against Zimbabwe were also likely to be high on the agenda at the summit .
With fewer than 200 days left in his term , Bush says he will press other G - 8 leaders to follow through on their commitments from earlier summits , but has warned there is nothing he or anyone else can do in the short term about oil prices .
Bush 's main economic goal at the summit may be defensive , said David Gergen , former adviser to presidents Richard Nixon , Gerald Ford , Ronald Reagan and Bill Clinton .
" What 's essential in this summit for George W. Bush is to make sure the world economy does not spin downward , " he said .
Bush has downplayed what he and other G - 8 leaders can accomplish on the economic front .
" One thing we need to make clear when I 'm with our partners is that we 're not going to become protectionists , that we believe in free trade and open markets , " Bush said Wednesday .
A former administration official who served on the National Security Council under Bush says the G - 8's purpose is not to come up with quick solutions .
" This is not a meeting of heads of state that leads to a treaty .
It 's really kind of public opinion shaping and trying to get people to agree that issues are important , " said Michael Green , now with the Center for Strategic and International Studies .

Practical Django Projects : Writer better web applications faster , and learn how to build up your own reusable code library ( buy )
James Bennett , Django Release Manager
Apress 256 pages
Any web developer worth their salt has undoubtedly spent significant amounts of time and billable hours building ( and re-building ) a library of reusable code to ease future development investment on their part .
If you ’ve made it that far , then you ’ve probably also come to a point when you ’ve scrapped all the code you wrote and picked from one of the many open - source web frameworks that have done all those tasks ( and more ) , done them well , and that -- most importantly - - other people maintain .
When many individuals took their first steps in web development , they were forced to write much of their code from scratch .
That includes handling cookies and sessions , talking with the database and building your own SQL queries , engineering some sort of templating system ( or none at all in much of PHP development ) , and many more man-hours of boilerplate .
These days , from ColdFusion , Ruby , PHP , Perl , to Python , developers at all levels are turning to web frameworks to do much of the dirty work .
Django is a Python - powered web framework and it's one that I ’ve been a following closely since its public inception .
Django has had some big wins lately with Goolge ’s App Engine and is well on its way to a 1.0 release .
Django has been heralded as a well - managed and disciplined open - source project that has managed to garner praise for it ’s stability and performance .
Practical Django Projects is an excellent book that goes well beyond The Definitive Guide to Django , which marches through each major bit of Django with basic examples of these features .
The main downfall of the Definitive Guide was that while it is extremely illustrative of the different parts of the framework , it has little to no example of how to build a real - world project you might present to a client .
This book has a strong focus on building real , battle - tested web applications from the ground up and is split into four logical portions which are prefaced with a brief introduction to Python , Django , and web frameworks themselves .
The first major section is a basic content management application which introduces the concepts of using third party applications , in this case django.contrib.
flatpages , to build a project .
The author demonstrates how you add these third party applications , wire them to URLs , set up your templates , and get going .
James ' extends the CMS application in subsequent chapter by demonstrating how a developer might add interesting flourishes such as Markdown formatting , and a search system ( writing your first custom view ) .
There ancillary chapters are used to introduce more complex ideas and more in - depth parts of the Django framework to readers .
In this section for example , adding the search system tackles building a data model for the first time .
Building real projects
The first is a personal weblog replete with multiple authors , comments , tagging , categories , link blogging ( with del.icio.us integration ) .
From here , the book dives into more advanced subjects such as using Django 's advanced template inheritance in this real world example .
Readers are encouraged to go a step further by constructing custom templating tags , a task that eludes some Django developers until well into their career .
In addition to building the base weblog , advanced walk throughs on topics such as comment moderation ( via Akismet ) , utilizing Django 's email framework to send notifications when new comments are posted , and using the built - in syndication framework to create a series of RSS feeds for the site .
The second major project is one that powers a popular website in the Django community , DjangoSnippets .
DjangoSnippets is an online application that allows users to upload short code snippets with descriptions .
Users can sign - up for accounts , rate snippets , bookmark snippets .
Again , the author walks you through the entire process ( spanning many chapters ) of using Django ’s built - in Generic Views to avoid writing code for common web application scenarios ( list / detail views , etc. ) , user registration systems , adding in syntax highlighting , and advanced form handling and processing .
The final , and best , section of this book covers a few topics that have personally revolutionized my understanding and how I think about developing my Django applications .
James goes to great lengths to explain the philosophy behind Django ’s concept of reusable applications .
The idea here is that one should strive to develop small , tightly - focused , and loosely coupled applications ( or modules ) that can be plugged into any application to add instant functionality .
In fact , a large portion of what makes Django such an attractive framework — it 's auto - generated admin interface , and copious add - on library — are developed in this exact same fashion .
It 's one of the reason 's Django is so powerful and easy to adopt .
James ’ own django - contact - form or Nathan Borror ’s blog , places , people , profiles applications are excellent examples of this philosophy .
This chapter details logical tests that a developer can apply to his applications to determine if any portions can or should be split into their own reusable applications .
James then goes on to demonstrate a series of best practices a Django developer can adhere to when writing their URL handlers , views , and templating structure to ensure that their applications can be reasonably customized by another programmer .
In the final pages of this section , James goes over the process of packaging your applications for easy distribution with distutils and handy documentation tips .
With few Django books on the market at this point , I would recommend Practical Django Projects to anyone who has at least cursory experience with web development or web frameworks .
By going through the two substantial projects in this book , a competent developer can hone their Django skills to a level that some have reached only after months or years .
This book is short for the amount of useful information it will impart on you ; at a thin 256 pages , you ’ll be speeding through chapters at a nice brisk pace that satisfied my scatterbrained personality .
If you ’re seeking a reference text containing of the high points of the Django API , you can always stick to the online documentation ( which is excellent ) , or pick up a copy of the Definitive Guide to Django .
According to police , traces of Mr Tanevski's DNA were found on the two last victims , and the third one was killed in the same way as the others – strangled with a telephone cord after she had been raped and tortured .
The body of the first woman , who went missing in 2003 , has not yet been found .
President Bush has submitted a new war funding request totaling $ 178 billion .
$ 135.4 billion of this war supplemental would go toward operations in Iraq through the end of the year .
The remainder of the $ 42.6 billion would go to operations in Afghanistan and other activities in the global war against terrorist networks .
So what does this mean for American taxpayers ?
Last year , CAP took a look at how much taxpayers in each state were paying for the war .
Based on updated information released , a new interactive map below shows a breakdown by state of what taxpayers could now be facing should the full amount of funding be approved .
American taxpayers have enough to worry about already .
The United States needs to shift its priorities in Iraq and the Middle East , beginning with a strategic reset of policy including a phased redeployment from Iraq alongside increased diplomatic efforts in the region .

Fox News will always have its revenge !
Back in March , news of a bedbug infestation in Fox 's newsroom surfaced , and the huge PR firm Fleishman - Hillard took advantage of it to promote one of their pest control clients — offering a free de-lousing to any Fox guests .
You just knew that Fox would n't let that insult slide .
Today , the fair and balanced station got its on - air vengeance against the PR firm [ PRNewser ] , with a little of Fox 's trademark gratuitous humiliation :
Fox & Friends anchor Steve Doocy used the made - up news peg of his son telling him about a new service from AT&T , a Fleishman client .
" I started looking around for it and there was absolutely no publicity on it , no press , " said Doocy .
But in the course of his perfectly innocent investigation , he happened to discover that Fleishman was the PR agency behind it , which naturally led into a rehashing of some old criminal charges against the firm , and a chance to mock pictures of its CEO on air .
Naturally !
Let 's just say we 're going for both sides here .
Your move , Fleishman .
The very worthwhile video clip is below .

Craigslist has filed a countersuit against eBay , alleging that the auction site used its minority stake in Craigslist to engage in unfair and unlawful anticompetitive behavior , false advertising , trademark infringement , and other misdeeds .
With Craigslist 's countersuit , the shareholder dispute that started with eBay 's lawsuit against Craigslist and then proceeded to hurt feelings and harsh words has now become a pitched legal battle .
The 26 - page complaint ( .pdf ) filed in California Superior Court today details the long , sorry history of the eBay - Craigslist relationship .
Sadly for Craigslist watchers , it does not include any financial details of the August , 2004 transaction in which eBay acquired a 25 percent stake in the popular community bulletin board and classified ad site .
It does , however , describe a sequence of events in which , Craigslist alleges , eBay executives unilaterally bought out the share of a " former shareholder " ( probably Phillip Knowlton , the WSJ reported in 2004 ) even as negotiations over the terms of the deal were breaking down .
Subsequently , the complaint says , eBay used its position on Craigslist 's board to glean inside information , launch a competitor , Kijiji , and then undermine Craigslist 's business .
At one point , Craigslist alleges , eBay even placed Google ads whose blue underlined hyperlinks appeared to link to craigslist.org but actually took users to Kijiji.com and eBay.com .
Craigslist founder Craig Newmark and CEO Jim Buckmaster " were taken aback by eBay 's behavior , and feared that they had a wolf in sheep 's clothing in their midst , " the complaint states .
The lawsuit seeks an injunction preventing eBay from using the Craigslist name or brand , and also asks the court to order eBay to " restore to craigslist all shares of the company owned by eBay which were acquired by means of , or for the purpose of , unfair competition ; or ... to divest its interests in craigslist . "
Craigslist is also seeking unspecified damages .
Craigslist executives were not available to comment .

Madonna Hires Sir Paul's Tough Divorce Lawyer ( Photos )
Our friends over at Holy Moly !
just revealed that Madonna has hired the toughest divorce lawyer in Britain , Nicholas Mostyn QC .
The singer is said to be ending her eight year marriage to producer Guy Ritchie .
Mostyn was Sir Paul McCartney 's heavy hitter and has a long list of high profile divorce cases that he has handled successfully in favor of his clients .
Madonna is apparently not messing around .
Forbes estimated Madonna 's earnings from last year at $ 72 million and word is that there is n't a prenup .
Ouch !
That means that Guy could be entitled to half .
No juicy news on why the couple are going their separate ways other than they grew apart - boring .
Now that the adoption of their son David Banda is finalized , it is no longer essential to keep the marital bonds intact and it appears the end is in sight for the couple .
Rumors have surfaced for some time now , noting that the couple have had very few public appearances over the past six months .
The meeting between Madge and Mostyn is said to have taken place in London over ten days ago .
We will keep you posted on any new details or denials as they surface .

“ The U.S. Department of Homeland Security is holding a workshop in Fayetteville to teach local law enforcement agencies how to handle roadside bombs , ” reports the Associated Press .
No , not in Iraq .
But here , in America .
The department ’s Office of Bombing Prevention will host Tuesday ’s workshop .
Police , sheriff ’s deputies and other law enforcement agents will learn how to identify the bombs and how to protect against them .
Roadside bombs are the leading killer of troops in Iraq and Afghanistan .
Although no roadside bomb attacks have been reported in the U.S. , experts say they could be a future threat .
Okay , it is getting ridiculous out here .
Apparently , endless and bogus terror threats issued since September 11 , 2001 , are not enough .
Now cops are to be filled with absurd ideas about terrorists planting IEDs alongside our highways and streets .
But then we are told in all seriousness blond hair and blue eye al - Qaeda terrorists are a reality here in America and it is only a matter of time before they strike in the name of Osama bin Laden and his demented cave dwelling terrorists .
Such things are sincerely cartoonish and no doubt most Americans do not take it seriously , no matter the talking heads on Faux News cranking up the hype on an almost daily basis .
In a way , we have already had a prominently hyped roadside bomb attack , in a fashion .
It happened in Times Square when a crude bomb went off in the middle of the night at a military recruiting center .
Geraldo told the nation it was the work of “ anarchists ” who are “ more like those ‘ 9/11 was an inside job ’ kind of guys . ”
Maybe Homeland Security knows something we do n’t .
Maybe they are preparing the cops for the inevitability of an Iraqi styled “ insurgency ” here in America .
After all , the Pentagon is paying Lockheed Martin $ 1.3 million to develop an “ Integrated Crises Early Warning System ” to detect “ rebellions , insurgencies , ethnic / religious violence , civil war , and major economic crises , ” according to Wired .
And then there is a “ secret report , suppressed by US defense chiefs and obtained by The Observer , ” warning that “ disruption and conflict will be endemic features of life ” in the near future and “ once again , warfare would define human life . ”
So I guess the Department and the Pentagon are ahead of the curve .
Or , more likely , they are attempting to rile up the cops and further brainwash them to believe the American people are the enemy .
The absurd prospect of IEDs planted by blond hair and blue eye terrorists helps along this polarization agenda .

yeah , i'm getting twice the power , but if a ' middle of the road ' computer costs two hundred more this year than last , how is that not inflation ?

LONDON ( Reuters ) - A Buddhist monk from Japan was killed after slipping and falling under the blades of his runaway tractor lawnmower , an inquest into his death has found .
The Reverend Seiji Handa , 50 , was cutting the grass around his peace pagoda in the English city of Milton Keynes when the accident occurred last August .
He got out of the tractor to inspect something but the vehicle , which was pulling a multi- bladed grass cutting machine , slipped its handbrake .
The coroner ’s office in Milton Keynes , northwest of London , said it had recorded a verdict of accidental death .
Handa , from Niigata in Japan , came to Britain in 1978 , when he began building a pagoda to promote peace .
He had tended the pagoda with the help of nuns ever since .
His main job was to trim the 12 acres of lawns around the monument .
High - power conservative activist endorses Rice for VP Nick Juliano

After her visit to a secretive meeting of high - powered conservative DC activists , where she reportedly was auditioning for a potential vice presidential bid , Condoleezza Rice has secured the endorsement of one of Washington 's most prominent power - brokers .
Rice and her aides have scoffed at speculation she is aiming to be John McCain 's running mate .
Despite her demurrals , though , Grover Norquist , who hosts the weekly Wednesday meeting at which Rice recently spoke , said he thinks she'd be the right woman for the job .
" If her goal was to convince everyone she would be a good president and , therefore , a good vice president -- she hit it out of the ballpark , " Norquist , president of Americans for Tax Reform , tells the Washington Post column The Sleuth .
Was Dan Senor , the former Bush administration spokesman in Iraq , accurate when he said on ABC's " This Week " that Rice was " actively " lobbying at the March 26 Wednesday meeting to be presumptive GOP presidential nominee John McCain 's running mate ?
" Is she campaigning for it ?
I do n't know , " Norquist told us .
" But if she is , she 's doing it the right way . "
It was Rice 's first appearance ever before the influential huddle of Washington conservatives , thus it was the first time many right - leaning thinkers around town had had a chance to hear from her firsthand ; usually , she sends a deputy from the State Department to talk to the gathering , as other Cabinet secretaries do .
But this time , Rice wanted to address the group of activists and writers personally .
And Norquist , who hosts the meetings , says many attendees " left the room saying , ' This is a woman who could be president . ' "
Senor , who was n't at the meeting , told ABC Sunday that Rice " has been actively campaigning for this , " referring to the Norquist meeting as one necessary step for any aspiring Republican pol .
For her part , Rice has said she wants to return to Stanford after President Bush leaves office .
Journalists were quick to ask what it was the Bucks wanted .
Their questions struck me as in bad faith .

SAN FRANCISCO ( Reuters ) - Defendants and plaintiffs in two related copyright infringement lawsuits against YouTube have reached a deal to protect the privacy of millions of YouTube watchers during evidence discovery , a spokesman for Google Inc said on Monday .
A screenshot of YouTube.com , taken on July 15 , 2008 .
REUTERS/www.youtube.com
Earlier in July , a New York federal judge ordered Google to turn over YouTube user data to Viacom Inc and other plaintiffs to help them to prepare a confidential study of what they argue are vast piracy violations on the video - sharing site .
Google said it had now agreed to provide plaintiffs ’ attorneys for Viacom and a class - action group led by the Football Association of England a version of a massive viewership database that blanks out YouTube username and Internet address data that could be used to identify individual video watchers .
“ We have reached agreement with Viacom and the class - action group , ” Google spokesman Ricardo Reyes said .
“ They have agreed to let us anonymize YouTube user data , ” he said .
Viacom , owner of movie studio Paramount and MTV Networks , requested the information as part of its $ 1 billion copyright infringement lawsuit against the popular online video service YouTube and its deep - pocketed parent , Google .
Judge Louis Stanton of the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York ordered Google on July 1 to turn over as evidence a database with usernames of YouTube viewers , what videos they watched when , and users ’ computer addresses .
Privacy activists from the Electronic Frontier Foundation and other groups argued in response that the order “ threatens to expose deeply private information ” and violated the Video Privacy Protection Act , a 1988 law passed after Supreme Court nominee Robert Bork ’s video rental habits were revealed .
Viacom said at the time that it needed the data to demonstrate video piracy patterns that are the heart of its case against YouTube .
But it sought to diffuse privacy fears , saying it had no interest in identifying individual users .
One outstanding disagreement between the two parties is on how to handle the YouTube viewership data of YouTube and Google employees , which Judge Stanton also had ordered YouTube to turn over as part of the July 1 ruling covering YouTube consumers .
Reyes said the issue could concern not just employees of the defendants , but also those of companies tied to the plaintiffs , including Viacom and the Football Association Premiere League .
In a legal stipulation agreed to by attorneys for all major parties in the case , the sides agreed that the new data privacy agreement did not cover employees and that they would work out how to share this data separately in coming weeks .
YouTube faces two separate , but parallel lawsuits , that for purposes of preliminary motions and evidence discovery are being treated as one .
Viacom filed the first lawsuit , and a separate class action was later filed by English Premiere League soccer , several other European sports leagues , along with music publishers and videographers .
The cases are unlikely to come to trial before 2009 or 2010 .
In a system where all power is supposedly based on the consent of the governed , where all men are created equally , what happens when one questions the legitimacy and the very nature of government ?
Watch this video and find out how government solves market needs in a very different way than private companies sseking a profit .

If you apply for this project we will probably not respond to you until approximately July 12 , 2008 .
To apply for this job ...

Please Submit Your Sample Source Code
~~~
Please provide us with some sample source code you have created in the past in Lisp or Ruby or Python or Perl or C++ or Java or some other language .
However , please do not submit source code have created in PHP .
~~~
Please Submit Your Monthly Rate
~~~
Please bid the monthly salary you require in US dollars for working 200 hundred ( two hundred ) hours per month .
~~~
Repeat : Please Submit Your Sample Source Code
~~~
Yes .
We mentioned above that we want you to submit your sample source code but many candidates do n't bother submitting their sample source code to us initially .
Therefore , we 'd like to persuade you to submit your sample source code to us along with your bid .
If you bid your monthly rate but fail to submit sample source code to us then we will send you a personal message via GetAFreelancer in which we request you to submit sample source code to us .
We will also be mildly annoyed with you because we will feel you have needlessly wasted our time .
Please understand that if we merely know how much money you want to earn we will not have enough information to decide whether or not you seem like a good candidate .
We need to get an idea of how well you write code .
~~~
$ 30 Test Project for you on GetAFreelancer
~~~
If the source code you submit to us is good enough and if your salary requirement for working 200 hours per month is low enough , then we will create a small $ 30 test project just for you on GetAFreelancer .
Therefore , please save us time and yourself time by submitting source code to us along with your bid for working 200 hours / month .
~~~
Work whichever hours of the day you prefer
~~~
We will permit you to work any hours of the day you prefer .
In other words , we do not care which hours of the day you work .
~~~
More about your sample code
~~~
Regarding your sample source code , perhaps you created the code 2 weeks ago , 2 months ago , or even 2 years .
If you are worried that by submitting the sample source code to us that you may be violating something like a client confidentiality agreement or non-disclosure agreement for source code you created as a " Work for Hire " then you may submit merely a snippet of the source code , not the entire source code .
We are not looking to steal anyone else 's software .
Not at all .
We merely want to review a sample of code you have created in the past so we can properly judge the quality of your code .
Please do n't copy and paste your sample code into a GetAFreelancer Personal Message ( PM ) because the indenting will be lost .
Instead please attach your sample code into a GetAFreelancer Personal Message ( PM ) so that the indenting will be maintained .
Please do not package your files in Visual Studio or any other framework .
Your files must be available individually and not packaged ( except as , say , a .zip or .rar file ) .
We have had trouble in the past with tests that candidates have submitted C++ which they created with Visual Studio .
The software architect normally uses Linux and Macintosh but not Windows .
Please make it easy for the software architect to review your code .
~~~
About You
~~~
We are currently looking for 1 or 2 or 3 very clever , full - time software application developers ( not mere coders ) to work with us for at least a year but hopefully longer .
~~~
About Us
~~~
We have many challenging new development projects that we need help with ( no maintenance ) .
If you remind us we 'll tell you more about us if we like your source code

Steel Bank Common Lisp ( SBCL )
~~~
You must develop software for us using Steel Bank Common Lisp ( SBCL ) [ url removed , login to view ]
Our development server runs Apache and mod_lisp .
~~~
But I do n't have any Lisp experience ?!?
~~~
Of course , we assume you have practically no experience developing with Lisp .
We know that very , very few developers use Lisp .
Therefore , we recommend you review " Practical Common Lisp " [ url removed , login to view ] and " Common Lisp HyperSpec " [ url removed , login to view ]
~~~
Lisp ?
Why Lisp ?
~~~
Why did we choose Lisp ?
Is n't Lisp almost , well , almost a dead language ?
Sort of .
We realize that Lisp is hardly used in software development except by a very small group of elite software developers .
We chose Lisp for one simple reason : we believe it is the best tool available for building most of the software we need .
In other words , we think Lisp is a great language .
If you study Lisp we suspect you 'll think it 's a great language too .
~~~
Are you sure you want to use Lisp ?
Really ?
~~~
Yes .
We did not inadvertently or naively choose Lisp .
Not at all .
We very carefully weighed the pros and cons of various languages and chose to use Lisp .
~~~
If you prefer to use Java or .NET
~~~
If you prefer to use Java or .NET then you definitely should not apply for this job .
We do not like those languages at all .
We feel strongly that those languages are like diseases .
However , we do not mind if you currently develop in one of those languages and , like a refugee from a war zone , are seeking to escape .
~~~
If you prefer to use Perl , Python , and Ruby on Rails
~~~
Even though we like and respect Perl , Python , and Ruby on Rails , if you prefer to use one of these languages then you should not apply for this job either .
We know Perl is for the old - timers , Python is what they use at Google , and that all the cool kids these days use Ruby on Rails .
We are not trying to be " old school " [ url removed , login to view ] or to be like Google or to be cool .
No .
We are attempting to develop great software .
~~~
Clever and Eager Autodidacts Wanted
~~~
You must be willing to teach yourself Steel Bank Common Lisp .
We will * not* pay for you to learn Steel Bank Common Lisp .
You must currently have a * reliable * high speed Internet connection ( DSL , Cable , T - 1 , etc ) .
~~~
Employee Benefits ?
None . Zero .
~~~
We will provide you with no benefits whatsoever .
No medical benefits .
No paid holidays .
Nothing .
But we will pay all fees you will be assessed to receive your money , such as fees charged by GetAFreelancer and ATM machine fees .
~~~
Taxes ?
~~~
We will not withhold any taxes from your compensation whatsoever nor will we report your earnings to you local tax authorities .
That will be your responsibility alone .
~~~
10 Hour Probationary Period
~~~
If we pay you $ 30 because you have successfully completed the test project we posted for you on GetAFreelancer then we will assign you one 2 hour project which you must complete and submit to us within 24 hours ( not including Saturdays and Sundays ) .
Therefore , if we assign a project to you on Friday , you will not need to complete and submit to us until Monday .
If we are satisfied with how you have performed then we will assign you a second two hour project which you must complete and submit to us within 24 hours ( not including Saturdays and Sundays ) .
If we are again satisfied with how you have performed we will repeat this process three more times until you have completed five such two hour assignments .
If we are satisfied with how you have performed then we will pay you for 10 hours .
Then you will advance to the 50 day probationary period .
However , if at any time during this 10 hour probationary period we are * not* satisfied with how you performed then we will pay * not * you any monies whatsoever for any of the 10 hours .
Instead we will terminate our relationship with you .
In other words , we require that you work 10 hours for us yet risk receiving no compensation whatsoever .
Therefore , if you are not willing to risk working 10 hours for free , then you should not apply for this job .
After the initial 10 hour probationary period we will pay you within 48 hours ( not including Saturdays and Sundays ) for your work .
Therefore , you will not need to , essentially , extend much credit to us .
In other words , normally you will only need to trust us to pay you for up to two days of work .
~~~
The 50 days following the 10 hour probationary period
~~~
During the 50 days following the 10 hour probationary period , we will allow you to work as few as 50 hours each month but may allow you to work up to 200 hours per month .
In other words , after the 10 hour probationary period we may allow you to begin working full - time with us .
However , we will not require you to begin working full - time during this 50 day period .
Why ?
Because we realize you may currently , for example , have a full - time job which you probably do n't like , but at least " pays the bills . "
~~~
After the 50 day probationary period you must be available to work 200 hours per month
~~~
However , after this 50 day probationary period , we will require you to work 200 hours each month with us .
Therefore , if you currently have a full - time job or other commitments which would interfere with you working 200 hours each month with us , then 50 day probationary period you will almost certainly need to quit your current job and / or abandon your other commitments .
In other words , after the 50 day probationary period we are not interested in working with you on a part - time basis .
We are only willing to work with you on a part - time basis until you complete the 50 day probationary period so that both you and we may become confident that we should work together on a full - time basis .
Please do not apply for this job unless you are willing to work 200 hours each month with us after you complete the 50 day probationary period .
In other words , we realize that many software developers reviewing the opportunities on GetAFreelancer are looking for part - time work .
After all , this website is called GetAFreelancer not GetAnEmployee .
However , if you are looking for a " side job " or some part - time work to supplement your current income and are therefore hoping to work , say , 50 to 100 hours per month , then please do not apply for this job .
We are only interested in working with candidates who will be willing to work 200 hours each month with us after they complete the initial 60 day period .
~~~
What about vacations ?
~~~
We do not provide any benefits whatsoever .
None . Zero. Nothing .
Of course we know you 'll take vacations .
Immediately below we describe how you would not be paid for vacations you take .
~~~
Paid within 48 hours ( not counting Saturdays and Sundays ) for each hour you work
~~~
We will actually pay you for every hour you work , not a set monthly rate .
We would allow you to work more 200 hours per month .
For example , if you were to work 250 hours in one month , then you 'd be paid for 250 hours .
Of course , if , say , you were to take a vacation and therefore only worked 50 hours in a particular month , then you 'd only be paid for 50 hours for that month .
To determine your hourly rate we will simply divide your monthly rate by 200 .
However , except when you are sick or go on vacation , you must be willing to work 200 hours per month .
And no , you may not take 4 or 5 " vacations " per month in order to work , say , 75 hours per month so that you can keep your current full - time job , stay in school , fulfill your military service , etc .
You must be willing to work 200 hours per month .
If you work more than 200 hours per month we 'll pay you more , but if you work less more than 200 hours per month we 'll pay you less .
We are not a paternalistic organization .
We wo n't " take care of you . "
We are interested in a simple and straightforward contractual relationship in which we pay you for each hour you work and in which you commit to work 200 hours / month .
If you want a job with any sort of typical benefits such as paid vacations , medical care , retirement pensions , etcetera this is not the job for you .
We are going to pay you strictly by the hour .
If this approach seems too brutal or callous or unforgiving we suggest you get a " regular " job with a " regular " company .

If you liked the Supreme Court ’s reinstatement of Habeas Corpus , vote Obama .
McCain did not like it and will be in a position to appoint a justice who will vote with the four dissenters .
Bush dismissed the ruling as that of only 5 against 4 .
( Was n’t that the margin that made him president in 2000 ? )
The US Constitution says , “ The Privilege of the Writ of Habeas Corpus shall not be suspended , unless when in Cases of Rebellion or Invasion the public Safety may require it . ”
The Constitution diary says ,
“ The basic premise behind habeas corpus is that you cannot be held against your will without just cause .
To put it another way , you can not be jailed if there are no charges against you .
If you are being held , and you demand it , the courts must issue a writ of habeas corpus , which forces those holding you to answer as to why .
If there is no good or compelling reason , the court must set you free .
It is important to note that of all the civil liberties we take for granted today as a part of the Bill of Rights , the importance of habeas corpus is illustrated by the fact that it was the sole liberty thought important enough to be included in the original text of the Constitution ”

Eurosceptics celebrate a triumph of the little people against the Euro juggernaut .
Ireland 's ' no ' vote against the treaty on the European constitution is , in such minds , the brave assertion of democracy against bureaucracy .
The European elite in Brussels , with its dark plans to hobble Europeans everywhere , deserves a good kicking for producing an unloved , incomprehensible set of reforms .
It has got it .
Ireland has stood up for Europe .
This is nonsense from top to bottom , a farrago of lies and disinformation .
The European Union is a painfully constructed and fragile skein of compromises that allows 27 democratic states on our shared continent to come together and drive forward areas of common interest to further their citizens ' well - being .
The elite that plots this is a nonexistent phantom invented by populist demagogues .
The beleaguered , unloved treaty would have improved Europe 's effectiveness and tried to address its much talked about democratic weaknesses .
The reality is that Ireland 's ' no ' voters have trashed an EU that is precious but weak .
Most ' no ' voters , grabbing on to the worst fear rather than reasoned fact , have unknowingly set in train a political dynamic that , unless carefully handled , could lead not just to Ireland but Britain leaving the EU .
Everybody will be the poorer .
Sometimes , fatalistically , I think this may have to happen .
Eurosceptics , such as Ireland 's leading ' no ' vote campaigner Declan Ganley , like to position their fierce and unjustified attacks on the actual Europe we have as being pro-European because today 's EU does not correspond to some impossible notion of Europe that meets their own very particular prejudices .
Such is the flaw of referendums as a means to practise reasoned democratic decision - making that the only way voters will come to realise that the sceptics are wrong is to be forced to live through the consequences of their vote .
For although the first reaction in Ireland , Brussels and the rest of the European Union has been to say that the will of Ireland 's voters must be respected , the wider political logic is that Irish voters are in effect saying no to the European Union , a will that can only be respected by other states freezing their ambitions .
Ireland 's voters have primed a bomb .
Thinking through the options shows just how big the bomb is .
Eighteen states have already ratified the treaty , some for the second time .
The first reaction of José Manuel Barroso , the president of the European Commission , was to ask the last eight member states , Britain included , to proceed with ratification .
Gordon Brown has agreed ; the final reading is on Wednesday and to stop the process because of the Irish vote would be unreasonable .
The European Council of heads of state meets this week and will surely re-endorse that collective view .
So the EU on 1 January 2009 will have a treaty that 26 states have ratified - but not the Irish .
A new commission is to be appointed , supposedly on a new basis , as well as a new president , along with a strengthened foreign policy chief .
So what is to happen ?
What can't happen is that the treaty is scrapped , rewritten to accommodate changes to meet the will of Ireland 's voters and then re-ratified in 27 countries .
There are the practical questions of time and expense and there is no political readiness in the other 26 capitals to go through the whole interminable process again .
On top of these there is the political problem that the treaty can't be rewritten to accommodate specific Irish concerns because it already does ; Ireland 's ' no ' campaigners told lies .
The voters ' great concerns had been met .
There is a specific protocol that guarantees Ireland 's neutrality and excuses it from membership of any joint European defence effort , if any surfaces .
There is no possibility of Ireland being told to enforce abortion .
And all states have autonomy over tax policy .
Crucially , the treaty contains a clause that states that do not agree to its provisions are required to leave the European Union .
The existing treaty can certainly be made more obviously Ireland - friendly within its existing provisions , but beyond that , the EU will have to get tough and invoke the clause .
It will have to ask Ireland to resubmit essentially the same treaty for a second referendum early in 2009 , rather as Ireland held a second referendum over the Nice treaty in 2002 .
If Ireland votes similarly again , then it will have to accept associate status in the EU and not be a member of its governing structures .
The EU will proceed without Ireland .
Nobody wants this outcome and the language at this week 's European Council will be carefully diplomatic .
Senior British government sources have told me that the EU has to be ' respectful ' of the Irish vote and not be portrayed in any way as a bully that disregards the popular will .
This may be possible for a few months , but the clock is ticking .
Decisions can not be deferred .
Sometime during the autumn , the President of the European Commission or the Irish Prime Minister must spell out Ireland 's choices .
Irish and British Eurosceptics , in close alliance , will react in fury .
I can see it now .
This will be proof - positive of the Brussels elite 's malevolence and anti-democratic intent .
David Cameron's
Tory party will say that Ireland is being treated disgracefully .
I do n't see how Cameron will be able to avoid a pledge to give British voters the same chance for a referendum on the treaty as the Irish , not least to strengthen the hand of the Irish ' no ' campaigners in their second referendum .
One of Europe 's big states will be on Ireland 's side when the Tories win power .
They can take on Brussels bullies etc .
Battle is going to be joined in earnest because it must .
Pro-Europeans everywhere must engage .
We need this Europe - to fight climate change , to ensure security of energy and food , to underwrite our prosperity and to fight for our common interests .
The world needs it too .
The EU is the citizens ' friend .
If it did not exist , Europe would have to invent something similar .
Over the next few months , Europe 's leaders are going to have to develop concrete initiatives to support these points and to present what they are doing as European and only possible because of the EU .
Maybe pro-Europeans can win Ireland 's second referendum and then , in 2010 or 2011 , our own .
But referendums work best for the demagogue , the dissimulator and scaremonger , as Hitler and Mussolini , lovers of referendums , proved .
Increasingly , Ireland and Britain are heading for the European exit and that could portend further break - up of the Union .
Pro-Europeans look out .
It is a bizarre tale of a would - be assassin who turned out to be an Egyptian poker dealer in Las Vegas , a woman in an unhappy relationship with a tycoon and revelations of a fake marriage , sex clubs in Spain and a Jacobean - style poison plot .
They were the ingredients of one of the most unusual murder trials ever heard by Ireland 's central criminal court .
The case reached its climax this week after a 45 - year - old mother - of - two , Sharon Collins , was found guilty of conspiring to hire a hitman through a website to kill her partner and his two sons .
PJ Howard was worth € 12 m ( £ 9.6 m ) through property rentals .
He owned homes in the west of Ireland and Spain as well as a boat called Heartbeat , named after his quadruple heart - bypass in 2000 .
Five years after his heart surgery Howard was dating blonde divorcee Collins who , like him , had two sons from a previous marriage .
But the match was not made in heaven , the court was told .
Collins admitted that in April 2005 she wrote to Gerry Ryan , a popular Irish radio DJ , accusing Howard of frequenting prostitutes , transvestites and swingers ' clubs near Malaga on the Costa del Sol .
Yet despite this , she was so obsessed with marrying Howard that she turned to the internet , paying $ 1 , 000 to Proxymarriage.com for a Mexican marriage certificate in the name of Sharon Howard .
In August 2006 , Collins contacted the website www.Hitman.us.com.
The jury was told that correspondence began between her and a man from the site who called himself Tony Luciano .
Luciano was in fact an Egyptian poker dealer in Las Vegas , Essam Eid .
Collins allegedly suggested arranging an accident for Howard and his sons , and supplied him with details of where the family lived and socialised .
The would - be assassin offered an alternative - poison that would induce heart attacks .
The plot unravelled in September 2006 after Eid flew to Ireland and burgled the Howard family 's business , taking computers .
He then arranged to meet Robert Howard , one of PJ 's sons , claiming to be able to identify the whereabouts of the equipment .
He also warned the son that there was a contract out on him , his brother and their father , demanding € 100,000 to have the contract terminated .
Howard contacted the Irish police and thus began a transatlantic investigation which included the FBI .
Collins was arrested in February 2007 after examination of one of the stolen computers , which had been dumped in a Limerick hotel .
It contained emails between her and the hitman , which included complaints from Collins that PJ Howard wanted to control her life , even down to asking her to have " stranger sex " .
In one email , Collins wrote : " His boys are going to suffer .
I wish it did n't have to be like this , but I know that if my husband was dead and they were still here , they 'd screw me . "
Collins and Eid , who was found guilty of demanding € 100,000 from Howard and handling stolen property , will be sentenced on October 8 .
Collins has secured the help of a Los Angeles - based literary agent , after she told Ireland 's director of public prosecutions : " I 'll write a book yet . "
Bill Clinton Lied About Hillary ’s Lies
Newsflash , the Clinton ’s lie !
It is n’t their fault , they ca n’t help themselves .
Lying is in their blood .
Bill Clinton tried to cover up for Hillary ’s Bosnia lie about landing under sniper fire by lying about Hillary ’s lie .
Here is what he said :
“ A lot of the way this whole campaign has been covered has amused me , ” Bill Clinton said in Boonville , Ind .
“ But there was a lot of fulminating because Hillary , one time late at night when she was exhausted , misstated and immediately apologized for it , what happened to her in Bosnia in 1995 . ”
There is only one problem with this statement , it is a lie .
Hillary Clinton did n’t “ misspeak ” or “ misremember ” , she deliberately lied about he Bosnia trip to show us that she had the experience to be president .
We know she deliberately lied because it was not a mistake she told one time while she was tired , she told the story several times .
The Bosnia sniper fire story was part of her stump speech all across the country and she used it many times .
Unless she “ misspoke ” every time she gave this speech she is lying .
The Clinton ’s continue to lie , and they will continue to lie until they are in the white house , and then even after .
The Clinton ’s must believe that the American people are stupid , or they do n’t believe that the media will call them on it .
They have gotten away with lying for so long that they just assume they will continue to get away with it .
It ’s either that or they have lied so much that they no longer even know what the truth is .
US aerospace heavyweight Northrop Grumman has revealed some details of a planned upgrade to the computing system of the famous B - 2 Stealth Bomber , one of the most expensive and unusual aircraft in the world .
According to reports , the well - known but seldom seen ghost bomber will be finally moving up to Pentium processors and code written in C .
The B - 2 will also get a new disk drive .
Stealth Bomber - now with Pentium sticker .
Northrop says that during the upgrade , many standalone computers distributed throughout the B - 2's batwinged airframe will be combined into a single faster and more modern Integrated Processing Unit ( IPU ) with fibre links to the various hardware it needs to interface with .
Flight International reports that the IPU will use " Pentium class " processor chips .
According to Northrop : " It provides the high - speed data handling environment required to implement future capabilities such as an EHF satellite communications system , and the ability to destroy moving targets . "
The new disk drive - a piece of kit seen by US government auditors as " high risk " , but in which the air force and Northrop have full confidence - will come from Honeywell .
The B - 2's flight - management computer , without which its unstable low - observable flying wing airframe cannot fly , will be replaced by a more modern single - card processor " installed in one of many computer slots " in the new IPU .
Naturally the stealth bomber 's software has to be rewritten for the new platform , in particular the operational flight program ( OFP ) - the app which lets the ungainly plane fly , rather than lurching out of control as it would without constant computer assistance .
( A recent B - 2 crash shortly after takeoff at the Pacific island of Guam was caused by a false sensor data feed into the OFP , resulting from an airspeed measuring device being affected by tropical moisture .
The duff data fooled the OFP app into wrecking the $ 2bn bomber - while the pilots were unable to do anything to stop it . )
It seems that the current OFP was written in a now - obsolete programming language called JOVIAL .
Northrop are proud to announce that they have figured out how to translate the code into a " newer , more modern programming language called C " .
While it might seem odd to some readers that the US Air Force 's multibillion dollar flagship plane is only now " upgrading " to fairly basic tech , this is commonplace in advanced aerospace and military kit .
The space shuttle 's flight computers , similarly critical to it remaining under control , are likewise basic .
In the early years of the 21st century , the main battle computer of a Royal Navy destroyer was still based around two 24 - bit , 1 MHz processors each with 25 KB of RAM .
Getting back to the B - 2 , Northrop and the US air force expect to start flight testing the new computer upgrades late next year .
There are also a raft of other hardware updates - more bomb racks , massive bunker - penerating superbombs , better comms , better radar etc - planned for coming years . ®

White women cold toward Obama
Barack Obama ’s favorability ratings among white women has declined significantly in recent months , particularly among Democrats and independents , presenting an immediate obstacle for the likely Democratic nominee as he moves to shore up his party ’s base .
According to a new report by The Pew Research Center for the People & the Press , half of white women now have a negative perception of Obama .
Advertisement
Forty - nine percent of white women view Obama unfavorably , while only 43 percent hold a favorable opinion .
In February , 36 percent of these women viewed Obama unfavorably , while 56 percent had a positive perception of the likely Democratic nominee .
Over the same period , Democratic white women ’s negative view of Obama increased from 21 percent to 35 percent , while their positive view decreased from 72 percent to 60 percent — roughly the same rate as white women overall .
White men , in general and among Democrats , have shown only a slight drop - off in their perception of Obama — one - third of the shift seen in white women .
About 20 percent of Democratic white men have an unfavorable view of Obama , a figure which has remained stable since February .
Pew also found that among self - described Clinton supporters , the negative shift against Obama is more severe among women than among men .
The Pew findings come as Obama ’s campaign struggles to close up the primary race while also attempting to avoid the perception of pushing Hillary Rodham Clinton out , for fear of offending her most loyal supporters — the largest bloc of which are white women .
Still unknown is whether white women ’s support for Clinton would translate into problems for Obama in the general election .
Intraparty divisions that arise during the primary season are typically mended over the course of the general election .
Bill Clinton struggled with college - educated Democrats in the 1992 primary , as John F. Kerry did with young Democratic voters in the early stages of the 2004 race .
Both candidates won back these blocs in the general election .
But the Democratic primary race of 2008 is without modern precedent , insofar as black support for Obama and white female support for Clinton are tied up in the symbolism of each candidate ’s historic presidential bid .
“ There is some sense of the visceral investment with Clinton , ” said Celinda Lake , a Democratic strategist .
Lake believes once the general election is under way , these same white women will gradually move away from McCain over issues , with the expectation that Clinton will campaign on Obama ’s behalf if he is the nominee .
“ In the long run , women will watch Hillary Clinton ’s reaction , how she ’s treated by Barack Obama , ” Lake added .
White women as a whole now prefer John McCain over Obama , by 49 percent to 41 percent .
Last month , Obama was ahead of McCain among white women , 49 percent to 46 percent .
The head - to - head matchup between McCain and Obama has not significantly shifted among white men .
“ There is no question that white women were — especially older women , not young women — Hillary Clinton ’s base in the primary , and there is going to be some repair work that has to be done , ” Democratic analyst Anna Greenberg said .
“ There is no reason to believe that these Democratic white women are not pursuable .
“ The priority is going to be to bring back these voters , ” Greenberg added .
Kellyanne Conway , a Republican pollster who has worked with Lake on surveys of women , said that “ the steady shift of white women away from Barack Obama ” could prove “ enduring heading into November . ”
“ These women have two issues at the top of their agenda that require experience and reasonableness — war and economy , ” Conway said .
“ For many of these women , when they hear Barack Obama talk about change they hear revolution , not incrementalism . "
Conway believes that McCain has particular strengths with these women that allow him to be viewed as independent of the Republican brand .
“ Those women will likely vote Democratic down ballot , ” she added .
“ This race is now Barack Obama vs. John McCain . ”
Democrats have come closest to capturing the White House by winning minorities by large margins and nearly splitting white women , as they did in 2000 .
Republicans have generally relied on their dominance with white men to put them in the White House , while winning at least half the vote among white women .

Galaxy Wars : M81 versus M82
Credit : Rainer Zmaritsch & Alexander Gross
Explanation :
On the left , surrounded by blue spiral arms , is spiral galaxy M81 .
On the right marked by red gas and dust clouds , is irregular galaxy M82 .
This stunning vista shows these two mammoth galaxies locked in gravitational combat , as they have been for the past billion years .
The gravity from each galaxy dramatically affects the other during each hundred million - year pass .
Last go - round , M82's gravity likely raised density waves rippling around M81 , resulting in the richness of M81 's spiral arms .
But M81 left M82 with violent star forming regions and colliding gas clouds so energetic the galaxy glows in X - rays .
In a few billion years only one galaxy will remain .

The use of deadly force
[ This post was written over a year ago and shelved because I thought it would n't be of interest to anyone else .
Considering the discussion over Thursday 's post , I 've decided to dust it off and bring it up to date .
This post should not be considered a substitute for knowing the laws in Israel regarding the use of guns .
You can find a nice summary of the laws here . ]
This post was written by a ' gun toting settler ' .
By this I mean that I make my home over the ' green line ' , and I carry a gun during pretty much every waking hour of the day .
I really only started carrying a gun because my daily commute takes me through some potentially problematic areas at odd hours of the day and night .
But , once I was granted a gun license I decided that the safest place for the gun was tucked into the back of my pants and not sitting in the house .
Anyone who thinks that kids can't figure out how to get into a gun safe should read some statistics on accidental shootings .
I also decided that I was every bit as likely to encounter a terrorist in Jerusalem or Tel Aviv ( meaning not very likely ... but a small chance , none - the - less ) as in the south Hevron hills , so I decided to follow the advice of the instructor who administered the licensing test at the range .
He said that anyone who has a gun license should be a responsible citizen and carry all the time .
As an aside , due to the fact that she is home alone for most of the day and that she has to drive alone ( and with the kids ) through potentially problematic areas , my wife also carries a gun ( although you would never know it if you saw her on the street ) .
So yes , we are gun-toting settlers .
I 'm just letting you know up front so you understand the source and weigh what you read here accordingly .
Lately there has been a lot of noise among the gun-toting settler crowd about the draconian rules of engagement associated with the use of deadly force here in Israel .
Oddly enough , there has also been a lot of noise from the anti-gun crowd about the alarming number of Israelis ( I assume they mean people like me ) who are walking around armed .
See ?
Nobody 's happy !
But sadly there are a lot of people on both sides of the issue who are n't sufficiently informed to be able to argue the point intelligently .
The law says you can use your gun only if you , or someone nearby , is in imminent mortal danger .
That means a )
There is someone who has a weapon ( gun , hand grenade , Molotov cocktail , knife , etc. ) that can be used to take your life or the life of someone nearby ; b)
They have the clear intention of using that weapon immediately ; and c )
They have the ability to do so .
Just as those late night investment fund ads usually caution : " Past performance is no guarantee of future results " , one can't legally assume anything about the way an individual or group will act based on what you think you know about them .
You have to actually wait for them to act .
And to justify using deadly force , that ' act ' must place you or someone else in imminent mortal danger .
Mortal Danger = the person(s ) you are about to shoot must have the ability to kill ( not just injure ) , and must give an unmistakable indication that they intend to do so .
Imminent =
Right this very second .
Not five seconds from now and not five seconds ago .
Now .
If you have time to yell instructions to someone ... shoot warning shots in the air ... aim and fire at their legs , etc. , you are going to have a hell of a time convincing the police that the danger was imminent and that you had no other choice but to fire .
There is also the overriding requirement that there be no other way of preventing the other person (s ) from trying to kill you and / or whoever is being threatened except by using deadly force .
Again , the full description of the laws can be found here , but for our purposes that should suffice .
Whenever I have renewed my pistol license and gone through my safety refresher course , I have been reminded by the instructor that I am not a policeman who can draw my gun and begin issuing instructions to a bad guy .
That is not why I 'm allowed to carry a gun .
I can take out my gun and aim it at someone only when I have already arrived at the conclusion that I have no choice but to kill them .
Full stop .
That means all the criteria above have already been met before I pull the thing out .
Another thing that I have been told every time I 've gone to renew my gun license is that if , G - d forbid , I am ever forced to shoot someone - even a 100 % clean / kosher / by - the - book justified shooting .
- I 'd better get myself a good lawyer because I am certainly going to be detained by the police ... and jail time is not out of the question .
Here 's where it becomes important to separate reality from the fantasy most people get from TV and films .
Even in the wake of a real terror attack where you popped the bad guy and saved the day ... the authorities are n't going to arrive on the scene , slap you on the back and congratulate you on your marksmanship .
They are n't going to take in the dead terrorist and decide you were justified and send you on your way .
They are going to take your gun ... and likely take you into custody .
Because , guess what ?
You are the primary suspect in a killing , and the cop on the street is n't authorized to decide if that killing was justified or not .
The way it was explained to me , a ' satisfactory ' outcome will be that the authorities will have a strong suspicion that I had a choice , and will only pull my gun license for a year or two .
More likely I will have to do anywhere from a few months to a few years in prison if the evidence is ambiguous .
And if the evidence is in any way damning , serious jail time could be in the cards .
I hear you ( some of you anyway ) ... this did n't seem particularly fair , right ?
I was told to look at it from a different standpoint .
The nearly impossible burden that is placed on someone who has to decide whether or not to use deadly force is designed to do everything possible to discourage them from pulling the trigger .
Given a choice between killing someone you perceive as a threat or not killing them , a person 's prejudices , life experiences and fears can come into play far too easily .
What the law wants you to be thinking before you even raise your gun , much less pull the trigger , is ' would I rather be killed or be arrested , interrogated , sued and potentially sent to jail ? '
Also , not every scenario takes place on Jaffa road in front of the media .
what if someone attacks you on a dark road ... at night ... when nobody else is around ?
Worse ... what if all of the potential witnesses are unsympathetic ( i.e. Arabs or fellow attackers ) ?
When you put it like that , a lot of people will suddenly come to the conclusion that they do n't really need to shoot ... that they , and the people around them , have time to take cover or drive on ... that the other person might only want to scare them and not necessarily kill them .
Earlier this year the Knesset approved an amendment to the existing law which has become known as the ' Shai Dromi Bill ' .
Here 's a quote from the news that sums up the background nicely :
" The legislation , named for the Negev farmer who in January 2007 shot at a group of people who broke into his farm to steal livestock , killing Khaled el - Atrash .
Dromi was charged with manslaughter , a move that caused a public uproar .
In the ensuing year , bumper - stickers appeared on cars nationwide bearing the phrase " We are all Shai Dromi , " expressing a lack of faith in the police 's ability to stop property crime , particularly in rural areas . "
According to the published report :
" Unlike earlier restrictions on criminal liability in cases of self - defense , under the new law a property owner does not have to face " a real danger to his own or another person 's life , freedom , bodily welfare or property " to justify shooting .
However , " the provision will not apply if the [ property owner 's ] act was manifestly unreasonable under the circumstances in order to repel the intruder or enterer . "
While the bill passed with a large majority ( 44 - 7 ) , in fairness it should be pointed out that not everyone was happy with the outcome :
" MK Zehava Gal - On ( Meretz ) described the bill as " a death penalty for property crime " .
" Thieves and robbers should be punished , but we should not allow property owners to determine an immediate death sentence , " said MK Ahmed Tibi ( United Arab List - Ta'al ) , who mounted a fiery opposition to the bill from the Knesset speaker 's podium . "
It may surprise you to know that I agree with MKs Gal - On and Tibi .
The law , as written , leaves a little too much wiggle room and lacks some important guidelines .
While I seldom refer to Jewish law when it comes to the laws of the modern state of Israel ...
I feel this is a case where Halachah provides some guiding wisdom from which this new law could have benefited .
Under Jewish law , a clear differentiation is made between someone who breaks into a house during the day and one who does so during the night .
Someone who breaks in during the day cannot be automatically assumed to have violent intentions since the likelihood is that they expected to find an empty house .
But someone who breaks in at night MUST be assumed to have violent intentions since people are generally home asleep at night .
In the latter case Jewish law actually describes the night - time burgler as already having the status of having blood on their hands , and requires the home owner to kill them so as not to put himself or whoever else is in the house at risk .
I 'm sure wiser people can elaborate on that so I wo n't flog an already overly - long post .
When I sit down and think about all the things I 've written here , I question my sanity for walking around with a gun .
After all , who needs this ?
The terrible responsibility that comes with the gun license seems to far outweigh any potential benefit .
But then I think about events like those that took place last week ... or the attack earlier this year in the Dimona mall , and suddenly I realize that there is a compelling reason for as many responsible Israelis as possible to be armed ( as stated in my last post ) .
One of last week 's commenters made reference to a terror attack from the mid ' 80s that took place on King George street .
It actually happened right in front of Richie 's Pizza ( where I was working back then ) .
A couple of terrorists had emerged from a store across the street with a shopping bag full of hand grenades .
They calmly walked out to the middle of the street and began tossing the grenades at the crowds on the sidewalks .
By some miracle none of the bystanders were killed .
Even more miraculous , within seconds of the first explosion the terrorists were both laying dead in the street .
They had been killed by armed bystanders .
One of them was even finished off by a civilian whose pistol had jammed and ( foolishly , IMHO ) decided to run out and club the terrorist to death with his jammed weapon .
I do n't entertain the idea that the prospect of armed Israelis serves as a deterrent since most terrorists seem to be perfectly willing to die trying to carry out their attacks .
But you can't even compare the scale of the carnage between what has typically happened here in Israel , and if ( G - d forbid ) something similar were to be attempted in London or New York where the only people walking around with guns are the thinly stretched police .
So , for those who felt that my last post we too ' touchy feely ' , or that it ' nit - picked ' about how to describe the killing of a terrorist instead of simply celebrating the terrorist 's death ... well , this one was for you .

I was certainly surprised when I heard the Supreme court 's ruling but we 've just spent a month in England where the new headlines are full of senseless knife attacks .
Best wishes

Most policemen in London and the UK are not armed , at least not with guns and we are having a big problem with knife attacks at the moment .
I can remember too when we had IRA terrorism , which was mainly bombings on the mainland ( guns were used in the Irish provinces , but I did n't live there and it's not in my range of experiences ) , but even then I did n't feel particularly unsafe .
I 'm not a bleeding heart liberal and I am not generally in the pro-gun lobby , but if I was walking down the street in
Israel and someone began to throw grenades about , or looked as though they were about to blow up a bus , I think I 'd feel just a tad safer knowing that in the event , there was at least the possibility that someone might be able to prevent or lessen the impact ( no pun intended ) by shooting the perpetrator (s ) , whoever they may be .
I suppose it is very easy for people like me who do n't have to acknowledge daily those risks to say that guns are too prevalent and too easy an option , but as you rightly point out , Trep , the consequences of doing so can be enormous .
Would I be able to do it ?
Could I pull the trigger and end someone 's life ?
I really do n't know , but then I do n't have to make that decision in a snapsecond , generally speaking .
I just feel that if I was there , and since I do n't know how to use a gun , let alone be licensed to have one , I would take some comfort knowing that there may be like minded individuals around me who did and who could just possibly save my or someone else 's life by doing so .
Most countries that I 've been to ( US and Europe mostly ) have armed police , but they do n't ( even post 9 - 11 and London / Madrid ) have to face the same level of unpredictability as most Israelis and , whilst not being flippant , I 'm reminded of a joke about a Jewish guy who was captured by a tribe of cannibals .
The Chief of the cannibals granted him a last request and he asked the Chief to kick him in the behind as hard as possible .
When the Chief did this , the Israeli pulled out a gun and shot the Chief and all the cannibals .
When asked why he asked to be kicked , he explained that it was to avoid the risk of being condemned by the UN for reacting to insufficent provocation !
Maybe this is how it feels to live in Isrel at times ?
Maybe one day I 'll get to know when I get around to making a visit ?
Until then I 'll take some views and my cues from here !
PS Glad to hear about Yonah 2.0 and that he 's much better !

Once again the unarmed are caught between the armed to do harm and the armed to prevent harm .
I hear a lot of complaints about the lack of police when we need them , now imagine a world where there were enough police to stop all of these tragedies .
What would that world be like , what would it be like to have an officer on every corner , how would you feel ?
would you feel free ?
would you always feel that someone was watching over or out for you ?
would confidently go on about your life ?
or would you constantly be checking and double checking everything you do to make sure to make sure it was just right since every time you make the slightest slip there would be someone there to catch you in the smallest mistake just like there would be someone to catch the real bad guys who want to hurt someone .
It would also be a terrorists wet dream , all those uniforms would mean rigid responses that could be predicted and once predicted used against them so that a distraction a block away or ten blocks away would leave where they are open and no one to stop them when the grenades are tossed .
Terrorists want rigid security , they want rigid structure , once the uniforms are out of the way they a clear field of unarmed sheeple to slaughter .
Gun free zones are candy stores to terrorists , they just can't get enough .
Places where people are armed and held accountable to a higher standard are more dangerous to them than a military base because they contain guard wolves in sheeple clothing .
So please do n't think that security based on restriction will prevent terrorists or even criminals , it wo n't , all it will do is give them a clearer field of play with more victims .
Would you as a parent rather your child cowered waiting for police to respond to an event or that someone just shot the bugger before the next grenade went your childs way .
The terrorist would much rather wait for the cops or even the military , more time to play in the candy store .

The Nazi spirit lives on in the Israel ... anyone non-Jewish is to have few rights even if citizens because of their religion and they 're to be cordoned off to live in ghettos ... everyone who 's non-white and uses violence to defend himself is a terrorist and Israeli settlers who steal land are legally gun-toting cowboys welcome to finish off anyone who may dare to trespass on what by international law is his ... good luck changing world opinion to accommodate a new holocaust , this time of the Muslim Palestinians -- the Israeli PR machine should be able to achieve that I think !?

I like guns .
I 'm small .
I 'm female .
I 'm not all that co-ordinated -- definitely not the next Karate Kid .
But , with a gun , I am on even footing with the biggest man --even against an expert shot , I have a chance .
Does this mean I 'm then bound by the same sort of rules I 'd expect a big , strong man to follow ?
Surely -- even more so , because guns do n't have a " punch him in the jaw " setting .
In the end , though , I like guns .

a) The taking of life in any circumstance is a step that there ’s no way back from .
If you get spooked easily , you should n’t pack a weapon .
b ) A civilian should not be able to apply capital punishment for a crime ( like cattle - rustling ) , which does not carry the death penalty .
c ) If the army and police were not overstretched they ’d be able to do a better job .
I will not elaborate on this one .

Israelis need to understand that they should n't judge themselves by Western Standards .
They are not in the same situations that Western Nations are in .
They are in the same situation that people in the Old West were in where someone could at any time come up to your homestead and burn it to the ground , where there are Ingins at every pass that could shoot arrows into their stagecoach .
There not having a gun was seen as very irresponsible for in places that had a sheriff which was rare and even if the sheriff was a sober one which was rarer still , the sheriff could be miles away .
In Israel the motto should be every Citizen a Solider meaning that even those who are not members of the IDF should have a gun always at the ready and the knowledge to use it for it should be the responsibility of every Israeli regardless of age to be able to the best of their ability to be able to defend themselves , their family , and their land when the situation arises .

Is there in fact any debate here ?
We are ALL saying the same thing ( apart from one spammer who I wo n't mention ) .
The concept of responsibility includes responsibilty for your family 's and everyone else 's security , and also includes the responsiblity to act wisely and with full knowledge of the consequences of your actions .
Therefore , Scott , Foxfier and I are singing the same song , though the melody may sound different .

I 'm as big a fan of Jewish law as the next Yid , but as a stay - at - home mom , the notion that an intruder 's intentions are more benign during the day than at night rings hollow .
Bad stuff goes down in the day too , and if someone decides to break into my house and finds me there , does that mean he 'll apologize and promise to come back another time when I 'm not home ?
Or not ?
No , the thought that someone could try to enter my house during the day when the neighbors are at work and can't hear the shouts coming from my house does little to comfort me .
While shooting someone for stealing your livestock may seem extreme , what are the options ?
Yell at them to clear off ?
I can hear the laughter .
Try to get a good look at them so you can send the cops chasing after them ?
( What are the chances that the thieves get caught in the end ? )
Is letting thieves steal your stock some act of chesed that 's mandated in halachah ?
Perhaps it 's better midot just to write off the stock loss as a bad day , but I can also see that taking that route is an invitation for a repeat offense .
I 'm not a gun-toting settler yet ( we move to Efrat next month ) but the issues you raise about gun use do give food for thought .

Looking forward to your visit .

Reading the news this morning the debate in the Knesset was about whether the first police to reach the bulldozer should have fired a ' confirmation ' shot into the terrorist to ensure he was dead .
If he had at least one of the victims would have lived .
Tough call .
I say yes , but I feel that the terrorist 's life was forfeit when he turned over the first car .
Alok ... Greetings to you there in Bangalore .
It was nice of you to leave such a thoughtful comment while you are at work ... using a company computer .
I 'll save you the trouble of a response since you will probably be canned by the time this response is posted ... what with me having forwarded your comment ( along with the IP # from which it was sent ) to the Vice President of your company .
Peace .
Foxfier ...
I can see how recreational shooting can be relaxing ... even fun .
I have actually gotten pretty good at it .
However I go to the range about once a month , not for the relaxation .
But because I am terrified that if ( G - d forbid ) I am ever required to shoot I will hesitate out of fear that I will miss the bad guy and hit a bystander .
asher ...
You are still operating under the misguided idea that the army and police are stretched because of the settlements .
They are stretched because of our enemies ' efforts to kill any and all Jews / Israelis .
You need to be reminded every so often whose side you are on .
And I 'm just the guy to do the reminding .
Do n't thank me ... I 'm a giver .
Scott ...
Hey , is that really you ?
Long time no see , buddy !
Welcome back !
Anyway , to your comment ...
First of all , if you read your history , the ' injins ' had more to fear from us white folks than any of the white folks had to fear from them .
But let 's use your analogy .
Actually there is a Sheriff in town .
He 's called the IDF .
However a big chunk of the townspeople seem to have developed a bad case of Stockholm Syndrome and have fallen in love with the ' injins ' .
asher ...
A little choir practice can do us all some good . :-)
Shimshonit ...
I 'm not saying that a person should not be able to shoot an intruder during the day .
I 'm just saying that it should be a harder cause to prove than killing a night - time intruder .
At the end of the day , I doubt any court would convict a woman home alone who shot an armed intruder .
And if he was n't armed when he came in I 'm sure you have an odd paring knife lying around that does n't match any of your sets . :-)
a. ...
He 's long gone . :-)

It is wonderful to read a defense of gun ownership that pays due attention to the immense responsibility of said gun ownership .
I wish more people here in the US thought this way .
Posted by : Lisa | Jul 7 , 2008 6:48:35 PM
treppenwitz , I do n't know if I am the Scott you are thinking of but most likely I am not .
As to your statement , " the ' injins ' had more to fear from us white folks than any of the white folks had to fear from them . " well while ultimately that was correct , it was correct precisely because the settlers had lots and lots of guns .
Indian attacks were common though ( not saying they were justified or not just looking at it as it was ) and white people were killed .
But in the end the settlers would not put up with it and that is why we survived .
As for the Sheriff being the IDF , my point was even with a sheriff the settlers needed to be able to protect themselves because even where there was a sheriff he could be miles and miles away when the men in black hats or the ' ingins ' attacked .
The sheriff expected to have a people with an ability to protect themselves as he would often deputize them .
Without a well armed citizenry it would have been impossible for the sheriff to do his job .
It is all a matter of survival here .
Do you want to survive or not ?
Posted by : Scott | Jul 7 , 2008 7:20:24 PM
Every citizen a solider , that needs to be the attitude of Israelis if they are to survive .
Israelis should make it a national movement to spend lots and lots of time at the gun range just like people in Western countries without conflict spend the night at the movies or bowling .

" ... if ( G - d forbid ) something similar were to be attempted in London or New York where the only people walking around with guns are the thinly stretched police . "
Hmmm .
London I 'll grant you .
I think in New York there are plenty of people who are not the police carrying guns .
There certainly are in my neck of the woods .
BTW , while carrying your weapon is certainly a good way to keep it safe , I assume you sleep at home sometimes .
Get a gun safe if you do n't have one .
All the statistics on accidental shootings that I am aware of indicate it's a good idea .

on women carrying guns , particularly the hiluk made , if any between between military rifles , real clei milchama , and handguns , which I would say are not .
If anyone has any info on Teshuvos , esp. material on the Net , I 'd be appreciative .
And as to the matter of consequences of even the most righteous shooting , as the say in the gun velt , better tried by 12 than carried by 6 .

A regular person thinks about things and then writes about them .
Thousands of viewers have embraced CBC - TV's experiment with BitTorrent , but many Canadians have found their attempts to access a CBC show online restricted by their internet service providers .
On Sunday , CBC offered a final episode of reality TV program Canada 's Next Great Prime Minister for download via BitTorrent , a file - sharing service .
The release was an experiment for the public broadcaster in new ways of offering its programming .
Downloads were in the thousands , said Tessa Sproule , executive in charge of digital programming for factual entertainment at CBC Television .
It is impossible to tell how many people actually saw the program because the files are passed from one computer user to another through BitTorrent , she added .
" It was very promising , " Sproule told CBC News .
" People around the world are seeing the file , probably because it 's the first time . …
We 're very happy about it . "
ISP bottlenecks
However , downloaders who blogged about the experience on the Canada 's Next Great Prime Minister site complained about very long periods required to download the show .
One user received a notice that it could take 2 ½ hours to download , while another was quoted 11 hours .
The bottleneck is occurring because ISPs such as Rogers and Bell limit the amount of bandwidth allocated for file - swapping on BitTorrent .
The controversial practice , called traffic shaping , is meant to stop illegal downloading through BitTorrent .
But it also slows the times on legal downloads such as Canada 's Next Great Prime Minister .
Michael Geist , an Ottawa - based advocate of open sharing over the internet , called the CBC experiment an " enlightened approach to content distribution . "
But he warned that ISP practices could get in the way .
" It would be ironic if ISP network management practices ensured that viewers outside the country enjoyed better access to the program than the Canadian taxpayers who helped fund its creation , " he wrote in his blog .
Some people posting on the show blog said they 'd left their computers running to help speed up downloading through BitTorrent for others .
Most users posting on the blog welcomed the CBC 's experiment with BitTorrent .
" With the state of affairs of Canada 's fading telecommunications industry , it 's fantastic to see that CBC is pressing new boundaries .
Kudos on finding new ways to provide Canadian content , " said a user called Bob .
Others asked for more content to be delivered this way , including favourite shows such as Jpod , Rick Mercer Report , Fifth Estate and the news .
" I 'd like to see more content delivered in this way , without restriction and I can tell you that the majority do not mind ad placement within the content , " said a user called Steven G .
There were complaints about the quality of the download , with some saying the images were distorted .
Sproule said CBC is working on refining the quality of broadcast via BitTorrent .
A company named Vuestar has reportedly been sending out invoices to companies that it believes are making use of its image - linking patents .
The Singapore - based operation appears to be a patent holding firm , the only purpose of which is to license its IP out to other companies .
Vuestar argues that it owns patents in Singapore , Australia , and the US that cover the linking of images ( instead of merely text ) on the web , and therefore everyone that makes use of such a technology needs to pay up .
The patent in question was issued by the US Patent and Trademark Office is titled " Method of locating web - pages by utilising visual images , " which was filed for in 2001 and granted in 2006 .
It describes a system that would list out images from web pages in search results so that users do n't have to follow links to get a visual representation of what they 're looking for .
The links would not necessarily point to images , but could also include video , animation , a mini-screenshot of the web page itself , streaming video , or the logo of the organization that runs the page , among other things .
If you think that description sounds a lot like Google Image Search ( and just about every other image search tool across the web ) , you would be right .
It 's not even limited to image searches anymore — many search engines show images associated with your search terms on the main page , depending on what you 're looking for .
Vuestar 's patent also addresses " a system for locating a web - page using a distributed computing system , " which involves querying a database and displaying a list of linked results .
Hello every search engine ever made !
Given that practically the entirety of Vuestar 's web page addresses licensing — my favorite question in the FAQ is " Why are you invoicing me ? " — it 's obvious that the company believes it is owed for everyone else 's making use of its technologies .
Even just regular old web pages that link to images apparently have to pay up , according to Vuestar .
So for all of you who have blogs or personal sites , stop combining anchor links with image tags in your HTML , immediately !
" If your site is only text and has no images , icons or other patent methods then no license required , " Vuestar says .
Well , that 's a relief .
Unfortunately for Vuestar , sending out invoices to everybody on the web is probably as far as it will ever get with its patents , at least here in the US .
Last April , the US Supreme Court reinvigorated the " obviousness test " used to determine whether a patent should be issued and upheld .
" The results of ordinary innovation are not the subject of exclusive rights under the patent laws , " Justice Anthony Kennedy wrote at the time .
" Were it otherwise , patents might stifle rather than promote the progress of useful arts . "
Since then , the decision has been used with varying degrees of success , like RealNetworks ' fight with Friskit over streaming multimedia .
If Vuestar were to ever try and sue US - based companies and website administrators for patent infringement , it might run headfirst into the Supreme Court 's ruling and fail the obviousness test .
There are also prior art issues — after all , there 's no possible way that Vuestar first came up with linking to images as " late " as 2001 — although the company claims on its website that it is " not in any way relying on or offending any third parties ’ prior art . "
As for Singapore , things might be a bit trickier .
An alert ( PDF ) from Singapore - based law firm Keystone Law says , " We believe that this development would have a wide - ranging impact on the Internet community in Singapore ...
We therefore believe that the claims of Vuestar should be taken seriously and urge clients to seek legal counsel . "

Channel 4 has assembled look - a- likes of The Shining 's cast and crew members Channel 4 Creative Services
The 65 - second promotional spot has been filmed as a one - take tracking shot through the recreation of The Shining set .
Viewers get Kubrick 's point of view as he walks through the set , ending up in his director 's chair as the crew prepare to shoot the famous scene of Danny Torrance , the son of Duvall and Jack Nicholson 's characters , riding round and round the deserted corridors of the Overlook Hotel .
The promo , filmed as a single tracking shot with a cast of 55 actors , was meticulously researched to " remain as faithful as possible to the period in which it was shot and the culture of the British studio in the late 1970s " .
Channel 4 Creative Services , the broadcaster 's in - house creative resource , cast people who resembled Kubrick 's own crew including his script lady , assistant director and director of production , John Alcott , who also worked on films including 2001 : A Space Odyssey and A Clockwork Orange with the director .
Look - a - likes were also found for Duvall , Danny Lloyd , who played Danny Torrance , and the twin girls who appear fleetingly in the film .
Most of the equipment that appears in the promotional clip was actually used in the filming of The Shining .
Many of the props that appear , including the tricycle and Kubrick 's script , were produced for the promotional clip based on photos or sketches from the late director 's archives .
The spot , which was shot over two days at London 's Bray Studios , was filmed using a 25 mm Cooke lens – a favourite of Kubrick's .
It promotes the season of 10 Kubrick films to be broadcast on More 4 from July 15 .
Jon Ronson 's documentary , Citizen Kubrick , will air ahead of the start of the first film .
The promotional clip will run across Channel 4 and More 4 in the run up to the start of the season .

Male homosexuality is difficult to explain under strictly Darwinian evolutionary models , because carriers of genes predisposing towards male homosexuality would be likely to reproduce less than average , suggesting that alleles influencing homosexuality should progressively disappear from a population .
Partly due to that , homosexuality in males is thought to have both psycho-social factors and genetic components .
This is suggested by the high concordance of sexual orientation in identical twins and the fact that homosexuality is more common in males belonging to the maternal line of male homosexuals .
These effects have not been shown for female homosexuality , indicating that these two phenomena may have very different origins and dynamics .
An Italian research team , consisting of Andrea Camperio Ciani and Giovanni Zanzotto at the University of Padova and Paolo Cermelli at the University of Torino , found that the evolutionary origin and maintenance of male homosexuality in human populations could be explained by a model based around the idea of sexually antagonistic selection , in which genetic factors spread in the population by giving a reproductive advantage to one sex while disadvantaging the other .
Previous work by Camperio Ciani and collaborators , published in 2004 , showed that females in the maternal line of male homosexuals were more fertile than average , giving less weight to the idea that alleles influencing homosexuality should progressively disappear from a population .
Challenged by all these empirical data , the authors considered a range of different hypotheses for the genetic diffusion of male homosexuality .
These included : the genetic maternal effects on sons , the heterozygote advantage ( as is found in malaria resistance ) , and " sexually antagonistic selection . "
The latter is a particular aspect of Darwinian evolution , in which genetic factors spread in the population by giving a reproductive advantage to one sex while disadvantaging the other .
This type of evolution has been previously found in insects , birds , and some mammals , but never in humans .
To discover and clarify the dynamics of the genetic factors for homosexuality , the researchers had to screen a large set of models and exclude them one by one .
They concluded that the only possible model was that of sexually antagonistic selection .
The other models did not fit the empirical data , either implying that the alleles would become extinct too easily or invade the population , or failing to describe the distribution patterns of male homosexuality and female fecundity observed in the families of homosexuals .
Only the model of sexually antagonistic selection involving at least two genes – at least one of which must be on the X chromosome ( inherited in males only through their mother ) – accounted for all the known data .
The results of this model show the interaction of male homosexuality with increased female fecundity within human populations , in a complex dynamic , resulting in the maintenance of male homosexuality at stable and relatively low frequencies , and highlighting the effects of heredity through the maternal line .
These findings provide new insights into male homosexuality in humans .
In particular , they promote a focus shift in which homosexuality should not be viewed as a detrimental trait ( due to the reduced male fecundity it entails ) , but , rather , should be considered within the wider evolutionary framework of a characteristic with gender - specific benefits , and which promotes female fecundity .
This may well be the evolutionary origin of this genetic trait in human beings .
The possible widespread occurrence of sexually antagonistic characteristics in evolutionary processes , which play their evolutionary game by giving a fecundity benefit to one sex while disadvantaging the other , has only recently begun to be appreciated .
This is understood as a key mechanism through which high levels of genetic variation are maintained in biological populations .
Male homosexuality is just the first example of an unknown number of sexually antagonistic traits , which contribute to the maintenance of the natural genetic variability of humans .
The new perspectives opened by the models developed for sexually antagonistic selection may also contribute to a better understanding of most genetically - based sexual conflicts , which are , at present , poorly understood in humans .
An unexpected implication of the new models concerns the impact that the sexually antagonistic genetic factors for male homosexuality have on the overall fecundity of a population .
The findings suggest that the proportion of male homosexuals may signal a corresponding proportion of females with higher fecundity .
Consequently , these factors always contribute , all else being equal , a positive net increase of the fecundity of the whole population , when compared to populations in which such factors are lower or absent .
This increase grows as the population baseline fecundity decreases ; this means that the genes influencing male homosexuality end up playing the role of a buffer effect on any external factors lowering the overall fecundity of the whole population .

You do n't need me to tell you it 's awful out there .
You do n't need me to tell you that there 's no quick fix for any of these things .
But what might help you understand why it feels so bad this time is that I have never , in my career , seen so many companies go off track at the same time .
This is one unbelievable moment , and it is made more horrible by the day as companies ' stocks just get pummeled , causing people to then question the very viability of the companies involved .
First , obviously , are

We do n't know what will happen , but we do know that their futures are much darker than their pasts .
Their best hope : a Democrat becomes president and shows the usual love to both .
But as investments , they are pretty much perma-losers going forward .
The losses are that heavy .
Yes , it is true that two years from now they will be better , but will the government let them limp through to that ?
View them as calls on a Democratic win .
We all know that
Citigroup

Bank of America

says it is n't in trouble , but obviously the market does n't believe management because the stock failed to rally when it said its dividend was safe .
Any short - selling hedge fund could hire 30 actors and have them line up at a Washington Mutual or two and get a bank run going .
Then we would have to hear about a " hasty " Treasury department plan to bail out WM .
Hasty ?
How can these guys not see it coming ?
(
Securities and Exchange Commission
Chairman Christopher Cox on Tuesday said the regulator
planned to crack down
on naked short - selling of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac , helping to lift financial stocks in afternoon trading .
Cox said in testimony to the Senate Banking Committee on Tuesday that the agency will require short - sellers " to pre-borrow shares " of the two government - sponsored mortgage giants and broker - dealers , including
Lehman Brothers
( LEH ) ,
Goldman Sachs
( GS ) - Get Report

Merrill Lynch
( MER ) and

Chairman Ben Bernanke .
Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson also provided testimony and further clarification on the proposed

Golly gee , who is paying them anything ?
They do n't have enough money to pay the bank back for heaven 's sake !
For example , they are very important to

The problem is that the dire stocks , the ones I have listed , are so numerous and so concentrated with so little hope for rescue that it is hard to imagine anything but more downside for these stocks and therefore more downside for the rest of the market , simply because they are so glaring , are owned by so many mutual funds and have so many roles to play in the real economy .
We know that things have gotten out of control because the IndyMac collapse -- widely predicted -- used a huge amount of the surplus the FDIC has , suddenly making the safety net seem like a flimsy piece of Brawny .
The bottom line here -- there is too much going wrong right now , too much to put us anywhere near sound footing .
I suspect that every rally will be met with selling until we see a multitude of collapses like IndyMac .
I am not going to search for positives in any of these groups yet , and if they rally off the decision by the Treasury to make more explicit the Fannie and Freddie guarantees , I would scale out of them once again on any short squeeze like the one we had at yesterday 's opening .
Someone asked me yesterday , " When do we bottom ? "
I said it would n't be until all the banks that have to fail do so and GM files bankruptcy along with Ford .
I said it matter - of - factly , because I meant it and because it is obvious .

As Californians brace for big reductions in government services , the possibility of tax hikes and a long summer of budget bickering , they may be under the impression that everyone else is slogging through the same financial misery .
Not so .
Although the nation ’s sluggish economy and mortgage crisis have put the squeeze on a number of states , many are humming along fine , without dramatic measures to keep them in the black .
Some even have multibillion - dollar surpluses .
And almost none of the states that do have fiscal difficulties face shortfalls on the scale of California’s .
Analysts say the state ’s troubles stem largely from its budget system -- the most dysfunctional in the country -- and they look to California as an example of how not to do things .
In a recent ranking of state policies by the Pew Center on the States , California scored D+ on fiscal management .
The average grade was B - .

“ We have these problems that have long been understood , but we do n’t deal with them , ” said Jim Mayer , executive director of California Forward , a bipartisan think tank seeking to overhaul the budget process .
“ If we are going to fix this , we need to learn from what they have done in other places . ”
Of the 46 states that began their fiscal year on Tuesday , California is one of just four that still have no spending plan .
Lawmakers are nowhere near agreement on how to patch a $ 15.2 - billion shortfall , and the budget will probably include borrowing , accounting shifts and other maneuvers that make money managers cringe .
An outdated tax code , voter - approved initiatives that lock in billions of dollars for programs , inadequate oversight of spending and the lack of a substantial rainy - day fund all add to California ’s financial ills .
Other states have addressed such issues with impressive results .
But attempts at similar changes here routinely fall flat .
Virginia has achieved a balanced budget and a stellar credit rating by constantly updating its spending priorities , improving its tax system and setting funds aside to be tapped during hard economic times .
The state is zealous about oversight , embedding independent investigators in state agencies to monitor how they are spending taxpayers ’ money .

Iowa , Maryland and Utah employ some of the same techniques , and there is momentum for such reforms in Ohio , Louisiana and Kentucky .
It is not just small states with limited government services that have a firm grasp on their finances , officials at the Pew Center point out .
Places that have large , diverse populations and spend generously have also figured it out .
Some experts say the root of California ’s problem is its unusual requirement of a two - thirds majority for the Legislature to approve budget - related measures .
That standard exists in only two other states , Rhode Island and Arkansas , neither of which is nearly as complicated to govern as California .
Daniel J.B. Mitchell , a professor of public policy at UCLA , said the two - thirds rule has paralyzed a Legislature that is already intensely polarized .
“ The years go by and we do n’t address these fundamental things , ” he said , “ and here we are in a budget crisis again . ”

Every change to the budget threatens to cost someone big money .
Special interests are organized and ready to protect their turf .
They have the ear of lawmakers who , as a result of term limits , constantly have their eye on the next office and are reluctant to rile their political patrons .
Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger took a crack at forcing the state to , in his words , “ live within its means ” in 2005 , when he called a special election to address state government issues .
His plan was to put a strict limit on how much spending could grow every year .
Democrats said it would strangle government and voters rejected it .
Other states have taken a more moderate approach and succeeded .
Over the last decade , many have adopted laws requiring them to build substantial reserves , some as much as 10 % of the general fund .
In Washington state , the first 1 % of revenue the state collects automatically goes into such a fund .
Georgia is weathering the economic downturn with ease , having built a rainy - day fund that equals about 10 % of its budget .
Nebraska , a state that spends just $ 3.5 billion a year , has socked away $ 500 million .
Advertisement
In California , the leader of the Assembly ’s minority Republicans , Mike Villines of Clovis , says he is perplexed by why California is not building a significant reserve .
He said the issue came up during a chat he had with Michelle Bachelet , the Socialist president of Chile , when she visited the Capitol recently .
“ She is a former communist , and she was talking about how you have to have a rainy - day fund to balance ups and downs , ” Villines said .
“ If it is good enough for Chile and a former communist , it should be good enough for California . ”
Another area where change has been resisted is the state ’s reliance on income taxes , a volatile revenue source that plunges when the economy slows .
Reformers are perpetually calling for revisions in the tax code that would bring more stability .
Virginia , for example , has changed its tax code 15 times in the last 20 years to stay current .
The roadblock in California is largely Proposition 13 , which limits property tax increases .
Longtime residents and businesses have some of the lowest property taxes in the country because of that citizen initiative .
If the state were to rely less on income taxes , property taxes might have to rise .
Advertisement
Lawmakers do n’t want to deliver that kind of news to voters .
Proposition 13 is known in Sacramento as the “ third rail ” of California politics :
Touch it , and your political career is dead .
So California continues to get nearly half its revenue from income tax , and once again finds itself in trouble .
That ’s not the case in most other states , which collect their revenues from a more diverse mix of sources .
Beyond the revenue issue is how the state spends its money .
California ’s financial oversight has yet to impress policy analysts .
Neal Johnson , director of the government performance project at the Pew Center on the States , said other places look carefully at how well government programs are meeting their objectives when deciding how much cash to provide them .
Agency heads must show results , inefficiencies are rooted out , management techniques that have proved effective in the private sector are encouraged .

But such an approach “ has not gained traction in California the way it has in other states , ” Johnson said .

WASHINGTON  Alarmed about the sharply eroding confidence in the nation ’s two largest mortgage finance companies , the Bush administration will ask Congress to approve a rescue package that would give the government the authority to buy billions of dollars in stock in Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and also lend to the companies to meet their short - term funding needs , people briefed about the plan said on Sunday .
Separately , the Federal Reserve voted on Sunday to also open a lending facility for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac , if they need emergency capital .
The two companies would be able to post their own securities as collateral .
The plan calls on Congress to give the government the authority over the next two years to buy an unspecified amount of stock in the two companies .
Over the same period of time , it would permit the companies to have greater access to the Treasury , by expanding the credit line that each company has from the Treasury .
Each company now has a $ 2.25 billion credit line , set nearly 40 years ago by Congress .
At the time , Fannie had only about $ 15 billion in outstanding debt .
It now has total debt of about $ 800 billion , while Freddie has about $ 740 billion .
Today the two companies also hold or guarantee mortgages valued at more than $ 5 trillion .
As part of the plan , the administration will also call on Congress to raise the national debt limit , people briefed on the plan said .
And it will ask Congress to give the Federal Reserve a role in setting the rules for how big a capital cushion each company must hold .
Giving the Fed a consulting role in the companies ’ oversight is seen as yet another way to reassure nervous markets .
Environmental groups have been warning for years that tense parts of the world could get even worse with the advent of global climate change , and even spark whole new conflicts .
Now , the nation 's spies are saying pretty much the same thing .
The U.S. intelligence community has finished up its classified assessment of how our changing weather patterns could contribute to " political instability around the world , the collapse of governments and the creation of terrorist safe havens , " * Inside Defense * reports .
Congress was briefed on the report last week .
And on Wednesday , leading spies – including National Intelligence Council chairman Dr. Thomas Fingar and Energy Department intelligence chief Rolf Mowatt - Larsen – will testify on the Hill about the 58 - page document , " The National Security Implications of Global Climate Change Through 2030 . "
* In addition to examining how weather could add stress to governments with a weak grip on power ... the authors mulled a spectrum of second - and third - order consequences for
Washington policymakers to consider – including indirect security concerns like impacts on economies , energy , social unrest and migration .
* Foreign - policy concerns were also weighed , including how flooding , rising water levels or drought might create humanitarian crises .
Also examined was how extreme weather events could challenge the response capabilities of governments around the world .
" Climate change is a threat multiplier in the world 's most unstable regions , " a source familiar with the document tells Danger Room .
" It 's like a match to the tinder . "
Just think about the fights over water already under way in the Middle East and Africa , or the tensions exacerbated by the hurricanes and tsunamis in Asia .
The document was originally supposed to be unclassified .
But then the policy recommendations – and warnings about trouble spots – got more and more detailed .
* Richard Engel , deputy national intelligence officer for science and technology ... said in a little - noticed speech last month at the
University of Delaware that if the findings of the assessment were made public , “ It would frustrate the execution of U.S. foreign policy . ” * *“ We wanted to get down to something that might be actionable for the policy community , ” Engel , a former Air Force major general and test pilot , said .
“ So we had to be very specific . ” *
" Generally , the Earth 's climate is changing , it has always been changing , so that 's not anything but a blinding flash of the obvious , " Engel added .
" We really want to understand extreme weather events because they are very important as they potentially put at risk the infrastructure . "
The assessment is stamped
“ confidential , ” the lowest level of classification .
And our source says that Fingar & Co. is promising that nearly all of the document will come out in Wednesday 's hearing , before a joint session of the House Select Committee on Energy Independence and Global Warming and the Intelligence Community Management Subcommittee .
Also testifying are former British Foreign Minister Margaret Beckett , retired AdmiralPaul Gaffney and the Army War College 's Kent Hughes Butts , all of whom have previously raised alarms about climate change 's strategic impact .
Lee Lane , with the American Enterprise Institute , has been pushing the issue of " geoengineering " in response to global warming .
And Marlo Lewis , with the Competitive Enterprise Institute , calls the whole thing a " myth . "
Lewis ' presence before the panel may be a bit of a sop for the Republicans on the Intelligence Committee , many of whom opposed the idea of using the nation 's spies to investigate these issues at all .
But the nation 's military leadership , at least , is paying closer attention .
" Climate change and other projected trends will compound already difficult conditions in many developing countries .
These trends will increase the likelihood of humanitarian crises , the potential for epidemic diseases , and regionally destabilizing population migrations , " the Army says in its 2008 posture statement .
" We are [ f ] acing challenges from multiple sources : a new , more malignant form of terrorism inspired by jihadist extremism , ethnic strife , disease , poverty , climate change , failed and failing states , resurgent powers , and so on , " Defense Secretary Robert Gates told an audience at American University in April .

Why Software Should Not Have Owners
by Richard Stallman
Digital information technology contributes to the world by making it easier to copy and modify information .
Computers promise to make this easier for all of us .
Not everyone wants it to be easier .
The system of copyright gives software programs “ owners ” , most of whom aim to withhold software 's potential benefit from the rest of the public .
They would like to be the only ones who can copy and modify the software that we use .
The copyright system grew up with printing — a technology for mass - production copying .
Copyright fit in well with this technology because it restricted only the mass producers of copies .
It did not take freedom away from readers of books .
An ordinary reader , who did not own a printing press , could copy books only with pen and ink , and few readers were sued for that .
Digital technology is more flexible than the printing press : when information has digital form , you can easily copy it to share it with others .
This very flexibility makes a bad fit with a system like copyright .
That 's the reason for the increasingly nasty and draconian measures now used to enforce software copyright .
Consider these four practices of the Software Publishers Association ( SPA ) :
Massive propaganda saying it is wrong to disobey the owners to help your friend .
Solicitation for stool pigeons to inform on their coworkers and colleagues .
Raids ( with police help ) on offices and schools , in which people are told they must prove they are innocent of illegal copying .
Prosecution ( by the US government , at the SPA 's request ) of people such as MIT 's David LaMacchia , not for copying software ( he is not accused of copying any ) , but merely for leaving copying facilities unguarded and failing to censor their use . [ 1 ]
All four practices resemble those used in the former Soviet Union , where every copying machine had a guard to prevent forbidden copying , and where individuals had to copy information secretly and pass it from hand to hand as samizdat .
There is of course a difference : the motive for information control in the Soviet Union was political ; in the US the motive is profit .
But it is the actions that affect us , not the motive .
Any attempt to block the sharing of information , no matter why , leads to the same methods and the same harshness .
Owners make several kinds of arguments for giving them the power to control how we use information :
Name calling .
Owners use smear words such as “ piracy ” and “ theft ” , as well as expert terminology such as “ intellectual property ” and “ damage ” , to suggest a certain line of thinking to the public — a simplistic analogy between programs and physical objects .
Our ideas and intuitions about property for material objects are about whether it is right to take an object away from someone else .
They do n't directly apply to making a copy of something .
But the owners ask us to apply them anyway .
Exaggeration .
Owners say that they suffer “ harm ” or “ economic loss ” when users copy programs themselves .
But the copying has no direct effect on the owner , and it harms no one .
The owner can lose only if the person who made the copy would otherwise have paid for one from the owner .
A little thought shows that most such people would not have bought copies .
Yet the owners compute their “ losses ” as if each and every one would have bought a copy .
That is exaggeration — to put it kindly .
The law .
Owners often describe the current state of the law , and the harsh penalties they can threaten us with .
Implicit in this approach is the suggestion that today 's law reflects an unquestionable view of morality — yet at the same time , we are urged to regard these penalties as facts of nature that can't be blamed on anyone .
This line of persuasion is n't designed to stand up to critical thinking ; it 's intended to reinforce a habitual mental pathway .
It 's elementary that laws do n't decide right and wrong .
Every American should know that , in the 1950s , it was against the law in many states for a black person to sit in the front of a bus ; but only racists would say sitting there was wrong .
Natural rights .
Authors often claim a special connection with programs they have written , and go on to assert that , as a result , their desires and interests concerning the program simply outweigh those of anyone else — or even those of the whole rest of the world .
( Typically companies , not authors , hold the copyrights on software , but we are expected to ignore this discrepancy . )
To those who propose this as an ethical axiom — the author is more important than you — I can only say that I , a notable software author myself , call it bunk .
But people in general are only likely to feel any sympathy with the natural rights claims for two reasons .
One reason is an overstretched analogy with material objects .
When I cook spaghetti , I do object if someone else eats it , because then I can not eat it .
His action hurts me exactly as much as it benefits him ; only one of us can eat the spaghetti , so the question is , which one ?
The smallest distinction between us is enough to tip the ethical balance .
But whether you run or change a program I wrote affects you directly and me only indirectly .
Whether you give a copy to your friend affects you and your friend much more than it affects me .
I should n't have the power to tell you not to do these things .
No one should .
The second reason is that people have been told that natural rights for authors is the accepted and unquestioned tradition of our society .
As a matter of history , the opposite is true .
The idea of natural rights of authors was proposed and decisively rejected when the US Constitution was drawn up .
That 's why the Constitution only permits a system of copyright and does not require one ; that 's why it says that copyright must be temporary .
It also states that the purpose of copyright is to promote progress — not to reward authors .
Copyright does reward authors somewhat , and publishers more , but that is intended as a means of modifying their behavior .
The real established tradition of our society is that copyright cuts into the natural rights of the public — and that this can only be justified for the public 's sake .
Economics .
The final argument made for having owners of software is that this leads to production of more software .
Unlike the others , this argument at least takes a legitimate approach to the subject .
It is based on a valid goal — satisfying the users of software .
And it is empirically clear that people will produce more of something if they are well paid for doing so .
But the economic argument has a flaw : it is based on the assumption that the difference is only a matter of how much money we have to pay .
It assumes that production of software is what we want , whether the software has owners or not .
People readily accept this assumption because it accords with our experiences with material objects .
Consider a sandwich , for instance .
You might well be able to get an equivalent sandwich either gratis or for a price .
If so , the amount you pay is the only difference .
Whether or not you have to buy it , the sandwich has the same taste , the same nutritional value , and in either case you can only eat it once .
Whether you get the sandwich from an owner or not cannot directly affect anything but the amount of money you have afterwards .
This is true for any kind of material object — whether or not it has an owner does not directly affect what it is , or what you can do with it if you acquire it .
But if a program has an owner , this very much affects what it is , and what you can do with a copy if you buy one .
The difference is not just a matter of money .
The system of owners of software encourages software owners to produce something — but not what society really needs .
And it causes intangible ethical pollution that affects us all .
What does society need ?
It needs information that is truly available to its citizens — for example , programs that people can read , fix , adapt , and improve , not just operate .
But what software owners typically deliver is a black box that we can't study or change .
Society also needs freedom .
When a program has an owner , the users lose freedom to control part of their own lives .
And , above all , society needs to encourage the spirit of voluntary cooperation in its citizens .
When software owners tell us that helping our neighbors in a natural way is “ piracy ” , they pollute our society 's civic spirit .
This is why we say that free software is a matter of freedom , not price .
The economic argument for owners is erroneous , but the economic issue is real .
Some people write useful software for the pleasure of writing it or for admiration and love ; but if we want more software than those people write , we need to raise funds .
Since the 1980s , free software developers have tried various methods of finding funds , with some success .
There 's no need to make anyone rich ; a typical income is plenty of incentive to do many jobs that are less satisfying than programming .
For years , until a fellowship made it unnecessary , I made a living from custom enhancements of the free software I had written .
Each enhancement was added to the standard released version and thus eventually became available to the general public .
Clients paid me so that I would work on the enhancements they wanted , rather than on the features I would otherwise have considered highest priority .
Some free software developers make money by selling support services .
In 1994 , Cygnus Support , with around 50 employees , estimated that about 15 percent of its staff activity was free software development — a respectable percentage for a software company .
In the early 1990s , companies including Intel , Motorola , Texas Instruments and Analog Devices combined to fund the continued development of the GNU C compiler .
Most GCC development is still done by paid developers .
The GNU compiler for the Ada language was funded in the 90s by the US Air Force , and continued since then by a company formed specifically for the purpose .
The free software movement is still small , but the example of listener - supported radio in the US shows it 's possible to support a large activity without forcing each user to pay .
As a computer user today , you may find yourself using a proprietary program .
If your friend asks to make a copy , it would be wrong to refuse .
Cooperation is more important than copyright .
But underground , closet cooperation does not make for a good society .
A person should aspire to live an upright life openly with pride , and this means saying no to proprietary software .
You deserve to be able to cooperate openly and freely with other people who use software .
You deserve to be able to learn how the software works , and to teach your students with it .
You deserve to be able to hire your favorite programmer to fix it when it breaks .
You deserve free software .

A Cambodian teenager was recovering in hospital after a puffer fish attacked him in the groin , local media reported on Tuesday .
The Khmer - language Koh Santepheap daily ran a picture of the unnamed 13 - year - old in a hospital bed with heavy strapping around his testicles , saying he was lucky to be alive .
The paper quoted the boy 's father , Sok Ly , as saying the fish had become enraged when it was accidentally trapped in the boy 's net and , when it was freed , had attacked the boy 's scrotum .
Nearly half of British troops regularly consider quitting the army and navy because of plummeting morale , poor equipment and low pay , a Ministry of Defence survey of more than 24,000 military personnel has found .
Some 47 % of soldiers and army officers periodically considered handing in their resignation .
The proportion was the same among Royal Navy personnel , while the figure was 44 % in the RAF .
It is the first study of its kind to gauge joint attitudes across the army , navy and RAF and reveals alarming levels of stress and unhappiness among service personnel .
The research is likely to call into question Britain 's ability to sustain campaigns in Afghanistan and Iraq .
Many of those questioned highlighted the pressures of fighting on two fronts , while 45 % said they were not happy with the level of separation from friends and family .
Some 38 % said the short gaps between tours of duty made them more likely to leave the forces .
In the army , nearly three - fifths of those questioned rated the level of morale as " low " or " very low " , although individuals said their personal morale level was high .
In the RAF , three - quarters thought morale was low , compared with 64 % in the Royal Navy and 38 % in the Royal Marines .
The survey was carried out between July and October last year - a time when more than 30 personnel died in the two main combat zones .
But since then the casualty rate has remained high , particularly in Afghanistan .
Patrick Mercer , the Tory MP for Newark and a former commanding officer , said the findings reflected the strains on military personnel .
" I think the tempo of operations has produced such a level of stress on the families that it is no wonder so many are thinking of leaving . "
The armed forces minister Derek Twigg said : " Since the survey was conducted we have already implemented a number of important changes , such as the recent pay rise , an adjustment to the operational bonus and the introduction of childcare vouchers .
Over the next 10 years , we are also spending £ 8.4bn on accommodation , an area that is a high priority . "
He said the government was planning to bring forward more measures to improve conditions later this month , and there was " always more that can be done " .
In the past , regular Continuous Attitude Surveys have been carried out separately for each of the services .
Last November the head of the British Army expressed concerns about poor morale and raised the issue of the strain on resources from operations in Iraq and Afghanistan .
General Sir Richard Dannatt said soldiers felt " devalued , angry and suffering from Iraq fatigue " , and catalogued disquiet on a wide range of issues facing soldiers , including poor housing .

As the above page from Milk Matters coloring book demonstrates , the point is not so much promotion of toothpaste but rather deadly fluoride ( note the title on the tube ) .
Brainwashing kids and parents alike is apparently the mission of the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development and the National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research .
In order to indoctrinate the little ones and make sure they get their dose of fluoride , these bureaucracies have published a coloring book , available here in PDF format .
As the page capture at right demonstrates , the point is not so much promotion of toothpaste but rather deadly fluoride ( note the title on the tube ) .
It ’s all part of the global elite ’s eugenics and dumbing - down program .
There is plenty of research , studiously ignored by the corporate media , that indicates fluoride not only dumb - downs children and adults alike , but is a killer .
In 1995 , neurotoxicologist and former Director of toxicology at Forsyth Dental Center in Boston , Dr. Phyllis Mullenix published research showing that fluoride permanent effects the brain .
“ The toxic effects of fluoride on the central nervous system was subsequently confirmed by previously - classified government research .
Two new epidemiological studies which tend to confirm fluoride ’s neurotoxic effects on the brain have shown that children exposed to higher levels of fluoride had lower IQs , ” writes the Holistic Healing web page .
In addition , small levels of fluoride created “ histologic lesions in their brain similar to Alzheimer ’s disease and dementia . ”
Moreover , according to a study conducted by Varner et al. , exposure to fluoride caused “ damage to the blood brain barrier . ”
The Department of Health in New Jersey found that bone cancer in male children was between two and seven times greater in areas where water was fluoridated .
U.S. Environmental Protection Agency ( EPA ) researchers confirmed the bone cancer - causing effects of fluoride at low levels .
In fact , fluoride build up in the bones and causes adverse changes to bone structure .
Fluoride is a perfect weapon for the eugenicists , as a toxicologist in the United Kingdom recently found that perinatal deaths in a fluoridated area was 15 % higher than in neighboring non-fluoridated areas .
The fluoridated area had a higher socio-economic status and would have been expected to have less perinatal deaths .
The fluoridated area also had a 30 % higher rate of Down ’s Syndrome .
Chile banned fluoridation because of research by the world - renowned researcher , Dr Albert Schatz , which showed a link to infant deaths due to fluoridation .
Research also discovered that fluoride “ impairs the functioning of the immune system .
In the United States , where toxic fluoride compounds are regularly added to water and given to children since the 1960s and 1970s , we are beginning to see an overwhelming number of people of that generation who are developing chronic immune system disorders , ” the above cited web site notes .
Double - blind studies revealed additional adverse affects , including : gastrointestinal symptoms , stomatitis , joint pains , polydipsia , headaches , visual disturbances , muscular weakness , and extreme tiredness .
For more information on these double - blind studies , check out the review of Fluoride : The Freedom Fight , by Dr. Hans Moolenburgh of the Netherlands .
Other studies indicate exposure to fluoride increases the risk to contamination from lead , arsenic and radio nuclides since fluoride compounds are toxic waste byproducts which largely come from pollution generated by scrubbers of fertilizer plants ( see this study ’s abstract ) .
Add to the list exacerbation of Repetitive Stress Injury , osteoarthritis , suppression of the and thyroid function , and more .
Finally , contrary to the assertion of the coloring book , fluoride causes dental fluorosis in children , that is to say it causes permanent adverse structural change to the teeth .
You ’d think the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development and the National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research would be aware of the above research .
No doubt they probably are , while many others working and volunteering for these “ institutes ” are unaware of the research and believe they are promoting dental health .
In fact , what they are promoting is the eugenics agenda to dumb - down and kill off large numbers of people , including no shortage of children .

Eoconfuciusornis zhengi , skeleton and feather impressions .
Photo by Dr Zhoiu Zhonghe
Details of a fabulous new fossil bird from the world - famous fossil deposits of Liaoning in China , are published this week in the journal Science in China .
Details of the bird's bone structure and feathers are exquisitely preserved .
The new bird , Eoconfuciusornis is the oldest known confuciusornithid , a group unique to China .
It therefore represents an early stage in bird evolution .
Confuciusornithids lived from 120 - 131 million years ago and include the oldest birds with horny beaks .
The fossil deposits of Liaoning , called collectively the Jehol Group , span much of the Early Cretaceous .
Eoconfuciusornis falls between Archaeopteryx ( 150 million years ) and the bulk of the Liaoning birds ( 125 million years ) , and it shows an intermediate stage in the improvement of bird flying capabilities .
Most bird fossils come from the Jiufotang and Yixian groups , dated about 125 - 120 million years , but the Dabeigou Formation where Eoconfuciusornis was found is 131 million years , so giving a span of 11 million years of evolution of this particular bird group .
The research was carried out at the University of Bristol by Dr Zhang Fucheng during 2005 - 6 in the Department of Earth Sciences .
Professor Mike Benton who supervised Dr Zhang Fucheng when he was at Bristol said : “ China never ceases to amaze , with remarkable new fossils being found again and again .
The Eoconfuciusornis fossil is hugely important in plugging a major gap in our knowledge of bird evolution immediately after Archaeopteryx . ”

ANNANDALE , Va. ( MarketWatch ) --
Here is today 's investment pop quiz :
Does the stock market perform better during Democratic or Republican presidencies ?
The answers provided by almost everyone of whom I ask this question are almost unanimous :
The stock market does better under Republican presidents .
They 're wrong .
Consider the data compiled by Ned Davis Research , an institutional research firm .
In a communication to his clients Thursday morning , Davis reported that the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA , - 0.47 % produced an annualized return of 7.21 % during Democratic presidents , in contrast to an average of 3.6 % during Republican presidents -- or almost precisely half as much , in other words .
Davis hastened to add that he is a political independent , and I should add that during my lifetime I have voted more often for Libertarian presidential candidates than for candidates of either of the major parties .
So please do n't accuse Davis of biasing his results , or my choosing to write a column on his research , for partisan political reasons .
To be sure , inflation is also higher on average during Democratic presidencies , so on an inflation - adjusted basis there is a smaller difference between the stock market 's average returns during presidencies of the two parties .
But the Democratic Party still comes out ahead : 2.5 % annualized during Democratic presidencies , versus 1.7 % during Republican presidencies .
When I mentioned Davis ' results to several people on Thursday , the not - infrequent reaction was anger .
This baffles me .
For example , just because the stock market has performed better during Democratic presidencies does n't automatically mean that Democrats deserve the credit for that outperformance .
The stock market is a discounting mechanism , after all , and you might be inclined to argue that some of the relatively poor performance in the latter portion of Republican presidencies has been caused by the anticipation of a Democratic victory in the subsequent election .
Some are making this argument right now , for example , claiming that the stock market 's poor returns in recent weeks have been caused in no small part by Sen.
Barack Obama being ahead in the polls .
By the same token , furthermore , you might be inclined to argue that some of the credit for the stock market 's relatively good performance during Democratic presidencies really was caused by anticipation of a Republican victory in the subsequent elections .
You are entirely free to make such arguments , of course , and place any other interpretation you wish on the facts .
But facts remain facts even when you do n't like them .
Whether you want to obtain a loan , view transaction reports or even track competitors , we can help .
But Paul , whose views often run counter to standard Republican policies , had very disapppointing showings in party primary elections , with a couple of second - place caucus results but mainly third - , fourth - and fifth - place finishes in primaries .
At one point in New Hampshire , ...
Paul was very successful in political fundraising during the past year , amassing more than $ 34 million , more than twice the amount collected by more prominent candidates such as ex-Gov.
Mike Huckabee .
The newspaper report said the auditorium was overflowing with students and parents , who interrupted the congressman with applause nearly two dozen times during his speech .
According to the campus newspaper of Maryland 's Goucher College , the 72 - year - old Paul made the surprising statement during campaign remarks Thursday at a school presidential forum .
Rep. Ron Paul , the House member from Texas who technically remains in the race for the Republican Party 's presidential nomination against Sen.
John McCain , predicts that Democratic Sen. Barack Obama will be the next president of the United States .
... Fox News even excluded him from a nationally - televised GOP debate as politically irrelevant .
Paul has absolutely no chance of turning his handful of delegates into an upset over McCain , who already has sufficient votes to capture the nomination in Minneapolis - St. Paul come September .
But he may hope to disrupt the candidate 's coronation with platform or floor fights .
But despite the adverse numbers and his professed belief that a Democrat is destined to win on Nov. 4 , Paul has continued to campaign sporadically , often on college campuses where he receives large crowds and enthusiastic responses to his message of drastically smaller government and an end to foreign military involvement .
His dedicated followers have scored some recent successes at county GOP conventions that his partisans hope will boost the number of delegates pledged to Paul at the national convention .
Paul , a former ob - gyn who is unopposed for his 11th House term in November , was the lone Republican presidential candidate to oppose the Iraq war and , as a result , refuses to endorse McCain , a strong proponent of finishing that job without a precipitous withdrawal .
As reported in The Ticket , Paul is also traveling to promote his new book , which was released this week and , propelled by the eager purchases of his dedicated followers , immediately soared to No. 1 on the Amazon.com bestseller list .
According to the Goucher paper , The Quindecim , besides his unexpected Obama prediction , in his nearly 40 minutes of remarks Paul touched on his standard strict constitutionalist positions , advocating much less federal involvement in citizens ' lives .
Many of the students were apparently more curious than they were devoted Paulunteers .

OMAHA , Neb . -- Brendan Hansen deserves a gold medal for class .
But it 's hardly the medal he was looking for Thursday night at the Olympic swimming trials .

The man who has dominated the 200 - meter breaststroke in America for four years was stunned in the finals of that event by his own Longhorn Aquatics teammates .
Hansen finished a shocking fourth , watching Longhorn greenhorns Scott Spann and Eric Shanteau blow past him in the final 50 meters .
Afterward , Hansen did not hesitate to embrace both Spann to his left and Shanteau to his right , congratulating them .
In fact , he initiated it with both .
" I just said , ' You little son of a bitch , ' " Hansen said of his postrace discussion with Spann .
" It happens , you know ? "
It does n't happen that often -- not in this meet this week .
The heavyweights of the sport have been remarkably consistent at holding serve and winning when they were supposed to , including Hansen in the 100 breast Monday night .
But not this time .
" I touched the wall and was really surprised to see that I won , " said Spann , who came up agonizingly short of making the U.S. team in the 100 breast .
" I 'm in shock . "
The ripples from this upset will be felt all the way to Japan , where Hansen 's red - hot rivalry with world - record holder Kosuke Kitajima just lost some of its luster .
Those two will still square off in the 100 in Beijing , but hopes of a repeat of their two showdowns in the 2004 Games are now history .
" I might have been worrying about what I needed to do [ to face Kitajima ] and not about the guys chasing me , " Hansen said .
" I train with them every single day .
I might have trained them both too well . "
Hansen said he " did n't have a very good feeling in warm - up , " and it clearly carried over to the race .
After setting the pace through the first 100 meters , he was steadily overhauled -- first by Shanteau and then by Spann and Usher .
In the final 15 meters , Hansen had nothing left .
His final time of 2:11.37 was nearly three seconds off his personal best .
" It is extremely disappointing , " Hansen said .
" I 've got to look at the positives .
If I start looking at the negatives it 's going to affect my swim [ in the 100 in Beijing ] . "
Spann reciprocated Hansen 's graciousness when asked about the shocking demise of his teammate in what had been his favorite event .
" That 's just an off race for him , " Spann said .
" He 's still the best .
Brendan 's still a 2:08.5 in my book .
He 's going to take on the world in the 100 .
" I can't even process that I made the team .
This is unbelievable . "
May 5 , 2008  --
A New York Yankees fan has been charged with second - degree murder after allegedly ramming her car into a group of people outside a New Hampshire bar , killing a Boston Red Sox fan .
Ivonne Hernandez , 43 , was arraigned this morning in Hillsborough District Court on reckless second - degree murder and drunken driving charges .
She did not enter a plea and will be held without bail .
The murder charge followed the weekend death of 29 - year - old Matthew Beaudoin , who was one of two people struck early Friday morning by Hernandez in a Nashua , N.H. , parking lot after an altercation that reportedly involved fans of the rival big league teams .
Hernandez , of Nashua , had initially been charged with two counts of felony reckless conduct , but one of the charges was increased after Beaudoin 's death .
" One of the pedestrians sustained minor injuries , " according to the Friday release from the state Attorney General 's Office .
" The second pedestrian sustained life - threatening injuries . "
Beaudoin , of Nashua , died from his injuries after being transported to a Massachusetts hospital .
Prosecutors did not immediately return a call from ABC News , but they told New Hampshire affiliate WMUR that words were exchanged outside a bar behind Nashua City Hall early Friday morning between Hernandez and a group that included Beaudoin .
Some kind of taunt allegedly was made about a Yankees sticker on Hernandez 's maroon Dodge Intrepid , prosecutors told WMUR , and she drove across a dirt parking lot directly at the group .
" Mr. Beaudoin was struck by Miss Hernandez 's vehicle , " Assistant Attorney General Susan Morrell told WMUR .
" He went onto the windshield and then , when the car hit the parking meter , he was ejected into the middle of Elm Street .
He died of massive head trauma . "
Morrell said that Hernandez accelerated at a high speed for about 200 feet before slamming into Beaudoin and a second victim .
" She indicated to police that she wanted to scare this group of people , " Morrell said .
" She thought they would get out of the way . "
Hernandez told authorities that she had been in an argument with the group .
She was arrested at the scene by the Nashua Police Department .
A local bartender told the Associated Press that at least one person in Beaudoin 's group had been chanting negatively after seeing the Yankees sticker on her car .
This is not the first time that the Red Sox - Yankees rivalry , considered among the most long - standing and bitter in all of American sport , has spilled from the field to a courthouse .
A pair of Yankees , Jeff Nelson and Karim Garcia , agreed to perform 50 hours of community service and undergo anger management counseling to avoid going to trial on misdemeanor assault charges linked to a bullpen fight at Fenway Park involving the Yankee players and a member of the stadium ground crew .
That altercation took place during Game 3 of the 2003 American League Championship series when Nelson , a bullpen pitcher , confronted the Fenway employee about waving his " rally towel " inside the Yankees bullpen .
Garcia , an outfielder , was charged after he jumped the fence and allegedly joined the brawl .
That dust - up followed a bench - clearing brawl in which then - Red Sox ace Pedro Martinez infamously rolled elderly Yankees bench coach Don Zimmer to the ground .
In March of this year , a group of Red Sox fans allegedly beat a Yankees fan outside a Central Square bar in Cambridge , Mass . , before fleeing on foot .
The victim , targeted specifically because of his Yankees hat , had to be transported to a local hospital for medical treatment , according the Cambridge Chronicle .
The long - standing rivalry was initially blamed for a fight outside a Yonkers , N.Y. , Ramada Inn in October 2007 that left one Red Sox fan badly beaten and resulted in the arrest of two men .
In that case , authorities in New York tried to beat back reports that team loyalty triggered the fight .
A Red Sox spokesman at the time said the beaten man would receive a free ticket to a Red Sox game .
In another less violent but impassioned recent episode , contractors tore up part of the new Yankee stadium after learning that a Red Sox fan working on the Bronx project had inserted a David Ortiz jersey under two feet of concrete in hopes that that the clutch Red Sox slugger 's presence would hex the Yankees when they move into their new home next season .
The jersey ended up raising $ 175,000 for the Jimmy Fund , a cancer research charity .
The New York Yankees and Boston Red Sox are two of the oldest and most popular franchises in Major League Baseball .
The New York Yankees have won 26 world championships , while the Red Sox have won seven .
The Red Sox , however , are the reigning champs and also won the title in 2004 .
The Yankees last won a championship in 2000 .
Prior to the Red Sox winning the 2004 World Series , the team suffered through an 86 - year lull without a championship thanks to what fans called the " Curse of the Bambino , " a reference to the team 's 1920 decision to sell legendary slugger Babe Ruth to the Yankees .
Information from the Associated Press was used in this report .
SANTIAGO ( Reuters ) - A stripper who danced on the poles of Santiago subway trains to challenge the prudishness of Chilean society was arrested on Thursday during one of her lightning performances .
Monserrat Morilles , 26 , surprised subway riders all week stripping to skimpy underwear , but she refused tips .
She said she was protesting a lack of tolerance in Chile , one of Latin America ’s most conservative societies where the first generation since the Pinochet dictatorship is reaching adulthood .
“ This is just a beginning .
We are starting an idea here that will grow and be developed further , ” she told Reuters as police and subway guards surrounded her .
The professional pole dancer worked quickly all week to avoid arrest , getting on at one station , finding a subway car with no children on it and stripping in time to exit at the next station .
Chilean media dubbed her “ La Diosa del Metro ” or Subway Goddess .
She called her performances “ happy minutes . ”
“ Chile is still a pretty timid country , ” said her manager Gustavo Pradenas .
“ People are n’t very extroverted and we want to take aim at that and make Chile a happier country . ”
I ’ll admit it : I could n’t help but get a bit happy when I heard that California was legalizing same - sex marriage .
And today , when I heard about the first couples in line to enjoy their new rights , couples like Phyllis Lyon and Del Martin who got married again after their 2004 marriage was declared invalid , my heart was kinda warmed .
After all , politics aside , it ’s beautiful to see people celebrate and commemorate their love , out in the open , and with a long - awaited sense of equality and societal recognition .
It ’s hard for me not to get a little bit sentimental and proud in the most rainbow - flag - waving sense of the word .
But it did n’t take long for that warmth to turn chill and that pride to shrivel up completely when I read this article from the LA Times :
The gay and lesbian couples who packed a Hollywood auditorium last week had come seeking information about California ’s new marriage policies .
But they also got some unsolicited advice .
Be aware .
Images from gay weddings , said Lorri L. Jean , chief executive of the Los Angeles Gay and Lesbian Center , could be used by opponents in a campaign designed to convince California voters that gays and lesbians should not have the right to marry .
Those getting married , she cautioned , should never lose sight of what they might be supplying the other side .
Sitting close to his husband - to - be in the audience , hairstylist Kendall Hamilton nodded and said he knew just what she meant .
No “ guys showing up in gowns , ” he said .
The article goes on to discuss how “ proponents of same - sex marriage are now taking care to emphasize mainstream unions . ”
Many of the … early weddings around the state were also of long - term couples who could have been selected by central casting to appear both nonthreatening and mainstream .
And as the SF Gate reports , even the gay - marriage - themed window displays are being engineered to be as normative as possible :
In window one : two men on a wedding cake , one in a $ 6,000 Brioni tuxedo , the other in a $ 4,000 Belvest tux .
In window two : two women , one in a black Roberto Cavalli skirt tuxedo ( $ 3,655 ) and the other in a $ 1,900 Catherine Regehr white dress .
“ Describe them as straightforward , ” [ San Francisco clothier Wilkes ] Bashford said .
“ I definitely did not want them to be camp . ”
That ’s right , folks : no camp here .
No gender non-conformity , either .
And definitely no guys in gowns .
Why ?
Because the marriage equality movement is largely predicated on the notion that us queers are just like “ everyone else , ” meaning mostly white , mostly middle - class or up , gender conforming monogamists .
You know , the non-threatening queers .
The rest of us should apparently find a nice closet to go hide in for a while , lest we threaten the rights that are apparently meant for the more upstanding , respectable members of the LGsomeotherlessimportantletters community .
“ One of the things about the gay and lesbian community is we ’re known for our outrageousness , our flamboyance , ” said West Hollywood City Councilman John Duran , who is president of the board of directors of Equality California , an organization pushing for gay marriage .
“ But we ’re under this incredible political pressure not to have those portrayals ” right now .
Because that ’s the way to push for equality – by privileging individuals and couples and relationships that are the most tame , the most palatable , the most marketable while shunning those who stray a bit too much from Middle America ’s ideas of propriety .
Has it ever occurred to these so - called movement leaders to say , “ You know what ?
It does n’t matter what the people are wearing , or how they define their gender , or whether they ’re picket fence aspirants or not .
We all deserve the same rights by virtue of being human beings . ”
Nah , because that would be too hard .
Not only would all the nice , normal gays and lesbians need to wait around until the government and the rest of American society decided that the freaks were human , too , but those same nice , normal gays and lesbians might have to confront their own prejudice and acknowledge their own privilege .
Gasp !
Of course , this is all par for the course when dealing with marriage equality , which has never been and can never be about true equality and justice for all people who fall within the LGBT spectrum .
That ’s because legal marriage is about sanctioning and rewarding certain kinds of relationships while disqualifying and demeaning others .
And while I do n’t begrudge Lyon and Martin or any of the other couples who have found relief and joy in finally being able to marry legally , I do begrudge a movement that has devoted so much time and attention and resources to a cause that does not serve the most crucial needs of the vast majority of queers and that further marginalizes the most marginalized and vulnerable members of the LGBT community , if you can call it a community .
Recently someone I know posted an excellent synopsis of why the California ruling is not a source of unbridled and uncomplicated joy for all queers .
I ’ve been meaning to repost this for a while , but with the marriages beginning today and the media circus surrounding them .
It ’s an op - ed written and signed by Toby Beauchamp , Steven Blevins , Abigail Boggs , Cynthia Degnan , Benjamin D’Harlingue , Cathy Hannabach , Christopher Jee , Tristan Josephson , Liz Montegary , and Kara Thompson .
Thanks to them for writing it and for crystalizing the problems so well .
Not all LGBT people are happy about the same - sex marriage ruling .
While we recognize that the California Supreme Court decision positively and importantly affects some queer lives , marriage alone cannot solve the problems plaguing queer communities .
In fact , the ruling further marginalizes relationships and families that donâ€™t conform to a lifelong , monogamous two - partner structure .
We are concerned that most media stories about the ruling have erased queer voices that are critical of extending rights only to a privileged few .
Most U.S. households are not modeled on the nuclear family , meaning many families and relationships still do not receive the rights and benefits afforded married couples .
Blended and extended families ; single parents ; close friends , siblings , or senior citizens serving as primary caregivers to each other â€ “ all are common examples of family structures denied rights extended through marriage .
While legal marriage benefits some , this ruling does not grant full equality for all LGBT people .
We are also concerned with the stateâ€™s use of marriage as a coercive tool .
For example , the current U.S. welfare program provides economic incentives to promote marriage , in some cases offering extra benefits to single mothers who marry their childâ€™s biological father , even if this relationship isnâ€™t desired or beneficial .
Welfare benefits that limit parenting and relationship choices demonstrate that for many people â€ “ regardless of sexual orientation â€ “ marriage is not the key to social justice .
While some LGBT people celebrate state - recognized relationships , many of us are wary of increased state control over our sexual lives .
For a chilling example of the stateâ€™s regulation of bodies , sexualities and supposed deviance , consider the May 14th sentencing of an HIV - positive man in Dallas , Texas to 35 years in prison for spitting on a police officer .
Despite long - standing reports from the CDC that saliva does not transmit HIV , the defendantâ€™s saliva was ruled a deadly weapon , meaning he must serve half of his sentence before being eligible for parole .
Consider also the current committee appointments for revising the American Psychiatric Associationâ€™s Diagnostic and Statistical Manual ( DSM ) .
The DSM lists diagnostic criteria for mental disorders , including Gender Identity Disorder ( homosexuality was removed in 1974 ) .
Dr. Kenneth Zucker is chairing the Sexual and Gender Identity Disorders Work Group , despite advocating that queer and trans people ( especially youth ) can be â€œcuredâ€ through reparative therapy .
That many LGBT people are unaware of these recent abuses by state institutions reveals that the same - sex marriage struggle overshadows some of the most damaging actions against queer and trans communities .
We support the personal and spiritual meaning that marriage has for many , but question whether fighting for marriage as a state - run institution is the best strategy for queer liberation more broadly .
We urge the networks formed through the same - sex marriage struggle to continue working in the service of all marginalized communities .
Following the work of projects like Queers for Economic Justice and beyondmarriage.org , and scholars and activists such as Lisa Duggan , Richard Kim and Nancy Polikoff , we advocate the following : Instead of linking state benefits like healthcare , housing and welfare to marital privilege , they should be detached from marriage and available to all , regardless of marital or citizenship status .
Rather than furthering the norm of two partners acting as a single economic childrearing unit , we argue for a movement that embraces multiple meanings of family , and recognizes that marriage and domestic partnership are not always optimal or desired choices .
Finally , we believe we can better serve marginalized communities by fighting against all state regulation of sexual and gender choices , identities and expressions .

WASHINGTON -- Speculative traders ' interest in crude oil has grown to the point that they now account for roughly 70 % of all trading in West Texas Intermediate crude on the New York Mercantile Exchange , compared with 37 % in 2000 , according to an investigation by a congressional subcommittee that forms part of an escalating political assault on Wall Street 's role in the run-up in oil prices .
The subcommittee 's findings , based on data obtained from federal commodity - futures regulators , are the latest sign that Washington is ...
Kefer asked a question in the comments of my post about ( co ) monadic ( co ) strength about Uustalu and Vene 's ComonadZip class from p157 of The Essence of Dataflow Programming .
The class in question is :
class Comonad w => ComonadZip w where czip :: f a -> f b -> f ( a , b )
In response I added Control .
Functor .
Zip [ Source ] to my nascent rebundled version of category - extras , which was posted up to hackage earlier today .
Putting aside the dual operation for the moment , we can dispense with the inverse of zip quite simply , for much the same reason that every functor in Haskell is strong , every functor in haskell is unzippable :
unfzip :: Functor f => f ( a , b ) -> ( f a , f b ) unfzip = fmap fst &&& fmap snd
On the other hand the question of what Functors are zippable is a little trickier .
Allowing for a circular definition between fzip and fzipWith we can start with the following class for which you have to implement at least one of fzip or fzipWith .
class Functor f =>
Zip f where fzip :: f a -> f b -> f ( a , b ) fzip = fzipWith ( , ) fzipWith :: ( a -> b -> c ) -> f a -> f b -> f c fzipWith f as bs = fmap ( uncurry f ) ( fzip as bs )
Here we set aside the restriction that we only be able to Zip a comonad , and simply require that if the functor in question is a comonad , then it is a " symmetric semi- monoidal comonad " , which is to say that zipping and then extracting yields the same result as extracting from each separately .
You may note a lot of similarity in the above to the definition for Control .
Functor .
Zap the Dual functor from the other day .
Now , we can throw ourselves with reckless abandon at the easy cases :
instance Zip Identity where fzipWith f ( Identity a ) ( Identity b ) = Identity ( f a b ) instance Zip [ ] where fzip = zip fzipWith = zipWith instance Zip Maybe where fzipWith f ( Just a ) ( Just b ) = Just ( f a b ) fzipWith f _ _ = Nothing
But we note that Either causes us to break down , we can't handle the ' mixed ' cases of Left and Right cleanly .
We can however use the same ' cheat ' that makes the Writer Monad work , however , and rely on an instance of Monoid , and leaving the left hand side of the bifunctor unchanged to enable us to define :
instance Monoid a => Zip ( Either a ) where fzipWith f ( Left a ) ( Left b ) = Left ( mappend a b ) fzipWith f ( Right a ) ( Left b ) = Left b fzipWith f ( Left a ) ( Right b ) =
Left a fzipWith f ( Right a ) ( Right b ) =
Right ( f a b )
and similarly :
instance Monoid a => Zip ( ( , ) a ) where fzipWith f ( a , c ) ( b , d ) = ( mappend a b , f c d )
Unfortunately the instance for ( ( , ) a ) is a little less than satisfying , what we really want to say there is that we have a Bifunctor and that it has two parameters that can be zipped together :
class Bifunctor p => Bizip p where bizip :: p a c -> p b d -> p ( a , b ) ( c , d ) bizip = bizipWith ( , ) ( , ) bizipWith :: ( a -> b -> e ) -> ( c -> d -> f ) -> p a c -> p b d -> p e f bizipWith f g as bs = bimap ( uncurry f ) ( uncurry g ) ( bizip as bs )
Now , we can define a more satisfying instance for ( , ) :
instance Bizip ( , ) where bizipWith f g ( a , b ) ( c , d ) = ( f a c , g b d )
However , by its very nature , an instance for Either eludes us .
Now , we can define a " Bifunctor - Functor - Functor Bifunctor " transformer that takes a bifunctor and a pair of functors to wrap it around , and derives a new bifunctor and lift the zippability of each of the parts to the zippability of the whole :
newtype BiffB p f g a b = BiffB { runBiffB :: p ( f a ) ( g b ) } instance ( Functor f , Bifunctor p , Functor g ) =>
Bifunctor ( BiffB p f g ) where bimap f g = BiffB . bimap ( fmap f ) ( fmap g ) .
runBiffB instance ( Zip f , Bizip p , Zip g ) =>
Bizip ( BiffB p f g ) where bizipWith f g as bs = BiffB $ bizipWith ( fzipWith f ) ( fzipWith g ) ( runBiffB as ) ( runBiffB bs )
What is interesting about this is that the cofree comonad and free monad can be defined in terms of BiffB given a definition for the fixed point of a bifunctor :
newtype FixB s a = InB { outB :: s a ( FixB s a ) } instance Bifunctor s =>
Functor ( FixB s ) where fmap f = InB . bimap f ( fmap f ) . out B type Cofree f a = FixB ( BiffB ( , ) Identity f ) a type Free f a = FixB ( BiffB Either Identity f ) a
Then we can define that the fixed point of a zippable bifunctor is a zippable functor :
instance Bizip p => Zip ( FixB p ) where fzipWith f as bs = InB $ bizipWith f ( fzip With f ) ( outB as ) ( outB bs )
Then it immediately follows by the construction for BiffB that every Cofree Comonad of a zippable base functor is Zippable because they are the fixed point of BiffB ( , ) Identity f. and since ( , ) is zippable and Identity is zippable , then given f zippable the base bifunctor is zippable , so Cofree f is zippable .
On the other hand , we do not get the same result for the Free Monad , because it is built over BiffB Either Identity f , and Either is not a zippable bifunctor .
We can define some other functors and bifunctors which are zippable , i.e. we can define a " functor - wrapped bifunctor bifunctor " :
newtype FunctorB f p a b = FunctorB { runFunctorB :: f ( p a b ) } liftFunctorB :: Functor f => ( p a b -> p c d ) ->
FunctorB f p a b ->
FunctorB f p c d liftFunctorB f = FunctorB . fmap f . runFunctorB instance ( Functor f , Bifunctor p ) =>
Bifunctor ( FunctorB f p ) where bimap f g = liftFunctorB ( bimap f g ) instance ( Zip f , Bizip p ) => Bizip ( FunctorB f p ) where bizipWith f g as bs = FunctorB $ fzipWith ( bizipWith f g ) ( runFunctorB as ) ( runFunctorB bs )
But the general pattern was set by Either and Maybe .
Whenever your functor has a branch you need a way to uniquely determine the way the constant terms combine .
While I think the above yields a pleasingly generic version of zip .
I do not believe that I have exhausted the set of possible instances , but yielding them automatically for cofree comonads of zippable functors , and hence for rose trees , streams , was rather nice .
If you have any other instances of note , I would welcome the insight .

Listen , my children , and you shall hear / Of the midnight ride of Paul Revere . "
With those words , Henry Wadsworth Longfellow , in a poem published in 1861 , galloped away with the legend of the Boston silversmith who helped start the Revolutionary War .
Longfellow 's poem , with its romantic image of a lonely rider single - handedly stirring a sleeping countryside to arms , was written more than 40 years after Revere 's death for readers facing the specter of another looming conflict .
But its simple , inspiring message still resonates :
One man , in pursuit of a noble cause , really can make a difference .
The poem has only one flaw , historians say :
It is inaccurate in almost every way .
" We have heard of poetic license , " wrote the town historian of Lexington , Mass. , in 1868 , " but have always understood that this sort of latitude was to be confined to modes of expression and to the regions of the imagination , and should not extend to historic facts . "
By abandoning the real story of Paul Revere from beginning to end , Longfellow may have undermined his own message .
" He appealed to the evidence of history as a source of patriotic inspiration , " writes David Hackett Fischer in Paul Revere 's Ride , " but was utterly without scruple in his manipulation of historical fact . "
The real - life Paul Revere was not a national hero until Longfellow crafted his poem , though his mythic stature would rise with each passing stanza .
In 1775 , Revere was one of many Whig activists in Boston who learned that the British garrison was preparing to send troops to seize military supplies in Concord .
At the time , Revere was a small but important player in a much larger colonial intelligence network , which dispatched him and one other rider to alert the local militias .
The other man , William Dawes , a Boston tanner , took the main road out of town .
Revere , meanwhile , arranged with the help of several other people to sneak across the Charles River .
Two if by sea .
No part of Longfellow 's poem has become more iconic than the image of Revere standing on the riverbank across from Boston , waiting for a signal from the Old North Church .
But in fact , Revere 's own testimony contradicts this version of the story .
In descriptions of his ride he wrote after the battles , Revere himself said he had arranged for the lanterns to be lit while he was still in Boston — two of them , to indicate the British would be traveling by sea — in case he was n't able to cross the river .
The citizens of Charlestown , on the other side , dispatched their own rider to spread the news .
Revere was rowed across , found a horse , and followed .
He and Dawes arrived in Lexington about 30 minutes apart .
Historians are n't sure what became of the third rider .
Later that night , Longfellow 's poem describes Revere galloping into Concord to sound the alarm , but Revere said he never made it that far .
He left Lexington with Dawes , then met yet another rider , Samuel Prescott , a local doctor , along the way .
Before they reached town , the three men were stopped by British officers .
Dawes and Prescott got away , but Revere was captured .
Prescott was the only one who made it to Concord .
Revere , in other words , was neither alone nor the man who completed his mission .
" He would be very much surprised by his modern image as the lone rider of the Revolution , " writes Fischer .
While Prescott was riding on , Revere spent some anxious moments being interrogated by the British .
He defiantly informed his captors that the game was up .
" I know what you are after , " he told them , " and have alarmed the country all the way up . "
Revere had been told the British were looking for John Hancock and Samuel Adams , who were in Lexington that night , and he tried to keep the British away from the town .
When his captors heard gunshots from the Lexington green — probably from a group of men clearing their muskets before entering the local tavern —
Revere was released .
Historians say Longfellow probably knew most of this when he wrote his poem .
He had access to Revere 's written recollections , but he seems to have ignored them .
" I think he told it the way he did because it 's simpler and more dramatic , " says Patrick Leehey , research director at the Paul Revere House in Boston .
Until Longfellow made him a hero , Revere had been little more than a local folk legend , but his stature quickly began to grow .
" I think it 's fair to say Revere 's messenger ride was n't considered to be anywhere near as important then as it's considered to be now , " says Leehey .
Deep packet inspection gear has long had the ability to peer inside users ' datastreams to pull out all sorts of interesting information , but a UK company called Phorm is taking DPI to the next level by using it to sell ads .
The company 's ambitious goal : segment users into small and highly - accurate " channels " by reading the URLs they visit , the search terms they use , and the content of the pages they visit .
The resulting channels are then sold to advertisers who are salivating at the thought of better targeting .
Actual users are predictably less thrilled , however , and a row over the issue has erupted in Britain .
Phorm made its announcement on Valentine 's Day .
The company said that it had inked deals with the three largest ISPs in the UK : BT , Talk Talk , and Virgin Media .
The ISPs will place Phorm 's gear inline on their networks , where it will have access to the datastream of all users .
Phorm charges advertisers for access to highly - targeted customers , and it splits this revenue with the ISP .
In addition to offering the benefit of more relevant ads , the company says that its gear will also warn users if they happen to visit phishing sites .
So everyone wins , in theory .
But plenty of users do n't see it that way .
Web sites like BadPhorm have already sprung up , encouraging users to take action by pressuring their MPs and by complaining to ISPs .
The story has gained significant traction in the UK this week , with multiple pieces in the major UK media outlets .
The Register even had the chance to interview Phorm 's CEO on Friday at the company 's London offices , and CEO Kent Ertegrul made clear that Phorm has nothing to hide .
In fact , it welcomes scrutiny and has opened its system up to inspection by groups like Privacy International .
Phorm claims that its system is far better for privacy than , say , Google 's AdSense , since the analysis of the datastream is done in memory and only the user 's " data digest " ( stripped of all identifying information ) is retained .
The real story of Phorm is " how you can run an advertising service and store nothing , " Ertegrul told The Register .
He 's also convinced that raising the value of online ads will actually lead to less advertising on the sites that use Phorm 's Open Internet Exchange ( OIX ) , since web site operators know that ads interfere with content .
We 'll see .
Ertegrul knows that he needs to overcome consumers ' gut reactions to the idea of advertisers targeting them based on clickstream data , but Phorm is n't helped in that work by having once been an adware ( not spyware , it insists ) provider .
Before changing its name to Phorm last year , the company was known as 121 Media , and it offered adware services including PeopleOnPage , which would show you others who were browsing a web page and allow you to chat with them ( while showing you ads ) .
Also controversial is the idea that ISPs would simply opt all of their users into the scheme .
Final announcements have n't been made , but this does seem the only real way to ensure enough participation to make the whole exercise worthwhile .
Fortunately , opting out is as simple as blocking Phorm 's cookie , and the company promises that no bandwidth throttling or other consequences will follow .
Where 's the win-win ?
All eyes are on Phorm and the UK 's top ISPs to see if users will eventually acquiesce to the idea of being tracked online .
The likelihood of the system staying on the right side of the law seems great to us , but only if Phorm 's claim that this technology is AdSense - like is upheld .
The bigger issue is customer reaction .
When one thinks back to the launch of Gmail , which was really the first time that AdSense came in for a beating owing to some folks ' concern over a machine reading their e-mail and serving ads based on them , the majority of users did n't sweat it .
That had a lot to do with Gmail being a win - win situation : you got a great web - based e-mail client and ( then an unheard of ) 1 GB of space .
Most people overlooked the privacy issue and did n't think too deeply about it .
With Phorm 's plan , there does n't appear to be a win - win aside from perhaps some phishing alerts , which frankly does n't get us too excited .
Without that win -win , users will scrutinize the deal more heavily , even if it is truly machine - based like AdSense is .

Think that gasoline is expensive at $ 4 a gallon ?
Maybe , but apparently that price point is n't high enough to make Americans change their usual day - to - day driving habit :
If oil hits $ 200 a barrel , which is the upper end of Goldman Sach 's prediction for prices over the next six months to two years , the gasoline picture changes quite dramatically .
At $ 200 a barrel , crude alone would cost $ 4.76 a gallon .
Add on the costs of refining and distributing as well as taxes , and pump prices could rise to a range of $ 6 to $ 7 a gallon .
U.S. drivers have n't radically changed their behavior , and it is unclear at what price it becomes unprofitable for Americans to go about their usual day - to - day activities , said Eric DeGesero , executive vice president of the Fuel Merchants Association of New Jersey .
" Maybe at $ 6 or $ 7 a gallon , it becomes less attractive to go to work , " Mr. DeGesero said .
" We have n't hit that point yet , but we might soon . "
The US Supreme Court has declined to take up a case examining whether a Chinese national should be granted political asylum in the United States because his wife was forced to abort their first child under China 's harsh population - control measures .
The action , announced on Monday , means that lower court rulings rejecting the Chinese citizen 's asylum claims remain in place .
At issue in the case was whether the spouse of someone who had suffered directly under the Chinese program – enduring a forced abortion or sterilization – could claim political asylum in the US .
Immigration judges and a federal appeals court had earlier rejected Yi Qiang Yang 's application for asylum , saying that he did not qualify since he and his wife were not officially married under Chinese law .
Lawyers for Mr. Yang countered that he and his wife participated in a traditional Chinese marriage ceremony when he was 21 and she was 17 .
As part of its population control policies , the Chinese government has banned legal marriage for any man under 22 and any woman under age 20 .
Rather than wait , the couple wed through a traditional ceremony attended by family and friends .
The Chinese government does not recognize such marriages as genuine and legal .
In addition , the Chinese marriage law carries heavy consequences .
When Yang 's wife , Jian Hui Ling , became pregnant , she had to hide from authorities to protect their unborn child .
The effort failed .
She was discovered when she was eight months pregnant .
Chinese population - control officials took her to a hospital and forcibly ended her pregnancy , according to a legal brief submitted by Yang 's lawyers .
" The fetus was placed in a bag and disposed of in front of Ling , " the brief says .
Specifically at issue in Yang 's case was whether the US government must recognize traditional Chinese marriages and give them the same weight as marriages sanctioned under China 's population - control regime .
" Because traditionally married spouses are unable to register their marriages with the government , the state treats such couples who have children as violators of the population control policy , " Yang 's lawyer , Charles Rothfeld , wrote in his brief urging the Supreme Court to take up the case .
" Such couples are often subjected to forced abortions or sterilizations . "
The US Solicitor General 's Office urged the court not to take up the case .
The lower courts ruled correctly , Solicitor General Paul Clement said in his brief .
In addition , he said , the attorney general is now reviewing whether to change US asylum policy concerning spouses .
Federal appeals courts have reached different conclusions on the legal marriage versus traditional marriage issue .
Both the Ninth Circuit in San Francisco and Seventh Circuit in Chicago have recognized traditional marriages , while the Second Circuit in New York and 11th Circuit in Atlanta have not .
" If Yang 's case had been decided in the Seventh or Ninth Circuits , he would have been deemed eligible for asylum , " Mr. Rothfeld said in his brief .
" The fate of traditionally married spouses thus turns on nothing more [ than ] where their case is heard . "
Rothfeld said that in 2006 US immigration courts received nearly 9,000 claims for asylum from Chinese nationals , many of them filed by couples in traditional marriages fleeing China 's harsh population - control policies .
Mr. Clement argued on behalf of the Bush administration that the US government was justified in drawing a distinction between officially authorized marriages in China and traditional marriages .
He quoted the 11th Circuit opinion in Yang 's case .
" Legal marriage reflects a sanctity and long - term commitment that other forms of cohabitation simply do not , " the court wrote .
" A legal husband ... shares significantly more responsibility in determining , with his wife , whether to bear a child in the face of societal pressure and government incentives . "
The court added , " It would be absurd to characterize reliance on marital status ... as arbitrary and capricious [ when ] benefits and presumptions based on marriage are found in so many other areas of the law . "
Yang 's lawyers say Congress wrote its immigration policies to protect married people – not simply those whose unions are recognized under the Chinese government 's population - suppression program .
" Traditionally married spouses are victimized by coercive population control policies in precisely the same way as registered spouses , " Rothfeld wrote .
Steve works at Google on web performance and open source initiatives .
To begin his talk , Steve is running YSlow in " autorun " mode .
This runs YSlow Performance tests on the top 100 sites according to Alexa .
Before Google , Steve was at Yahoo for 7 years .
You can download Steve 's slides from his site ( do n't ask me where ) .
i Google with an empty cache : 9 % of the time is spent getting the HTML document .
The % of time of what a webserver does is a pretty small percentage of the overall picture .
If the cache is primed , the time goes up to 17 % of the time .
80 - 90 % of the end - user response time is spent on the frontend .
Start there .
There 's a greater potential of improvement on the frontend .
If you improve the backend performance by 50 % , chances are the end - user only sees a 5 % improvement .
The 14 Rules are encapsulated in the YSlow plugin .
At OSCON last year , Yahoo released YSlow .
500,000 downloads since it was released .
Following the release of YSlow , Steve wrote High Performance Web Sites .
High Performance Web Sites , Vol 2 .
The 3 most important rules are :
Split the initial payload
Load scripts without blocking
Do n't scatter inline scripts
Why focus on JavaScript ?
A lot of the top sites use JavaScript .
For example , up until a few weeks ago , Facebook served up 1MB of JavaScript , uncompressed .
Scripts block parallel downloads and page rendering .
To see it in action , go to http://stevesouders.com/cuzillion/?ex=10008.
Any content below a < script > is blocked from rendering - even if it 's already cached in the browser .
Cuzillion is an open source project that Steve is releasing that allows you to add components to a page and test their performance .
Split your JavaScript between what 's needed to render the page and everything else .
Load " everything else " after the page is rendered .
To do this , you can use Firebug to do it manually , or you can use Doloto from Microsoft to automate the splitting of your files .
MSN.com solves the script blocking problem by using JS DOM to allow for parallel downloading .
There 's 6 techniques for doing this :
XHR Eval ( must have same domain as page )
XHR Injection ( same domain )
Script in iFrame ( same domain )
Script DOM Element ( domains can differ )
Script Defer ( only supported in IE , domains can differ )
document .write ( not recommended , parallelization only works in IE )
How do these techniques cause " browser busy " indicators ?
XHR Eval and Injection do n't trigger any indicators .
You need to choose when you want to show busy indicators .
It 's good to show them when you want to show your users that something is processing ( but not for lazy - loading JavaScript that 's not required for load ) .
For the different techniques , most do n't ensure order of parsing .
Based on 3 factors , Steve can tell you which technique is best to use .
These three factors are 1 ) the URL of the page and script 2 ) if you want busy indicators and 3 ) if you care about order .
Steve thinks it would be awesome if web frameworks could support this to write out JavaScript appropriately for the developer 's input .
Long executing inline scripts block rendering and downloads .
If you know you 're going to have scripts like this , you can solve it with a couple workarounds :
Initiate execution with setTimeout ( >250 for Firefox )
Move JavaScript to enternal script with advanced downloading techniques
Use defer attribute for IE
In Firefox 2 , stylesheets block parallel downloads just like scripts .
IE does n't .
However , IE will block when you have a stylesheet followed by an inline script .
To solve , it 's best to move line scripts above stylesheets or below other resources .
use < link > , not @import .
Takeaways : focus on the frontend , run YSlow , focus on JavaScript ( split initial payload , load scripts w/o blocking , do n't scatter inline scripts ) .

There are places on our planet , which literally resemble hell on earth ... a place that youd think was conceived by minds of apocalyptic science fiction writers but is however quite realA place , closed off to the tourists , a place where no photographers are allowed to go and those that do , get their cameras taken away and arrested by the police .. Today we shall travel to Bangladesh , Chittagong .
Chittagong has a territory of 144 000 км² and population of 144 million people .
Several beaches around the area bear strange ships , parked in sand as seen from space : zooming in a little closer :
What are we looking at ?
Here are some photographs of it and the stories written by journalists and photographers that broke through the barriers and went there :
Along the southeast coast of Bangladesh are the ship breaking installations , where immense ocean freighters and tankers are torn apart by hundreds of gritty , lean , strong , bronze - skinned , men -- by manual labor .
These ShipBreakers scrap the world 's ships with little more than their bare hands .
Despite wretched conditions , they say it is better to work and die than to starve and die .
Over thirty thousand men come here to disassemble old , rusting ships that the First Nations of the world discard on the beaches of the third world .
And by discard , I mean sell as scraps .
Using blow torches , sledgehammers , chisels and wedges workers break the mammouth steel behemoths .
Massive slabs of carved up ships , plunge into the water , raising clouds of mist .
After the huge pieces crash into the water like glaciers calving , they are winched onto shore where they are cut up into bite - size pieces weighing hundreds of pounds then lifted and loaded by teams of guys -- who sing in rhythm as they walk lock - step carrying the very heavy inch - thick steel plates - - onto trucks
These metal scraps are sold ( very profitably by the owners who live in huge mansions in town ) as scrap metal across the country and Asia ( with some reworked into ' new ' ships ) .
ShipBreaker , carrying a rusted part from a Russian ship : Hammers at work , smashing metal into smaller pieces :
Ships reach to the sky : This ShipBreaking installation exists because of the tide .
It is one of those places -- like the Bay of Fundy in Canada -- where a host of geographical circumstances come together to create exceptionally large differences between the twice - daily high and low tides .
Coupled with a soft , shelving beach , the tides at Alang make shipbreaking possible with a minimum of construction .
There are no piers or drydocks .
Ships are simply run onto the shore , and sometimes even pulled by the ShipBreakers towards their final destination .
ShipBreakers live in hovels built of scrap , with no showers , toilets or latrines .
You can see such hovels from space using google map : ( Alang , India ) They have come from poor villages on the other side of India , lured by wages that start at $ 1.50 a day , to work at dangerous jobs , protected only by their scarves and sandals .
They suffer broken ankles , severed fingers , smashed skulls , malarial fevers , chol - era , dysentery and tuberculosis .
Some are burned and some are drowned .
Nobody keeps track of how many die here from accidents and disease .
Ship breaking is done from 7 AM to 11 PM ( same crew ) with two half hour breaks and an hour for lunch ( supper is eaten after they go home at 11 ) ; 14 hours a day , 6 - 1/ 2 days a week ( off half day Friday for Muslim observations ) .
Workers in Alang begin stirring around 7:30 a.m..
Some wash from a bucket on the muddy ground outside their huts .
Others squat by puddles , dipping toothbrushes in the yellow water and cleaning their teeth .
There 's early morning coughing all around .
At this hour , the chief activity is along the strip of shacks that serve the workers ' needs : a barber 's stall and a tailor 's , a man who does laundry and a Muslim prayer leader , vendors who sell bicycle parts , kerosene lamps , sodas , cigarettes , fruit and eggs .
The men live in shacks they have built out of lumber harvested from the ships .
The shacks are packed on the dunes behind the beach , separated by muddy alleys .
Four or eight or 12 men might live in one shack .
There is no furniture , no light , no water .
Here is a nearby shack village , covered in lifeboats , harnessed from one of the ships : Sriram Prasad , 32 , with dark hair brushed forward and a bushy mustache , counts himself among the lucky men of Alang .
He lives in an 8 - foot - square shack with three others .
They sleep on a table .
The walls are covered with newspapers ; little triangles of colored paper hang from the ceiling .
He has a wife and two sons back home .
A brother and many of his neighbors work here .
He gets the shack for free .
He says he has worked here 10 years .
" It 's hazardous -- we 're always scared of getting hurt .
I get bruised all the time , but I 've been lucky and never seriously hurt .
" But I 've seen so many people die .
I 've seen 100 people die before my eyes .
It is just a matter of destiny .
" This attitude infects seemingly everyone in Alang .
Destiny brings men who otherwise could not support themselves to this fiery corner of India .
Destiny wears them out and fills them with malaria .
Destiny deprives them of decent sanitation .
Destiny burns them and crushes them .
" The best thing is the money , which I would n't get anyplace else , " says Prasad , " and the worst thing is not knowing how long you 'll be alive .
" There are no cranes , no special equipment , no safety of any kind .
Often , shipbreakers do n't even have shoes .
They carry metal scraps through the water , often cutting themselves on metal that litters the beach .
Dangers arise very often :
In a fires caused by improper oil containment inside old tankers that catches fire from the welding Asbestos and poisonous smoke that fills in the air from the ship - cutting : " There is a shadow of death on this place , " says Ram Lalit , a 22 - year - old worker .
" This place is haunted by it .
" The U.S. Navy , which for years has insisted on scrapping its ships in the United States , now also sends them abroad -- here to India , or to similar beachfronts in Pakistan or Bangladesh .
" I was two feet away , " says Shiv Shankar , 38 .
" I was talking to them .
The last thing I said was , ' Why do n't you work faster ?
It 's time to get this job over with . ' "
The whole section broke off and plunged 40 feet into the ship 's hold .
Three men died from head injuries .
Five survived .
None was wearing a hard hat .
" This was God 's will , " says a supervisor , Toofani Bhai , 32 .
" Nothing could be done about it .
I felt hurt -- it pained me .
I was among those who picked up the bodies and put them on the ambulance . " " Alang , " he says , " is a colony of the dead -- breathing , walking dead men . "
After the section fell , the owner of the yard called for Alang 's single ambulance .
It happened to be available .
Digvijay H. Sarviya , the driver , says that when he got to the accident scene it appeared that two men were dead and one was near death .
He decided to load all three into the ambulance , because he was n't sure .
The trip to the hospital took 2 hours .
By that time all 3 were dead .
The scrapyard owners look on from their porches , sipping sweet milky tea .
Walking to or from the yards , the men of Alang seem listless , worn out , beaten down .
But they are diligent workers .
At Plot 66 , two men , facing each other , pull on the ends of a large hacksaw , like lumberjacks , cutting the copper pipes of a boiler .
They 've been at it since 3 p.m. the day before .
They expect to finish toward sundown the next day .
Back and forth , in a patient trance , with an unvarying stroke , they pull at the saw .
"
It 's how we earn our bread , " says Ram Sanwarey , 38 .
Wrapped in an orange shroud , workers carry the body of Shahade Ram , 35 , who had worked here five years .
He had complained of a cough and chest pain .
A self - styled doctor told him he would be fine and gave him a glucose injection .
At 1 a .m. he had died in his hut .
The body is placed on the pile , made out of wood scavenged from a ship .
There is a brief distraction :
A fire at a plot 200 yards away has sent workers running in all directions .
It ends with the concussive explosion of an oxygen canister .
Seven men walk around the pyre , chanting , " Ram , nam , satya hai , " and lighting the fire with burning bundles of reeds .
Bright orange flames leap from the pyre , and the men back away from the heat .
A few leave .
One rings a bicycle bell as he walks away .
The fire burns for a long time , until finally the tide comes in , washing away what little remains of Shahade Ram .
Now , has your today 's perception of the world changed , after seeing these images and hearing this story ?

There 's now a great video on the issue----

By way of background : over the last eight years of Republican power , of the George Bush administration ’s misrule , science in America has come under attack in several ways .
Among them :
1 : Official denialism , censorship , government sanctioned lies and misrepresentations so thorough as to rise to the level of falsehood .
See Seth Shulman ’s account ; Chris Mooney ’s book ; and anything from the wealth of reporting on climate change deceit , reproductive health nonsense , and the disastrous conflation of religious ideology with public health and HIV prevention world wide .
( Those last two links are to Elizabeth Parisi ’s blog and just - about - available book , both titled The Wisdom of Whores .
The book is at the top of a growing pile of well written books about crucial topics accreting on my desk .
I ’ll blog more about Elizabeth ’s and several others over the next few weeks — important stuff here ) .
2. Going further in the same vein — when inconvenient results could not be suppressed , the Bush administration turned to a more direct solution , blocking further research that might yield ideologically unacceptable research .
The lengths to which this “ I Ca n’t Hear You ” twitch can go can be seen in this 2005 decision to pull out of Agent Orange research in Vietnam .
3. Delegitimizing science through active public disdain .
My bile will probably force a separate blog post on an issue I ’ve already screamed about — but this quote from GOP Congressman John Duncan captures the theme pretty well :
Rep. John Duncan , a Tennessee Republican , said that it seems “ rather elitist ” that people with academic degrees in health think they know better than parents what type of sex education is appropriate .
“ I do n’t think it ’s something we should abandon , ” he said of abstinence - only funding .
( Acute readers will notice the depressing similarity between Duncan ’s statement and the one discussed here . )
John McCain has participated in his party ’s and its leaders sins against reason .
Examples range from his support for the same abstinence funding Congressman Duncan so eloquently defended , to his support for “ teaching the controversy ” ( sic ) thus admitting Intelligent Design ( sic ) into the classroom — but that ’s not the key reason to think that his administration will be hostile to science ( though such pandering does not inspire much hope , to be sure ) .
That is , McCain has been willing to go along to get along with the party — and nothing in his gas tax holiday idiocy suggests that he has the interest or willingness to think critically about technical questions , nor to listen to those who do .
But that said , the real test of McCain ’s attitude towards science as a would - be President comes where it always does in government .
That is to say :
Follow the money .
Here ’s the last bit of background : our once dominant international lead in science and engineering training , basic education and research funding has suffered significantly over the last eight years .
To take the NSF as a proxy for science funding as a whole , the appropriation for FY 2002 ( the first for which Bush II was responsible ) was 4.789 billion dollars , while the current , FY 2008 number comes only to 6.06 billion — an increace of 1.217 billion nominal dollars or a cumulative increase of 25.4 % over seven years .
That is essentially flat when inflation is factored in , and the year over year number for 2007 - 2008 actually lags behind current inflation .
Other areas of government supported research fare even worse .
You do n’t want to be a DOE supported particle physicist right now — nor one trying to solve our energy dependence through fusion research .
So the question for would - be President McCain is : what will you do to reverse the current decline in funding for basic and applied science and engineering research ?
The answer is nothing — or worse .
How do I know this , given the near complete lack of detailed science plans on the McCain ’08 policy page ?
Because of this speech , delivered on April 14 and billed as a major address on his approach to the economy .
He said …
“ I promise you , if I ’m elected President , I wo n’t leave office without balancing the federal budget .
And I wo n’t do it with smoke and mirrors . ”
Then : “ I wo n’t balance the budget by allowing the President ’s income and investment tax cuts to expire .
When we passed those tax cuts , we increased spending as well .
That ’s unacceptable … “
Next up , ( in this speech delivered the next day ) : “ I will also send to the Congress a middle - class tax cut — a complete phase - out of the Alternative Minimum Tax to save more than 25 million middle - class families more than 2,000 dollars every year . ”
And finally ( from McCain ’s website ) ” A greater military commitment now is necessary if we are to achieve long - term success in Iraq . ”
Now for a simple exercise in counting on one ’s fingers .
2007 budget authority for the Iraq conflict topped 133 billion ( or more than 20 times NSF ’s budget .
( Put another way : we could double basic science spending in this country for what we spent for about 17 days of the conflict . )
McCain wants to spend more — not to mention the increase in the general military budget he also envisions .
Eliminating the AMT will cost the government an enormous sum — as much as 1.2 trillion dollars over the next decade .
Retaining the Bush tax cuts for the top 1 percent of American taxpayers eliminates the possibilty of recovering lost revenues or covering the cost of new spending commitments made elsewhere in the McCain “ plan ” ( sic ) .
And finally , achieving a balanced budget means that McCain will have to find the cash to cover a deficit that in the first six months of FY 2008 alone is running over 311 billion dollars ( very roughly 10 percent of the budget for the entire year ) .
One last detail : discretionary domestic spending in FY 2007 ( the last year with comprehensive data ) — everything from roads to midnight basketball to science but excluding defense and veterans spending — came to 522 billion dollars .
So to put all this stuff in one tightly wrapped package :
To deliver on his commitments on taxes , defense and fiscal responsiblity , John McCain would have to eliminate all discretionary spending — including the few tens of billions spent on science R & D .
There is , of course , no real world political calculation that would permit that to happen .
But McCain ’s priorities are very clear — trillions for defense ; trillions more for tax cuts .
For the rest , as he put it himself , “ the best way to protect the tax cuts and balance the budget is to stop spending money on things that are not the business of government and on programs that have outlived their usefulness or were never useful to begin with . ”
In that context , does anyone think that basic science , graduate student fellowships , young investigator grants and all the rest will survive at anything like current levels — much less with funding increases to catch up even to what has been lost to inflation over the last presidency ?
This post has gone on too long .
Why so many words when I could simply have said , “ It ’s the arithmetic , stupid . ”
Whatever else John McCain would do as President , advancing the cause of science in America is not plausibly one of them .
I ’ll leave it to the reader to dwell on the economic and national security consequences of such a choice
* For the record the most comprehensive study to date , performed under contract for the US Department of Health and Human Services , found that
The impact results from the four selected programs show no impacts on rates of sexual abstinence .
About half of all study youth had remained abstinent at the time of the final follow - up survey , and program and control group youth had similar rates of sexual abstinence .
Moreover , the average age at first sexual intercourse and the number of sexual partners were almost identical for program and control youth .

In addition , Safari 4 will also include a feature to create site - specific browsers , or SSBs , from any webpage .
The functionality is not unlike that offered by Mozilla Labs ' Prism project or the highly - regarded Fluid for Mac OS X , which create a desktop app that is basically a browser with minimal UI to directly access a web - based app .
And , Safari should incorporate CSS - based graphics improvements by the WebKit team , including CCS - based gradients , masks , and reflections .
These features make perfect sense in relation to not only increased use of Web2.0 apps like Google Mail or Flickr , but with the new MobileMe service that Apple announced yesterday .
Given its reliance on JavaScript to mimic desktop app functionality , eking out every bit of performance from the JavaScript engine is a must for reasonable performance .
And a site - specific browser for accessing MobileMe 's services can make an even more transparent user experience .
If cloud computing becomes the standard , the transition for Mac users will be seamless .
The CSS - based graphics simplify many common effects and improve performance by relying on rendering code compiled into the browser .
It brings a richer graphical experience to web apps akin to Apple 's polish on the desktop .
Though we 've heard that Snow Leopard should ship in about a year , Safari 4 could come much sooner .
Mac
Rumors notes that there are multiple versions " specifically for Windows , Tiger and Leopard . "
The projected performance improvements of JavaScript alone would be appreciated by MobileMe users .
All in all , Safari looks to gain yet more speed and will be ready for the cloud as more people move their data online .
Toni Hiley , curator and director of the CIA Museum , said the museum , which is not open to the public , is meant to support the CIA 's mission and intelligence operations .
Here ,
Hiley talks about an exhibit currently on display that chronicles the agency 's work in Afghanistan .

LANGLEY , Va . 
When the CIA 's gadget gurus need a new piece of technology these days to meet the demands of agents in Iraq , Afghanistan or some other outpost in the war on terror , they often walk into the past .
It 's all down the hall in the CIA Museum , where long - abandoned technological fantasies of the Cold War are taking on new relevance in the modern - day fight against terrorists and a whole new crop of hostile states .
A smaller option for remote surveillance ?
Maybe there 's a way to adapt that old " Insectothopter " — a true - to - life robotic dragonfly that was developed in the 1970s to fly tiny listening devices through open windows in heavily guarded buildings .
Or perhaps there 's something to that tiny pigeon cam , built decades ago to be carried over hostile areas by trained birds .
" We 're revisiting technologies all the time … ( and ) we look back to the lessons learned historically on using these technologies and build on those foundations , " says Toni Hiley , the museum 's curator and director since 1999 .
Several times a week , Hiley says , she gets inquiries from operations officers or agency scientists about artifacts or files in the museum .
So what sort of material are they looking at and how will it be used ?
That , of course , is secret .
Just like the museum itself .
With five galleries spread over 11,000 square feet , the CIA Museum holds artifacts that curators can only dream about at the nearby International Spy Museum in Washington , where about 700,000 people a year pony up for $ 20 tickets .
But the only way for the public to see the CIA 's exhibits is an online tour via the CIA 's website .
And nobody knows what the average taxpayer is paying for that virtual visit :
The museum falls within the CIA 's classified budget .
The CIA 's permanent exhibits include all the classic , James Bond - style gadgets — stealthy pistols and fighting knives , cameras disguised as cigarette packs , even a pipe designed to receive radio messages and relay them silently to the user 's ear by sending vibrations up his jawbone .
There 's also the desk of Gen .
" Wild Bill " Donovan , who led the CIA 's World War II predecessor , the Office of Strategic Services .
And down the hall sits a two - man , semi- submersible boat developed to secretly drop CIA agents along hostile coasts .
Yet unlike , say , the National Cryptologic Museum , set up near the National Security Agency to promote public understanding of NSA 's code - breaking and surveillance missions , the CIA Museum is inside the agency 's headquarters on the secure Langley compound .
Though everything on display is declassified , only agency employees and cleared guests can get to it .
" The museum is here to support the agency 's mission , to support intelligence operations , to support the agency 's training ( and ) … recruitment , " says Hiley , who gave a USA TODAY reporter and photographer a tour of the museum .
" The museum not only preserves the tangible pieces of the agency 's history , but we also preserve its culture . "
Afghanistan exhibit
The museum 's collection is loaded with unique and historically important items , and it would behoove the agency to find ways to make it more accessible to the public , says Peter Earnest , a 35 - year CIA veteran and executive director of the International Spy Museum .
" It 's a way to give the public a better understanding of what their mission is ( at CIA ) … and to build support for that mission , " Earnest says .
Indeed , the newest exhibit offers an unprecedented look at the CIA 's secret role in the Afghanistan war .
There are photos of the seven - member team that launched the first U.S. operations in the country just days after the Sept. 11 attacks .
There are displays of the native garb they wore , the weapons they carried , even a saddle used on clandestine horseback hunts for al - Qaeda leaders .
But the purpose of the exhibit — like the museum itself — is not to serve the public , Hiley says .
Ever since then - CIA director William Colby suggested " a modest little museum " in the early ' 70s to educate and inform employees , she adds , the museum has been geared toward insiders .
All new CIA officers get a tour on their first day , and seasoned veterans also stroll in often .
In 2007 , about 4,000 people took officials tours , and Hiley estimates that the museum also gets tens of thousands of visits from employees and invited guests who stop by on their own .
" I 've had officers tell me that they walk potential recruits through the museum , " Hiley says , " and they often find that that person will sign on the dotted line after seeing the stories and the artifacts . "
Open government advocates say all taxpayers should get the same chance to see the exhibits — and know what they cost .
The NSA has proved " it 's possible for an intelligence agency to have a public museum if there 's a will to do so , " says Steven Aftergood , who heads the Project on Government Secrecy at the Federation of American Scientists .
" All that 's missing is a desire to serve the public . "
The museum does loan pieces of its collection to public institutions — presidential libraries , the Smithsonian , etc. — but not to for - profit entities , such as the Spy Museum .
There was some discussion in decades past of building a publicly accessible museum on the fringe of the CIA 's Langley compound , Earnest says , but it never got traction .
And for security reasons , Hiley says , there 's been no discussion in recent years of opening the museum to the outside world .
The museum could help people understand intelligence 's role , Hiley says , but " that really is n't our mission . "

We all know people who are tense and nervous and can't relax .
They may have been wired differently since childhood .
New research by the HealthEmotions Research Institute and Department of Psychiatry at the University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health ( SMPH ) indicates that the brains of those suffering from anxiety and severe shyness in social situations consistently respond more strongly to stress , and show signs of being anxious even in situations that others find safe .
Dr. Ned Kalin , chairman of the UW Department of Psychiatry and HealthEmotions Research Institute , in collaboration with graduate student Andrew Fox and others , has published a new study on anxious brains in the online journal PLoS One .
The study looked at brain activity , anxious behaviour , and stress hormones in adolescent rhesus monkeys , which have long been used as a model to understand anxious temperament in human children .
Anxious temperament is important because it is an early predictor of the later risk to develop anxiety , depression , and drug abuse related to self medicating .
The researchers found that those individuals with the most anxious temperaments showed higher activity in the amygdala , a part of the brain that regulates emotion and triggers reactions to anxiety , such as the fight or flight response .
These anxious monkeys had more metabolic activity in the amygdala in both secure and threatening situations .
" The brain machinery underlying the stress response seems to be always on in these individuals , " said Kalin , " even in situations that others perceive as safe and secure . "
Rhesus monkeys were graded on their anxious temperament , then exposed to situations that ranged from being secure at home with their cage - mates , to being alone , to being confronted by an unfamiliar person .
This unknown person stood in front of the monkey presenting her facial profile to the monkey while avoiding any eye contact .
The adolescent monkeys received an injection of FDG , a radioactive substance similar to glucose that lights up the active parts of the brain when the monkeys are imaged with Positron Emission Tomography ( PET ) .
Whether in a secure environment or a more uncertain and possibly scary one , the nervous monkeys had more brain activity in the amygdala and surrounding " stress response " parts of the brain .
The increased amygdala activity corresponded to higher levels of " freezing " behaviour , fewer vocalizations and higher levels of the stress hormone cortisol in the anxious monkeys .
When the monkeys were retested a year and a half later , the results were the same : the anxious monkeys still were more stressed out than their calmer peers when judged by the behavioural and physiological measures .
" We 're looking for better ways to diagnose and treat mental illness , " explains Kalin , about his ongoing work at HealthEmotions .
" We 're trying to understand how the brain influences mood , reactions to stress and physical health . "
Psychiatrists have long known that an anxious temperament in childhood is a risk factor for developing anxiety disorders , depression and substance abuse .
These new findings in young rhesus monkeys point to a brain mechanism that is present early in life that predisposes to this disposition .
The current research suggests that the reason is it is hard for some one with an anxious temperament to " calm down " is because they are wired in a way that tends to keep them tense and anxious .

Purely in the interests of science , I have replaced the word " wand " with " wang " in the first Harry Potter Book
< JonJonB >
Let 's see the results ...
< JonJonB >
" Why are n't you supposed to do magic ? " asked Harry .
< JonJonB > " Oh , well -- I was at Hogwarts meself but I -- er -- got expelled , ter tell yeh the truth .
In me third year .
They snapped me wang in half an ' everything
< JonJonB > A magic wang ... this was what Harry had been really looking forward to .
< JonJonB >
" Yes , yes .
I thought I 'd be seeing you soon .
Harry Potter . "
It was n't a question .
" You have your mother 's eyes .
It seems only yesterday she was in here herself , buying her first wang .
Ten and a quarter inches long , swishy , made of willow .
Nice wang for charm work . "
< JonJonB >
" Your father , on the other hand , favored a mahogany wang .
Eleven inches . "
< JonJonB >
Harry took the wang .
He felt a sudden warmth in his fingers .
He raised the wang above his head , brought it swishing down through the dusty air and a stream of red and gold sparks shot from the end like a firework , throwing dancing spots of light on to the walls
< JonJonB > " Oh , move over , " Hermione snarled .
She grabbed Harry 's wang , tapped the lock , and whispered , ' Alohomora ! "
< JonJonB >
The troll could n't feel Harry hanging there , but even a troll will notice if you stick a long bit of wood up its nose , and Harry 's wang had still been in his hand when he'd jumped - it had gone straight up one of the troll 's nostrils .
< JonJonB >
He bent down and pulled his wang out of the troll 's nose .
It was covered in what looked like lumpy gray glue .
< JonJonB >
He ran onto the field as you fell , waved his wang , and you sort of slowed down before you hit the ground .
Then he whirled his wang at the dementors .
Shot silver stuff at them .
< JonJonB > Ok
< JonJonB >
I have found , definitive proof
< JonJonB > that J.K
Rowling is a dirty DIRTY woman , making a fool of us all
< JonJonB > " Yes , " Harry said , gripping his wang very tightly , and moving into the middle of the deserted classroom .
He tried to keep his mind on flying , but something else kept intruding ....
Any second now , he might hear his mother again ... but he should n't think that , or he would hear her again , and he did n't want to ... or did he ?
< melusine > O_______O
< JonJonB >
Something silver - white , something enormous , erupted from the end of his wang
< JonJonJonB >
Then , with a sigh , he raised his wang and prodded the silvery substance with its tip .
< JonJonJonB > ' Get - off - me ! '
Harry gasped .
For a few seconds they struggled , Harry pulling at his uncles sausage - like fingers with his left hand , his right maintaining a firm grip on his raised wang .
In the Philippines , women 's health advocates and legislators are working to create access to family planning and contraception for women but the Catholic Church is stuck on abortion and has its own agenda .
Picture accessible primary health care services including comprehensive women ’s health , maternal health care and a host of sexual and reproductive health services covering both young and old .
Anywhere else , it may sound like a perfectly good idea .
In the Philippines where a segment of the conservative Catholic hierarchy insists on imposing its views on public policy , reproductive health agendas are all supposedly a smokescreen for the legalisation of abortion .
In Manila , the Catholic Bishops ’ Conference Episcopal Commission on Family Life marked the 40th anniversary of the Humanae Vitae by renewing the church ’s stance against a variety of pending legislation supported by women ’s rights advocates labelling them as “ DEATH ” bills ( to stand for Divorce , Euthanasia , Abortion , Total Reproductive Health , Homosexuality ) .
Papal Nuncio Edward Joseph Adams also reminded Catholics that sex should not be treated as a pleasurable experience but as an act of self - giving love and called for self - giving that " starts in the God of love . "
The Humanae Vitae was the 1968 Encyclical Letter of Pope Paul VI which laid down Catholic teaching against the use of contraceptives .
The document was considered controversial when it was first issued , stating that no other document undermined the church ’s teaching authority .
Not only did it end up splitting the hierarchy but a majority of Catholics choose to ignore the ban .
Sex .
Abortion .
Parenthood .

Catholics for Free Choice notes that according to R. Scott Appleby , a historian at the University of Notre Dame , " It was the first time in the history of the modern church that a papal teaching had been openly defied in such a widespread fashion . "
Last week , Philippine Bishops also issued a call to deny communion to Catholic members of Congress who purportedly “ push for the legalization of abortion . ”
The Bishops claimed that while not a sanction or a penalty , the denial of communion is a reaction to a person ’s “ public unworthiness ” because of an “ objective situation of sin . ”
According to the Bishops , in this case , “ a person is in an objective situation of sin if he paved the way for people to commit abortion . ”
While Catholic teaching sanctions the rhythm method of family planning , however , its position equates all manner of contraception with abortion .
In this case , the solons accused of “ legalizing abortion ” are the forty - eight sponsors of the reproductive health bill .
Despite this , reproductive health advocates supporting the measure insisted that the use of contraceptives can make resorting to clandestine abortions unnecessary .
Abortion has been penalized in the Philippines since 1897 but in 2006 , the Guttmacher Institute pegged the annual rate of abortions in the country at 473,000 or 27 out of 1,000 pregnancies , even higher than the annual rate in the United States ( 20:1000 ) where abortion is legal .
The irony is that the only mention of abortion in pending legislation is in the provision that mandates a standard of “ humane treatment ” in post- abortion care .
The bill does not even propose legalization of abortion as the Catholic Church alleges .
While the Church proclaims that Humanae Vitae in 1968 represented its reaction against population control programs and the widespread use of modern contraceptives , further conflation of contraception with abortion actually took place over a period of years , culminating during the reign of Pope John Paul II .
Even as St. Augustine laid the basis for Catholic teaching condemning how abortion breaks the connection between sex and procreation , he did n’t peg the beginning of “ life ” at fertilisation .
In fact in the 8th century , penance for the commission of abortion took into consideration the circumstances of women who procured them , specifically in situations of difficulty ( e.g. inability to support a child , or concealment of dishonour ) .
To date , Philippine penal law reflects this concept of “ concealment of dishonour ” in a provision focused on mitigating circumstances in the case of abortion .
On one hand , it could be argued that the notions contained in “ concealment of dishonour ” are premised on archaic views about women ’s capacities and status prevailing at the time .
On the other hand , the Church ’s current uncompromising and absolutist position on abortion and contraception allows virtually no room for understanding the specific circumstances of women who opt to have abortions ( or in this case , decide to use contraception ) , let alone the exercise of moral deliberation or judgement .
The Catholic Church ’s teachings on abortion have never been proclaimed “ infallible ” teaching by any Pope to date .
As it stands today , however , the rigid interpretation and approach to abortion , right down to its conflation with contraception purporting to be premised on the value of “ life , ” tends to be a meaningless abstraction when it disregards the real lives of women .
In the Philippines where maternal mortality continues to soar at 162 per 100,000 live births , access to family planning information and services which include options in contraception , and humane treatment in post- abortion care are clearly a matter of life and death for Filipino women .

American soldiers have long scrawled messages to the enemy on the bombs they were about to deliver .
In The Making of the Atomic Bomb , Richard Rhodes reminds us , for instance , that “ Little Boy , ” the bomb that would inaugurate a new age over Hiroshima , “ was inscribed with autographs and messages , some of them obscene .
‘ Greetings to the Emperor from the men of the Indianapolis , ’ one challenged . ”
( The Indianapolis , a cruiser which had transported parts of Little Boy to the island of Tinian for assembly , had been torpedoed by a Japanese submarine only a week earlier and most of its crew had died at sea under gruesome circumstances . )
Recently , my eye was caught by a report on just such “ autographs and messages ” from our most recent war .
A Washington Post piece discussing the air war over Baghdad and the Hellfire missiles the U.S. military has been regularly firing into the vast Shiite slum , Sadr City , these last months included this passage :
“ At a sprawling air base on the outskirts of Baghdad , Edens , Katzenberger and their colleagues live in small trailers surrounded by blast walls , play volleyball on sand courts and eat at an outdoor food court .
Many of the pilots are in their 20s .
The pilots sometimes scrawl messages on the five - foot - long missiles strapped to their ‘ birds . ’
During a recent visit to the base , a reporter saw a missile addressed to ‘ Haji , ’ an honorific for people who have made the pilgrimage to Mecca .
Many U.S. soldiers use it to refer dismissively to Iraqis and Arabs in general .
Someone wrote ‘ rock this thang ’ on another . ”
“ To refer dismissively … ” :
This is the Post ’s polite way of describing the bedrock racism — the demeaning of the enemy ( and hardening of the self ) — that is essentially bound to go with any counterinsurgency - cum - neocolonial war like those in Iraq and Afghanistan .
Few know this better than Pulitzer Prize - winning former war reporter Chris Hedges who , along with Laila al - Arian , has produced a remarkable new book , Collateral Damage , America ’s War Against Iraqi Civilians ( officially published on this very day ) .
Based on hundreds of hours of interviews with veterans of the Iraq war and occupation , it lays out graphically indeed and in their own words the American system of patrols , convoys , home raids , detentions , and military checkpoints that became a living nightmare for civilians in Iraq .
Think of their book as a two - person version of the Vietnam - era Winter Soldier Investigation , this time for a war in which Americans have seemed especially uneager to know much about what their troops , many thousands of miles from home , are really doing to the “ hajis . ”
The following piece — with echoes of Hedges ’s classic work War Is a Force That Gives Us Meaning — has been adapted from his introduction to the new book .

Collateral Damage
What It Really Means When America Goes to War
By Chris Hedges
Troops , when they battle insurgent forces , as in Iraq , or Gaza or Vietnam , are placed in “ atrocity producing situations . ”
Being surrounded by a hostile population makes simple acts , such as going to a store to buy a can of Coke , dangerous .
The fear and stress push troops to view everyone around them as the enemy .
The hostility is compounded when the enemy , as in Iraq , is elusive , shadowy and hard to find .
The rage soldiers feel after a roadside bomb explodes , killing or maiming their comrades , is one that is easily directed , over time , to innocent civilians who are seen to support the insurgents .
Civilians and combatants , in the eyes of the beleaguered troops , merge into one entity .
These civilians , who rarely interact with soldiers or Marines , are to most of the occupation troops in Iraq nameless , faceless , and easily turned into abstractions of hate .
They are dismissed as less than human .
It is a short psychological leap , but a massive moral leap .
It is a leap from killing — the shooting of someone who has the capacity to do you harm — to murder — the deadly assault against someone who cannot harm you .
The war in Iraq is now primarily about murder .
There is very little killing .
The savagery and brutality of the occupation is tearing apart those who have been deployed to Iraq .
As news reports have just informed us , 115 American soldiers committed suicide in 2007 .
This is a 13 % increase in suicides over 2006 .
And the suicides , as they did in the Vietnam War years , will only rise as distraught veterans come home , unwrap the self - protective layers of cotton wool that keep them from feeling , and face the awful reality of what they did to innocents in Iraq
American Marines and soldiers have become socialized to atrocity .
The killing project is not described in these terms to a distant public .
The politicians still speak in the abstract terms of glory , honor , and heroism , in the necessity of improving the world , in lofty phrases of political and spiritual renewal .
Those who kill large numbers of people always claim it as a virtue .
The campaign to rid the world of terror is expressed within the confines of this rhetoric , as if once all terrorists are destroyed evil itself will vanish .
The reality behind the myth , however , is very different .
The reality and the ideal tragically clash when soldiers and Marines return home .
These combat veterans are often alienated from the world around them , a world that still believes in the myth of war and the virtues of the nation .
They confront the grave , existential crisis of all who go through combat and understand that we have no monopoly on virtue , that in war we become as barbaric and savage as those we oppose .
This is a profound crisis of faith .
It shatters the myths , national and religious , that these young men and women were fed before they left for Iraq .
In short , they uncover the lie they have been told .
Their relationship with the nation will never be the same .
These veterans give us a true narrative of the war — one that exposes the vast enterprise of industrial slaughter unleashed in Iraq .
They expose the lie .
War as Betrayal
“ This unit sets up this traffic control point , and this 18 - year - old kid is on top of an armored Humvee with a .50 - caliber machine gun , ” remembered Sgt. Geoffrey Millard , who served in Tikrit with the 42nd Infantry Division .
“ And this car speeds at him pretty quick and he makes a split - second decision that that ’s a suicide bomber , and he presses the butterfly trigger and puts two hundred rounds in less than a minute into this vehicle .
It killed the mother , a father , and two kids .
The boy was aged four and the daughter was aged three .
“ And they briefed this to the general , ” Millard said , “ and they briefed it gruesome .
I mean , they had pictures .
They briefed it to him .
And this colonel turns around to this full division staff and says , ‘ If these f—ing hajis learned to drive , this sh-t would n’t happen . ' ”
Millard and tens of thousands of other veterans suffer not only delayed reactions to stress but this crisis of faith .
The God they knew , or thought they knew , failed them .
The church or the synagogue or the mosque , which promised redemption by serving God and country , did not prepare them for the awful betrayal of this civic religion , for the capacity we all have for human atrocity , for the stories of heroism used to mask the reality of war .
War is always about betrayal : betrayal of the young by the old , of idealists by cynics , and of troops by politicians .
This bitter knowledge of betrayal has seeped into the ranks of America ’s Iraq War veterans .
It has unleashed a new wave of disillusioned veterans not seen since the Vietnam War .
It has made it possible for us to begin , again , to see war ’s death mask and understand our complicity in evil .
“ And then , you know , my sort of sentiment of , ‘ What the f — are we doing , that I felt that way in Iraq , ' ” said Sgt. Ben Flanders , who estimated that he ran hundreds of military convoys in Iraq .
“ It ’s the sort of insanity of it and the fact that it reduces it .
Well , I think war does anyway , but I felt like there was this enormous reduction in my compassion for people .
The only thing that wound up mattering is myself and the guys that I was with .
And everybody else be damned , whether you are an Iraqi — I ’m sorry , I ’m sorry you live here , I ’m sorry this is a terrible situation , and I ’m sorry that you have to deal with all of , you know , army vehicles running around and shooting , and these insurgents and all this stuff . ”
The Hobbesian world of Iraq described by Flanders is one where the ethic is kill or be killed .
All nuance and distinction vanished for him .
He fell , like most of the occupation troops , into a binary world of us and them , the good and the bad , those worthy of life and those unworthy of life .
The vast majority of Iraqi civilians , caught in the middle of the clash among militias , death squads , criminal gangs , foreign fighters , kidnapping rings , terrorists , and heavily armed occupation troops , were just one more impediment that , if they happened to get in the way , had to be eradicated .
These Iraqis were no longer human .
They were abstractions in human form .
“ The first briefing you get when you get off the plane in Kuwait , and you get off the plane and you ’re holding a duffel bag in each hand , ” Millard remembered .
“ You ’ve got your weapon slung .
You ’ve got a web sack on your back .
You ’re dying of heat .
You ’re tired .
You ’re jet - lagged .
Your mind is just full of goop .
And then you ’re scared on top of that , because , you know , you ’re in Kuwait , you ’re not in the States anymore …
So fear sets in , too .
And they sit you into this little briefing room and you get this briefing about how , you know , you ca n’t trust any of these f—ing hajis , because all these f — - king hajis are going to kill you .
And ‘ haji ’ is always used as a term of disrespect and usually with the F - word in front of it . ”
The press coverage of the war in Iraq rarely exposes the twisted pathology of this war .
We see the war from the perspective of the troops or from the equally skewed perspective of the foreign reporters , holed up in hotels , hemmed in by drivers and translators and official security and military escorts .
There are moments when war ’s face appears to these voyeurs and professional killers , perhaps from the back seat of a car where a small child , her brains oozing out of her head , lies dying , but mostly it remains hidden .
And all our knowledge of the war in Iraq has to be viewed as lacking the sweep and depth that will come one day , perhaps years from now , when a small Iraqi boy reaches adulthood and unfolds for us the sad and tragic story of the invasion and bloody occupation of his nation .
As the war sours , as it no longer fits into the mythical narrative of us as liberators and victors , it fades from view .
The cable news shows that packaged and sold us the war have stopped covering it , trading the awful carnage of bomb blasts in Baghdad for the soap - opera sagas of Roger Clemens , Miley Cyrus , and Britney Spears in her eternal meltdown .
Average monthly coverage of the war in Iraq on the ABC , NBC , and CBS newscasts combined has been cut in half , falling from 388 minutes in 2003 , to 274 in 2004 , to 166 in 2005 .
And newspapers , including papers like the Boston Globe , have shut down their Baghdad bureaus .
Deprived of a clear , heroic narrative , restricted and hemmed in by security concerns , they have walked away .
Most reporters know that the invasion and the occupation have been a catastrophe .
They know the Iraqis do not want us .
They know about the cooked intelligence , spoon - fed to a compliant press by the Office of Special Plans and Lewis Libby ’s White House Iraq Group .
They know about Curveball , the forged documents out of Niger , the outed CIA operatives , and the bogus British intelligence dossiers that were taken from old magazine articles .
They know the weapons of mass destruction were destroyed long before we arrived .
They know that our military as well as our National Guard and reserve units are being degraded and decimated .
They know this war is not about bringing democracy to Iraq , that all the clichs about staying the course and completing the mission are used to make sure the president and his allies do not pay a political price while in power for their blunders and their folly .
The press knows all this , and if reporters had bothered to look they could have known it a long time ago .
But the press , or at least most of it , has lost the passion , the outrage , and the sense of mission that once drove reporters to defy authority and tell the truth .
The Legions of the Lost and Damned
War is the pornography of violence .
It has a dark beauty , filled with the monstrous and the grotesque .
The Bible calls it “ the lust of the eye ” and warns believers against it .
War allows us to engage in lusts and passions we keep hidden in the deepest , most private interiors of our fantasy lives .
It allows us to destroy not only things and ideas but human beings .
In that moment of wholesale destruction , we wield the power of the divine , the power to revoke another person ’s charter to live on this Earth .
The frenzy of this destruction — and when unit discipline breaks down , or when there was no unit discipline to begin with , “ frenzy ” is the right word — sees armed bands crazed by the poisonous elixir that our power to bring about the obliteration of others delivers .
All things , including human beings , become objects — objects either to gratify or destroy , or both .
Almost no one is immune .
The contagion of the crowd sees to that .
Human beings are machine - gunned and bombed from the air , automatic grenade launchers pepper hovels and neighbors with high - powered explosive devices , and convoys race through Iraq like freight trains of death .
These soldiers and Marines have at their fingertips the heady ability to call in airstrikes and firepower that obliterate landscapes and villages in fiery infernos .
They can instantly give or deprive human life , and with this power they become sick and demented .
The moral universe is turned upside down .
All human beings are used as objects .
And no one walks away uninfected .
War thrusts us into a vortex of pain and fleeting ecstasy .
It thrusts us into a world where law is of little consequence , human life is cheap , and the gratification of the moment becomes the overriding desire that must be satiated , even at the cost of another ’s dignity or life .
“ A lot of guys really supported that whole concept that , you know , if they do n’t speak English and they have darker skin , they ’re not as human as us , so we can do what we want , ” said Spc. Josh Middleton , who served in the 82nd Airborne in Iraq .
“ And you know , 20 - year - old kids are yelled at back and forth at Bragg , and we ’re picking up cigarette butts and getting yelled at every day for having a dirty weapon .
But over here , it ’s like life and death .
And 40 - year - old Iraqi men look at us with fear and we can — do you know what I mean ? — we have this power that you ca n’t have .
That ’s really liberating .
Life is just knocked down to this primal level of , you know , you worry about where the next food ’s going to come from , the next sleep or the next patrol , and to stay alive .
“ It ’s like , you feel like , I do n’t know , if you ’re a caveman , ” he added .
“ Do you know what I mean ?
Just , you know , I mean , this is how life is supposed to be .
Life and death , essentially .
No TV .
None of that bullsh - t . ”
It takes little in wartime to turn ordinary men into killers .
Most give themselves willingly to the seduction of unlimited power to destroy .
All feel the peer pressure to conform .
Few , once in battle , find the strength to resist .
Physical courage is common on a battlefield .
Moral courage , which these veterans have exhibited by telling us the truth about the war , is not .
Military machines and state bureaucracies , which seek to make us obey , seek also to silence those who return from war and speak to its reality .
They push aside these witnesses to hide from a public eager for stories of war that fit the mythic narrative of glory and heroism the essence of war , which is death .
War , as these veterans explain , exposes the capacity for evil that lurks just below the surface within all of us .
This is the truth these veterans , often with great pain , have had to face .
The historian Christopher Browning chronicled the willingness to kill in Ordinary Men , his study of Reserve Police Battalion 101 in Poland during World War II .
On the morning of July 12 , 1942 , the battalion , made up of middle - aged recruits , was ordered to shoot 1,800 Jews in the village of Jzefw in a daylong action .
The men in the unit had to round up the Jews , march them into the forest , and one by one order them to lie down in a row .
The victims , including women , infants , children , and the elderly , were shot dead at close range .
Battalion members were offered the option to refuse , an option only about a dozen men took , although a few more asked to be relieved once the killing began .
Those who did not want to continue , Browning says , were disgusted rather than plagued by conscience .
When the men returned to the barracks they “ were depressed , angered , embittered and shaken . ”
They drank heavily .
They were told not to talk about the event , “ but they needed no encouragement in that direction . ”
Each generation responds to war as innocents .
Each generation discovers its own disillusionment , often at a terrible personal price .
And the war in Iraq has begun to produce legions of the lost and the damned , many of whom battle the emotional and physical trauma that comes from killing and exposure to violence .
Punishing the Local Population
Sgt. Camilo Meja , who eventually applied while still on active duty to become a conscientious objector , said the ugly side of American racism and chauvinism appeared the moment his unit arrived in the Middle East .
Fellow soldiers instantly ridiculed Arab - style toilets because they would be “ sh - tting like dogs . ”
The troops around him treated Iraqis , whose language they did not speak and whose culture was alien , little better than animals .
The word “ haji ” swiftly became a slur to refer to Iraqis , in much the same way “ gook ” was used to debase the Vietnamese and “ raghead ” is used to belittle those in Afghanistan .
Soon those around him ridiculed “ haji food , ” “ haji homes , ” and “ haji music . ”
Bewildered prisoners , who were rounded up in useless and indiscriminate raids , were stripped naked and left to stand terrified for hours in the baking sun .
They were subjected to a steady torrent of verbal and physical abuse .
“ I experienced horrible confusion , ” Meja remembered , “ not knowing whether I was more afraid for the detainees or for what would happen to me if I did anything to help them . ”
These scenes of abuse , which began immediately after the American invasion , were little more than collective acts of sadism .
Meja watched , not daring to intervene yet increasingly disgusted at the treatment of Iraqi civilians .
He saw how the callous and unchecked abuse of power first led to alienation among Iraqis and spawned a raw hatred of the occupation forces .
When Army units raided homes , the soldiers burst in on frightened families , forced them to huddle in the corners at gunpoint , and helped themselves to food and items in the house .
“ After we arrested drivers , ” he recalled , “ we would choose whichever vehicles we liked , fuel them from confiscated jerry cans , and conduct undercover presence patrols in the impounded cars .
“ But to this day I cannot find a single good answer as to why I stood by idly during the abuse of those prisoners except , of course , my own cowardice , ” he also noted .
Iraqi families were routinely fired upon for getting too close to checkpoints , including an incident where an unarmed father driving a car was decapitated by a .50 - caliber machine gun in front of his small son .
Soldiers shot holes into cans of gasoline being sold alongside the road and then tossed incendiary grenades into the pools to set them ablaze .
“ It ’s fun to shoot sh-t up , ” a soldier said .
Some opened fire on small children throwing rocks .
And when improvised explosive devices ( IEDS ) went off , the troops fired wildly into densely populated neighborhoods , leaving behind innocent victims who became , in the callous language of war , “ collateral damage . ”
“ We would drive on the wrong side of the highway to reduce the risk of being hit by an IED , ” Meja said of the deadly roadside bombs .
“ This forced oncoming vehicles to move to one side of the road and considerably slowed down the flow of traffic .
In order to avoid being held up in traffic jams , where someone could roll a grenade under our trucks , we would simply drive up on sidewalks , running over garbage cans and even hitting civilian vehicles to push them out of the way .
Many of the soldiers would laugh and shriek at these tactics . ”
At one point the unit was surrounded by an angry crowd protesting the occupation .
Meja and his squad opened fire on an Iraqi holding a grenade , riddling the man ’s body with bullets .
Meja checked his clip afterward and determined that he had fired 11 rounds into the young man .
Units , he said , nonchalantly opened fire in crowded neighborhoods with heavy M - 240 Bravo machine guns , AT - 4 launchers , and Mark 19s , a machine gun that spits out grenades .
“ The frustration that resulted from our inability to get back at those who were attacking us , ” Meja said , “ led to tactics that seemed designed simply to punish the local population that was supporting them . ”
The Algebra of Occupation
It is the anonymity of the enemy that fuels the mounting rage .
Comrades are maimed or die , and there is no one to lash back at , unless it is the hapless civilians who happen to live in the neighborhood where the explosion or ambush occurred .
Soldiers and Marines can do two or three tours in Iraq and never actually see the enemy , although their units come under attack and take numerous casualties .
These troops , who entered Baghdad in triumph when Iraq was occupied , soon saw the decisive victory over Saddam Hussein ’s army evolve into a messy war of attrition .
The superior firepower and lightning victory was canceled out by what T. E. Lawrence once called the “ algebra of occupation . ”
Writing about the British occupation of Iraq following the Ottoman Empire ’s collapse in World War I , Lawrence , in lessons these veterans have had to learn on their own , highlighted what has always doomed conventional , foreign occupying powers .
“ Rebellion must have an unassailable base … it must have a sophisticated alien enemy , in the form of a disciplined army of occupation too small to dominate the whole area effectively from fortified posts , ” Lawrence wrote .
“ It must have a friendly population , not actively friendly , but sympathetic to the point of not betraying rebel movements to the enemy .
Rebellions can be made by 2 percent active in a striking force , and 98 percent passive sympathy .
Granted mobility , security … time and doctrine … victory will rest with the insurgents , for the algebraical factors are in the end decisive . ”
The failure in Iraq is the same failure that bedeviled the French in Algeria ; the United States in Vietnam ; and the British , who for 800 years beat , imprisoned , transported , shot , and hanged hundreds of thousands of Irish patriots .
Occupation , in each case , turned the occupiers into beasts and fed the insurrection .
It created patterns where innocents , as in Iraq , were terrorized and killed .
The campaign against a mostly invisible enemy , many veterans said , has given rise to a culture of terror and hatred among U.S. forces , many of whom , losing ground , have in effect declared war on all Iraqis .
Meja said , regarding the deaths of Iraqis at checkpoints , “ This sort of killing of civilians has long ceased to arouse much interest or even comment . ”
Meja also watched soldiers from his unit abuse the corpses of Iraqi dead .
He related how , in one incident , soldiers laughed as an Iraqi corpse fell from the back of a truck .
“ Take a picture of me and this motherf —er , ” said one of the soldiers who had been in Meja ’s squad in Third Platoon , putting his arm around the corpse .
The shroud fell away from the body , revealing a young man wearing only his pants .
There was a bullet hole in his chest .
“ Damn , they really f—ed you up , did n’t they ? ” the soldier laughed .
The scene , Meja noted , was witnessed by the dead man ’s brothers and cousins .
The senior officers , protected in heavily fortified compounds , rarely experienced combat .
They sent their troops on futile missions in the quest to be awarded Combat Infantry Badges .
This recognition , Meja noted , “ was essential to their further progress up the officer ranks . ”
This pattern meant that “ very few high - ranking officers actually got out into the action , and lower - ranking officers were afraid to contradict them when they were wrong . ”
When the badges — bearing an emblem of a musket with the hammer dropped , resting on top of an oak wreath — were finally awarded , the commanders brought in Iraqi tailors to sew the badges on the left breast pockets of their desert combat uniforms .
“ This was one occasion when our leaders led from the front , ” Meja noted bitterly .
“ They were among the first to visit the tailors to get their little patches of glory sewn next to their hearts . ”
War breeds gratuitous , senseless , and repeated acts of atrocity and violence .
Abuse of the powerless becomes a kind of perverted sport for the troops .
“ I mean , if someone has a fan , they ’re a white - collar family , ” said Spc. Philip Chrystal , who carried out raids on Iraqi homes in Kirkuk .
“ So we get started on this day , this one , in particular .
And it starts with the psy - ops [ psychological operations ] vehicles out there , you know , with the big speakers playing a message in Arabic or Farsi or Kurdish or whatever they happen to be saying , basically , saying put your weapons , if you have them , next to the front door in your house .
Please come outside , blah , blah , blah , blah .
And we had Apaches flying over for security , if they ’re needed , and it ’s also a good show of force .
And we were running around , and we ’d done a few houses by this point , and I was with my platoon leader , my squad leader , and maybe a couple other people , but I do n’t really remember .
“ And we were approaching this one house , and this farming area ; they ’re , like , built up into little courtyards , ” he said .
“ So they have like the main house , common area .
They have like a kitchen and then they have like a storage - shed - type deal .
And we were approaching , and they had a family dog .
And it was barking ferociously , because it was doing its job .
And my squad leader , just out of nowhere , just shoots it .
And he did n’t — motherf —er — he shot it , and it went in the jaw and exited out .
“ So I see this dog — and I ’m a huge animal lover .
I love animals — and this dog has like these eyes on it , and he ’s running around spraying blood all over the place .
And the family is sitting right there , with three little children and a mom and a dad horrified .
And I ’m at a loss for words .
And so I yell at him .
I ’m like , u2018 What the f— are you doing ? ’
And so the dog ’s yelping .
It ’s crying out without a jaw .
And I ’m looking at the family , and they ’re just scared .
And so I told them , I was like , ‘ F—ing shoot it , ’ you know .
‘ At least kill it , because that ca n’t be fixed .
It ’s suffering . ’
And I actually get tears from just saying this right now , but — and I had tears then , too — and I ’m looking at the kids and they are so scared .
So I got the interpreter over with me and I get my wallet out and I gave them twenty bucks , because that ’s what I had .
And , you know , I had him give it to them and told them that I ’m so sorry that asshole did that .
Which was very common .
“ Was a report ever filed about it ? ” he asked .
“ Was anything ever done ?
Any punishment ever dished out ?
No , absolutely not . ”
The Plaster Saints of War
The vanquished know war .
They see through the empty jingoism of those who use the abstract words of “ glory , ” “ honor , ” and “ patriotism ” to mask the cries of the wounded , the brutal killing , war profiteering , and chest - pounding grief .
They know the lies the victors often do not acknowledge , the lies covered up in stately war memorials and mythic war narratives , filled with stories of courage and comradeship .
They know the lies that permeate the thick , self - important memoirs by amoral statesmen who make wars but do not know war .
The vanquished know the essence of war — death .
They grasp that war is necrophilia .
They see that war is a state of almost pure sin , with its goals of hatred and destruction .
They know how war fosters alienation , leads inevitably to nihilism , and is a turning away from the sanctity and preservation of life .
All other narratives about war too easily fall prey to the allure and seductiveness of violence as well as the attraction of the godlike power that comes with the license to kill with impunity .
But the words of the vanquished come later , sometimes long after the war , when grown men and women unpack the suffering they endured as children : what it was like to see their mother or father killed or taken away , or what it was like to lose their homes , their community , their security , and to be discarded as human refuse .
But by then few listen .
The truth about war comes out , but usually too late .
We are assured by the war - makers that these stories have no bearing on the glorious violent enterprise the nation is about to inaugurate .
And , lapping up the myth of war and its sense of empowerment , we prefer not to look .
We are trapped in a doomed war of attrition in Iraq .
We have blundered into a nation we know little about , caught in bitter rivalries between competing ethnic and religious groups .
Iraq was a cesspool for the British in 1917 when they occupied it .
It will be a cesspool for us as well .
We have embarked on an occupation that is as damaging to our souls as to our prestige and power and security .
We have become tyrants to others weaker than ourselves .
And we believe , falsely , that because we have the capacity to wage war we have the right to wage war .
We make our heroes out of clay .
We laud their gallant deeds and give them uniforms with colored ribbons on their chests for the acts of violence they committed or endured .
They are our false repositories of glory and honor , of power , of self - righteousness , of patriotism and self - worship , all that we want to believe about ourselves .
They are our plaster saints of war , the icons we cheer to defend us and make us and our nation great .
They are the props of our civic religion , our love of power and force , our belief in our right as a chosen nation to wield this force against the weak , and rule .
This is our nation ’s idolatry of itself .
And this idolatry has corrupted religious institutions , not only here but in most nations , making it impossible for us to separate the will of God from the will of the state .
Prophets are not those who speak of piety and duty from pulpits — few people in pulpits have much worth listening to — but are the battered wrecks of men and women who return from Iraq and speak the halting words we do not want to hear , words that we must listen to and heed to know ourselves .
They tell us war is a soulless void .
They have seen and tasted how war plunges us into perversion , trauma , and an unchecked orgy of death .
And it is their testimonies that have the redemptive power to save us from ourselves .
The Best of Tom Engelhardt
Marilyn Authenreith , a mother of two in North Carolina , felt strongly about supporting Hillary Rodham Clinton in the Democratic presidential primary .
But once the former first lady quit the race , Authenreith switched allegiance to Barack Obama , mainly because she thinks that he -- unlike Republican John McCain -- will push for universal healthcare .
“ I ca n’t understand the thinking of how someone would jump from Hillary to McCain , ” she said .
“ It does n’t make any sense . ”
Now that the Democratic marathon is over , Clinton supporters like Authenreith are siding heavily with Obama over McCain , polls show .
And Obama has taken a wide lead among female voters , belying months of political chatter and polls of primary voters suggesting that disappointment over Clinton ’s defeat might block the Illinois senator from enjoying his party ’s historic edge among women .
Advertisement
The rancor peaked two weeks ago with televised images of furious Clinton loyalists protesting a Democratic Party meeting in Washington to settle a dispute over Florida and Michigan delegates .
“ There are women still struggling with a real sense of grief that Hillary is not the nominee , ” said Maren Hesla , who runs campaign programs for EMILY ’s List , a group that promotes female candidates who support abortion rights .
But that sense “ will grow smaller with every day that passes from the nomination battles . ”
Still , McCain hopes to capitalize on the disillusionment of women who voted for Clinton .
The Arizona senator has appeared recently on “ The Ellen DeGeneres Show ” and “ The View , ” TV talk shows with many female viewers .
A top McCain advisor , former Hewlett - Packard Co. Chief Executive Carly Fiorina , met last week with dozens of Clinton loyalists in Ohio .
On Saturday , she joined McCain in a “ virtual town hall ” with other Clinton supporters .
Advertisement
“ I admire and respect her , ” McCain said of Clinton .
Aides suggested that McCain ’s support for a gas tax holiday , a hawkish foreign policy and steps against climate change would appeal to many women .
But in a year that strongly favors Democrats , McCain faces an uphill battle to cut into Obama ’s advantage among women , who made up more than half of the voters in recent presidential elections .
“ Women are voting for Obama because they dislike [ President ]
Bush , they dislike McCain , they dislike the war , and they ’re upset about the economy , and those facts override any concerns about the Clinton - Obama primaries , ” Democratic pollster Mark Mellman said .

During the final weeks of the Democratic race , Obama took pains to praise Clinton almost daily and to avoid any appearance that he was trying to force her to drop out .
In the days since Clinton abandoned the race and endorsed him , the political arm of Planned Parenthood and other women ’s groups have rallied behind Obama and joined forces to attack McCain .
Among other things , they have highlighted McCain ’s opposition to abortion rights .
The Republican ’s moderate image , they say , has misled many women into thinking he supports abortion rights .
“ It ’s astonishing the extent to which that ’s just assumed about him , ” said Hesla .
For a generation , women have favored Democrats , and men have leaned Republican .
In 2000 , Al Gore won 55 % of the female vote ; Bush offset that with 54 % of the male vote .

In his run for reelection , Bush fared better among women , thanks partly to his emphasis on terrorism in the aftermath of the Sept. 11 attacks .
Although he held a 7 - percentage - point lead among men over Democratic rival John F. Kerry , Bush finished just 1 percentage point behind among women .
But terrorism is no longer the dominant issue .
Bush administration shortcomings in the Iraq war and Hurricane Katrina have damaged the Republican Party .
Four out of five voters see the country as headed in the wrong direction .
And now , the nation ’s economic slowdown is the top concern for voters , and they see Democrats as better suited than Republicans to lead a turnaround .
Among those most concerned about economic troubles are white blue - collar women , a swing group targeted by both the McCain and Obama campaigns .

“ Women see themselves as more economically vulnerable than men , more likely recipients of the social safety net at some point in their lives , and they see a larger role for government , ” said Debbie Walsh , director of the Center for American Women and Politics at Rutgers University .
An NBC / Wall Street Journal poll found a wide gap last week : Women favored Obama over McCain , 52 % to 33 % .
The survey also found that voters who cast ballots for Clinton in the Democratic primaries preferred Obama over McCain , 61 % to 19 % .
Authenreith , a 43 - year - old business owner who lives in West Jefferson , N.C. , said Obama “ popped out of nowhere ” last year and seemed less experienced than Clinton .
But Authenreith , who was a respondent to a Times poll in February , said there was no question now that Obama would better handle the economy and , she hoped , overhaul the healthcare system .

“ I know if I vote a Republican in , ” she said , “ it will never happen . ”

Off - duty Fremont cop held in assault at BART SAN FRANCISCO
An off - duty Fremont police officer was arrested on suspicion of battery after Sunday 's country music concert at AT&T Park in San Francisco for allegedly attacking an off - duty firefighter whose wife pointed out that he was leaning against the door of a Muni train , police said Wednesday .
Off - duty officer Nick Maurer , 26 , cursed at the Richmond firefighter 's wife and then attacked the firefighter inside the Embarcadero BART Station , said BART Police Chief Gary Gee .
" It was pretty clear - cut that the Fremont officer was the instigator , " said Gee of the incident , which was reported at 10:47 p.m .
The Richmond firefighter , 41 - year - old Nick Jackalone , made a citizen 's arrest at the station .
Maurer was then formally arrested by BART police on suspicion of misdemeanor battery and released , Gee said .
Maurer 's case has not yet been reviewed by San Francisco prosecutors .
The account by BART police was disputed Wednesday by Maurer 's attorney , who called the altercation " a perfect storm that involved a misunderstanding plus alcohol plus testosterone . "
Attorney Terry Bowman said her client , who had been drinking at the concert , took action after a fellow Fremont cop , 37 - year - old Vince Bedolla , was " sucker - punched " by an unknown person on the Muni train , leaving him with a broken nose and bruises .
Maurer thought Jackalone had delivered the punch , Bowman said .
" He was protecting and defending his friend , " she said .
" He certainly believed that the person that he dealt with was the one who assaulted Bedolla . "
Jackalone did not sucker - punch anyone or instigate the attacks , Gee said , adding that none of the men sought medical attention after the incident .
Jackalone , a resident of Martinez , declined to comment on Wednesday .
Richmond Fire Chief Michael Banks said Jackalone was " still pretty shaken up " and would miss some work shifts as he recovered from facial cuts , bruises and soreness .
He said Jackalone served as an engineer on a fire crew and had been with the department for 21 years .
According to Gee , the trouble began on a Muni train carrying concertgoers to the Embarcadero BART Station when Jackalone 's wife , Lucia , noticed that Maurer was leaning on the door and responded by " politely " telling someone with Maurer that he should be careful .
" All of a sudden , " Gee said , " Maurer started cursing at the woman . "
After both parties got off the train at the Embarcadero Station , Gee said , Maurer started pushing and fighting with Jackalone on a concourse between the pay gates for Muni and BART .
Gee said Maurer went after Jackalone again inside the BART gates after using his badge to gain free access , as police officers are allowed to do .
After Jackalone and his wife went down to the underground BART platform to catch a train , " Here comes Maurer again , " said Gee .
" He picks a fight with Jackalone again on the platform , and they get separated again . "
Gee said Bedolla was involved in separating Maurer from Jackalone , which Bowman disputed .
She also said her client did not repeatedly attack Jackalone .
BART officers then arrived at the platform , Gee said , and arrested Maurer after speaking to Jackalone and other witnesses .
Bowman said her client , who is on paid leave , is a probationary employee who is not yet a permanent police officer in Fremont .
He has never been in trouble before , she said .
Fremont police Detective Bill Veteran , a department spokesman , said department officials were aware of the incident but could not discuss it because it is a personnel matter .
Jackalone , Maurer and Bedolla were among more than 35,000 people who had attended a 4 p.m. country music concert at AT&T Park that was headlined by Kenny Chesney and also featured Brooks & Dunn , LeAnn Rimes and other performers .
Guest Column : Uri Avnery , the doyen of Israeli peace campaigners , has seen it all before .
With last week ’s killing of Hizballah commander Imad Mughniyeh , Israel once again demonstrated an unrivaled capacity to pull off difficult assassinations , and then went into a frenzy of self - congratulation over its prowess .
After last year ’s failed Lebanon war , Israel ’s political - military leadership certainly felt the need to offer its public a psychological pick - me - up .
But at what cost ?
Avnery explores the history of such “ liquidations , ” as the Israeli establishment calls them , to show that they tend to actually strengthen resistance organizations , while raising the danger to the civilian population of those who carry them out .
Although he would n’t know it , Uri Avnery played an important part in my journey from Zionism .
On Yom Kippur in 1979 , as an increasingly skeptical young activist of Habonim , I did n’t bother going to shul ; instead I stayed home and read Avnery ’s Israel Without Zionism .
It was the first time I had encountered an Israeli Jew challenging the fundamentals of the nationalist ideology of “ Jewish Statehood , ” and I was moved by the fact that , as a participant in those events , he was more than willing to reveal the violent process of Palestinian dispossession in 1948 , puncturing the mythology of a “ miracle ” by which the Palestinians had simply upped and left in response to Arab radio broadcasts .
Avnery helped “ reassure ” me back then , as an uncertain 18 - year - old , that it was okay to be Jewish and question Zionism .
I ’m honored to have him as a guest contributor .
Blood and Champagne
By Uri Avnery
Every people elevates the profession in which it excels .
If a person in the street were asked to name the area of enterprise in which we Israelis excel , his answer would probably be : Hi-Tech .
And indeed , in this area we have recorded some impressive achievements .
It seems as if hardly a day passes without an Israeli start - up company that was born in a garage being sold for hundreds of millions .
Little Israel is one of the major hi-tech powers in the world .
But the profession in which Israel is not only one of the biggest , but the unchallenged Numero Uno is : liquidations .
This week this was proven once again .
The Hebrew verb “ lekhassel ” – liquidate – in all its grammatical forms , currently dominates our public discourse .
Respected professors debate with academic solemnity when to “ liquidate ” and whom .
Used generals discuss with professional zeal the technicalities of “ liquidation ” , its rules and methods .
Shrewd politicians compete with each other about the number and status of the candidates for “ liquidation ” .
Indeed , for a long time now there has not been such an orgy of jubilation and self - congratulation in the Israeli media as there was this week .
Every reporter , every commentator , every political hack , every transient celeb interviewed on TV , on the radio and in the newspapers , was radiant with pride .
We have done it !
We have succeeded !
We have “ liquidated ” Imad Mughniyeh !
He was a “ terrorist ” .
And not just a terrorist , a master terrorist !
An arch - terrorist !
The very king of terrorists !
From hour to hour his stature grew , reaching gigantic proportions .
Compared to him , Osama Bin-Laden is a mere beginner .
The list of his exploits grew from news report to news report , from headline to headline .
There is and never has been anyone like him .
For years he has kept out of sight .
But our good boys – many , many good boys – have not neglected him for a moment .
They worked day and night , weeks and months , years and decades , in order to trace him .
They “ knew him better than his friends , better than he knew himself ” ( verbatim quote from a respected Haaretz commentator , gloating like all his colleagues ) .
True , one killjoy Western commentator argued on Aljazeera that Mughniyeh had dropped from sight because he had ceased to be important , that his great days as a terrorist were in the 80s and 90s , when he hijacked a plane and brought down the Marine headquarters in Beirut and Israeli institutions abroad .
Since Hizbullah has turned into a state - within - the - state , with a kind of regular army , he had – according to this version – outlived his usefulness .
But what the hell .
Mughniyeh - the - person has disappeared , and Mughniyeh - the - legend has taken his place , a world - embracing mythological terrorist , who has long been marked as “ a Son of Death ” ( i.e. a person to be killed ) as declared on TV by another out - of - use general .
His “ liquidation ” was a huge , almost supra-natural , achievement , much more important than Lebanon War II , in which we were not so very successful .
The “ liquidation ” equals at least the glorious Entebbe exploit , if not more .
True , the Holy Book enjoins us : “ Rejoice not when thine enemy falleth , and let not thine heart be glad when he stumbleth / Lest the Lord see it and it displeases him . ”
( Proverbs 24:17 )
But this was not just any enemy , it was a super - super - enemy , and therefore the Lord will certainly excuse us for dancing with joy from talk - show to talk - show , from issue to issue , from speech to speech , as long as we do not distribute candies in the street – even if the Israeli government denies feebly that we were the ones who “ liquidated ” the man .
As chance would have it , the “ liquidation ” was carried out only a few days after I wrote an article about the inability of occupying powers to understand the inner logic of resistance organizations .
Mughniyeh ’s “ liquidation ” is an outstanding example of this .
( Of course , Israel gave up its occupation of South Lebanon some years ago , but the relationship between the parties has remained as it was . )
In the eyes of the Israeli leadership , the “ liquidation ” was a huge success .
We have “ cut off the head of the serpent ” ( another headline from Haaretz ) .
We have inflicted on Hizbullah immense damage , so much that it can not be repaired .
“ This is not revenge but prevention ” , as another of the guided reporters ( Haaretz again ) declared .
This is such an important achievement , that it outweighs the inevitable revenge , whatever the number of victims - to - be .
In the eyes of Hizbullah , thing look quite different .
The organization has acquired another precious asset : a national hero , whose name fills the air from Iran to Morocco .
The “ liquidated ” Mughniyeh is worth more than the live Mughniyeh , irrespective of what his real status may have been at the end of his life .
Enough to remember what happened here in 1942 , when the British “ liquidated ” Abraham Stern ( a.k.a. Ya’ir ) : from his blood the Lehi organization ( a.k.a. Stern Gang ) was born and became perhaps the most efficient terrorist organization of the 20th century .
Therefore , Hizbullah has no interest at all in belittling the status of the liquidatee .
On the contrary , Hassan Nasrallah , exactly like Ehud Olmert , has every interest in blowing up his stature to huge proportions .
If Hizbullah has lately been far from the all - Arab spotlight , it is now back with a bang .
Almost every Arab station devoted hours to “ the brother the martyr the commander Imad Mughniyeh al - Hajj Raduan ” .
In the struggle for Lebanon – the main battle that occupies Nasrallah – the organization has scored a great advantage .
Multitudes joined the funeral , overshadowing the almost simultaneous memorial parade for his adversary , Rafiq al - Hariri .
In his speech , Nasrallah described his opponents contemptuously as accomplices to the murder of the hero , despicable collaborators of Israel and the United States , and called upon them to leave the house and move to Tel Aviv or New York .
He has gone up another notch in his struggle for domination of the Land of the Cedars .
And the main thing : the anger about the murder and the pride in the martyr will inspire another generation of youngsters , who will be ready to die for Allah and Nasrallah .
The more Israeli propaganda enlarges the proportions of Mughniyeh , the more young Shiites will be inspired to follow his example .
The career of the man himself is interesting in this respect .
When he was born in a Shiite village in South Lebanon , the Shiites there were a despised , downtrodden and impotent community .
He joined the Palestinian Fatah organization , which dominated South Lebanon at the time , eventually becoming one of Yasser Arafat ’s bodyguards ( I may even have seen him when I met Arafat in Beirut ) .
But when Israel succeeded in driving the Fatah forces out of South Lebanon , Mughniyeh stayed behind and joined Hizbullah , the new fighting force that had sprung up as a direct result of the Israeli occupation .
Israel now resembles the person whose neighbor overhead has dropped one boot on the floor , and who is waiting for the second boot to fall .
Everybody knows that there will be revenge .
Nasrallah has promised this , adding that it could take place anywhere in the world .
For a long time already , people in Israel believe Nasrallah much more than Olmert .
Israeli security organs are issuing dire warnings for people going abroad – to be on guard at every moment , not to be conspicuous , not to congregate with other Israelis , not to accept unusual invitations , etc .
The media have magnified these warnings to the point of hysteria .
In the Israeli embassies , security has been tightened .
On the Northern border , too , an alert has been sounded – just a few days after Olmert boasted in the Knesset that , as a result of the war , the Northern border is now quieter than ever before .
Such worries are far from baseless .
All the past “ liquidations ” of this kind have brought with them dire consequences :
— The classic example is , of course , the “ liquidation ” of Nasrallah ’s predecessor , Abbas Mussawi .
He was killed in South Lebanon in 1992 by Apache gunships .
All of Israel rejoiced .
Then , too , the Champagne was flowing .
In revenge , Hizbullah blew up the Israeli embassy in Buenos Aires , as well as the Jewish community center there .
The planner was , it is now alleged , Imad Mughniyeh .
More than a hundred people perished .
The main result : instead of the rather grey Mussawi , the sophisticated , masterly Nasrallah took over .
— Before that , Golda Meir ordered a series of “ liquidations ” to revenge the tragedy of the Israeli athletes in Munich ( most of whom were actually killed by the inept German police trying to prevent their being flown to Algeria as hostages ) .
Not one of the “ liquidated ” had anything to do with the outrage itself .
They were PLO diplomatic representatives , sitting ducks in their offices .
The matter is described at length in Stephen Spielberg ’s kitschy film “ Munich ” .
The result : the PLO became stronger and turned into a state - in - the - making , Yasser Arafat eventually returned to Palestine .
— The “ liquidation ” of Yahyah Ayyash in Gaza in 1996 resembles the Mughniyeh affair .
It was carried out by means of a booby - trapped cellular telephone .
Ayyash ’s dimensions , too , were blown up to giant proportions , so that he had become a legend already in his own lifetime .
The nickname “ the engineer ” was attached to him because he prepared the explosive devices used by Hamas .
Shimon Peres , who had succeeded to the Prime Ministership after the murder of Yitzhak Rabin , believed that the “ liquidation ” would lend him huge popularity and get him re-elected .
The opposite happened : Hamas reacted with a series of sensational suicide - bombings and brought Binyamin Netanyahu to power .
— Fathi Shikaki , head of Islamic Jihad , was “ liquidated ” in 1995 by a bicyclist who shot him down in a Malta street .
The small organization was not eradicated , but on the contrary grew through its revenge actions .
Today it is the group which is launching the Qassams at Sderot .
— Hamas leader Khaled Mash ’al was actually being “ liquidated ” in a street in Amman by the injection of poison .
The act was exposed and its perpetrators identified and a furious King Hussein compelled Israel to provide the antidote that saved his life .
The “ liquidators ” were allowed to go home in return for the release of Hamas founder Sheik Ahmad Yassin from Israeli prison .
As a result , Mash ’al was promoted and is now the senior political leader of Hamas .
— Sheik Yassin himself , a paraplegic , was “ liquidated ” by attack helicopters while leaving a mosque after prayer .
A previous attempt by bombing his home had failed .
The sheik became a martyr in the eyes of the entire Arab world , and has served since as an inspiration for hundreds of Hamas attacks .
The common denominator of all these and many other actions is that they did not harm the organizations of the “ liquidatees ” , but boomeranged .
And all of them brought in their wake grievous revenge attacks .
The decision to carry out a “ liquidation ” resembles the decision that was taken to start the Second Lebanon War : not one of the deciders gives a damn for the suffering of the civilian population that inevitably falls victim to the revenge .
Why , then , are the “ liquidations ” carried out ?
The response of one of the generals who was asked this question : “ There is no unequivocal answer to this . ”
These words are dripping with Chutzpa : how can one decide on such an action when there is no unequivocal answer to the question of its being worth the price ?
I suspect that the real reason is both political and psychological .
Political , because it is always popular .
After every “ liquidation ” , there is much jubilation .
When the revenge arrives , the public ( and the media ) do not see the connection between the ” liquidation ” and the response .
Each is seen separately .
Few people have the time and the inclination to think about it , when everybody is burning with fury about the latest murderous attack .
In the present situation , there is an additional political motivation : the army has no answer to the Qassams , nor has it any desire to get enmeshed in the re-occupation of the Gaza Strip , with all the expected casualties .
A sensational “ liquidation ” is a simple alternative .
The psychological reason is also clear : it is satisfying .
True , the “ liquidation ” – as the word shows – is more appropriate for the underworld than for the security organs of a state .
But it is a challenging and complex task , as in a Mafia film , which gives much satisfaction to the “ liquidators ” .
Ehud Barak , for example , was a liquidator from the start of his military career .
When the “ liquidation ” ends in success , the executioners can raise glasses of champagne .
A mixture of blood , champagne and folly is an intoxicating but toxic cocktail .
When you were younger , did you ever own an ant farm ?
I ’m still begging my wife to get me a glow - in - the - dark one that we saw several years ago in a science center gift shop .
Ok , begging might be a little bit of an exaggeration , but I ’d still like the novelty gift .
In any case , when we saw the ant farm it made me think fondly back on the several ant farm colonies I had as a child , and how interesting and cool the ants were to watch as they built their tunnels .
I never had any idea though that ants might be able to predict earthquakes .
Now a man in Turkey , Kadir Sutcu , is using several ant colonies in his home to predict when earthquakes will occur .
As the article I read claims , in early July Sutcu was successful in predicting an earthquake before its occurrence by watching the behavior of his ants .
Supposedly , he even sent out thousands of emails warning people before the earthquake hit ( I wonder how many people took him seriously at that time , and also how many do now ) .
Sutcu does not claim to be an expert , but says that his ants started behaving in a distressed manner and that some started dying about 24 hours before the earthquake occurred .
He has a website where he publicly records his data and findings .
Unfortunately for me and probably most of you readers , the website is written in a foreign language ( Turkish anyone ? ) .
But just how plausible is it that ants can predict earthquakes ?
Guess What ?
Several Scientists Were Doing a Study on Ants When an Earthquake Occurred .
They Were Able to Use the Data They Were Collecting to Put the Question of Whether or Not Ants Can Predict Earthquakes to Test
There has been a considerable amount of anecdotal evidence that ants can predict earthquakes .
Conducting a scientific study to test this idea though is challenging given the unpredictable nature of earthquakes .
Luckily for us , biologists John Lighton and Frances Duncan just happened to be collecting data about the behavior of desert harvester ant colonies in California ’s Mojave Desert during the magnitude 7.4 Landers Earthquake of 1992 and its subsequent aftershocks .
While Lighton and Duncan ’s data was intended to answer other research questions about ants , they were also able to use it for the duel purpose of finding out whether or not these particular ants provided any indications that the earthquake and its aftershocks were going to occur .
They published their findings in the Journal of Experimental Biology in a 2005 paper titled “ Shaken not stirred : a serendipitous study of ants and earthquakes . ”
While the paper is only five pages , a good summary of the story of the researchers and their findings is also available here .
So what did their results show ?
The researchers found absolutely no evidence that the ants in their study were influenced by earthquakes or that the ants provided any behavioral signs that would help predict earthquakes .
So does this mean Kadir Sutcu and his ants are frauds ?
Not necessarily .
I ’m not sure which species of ants he uses to predict earthquakes , but I bet they are not Mojave Desert Harvester Ants .
There is amazing diversity in the ant world , and there are over 14,000 documented species of ants ( with many more still yet to be documented no doubt ) .
Given the specific behaviors that some ant species have developed ( e.g. , leaf - cutting ants , army ants , driver ants ) , I would not doubt that some species might have adapted through evolution with earthquake predicting abilities .
If earthquakes destroy ant colonies in some areas , then why not ?
I would be thrilled if some day we find out the answer .
Maybe it ’s time to order that glow - in - the - dark ant farm .

For Amy Rick , the 2008 presidential election is a win-win situation .
Both Barack Obama and John McCain support an expansion of stem - cell research that she has battled for in vain under President Bush .
“ Both are very solid , ” said Rick , president of the Coalition for the Advancement of Medical Research .
“ We are definitely looking forward with optimism to a change in policy in 2009 . ”
John Isaacs , an arms control advocate , feels the same way , because both candidates have made nuclear nonproliferation a priority .
“ We ’ll have major progress on nuclear issues no matter who is elected , ” said Isaacs , executive director of the Council for a Livable World .
Stem - cell research and nuclear weapons are just two examples of a surprising but little - noticed aspect of the 2008 campaign : Democrat Obama and Republican McCain agree on a range of issues that have divided the parties under Bush .
Advertisement
On immigration , faith - based social services , expanded government wiretapping , global warming and more , Obama and McCain have arrived at similar stances -- even as they have spent weeks trying to amplify the differences between them on other issues , such as healthcare and taxes .
Even on Iraq , a signature is sue for both candidates , McCain and Obama have edged toward each other .
The result is that in many areas of policy , the general direction of the next White House seems already set , even if the details are not .
The centrist consensus on many issues underscores an important dynamic in the 2008 political climate :
At a time of growing frustration with gridlock and partisan bickering in Washington , politicians with a pragmatic , middle - course tack are thriving .
In both parties , the more strident , ideological presidential candidates lost in the primaries .
Advertisement
This development also shows how this presidential election differs from the last .
Whereas both political parties in 2004 focused on mobilizing their most ardent supporters , this campaign ’s battle is focusing on the political middle .
The convergence is in large measure a result of McCain ’s record of defying the GOP party line .
But Obama too has been tacking to the center lately on a number of fronts , including trade , government wiretapping policy and the death penalty .
“ It debunks the common view that Obama is the most liberal Democratic senator , ” Isaacs said .
“ And it debunks the view that McCain is really the third Bush term . ”
To be sure , a McCain presidency would look far different than an Obama presidency .
The two candidates have starkly different approaches to healthcare , Social Security and Supreme Court nominations , among other issues .
But this makes it all the more surprising that in many areas the rivals are more or less aligned .
Advertisement
Initially , the war in Iraq was one of the hot - button disagreements .
Obama made his early opposition to the war a cornerstone of his candidacy ; McCain ’s calling card has been his support for the war and last year ’s troop increase .
But in the course of the campaign , their differences have narrowed over the choices facing the next president .
McCain has repeatedly opposed setting timetables for withdrawing U.S. forces , but more recently he has said he wants most troops out by 2013 -- the first time he has mentioned a specific date .
Obama has repeatedly said he would withdraw troops within 16 months of taking office , but he has hedged in ways that would give him wide latitude :
He says he will listen to military commanders , will react to events on the ground and may “ refine ” his plan after his upcoming trip to Iraq .
In other areas of policy :
Advertisement
Both McCain and Obama favor combating global warming with a “ cap and trade ” system .
Under this plan , the government would set limits on emissions .
Companies and others who emit gases below those limits would be able to sell credits to those unable to meet the targets .
On the future of nuclear power , the candidates are in the same neighborhood .
McCain has laid out a plan to build 45 nuclear power plants .
Obama has offered more general support , along with the caveat that a nuclear power expansion be coupled with a resolution on how to safely dispose of waste .
Both have parted ways with Bush and advocated stepped - up negotiations with Russia and other countries to reduce the world ’s nuclear arsenal .
Both twice voted for legislation -- which Bush twice vetoed -- that would have eased federal restrictions on human embryonic stem - cell research .
Advertisement
Obama voted in the Senate on Wednesday for a bill , bitterly opposed by many liberals , to expand the government ’s eavesdropping authority and to protect telephone companies that cooperate with the program from being sued .
McCain was not present for the vote but has said he supported the bill .
Both embrace the idea of continuing Bush ’s faith - based initiative , a program that funnels federal money to religious charities for social services .
Although those issues are not prominent in the campaign debate , the candidates are also converging on the major issue of immigration -- to the surprise and delight of immigrant advocates and businesses who depend on their labor .
“ The best news all year is that after competitive presidential primaries in both parties , we end up with nominees on both sides who get it on immigration , ” said John Gay , an official with the National Restaurant Assn . who heads a business coalition favoring a legalization plan for undocumented immigrant workers .
“ That was by no means a certainty when the campaign got started . ”
Advertisement
Most of McCain ’s rivals for the GOP nomination had criticized the idea of legalization as amnesty , and many campaign ads played on growing concerns about illegal immigrants .
McCain had been an early supporter of a legalization program for the estimated 12 million undocumented immigrants in the United States .
During the primary , he distanced himself from that plan and said he had learned his lesson , that Americans want the border secured first .
But now McCain has shifted his emphasis again , indicating that as president he would push for broad legislation that tackles all of the country ’s immigration troubles , including the legalization question .
Obama speaks more directly to the idea of legalization , and McCain addresses it in subtle terms , but advocates say the position is essentially the same .

“ Sen . McCain never really repudiated his [ original ] position , ” said Tamar Jacoby , who heads a business coalition called ImmigrationWorks USA .
“ Saying you ’re going to do it in phases does n’t mean you ’re not going to do it . ”

As expected , presidential hopeful John McCain outlined a plan yesterday which would offer a $ 300 million cash prize to the first company able to build a better automotive battery .
The proposal is part of an effort to reduce the nation 's petroleum usage , in this case , by furthering the development of electric cars .
In what would must be the least shocking news of the day , McCain 's rival for the White House , Barack Obama is n't in favor of the Arizona Senator 's plan , calling it a " gimmick " and suggesting that his plan to force automakers into a 50 mile per gallon fleet average by 2027 would be more effective .
One thing is certain : whomever wins the presidential election has plans to make drastic changes to the automotive sector with the express goal of reducing the nation 's dependence on oil .
What path that may take , though , remains to be seen and will likely depend on which candidate placed in office .
It should be rather interesting to watch it all unfold .

By blowing glass at the nanometer scale , scientists have created microscopic funnels that could aid the study of single molecules .
The technique is described in a study scheduled to be published next week in * Nanotechnology * by researchers from Cornell University and the National Institute of Standards and Technology .
The authors were inspired by an accidental but fortunate observation .
Microfluidics devices – tools for controlling small quantities of fluids – are traditionally made by bonding a glass cover to a lithographically etched glass plate .
Sometimes , however , trapped air causes the glass to expand – a nano - scale equivalent of techniques used by glassblowers to create curves .
By harnessing this phenomenon , the researchers were able to make funnels that gradually tapered to a seven - nanometer depth , some 1,000 times smaller than a single red blood cell .
" In the past , " said study co-author Elizabeth Strychalski in a press release , " it was difficult to get single strands of DNA into a nanofluidic device for study . "
Future funnels could be used as part of a device to identify single base pairs of DNA .
They could even be designed to culture single , isolated cells , permitting scientists an unprecedented degree of cellular control .

Science News reports on recent research indicating that any kind of multitasking while driving is dangerous .
Not just the obvious distraction of juggling a cell phone , but even talking to a passenger or listening to a book on tape .
The researchers used a driving simulator inside an MRI machine to measure brain activations .
More striking is Obama ’s sin of omission .
In the rest of the speech , he goes on to detail  at some length  the “ so many ways to serve ” that are available “ at this defining moment in our history . ”
There ’s the Peace Corps , there ’s renewable energy , there ’s education , there ’s poverty  there are all kinds of causes you can take up “ should you take the path of service . ”
But there ’s one obvious path of service Obama does n’t recommend  or even mention : military service .
He does mention war twice : “ At a time of war , we need you to work for peace . ”
And , we face “ big challenges like war and recession . ”
But there ’s nothing about serving your country in uniform .
It ca n’t be that the possibility of military service as an admirable form of public service did n’t occur to Obama .
Only the day before , Obama had been squabbling with John McCain about veterans ’ benefits .
He said then , “ Obviously I revere our soldiers and want to make sure they are being treated with honor and respect . ”
And the day after the Wesleyan commencement , Obama was in New Mexico , where he read an eloquent and appropriate Memorial Day tribute to our fallen soldiers .
But at an elite Northeastern college campus , Obama obviously felt no need to disturb the placid atmosphere of easy self - congratulation .
He felt no need to remind students of a different kind of public service  one that entails more risks than community organizing .
He felt no need to tell the graduating seniors in the lovely groves of Middletown that they should be grateful to their peers who were far away facing dangers on behalf of their country
Nor did Obama choose to mention all those college graduates who are now entering the military , either for a tour of duty or as a career , in order to serve their country .
He certainly felt no impulse to wonder whether the nation would n’t be better off if R.O.T.C. were more widely and easily available on elite college campuses .
Obama failed to challenge  even gently  what he must have assumed would be the prejudices of much of his audience and indulged in a soft patriotism of low expectations .
Was this a public service ?
Fruit with six times the vitamin C of an orange heading for UK supermarkets
It is one of the strangest fruits under the sun and has been revered in Africa for thousands of years .
Now the bounty from the baobab tree is heading to our supermarkets after the EU agreed to allow it to be imported for the first time .
The fruit , which from the outside looks like a coconut , contains six times more vitamin C than oranges and twice as much calcium as milk .
The tart pulp inside the velvety but hard shell of the baobab pod encases small round seeds
In its native Africa , it has provided health benefits for generations .
The pulp , which is white , powdery and has a cheese - like texture , is extremely nutritious and high in anti-oxidants , iron and potassium .
The baobab ( or upside - down tree , as it is also known ) is cherished by locals who believe that its spirit protects villages .
Only specially trained climbers are allowed to scale the branches to retrieve the fruit .
Once the hard outer shell has been broken the flesh can be eaten straight away , although it has a slightly sour flavour .
In some parts of East Africa the fruit is covered in a red , sugary coating and sold as sweets .
Because the shell is so hard to crack , it will not be available to buy as a whole fruit in Britain .
Instead , it will provide ingredients for smoothies and cereal bars .
The fruit was finally allowed to be imported into the UK following extensive lobbying by Phytotrade
Under current legislation , foods which have not been commonly consumed in the EU before 1997 have to be formally approved before they can go on sale or used in European food and drink products .
The organisation submitted an application for the fruit to be imported in 2006 and the EU yesterday announced its approval .
It is hoped that the demand will enable millions of poor families in Africa to earn a living growing and harvesting the fruit .
Gus Le Breton , chief executive of PhytoTrade Africa , said : ' The EU decision is a crucial step to developing the global market which could be worth up to £ 500 million a year .
' Baobab is an ideal ingredient for smoothies and cereal bars , and its well documented nutritional benefits provide manufacturers with a new opportunity to target the booming market in healthy foods .
' Dozens of companies have shown interest in baobab since we submitted the application and many have already conducted initial research .
Now that approval has been given , they can progress to full - scale product development . '
DEM SHOCKER !!…
Speaker Pelosi Was Sending Messages to FARC Terrorists While Undermining Colombian Government !

DEM SHOCKER !!…
Speaker Pelosi Was Sending Messages to FARC Terrorists While Undermining Colombian Government !
SWAMP POLITICS —
New information reveals that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi was indirectly sending messages to the FARC .
The Marxist Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia ( FARC ) is designated as a terrorist group by the US government .
Speaker Pelosi was doing this while at the same time she refused to bring a free trade agreement with Colombia up for a vote in the US House .
In fact , Pelosi took extraordinary steps to block this trade agreement with America ’s closest ally in South America .
Cordoba - Pelosi-McGovern
Colombian Sen. Piedad Cordoba ( left ) is currently under investigation by the Colombian attorney general for ties to the FARC .
Cordoba claims that Speaker Nancy Pelosi was sending messages to the FARC terrorists .
Cordoba also claimed during FARC negotiations that Pelosi had assigned Rep. Jim McGovern , as the point man .
Captured FARC documents confirmed in March that Mr. McGovern had been working with an American go - between , who had been offering the rebels help in undermining Colombia ’s elected and popular government .
The Wall Street Journal reported on the confiscated FARC documents that implicated Rep. McGovern back in March :
The Reyes hard drive reveals an ardent effort to do business directly with the FARC by Congressman James McGovern ( D. , Mass . ) , a leading opponent of the free - trade deal .
Mr. McGovern has been working with an American go - between , who has been offering the rebels help in undermining Colombia ’s elected and popular government .
Mr. McGovern ’s press office says the Congressman is merely working at the behest of families whose relatives are held as FARC kidnap hostages .
However , his go - between ’s letters reveal more than routine intervention .
Now , today we find out who was directing Rep. McGovern–
Speaker Pelosi !
Mary Anastasia O’Grady at The Wall Street Journal reported :
Last fall , Mr. Chávez and the FARC hatched an audacious plan whereby the Venezuelan would take “ proof of life ” of Ms. Betancourt to French President Nicolas Sarkozy in Paris , where the plight of Ms. Betancourt was a cause célèbre .
The rebels wrote that Mr. Chávez was sure French pressure for negotiations would cause President Bush to “ order Uribe to allow the meeting ” between Mr. Chávez and the rebels on Colombian soil , something Mr. Uribe had refused to do .
The rebels reported that Mr. Chávez was “ super - motivated , ” because he viewed the rendezvous as a public - relations coup that would give him and the FARC “ continental and world renown . ”
That plan flopped , but Mr. Chavez had other cards up his sleeve .
One involved Colombian Sen. Piedad Cordoba , who is currently under investigation by the Colombian attorney general for ties to the FARC .
She figures prominently in the captured rebel documents , and is notoriously close to Mr. Chávez .
She met at the Venezuelan presidential palace with FARC leaders last fall .
From that meeting the rebels reported that “ Piedad says that Chávez has Uribe going crazy .
He does n’t know what to do .
That Nancy Pelosi helps and is ready to help in the swap [ hostages in exchange for captured guerrillas ] .
That she has designated [ U.S. Congressman Jim ] McGovern for this . ”
If the speaker of the House was working with Ms. Cordoba in this scheme , her judgment was more than a little misguided .
The rebels write that on a trip to Argentina Ms. Cordoba told them , “ It does n’t matter to me the proposal that Sarkozy has made to free Ingrid .
Above all , do not liberate Ingrid . ”
In short , why give up such a useful pawn ?

Word on the street is that Canadian Industry Minister Jim Prentice is about to try to shove the Canadian version of the US 's failed Digital Millennium Copyright
Act through Parliament very soon , and very fast .
He made plans to do this before , and the overwhelming public outcry caused him to shelve them , but now he figures we 're all distracted and we 'll let him get away with it ( especially since he 's made a couple of cosmetic changes to the bill that he 'll use to show how much he really , really cares about us poor Canadians , rather than the US government and entertainment companies who are giving him marching orders ) .
The Tories promised that they would n't do any more treaty - law without public consultation , but Prentice stalwartly refuses to have any public consultation on his plans , despite outcry from industry ( he 's the Minister of Industry , remember ? ) , artists ' groups , library groups , educator groups , and public interest groups .
He just keeps on ploughing ahead with his half - baked plan to follow the US off the same stupid copyright cliff it leapt off of in 1998 when it passed the DMCA , a law which has done nothing to reduce infringement , but which has screwed up libraries , competition , and education , and has led to lawsuits against tens of thousands of ordinary citizens .
So it looks like we 're going to have to do it again : we 're going to have to write to Prentice , rally at his office , phone him and let him know that we 're still watching and still paying attention , and that we still demand that he listen to the public — the way his party promised they would — before he brings down this law .
If the exceptions are undermined by the Canadian DMCA provisions , why is Prentice throwing them in ?
The answer is pretty clear .
Prentice hopes that the media coverage will focus on these new " modernizing " provisions that he will claim benefit consumers , rather than on the DMCA - style anti-circumvention provisions that will lock down consumer products , harm research and security , raise privacy concerns , and create a restrictive new legal environment .
With the bill seemingly only days away , now is the time to again tell Prentice and your local MP that Canadians will not be so easily deceived .
Countries such as New Zealand and Israel have recently enacted legislation with far more balance than what Prentice has in mind .
It only takes a few seconds to send an email to Prentice , the Prime Minister , and your local MP , letting them know that Canadians wo n't be deceived by a Canadian DMCA and that Canadian copyright reform should reflect fair copyright principles ( and after you click send , print out the email and drop it in the mail without a stamp , addressed to House of Commons , Ottawa , ON , K1A0A6 ) .

Genes From Middle East Families Yield Autism Clues Scientists look to DNA from Middle Eastern families to solve the autism mystery .
July 10 , 2008  -- WASHINGTON ( AP ) - Harvard researchers have discovered half a dozen new genes involved in autism that suggest the disorder strikes in a brain that can't properly form new connections .
The findings also may help explain why intense education programs do help some autistic children - because certain genes that respond to experience were n't missing , they were just stuck in the " off " position .
" The circuits are there but you have to give it an extra push , " said Dr. Gary Goldstein of the Kennedy Krieger Institute in Baltimore , which was n't involved in the gene hunt but is well - known for its autism behavioral therapy .
The genetics suggest that " what we 're doing makes sense when we work with these little kids -- and work and work and work -- and suddenly get through , " he said .
But the study 's bigger message is that autism is too strikingly individual to envision an easy gene test for it .
Instead , patients are turning out to have a wide variety , almost a custom set , of gene defects .
" Almost every kid with autism has their own particular cause of it , " said Dr. Christopher Walsh , chief of genetics at Children 's Hospital Boston , who led the research published in Friday 's edition of the journal Science .
Autism spectrum disorders include a range of poorly understood brain conditions , from the mild Asperger 's syndrome to more severe autism characterized by poor social interaction , impaired communication and repetitious behaviors .
It 's clear that genes play a big role in autism , from studies of twins and families with multiple affected children .
But so far , the genetic cause is known for only about 15 percent of autism cases , Walsh said .
So Walsh 's team took a new tack .
They turned to the Middle East , a part of the world with large families and a tendency for cousins to marry , characteristics that increase the odds of finding rare genes .
They recruited 88 families with cousin marriages and a high incidence of autism , from Jordan , Saudi Arabia , Kuwait , Oman , Pakistan , Qatar , Turkey and the United Arab Emirates .
They compared the DNA of family members to search for what are called recessive mutations -- where mom and dad can be healthy carriers of a gene defect but a child who inherits that defect from both parents gets sick .
In some of the families , they found large chunks of missing DNA regions that followed that recessive rule .
The missing regions varied among families , but they affected at least six genes that play a role in autism .
Here 's why this matters :
All the genes seem to be part of a network involved in a basic foundation of learning -- how neurons respond to new experiences by forming connections between each other , called synapses .
In the first year or two of life -- when autism symptoms appear -- synapses rapidly form and mature , and unnecessary ones are " pruned " back .
In other words , a baby 's brain is literally being shaped by its first experiences so that it is structurally able to perform learning and other functions of later life .
" This paper points to problems specifically in the way that experience sculpts the developing brain , " explained Dr. Thomas Insel , director of the National Institute of Mental Health , which helped fund the work .
Some earlier research had pointed to the same underlying problem , so these newly found genes " join a growing list to suggest that autism is a synaptic disorder , " he said .
If that sounds discouraging , here 's the good news :
The missing DNA did n't always translate into missing genes .
Instead what usually was missing were the on / off switches for these autism - related genes .
Essentially , some genes were asleep instead of doing their synapse work .
" I find that hopeful " because " there are ways that are being discovered to activate genes , " Walsh said .
" This might be an unanticipated way of developing therapies in the long term for autism : Identifying these kids where all the right genes are present , just not turned on in the right way . "
At Kennedy Krieger , Goldstein thinks the work may provide a gene - level explanation for why some children already are helped by intense therapy .
" We have trouble getting through to these children , but with repeated stimulation we can do it , " he said .
" These are circuits that have an ability not so much to recover but to work around the problem . "

Bush Says Dems to Blame for High Gas Prices President reverses policy , along with McCain , on off - shore drilling .
WASHINGTON , June 18 , 2008  --
As the presidential election revs into high gear , President Bush drilled the " Democratic - controlled Congress " for opposing White House energy policies , which he said has resulted in the rise of " gas prices to record levels . "
" If Congressional leaders leave for the Fourth of July recess without taking action , they will need to explain why $ 4 - a - gallon gasoline is not enough incentive for them to act .
And Americans will rightly ask how high oil -- how high gas prices have to rise before the Democratic - controlled Congress will do something about it , " Bush said in the Rose Garden .
Bush also inserted himself in the middle of the heated presidential race by reversing a long - held executive position on offshore oil drilling .
The president proposed lifting a ban that he has signed annually and was strengthened by his father , former President George H.W. Bush , and extended by former President Clinton until 2012 .
Urging Congress to make the first move on the legislative ban , Bush said , " There 's also an executive prohibition on exploration in the OCS [ Outer Continental Shelf ] .
When Congress lifts the legislative ban , I will lift the executive prohibition . "
Bush and McCain in Energy Embrace
By proposing the policy reversal , Bush in turn , aligned himself with Sen .
John McCain , the all but certain Republican nominee , who also changed his tune on offshore drilling earlier this week as gas prices jumped above $ 4.00 a gallon .
" I believe it is time for the federal government to lift these restrictions and to put our own reserves to use , " McCain told a crowd Tuesday in Houston before the president made his announcement today .
The White House press office told reporters that the president has held such views on reversing offshore drilling policy for some time , and he was n't following McCain on the issue .
McCain , who strikes an awkward balance of distancing himself from the unpopular president both physically and on policy matters , while trying not to alienate those Republicans loyal to the president , did not seem to welcome the White House energy symmetry , and resisted the " third - term Bush " claims from his Democratic opponent Sen. Barack Obama .
" When I announced this policy the other day , Sen . Obama wasted no time in mischaracterizing it .
He described my position as -- you guessed it -- another example of Bush 's third term , " McCain said today in Missouri .
" I guess the senator has changed his position since voting for the 2005 Bush energy bill -- a grab - bag of corporate handouts that I opposed . "
However , Democrats were quick to pick up on the Bush - McCain energy embrace .
" After admitting he does n't understand the economy , Sen. McCain is now trying to pass off failed Bush policies that have undermined America 's energy security , our national security and our economy as his ' new ' approach to energy independence , " Democratic National Committee Communications Director Karen Finney said .
' Years ' Until Relief at the Pump
Regardless of politics , Bush admitted his new proposals would not be an instant fix .
" The proposals I 've outlined will take years to have their full impact , " he said .
However , he argued that lifting the ban on offshore drilling could produce 18 billion barrels of oil in the future .
The president said restrictions on offshore drilling have become " outdated and counterproductive , " and urged Congress to act on three other proposals in addition to offshore drilling .
The other proposals include opening exploration in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge , expanding and enhancing U.S. refineries , and leasing land for shale exploration in Colorado , Wyoming and Utah .
Democrats in Congress refute the president , saying shale is at least 10 years from commercial development , because technology is n't mature enough .
Sen . Dick Durbin , D - Ill. , dismissed Bush 's proposals , saying oil companies need to change their ways .
" We have to look to the reality , " Durbin said .
" The reality is oil companies are making profits at record - breaking levels .
The reality is that speculation is driving the price of oil up .
And the reality is that the president of the United States has yet to call the oil company executives into the Oval Office to tell them they 're wrecking the economy . "
He added that oil companies already have the rights to drill on 68 million acres of American soil that are n't currently under development .

Real whipped cream has a decadent taste and texture .
Whipped cream imposters are convenient , but there is nothing like the real thing !
At the grocery store , there are many different types of milk and cream that are available .
When making your own whipped cream buy whipping cream or heavy cream .
The butter fat content of whipping cream allows it it whip and is what gives it that great taste and texture .
( My post How to : Milks and Creams will give you a better understanding of many different dairy products . )
It is possible to buy real whipped cream in a can , but even then , you get an airier product that liquefies faster than homemade .
So , it ’s definitely worth knowing how to whip up the real thing .
So let ’s get started !
What You Need to Make Whipped Cream
A carton of whipping cream , ( or double cream in the UK . )
Some other kinds of cream can be whipped , but not all .
Here ’s a link which will explain the different kinds of cream and their uses .
A bowl ( metal is preferred for chilling , but you can also use a glass bowl )
An electric hand mixer , or a wire whisk
Here Are the Three Easy Steps to Making Whipped Cream
Start by chilling the cream , the bowl and the beaters or whisk in the freezer for 10 to 20 minutes
Pour one cup of whipping cream into the bowl and beat until it holds soft peaks .
Soft peaks should fold over when the beaters or whisk are lifted .
If using an electric mixer , start on medium speed to prevent splattering , then speed up .
If using a whisk , circle it vigorously in the cream , watching as it thickens .
It ’s a workout for your arm and shoulder !
You ’ll know you ’ve over - beaten it if the consistency starts to turn buttery .
Once soft peaks start to form , you can add sugar ( one or two tablespoons ) , and any other flavorings you like .
Beat again until soft peaks form .
The Ingredients :
Start beating and once the cream begins to thicken ( soft peaks ) .
Add 1 Tablespoon of sugar …
… and 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract .
Continue beating …
until the cream reaches desired consistency ( do not over beat ! ) .
Tips for a Successful Whipped Cream
One cup of whipping cream makes about 2 cups of whipped cream .
For flavoring , one teaspoon of vanilla is often added per cup of whipping cream .
But the flavoring possibilities are endless ; you can add other flavor extracts , liqueurs , or powdered cocoa .
There are lots of flavored whipped cream recipes to try – even bourbon !
If you ’re using whipped cream on a dessert that will be sitting out for a while , adding icing sugar , rather than granulated sugar , in step 2 will help it keep its shape
Whipped cream can be kept covered in the fridge for about three days – but it will begin to break down if you have not added any stabilizer to it .
How to Use Whipped Cream :
Having recently returned from Egypt , I have the Suez Canal on my mind .
And looking at Iraq from Cairo , the thought occurred to me that maybe the Iraqis have just crossed the Suez Canal .
If so , that ’s good news .
What am I talking about ?
There is no way that Egypt ’s President Anwar Sadat could have ever made peace with Israel had he not first launched his lightning strike across the Suez Canal on Yom Kippur , 1973 .
“ The crossing , ” as that surprise attack became known in Egyptian lore , was as psychologically important as it was militarily important .
It wiped away Egypt ’s humiliating loss in the 1967 war and gave Egyptians the dignity and self - confidence to make peace with Israel as military equals .
While the military reality was more complex , Egyptians nevertheless felt they had liberated the Sinai themselves .
One of the first things I realized when visiting Iraq after the U.S. invasion was that the very fact that Iraqis did not liberate themselves , but had to be liberated by Americans , was a source of humiliation to them .
It ’s one reason they never threw flowers .
When someone else has to liberate you in your own home , that is humiliating  and humiliation , I believe , is the single - most underestimated force in international relations , especially in the Middle East .
That also helps explain why Iraqis initially never took ownership of their governing institutions , like the Coalition Provisional Authority , or C.P.A .
They never fought for it .
It was handed to them .
People have to fight and win their own freedom , and that ’s what gives their institutions legitimacy .

A new Quinnipiac University poll of battleground states Michigan , Wisconsin , Colorado , and Minnesota released today shows Barack Obama leading John McCain in all four .
Obama leads in Colorado 49 % - 44 % , in Michigan 48 % - 42 % , in Minnesota 54%- 37 % , and in Wisconsin 52% - 39 % .
In Colorado , women and Hispanic voters are behind Obama ’s lead .
Women support Obama by a margin of 53%- 39 % .
Colorado Hispanic voters are leaving the GOP in droves .
Obama leads with this group 62% - 36 % .
I believe that this is directly related to the hard line stance of the Republican Party on immigration .
Obama leads McCain among Independents 54%-39 % .
McCain leads with men 50 % - 45 % , and white men 47 % - 46 % .
Obama leads with all age groups , but McCain leads with voters who do not have a college degree , 50 % - 42 % .
In Michigan Obama ’s coalition of support are women , African Americans , union households , Independents .
Women are supporting the Democratic candidate by a margin of 52%- 38 % , and Independents favor Obama 46% - 38 .
Obama dominates McCain with the state ’s union households , 57 % - 32 % .
McCain has a narrow lead with men in the state , 46 % - 45 % , and leads with white men 48 % - 42 % .
Obama leads with all age groups , and McCain leads among those without college degrees .
Interestingly , Michigan voters listed the war , not the economy as their number one issue .

While in Minnesota , the big difference is that Obama leads with both men and women .
Obama ’s lead with men is 49 % - 42 % , and with women 58 % - 32 % .
He also leads the Republican by 21 points with Independents , 54% - 33 % .
Obama leads with all groups , including those who do n’t have a college degree , where he leads 47 % - 42 % .
Obama ’s strength in the state does n’t seem to helping Al Franken ’s Senate campaign .
Franken trails Norm Coleman 51 % - 41 % .
Wisconsin ’s numbers are similar to Minnesota ’s .
Obama leads with both men and women in the state .
He has his largest lead with male voters here , 51 % - 40 % .
He has a 16 point lead with women , 53 % - 37 % .
The Illinois Senator leads with white voters , 49 % - 42 % , and Independent voters , 50 % - 37 % .
The Democrat leads among voters who do n’t have a college degree , 47 % - 43 % .
Judging from this poll and several other recent ones as well , McCain ’s base of support is limited to men , specifically white men , while Obama ’s base of support appears to be growing beyond women and African Americans .
The difference between whether or not Obama has a single or double digit lead is the support of white men .
Most surprising , is McCain ’s inability to lead with older voters .
If McCain does n’t expand his base beyond white men , he is going to lose big in November .
Full Poll Results
I saw and duly dismissed as wishful thinking Karl ’s and Patrick Ruffini ’s posts last week speculating that St. Barack had n’t released his June fundraising numbers yet because his money machine had finally broken down .
After watching this , I wonder if they ’re right .
The obvious spin is that the sluggish contributions are simply an artifact of summer doldrums , but ( per Ruffini ) Kerry took in $ 30 million in June 2004 , which would be slightly better than what Obama ’s rumored to have pulled last month .
You ’d expect even a weak stretch for Team Barry to improve significantly on what the Dems were doing four years ago .
Or would you ?
Says Ruffini :
Obama ’s fundraising surge came during and around primary elections with the outcome in doubt .
Once it seemed he had it wrapped up , his online fundraising fell off dramatically .
As we ’ve seen , online fundraising can be hugely tempermental and event - driven .
Hillary , who would normally raise $ 200,000 – $ 400,000 per email in slow periods , would see $ 10 million over a couple of days after winning a key primary like Pennylavania .
That actually seems to argue in favor of summer doldrums .
Kerry ’s donors were running hard out of the gate to stop Bush ; Obama ’s donors , having run hard to stop Hillary , might be momentarily unmotivated until the race with McCain wears on a bit and stays tight , whereupon they ’ll panic and start pouring it on again .
$ 100 million in June might be absurd , in other words , but $ 100 million in September and October might not be .
Which probably explains Plouffe ’s video here :
Whether it ’s genuinely time to panic or not , he wants them to think that it is .
Especially before another month of lackluster fundraising ( by Obama ’s standards ) gives the media a new building block to construct an Obama “ fizzle ” narrative .
Exit question : Geraghty says if Obama actually did have a monster June , he would n’t be keeping it a secret .
In any other month , maybe not — but with his foreign policy trip coming up , they might be waiting ( and putting out bad info now to lower expectations ) in order to give him a big buzzworthy send - off .
We ’ll know by this weekend .
Click the image to watch .
Update : Let ’s come at this from another direction .
If you think Obama ’s fundraising is gone for good instead of in a momentary lull , explain why .
Certainly some of his support in the primary came from people who simply hate the Clintons and wanted them stopped without caring much who might win between Obama and McCain , but for every one of those donors that Obama ’s lost , he ’s probably picking up ( or will eventually pick up ) a former Hillary donor .
It may also be that some of the nutroots and far left are disaffected with his tacking towards the right , but they ’ll come back soon enough if the race stays close .
And if it does n’t stay close , with Obama bouncing out to a big lead — who cares about money then ?
The point is to win , not to raise $ 500 million .

A seedbox is BitTorrent jargon for a dedicated high - speed server , used exclusively for torrent transfers .
With a seedbox you 'll be able to download and upload faster than you ever imagined .
Additionally , you can manage your torrents through a browser from anywhere , anytime .
Seedboxes are not something every BitTorrent user wants or needs .
They are mostly for people who share a lot of files , and those who want to keep a good ratio on one of the elite private BitTorrent trackers .
The downside to having a seedbox is of course that they are not free .
To some this is n’t a problem , “ I pay for my Internet connection , so why not pay a few extra bucks to get the best out of it , ” is an argument we often hear .
Others , however , are satisfied with the speeds they get , and do n’t want to pay extra for BitTorrent traffic .
So why should people use these seedboxes ?
What are the benefits ?
Here are some of the advantages .
1. Competition .
Whether you ’re aware of it or not , users on private trackers are extremely competitive .
No matter how many torrents you have seeding , or how you ’ve managed to tweak the BitTorrent client settings , there ’s just no competing with the uploading power of a seedbox .
With many elite private trackers , a seedbox is not just recommended , they ’re almost essential for account longevity .
2. Speed .
Most seedboxes are on 100 M bit lines , which makes them really fast .
Unquestionably faster than your home Internet access – unless you live in Japan or Sweden , that is .
You can sit back , relax and watch in amazement at how fast the torrents finish .
Gigabyte files will be downloaded in minutes , practically without limitations .
Of course , you ’ll still be limited to the speed of your home connection when you want to transfer these files from the server to your computer .
3. Uploading .
Some users of private trackers are less concerned about the downloading , and more about seeding .
Good ratios are crucial to a healthy membership – without them , the account will wither away and die .
With a seedbox , your ratio will be 1:1 within minutes , not days .
10:1 ratios are not uncommon within the first hour for popular torrents .
No more do you have to seed the torrent for weeks just to stay in the good graces with your private tracker .
You ’ll be free to delete seeding torrents , and replace them with other ones .
4 . No more throttling and bandwidth limiting ISPs
ISPs like Comcast are known to throttle your BitTorrent traffic , and they will soon introduce a monthly bandwidth limit of 100GB .
With a seedbox you can bypass these limitations .
Your seedbox traffic is not counted towards your ISP account stats and wo n’t be throttled .
The only time it becomes ‘ your ’ traffic is when you choose to download the files from a finished torrent to your home PC , and uploading torrent traffic will not eat into your cap .
5 . They ’re Secure & Safe
With a seedbox , you do n’t even need to use a BitTorrent client on your home computer – your worries about the RIAA or MPAA spying on you are over .
No more DMCA notices or warning letters from your ISP – and more importantly , no lawsuit letters will be coming either .
Where to get a Seedbox …
Seedboxes are n’t cheap , but they do n’t have to break the bank .
Many services now offer a ‘ torrent - specific ’ seedbox packages that are great for entry - level users .
Here is an affordable seedbox solution :
Happy torrenting …

The great imperial struggles of the 1800s were over control of strategic or otherwise prized resources , and the hostilities they generated helped stoke World Wars I and II .
Many believe the Iraq war was all about oil .
China is considering adopting a contemporary variant of the colonial model .
A Ministry of Agriculture proposal suggests that rather than conquer territory to secure needed farmland , it could simply buy it up .
But this path proves likes to engender resistance from the locals in countries with conquered occupied investee sites .
This might work if done quietly , with local players acting as fronts .
But this program will have to be very large scale to achieve its desired aims , which is improving food security , which makes keeping a low profile well nigh impossible .
And does China really think it can export food from large tracts of land abroad if the natives are hungry ?
There are major risks , such as governments asserting eminent domain to repatriate property and sabotage of transport .
China is concentrating its efforts on Africa and South America .
In many areas , the control of the central government is weak .
Will China wind up employing local mercenaries to secure its interests ?
It will be interesting to watch this initiative play out .
From the Financial Times :
I know some of you may be wondering , Energy scarcity ?
That 's someone else 's problem ; put this guy in touch with geologists and politicians .
Hello , it 's nice to be with you today .
My intent is to give you a realistic take on the future of your profession by explaining why healthcare and nursing will be transformed by rising energy costs .
Is there danger ahead ?
You bet .
It 's going to be difficult , probably life - changing for all Americans .
Here ’s why : the scale of our energy predicament is enormous , unprecedented and grossly misunderstood by institutional leaders and most of the media .
Dan is a healthcare consultant who tries to get people in healthcare ( including public health ) to start thinking about peak oil and climate change issues and how to address them .
In Dan 's words , he is " a healthcare consultant building a consortium among public health and health care stakeholders and actors to address peak oil , climate change and related environmental issues " .
Dan posts on TOD under the name Danb .
This is a talk given by Dan Bednarz to a group of nurses .
The talk was given at the House of Delegates Meeting of the Pennsylvania Association of Staff Nurses & Allied Professionals ( Pasnap ) in Harrisburg , Pennsylvania on April 29 , 2008 .
Overview
A few numbers to set the context :
• The amount of crude oil pumped out of the ground has been on a bumpy plateau since May of 2005 .
Until then oil production was steadily increasing about 2 % a year - –with periodic declines -- and the world had a daily surplus , or emergency cushion .
That surplus is gone , everything produced , supply , is immediately purchased , demand .
Whether or not the world has reached " peak oil " - –the point at which yearly total worldwide extraction cannot be increased -- this 3 year plateau indicates that the era of cheap energy is over .
• Oil is now over $ 100.00 a barrel .
It was $ 10.00 a barrel in November 1998 .
• Oil powers 90 % of all transportation and it is essential to food production and distribution ; it is the primary ingredient in many products - – think plastics , petrochemicals , and clothing .
It is fair to say that all our institutions , especially medicine , are dependent upon oil , the lynchpin resource that keeps the economy humming and allows it to grow .
• And it ’s not just oil that ’s getting scarce .
Natural gas in Pittsburgh went up 30 % on April 1st , to $ 12.50 per MCF ( thousand cubic feet ) ; it was $ 2.50 in 2001 .
Typically , the cost of natural gas drops after the winter but here we are facing higher prices during the summer .
• Coal is becoming scarce in many countries and more expensive here ; its price has about doubled in the past year .
It is our main source of electricity .
In about 15 years the world may hit a peak in its production , and this combined with the fact that natural gas - – the secondary source of electricity generation -- simultaneously will be at or past its peak , poses a threat to our supply of electricity .
• To put a human face on this , a polling agency found in December 2007 that 12 % of Americans planned to put their winter energy bills on their credit card - – no wonder Christmas spending was down .
An article in this past Saturday 's New York Times details the rising number of people unable to pay their winter utility bills and now facing service cutoffs .
Many hospitals in California are on the verge of bankruptcy ; rising energy costs - –in tandem with other increasing costs -- could be a breaking point for them .
Further , we are merely at the beginning of what some of you recognize as Jim Kunstler 's poetic phrase " The Long Emergency . "
• The total amount of energy the world gets from fossil fuels is predicted to peak in 2010 , so we ’ve probably got about two years before systemic disruptions and breakdowns become commonplace and then worsen .
Even now we see the airlines struggling , food prices soaring , and we have a fiscal / financial crisis of unknown scope that is connected to the price of oil in numerous ways I can not delve into today .
Energy in Hospitals
Now let 's look at energy use in hospitals and then use the issue of record keeping , a biggie for nurses , as one small but significant example of how energy scarcity will shape the future of healthcare .
Then we ’ll close with some comments on where medicine is heading and my claim that nursing stands to become a force in reforming the healthcare system .
The EPA estimates that hospitals use twice as much energy per square foot as do office buildings .
Until recently hospital administrators have not paid attention to the cost of energy because they think - –mistakenly -- that it represents less than 2 % of their operating expenses .
Therefore , they have considered rising energy costs a nuisance , not a threat .
However , a few weeks ago a former AMA ( American Medical Association ) official told me hospital administrators are getting worried about energy costs because sharp increases are eating into profits .
For example , all energy costs in the US rose 17 % in 2007 , with the cost of oil climbing 57 % .
The first quarter of 2008 shows no change in this trend .
How many years can our society - –and hospitals - - absorb these increases ?
We should look a bit closer at that alleged 2 % because it ignores hidden oil - related costs -- also , this percentage is from 2005 , when oil was $ 48.00 a barrel .
Virtually every item consumed in a hospital is to some extent connected to fossil fuels , primarily oil .
In medicine petrochemicals are used to manufacture analgesics , antihistamines , antibiotics , antibacterials , rectal suppositories , cough syrups , lubricants , creams , ointments , salves , and many gels .
Processed plastics made with oil are used in heart valves and other esoteric medical equipment .
Petrochemicals are used in radiological dyes and films , intravenous tubing , syringes , and oxygen masks .
This could be a much longer list .
Finally , as the cost of oil , natural gas and coal rise in tandem their impact is surpassing that 2 % of operating expenses just mentioned .
Now let 's consider our example of how nursing will be changed .
Recently , I read a report which estimates the amount of paperwork ( communication , medication administration , admission , discharge , transfer , supplies , equipment , and so on ) is so burdensome that the average nurse devotes only 31 % of the workday to direct care .
The American Academy of Nursing is pushing for fully electronic records .
I wo n't get into whether or not this will increase patient contact hours .
What is salient is that this is a solution based on an increasing amount of energy flowing into hospitals .
Indeed , all across our society planning takes for granted an ever increasing supply of cheap and uninterrupted energy .
My colleague , Gail Tverberg , an actuary with a good deal of experience in the medical industry , has been studying the economic ramifications of peak oil and notes :
I expect that electrical interruptions will become more common in the next 20 or 30 years .
These may even become a problem early on , for a whole host of reasons , including lack of water for cooling , lack of fuel for power generation , and poor upkeep of the electrical grid .
Healthcare providers would be wise to plan for the day when elevators and electronic records may not be available .
Wow .
Imagine doing your work under these conditions .
Needless to say , the healthcare professions have no inkling of -- let alone are preparing for -- this astonishing future .
In fact , a recent study showed that the electricity used exclusively for medical records is rapidly increasing , by 400 - 800 % in the past four years .
Also , MRI usage is increasing , as are many technologies that rely on electricity .
Add to this the inevitable shortages of other supplies and medicines that will simultaneously result from peak oil .
I would not be surprised if some of you are now thinking , " This is crazy ; this simply cannot happen . "
To which I ’d like to be confrontational and assert , fossil fuel costs will continue to rise and eventually the healthcare system will be forced to downsize - –just as the Baby Boomers and ( possibly ) climate change effects -- inundate the system .
Let me just mention our perilous national economic status and note that some commentators are claiming that the government has in effect nationalized Wall Street by bailing out Bear Stearns .
Further , anyone who thinks the health sector is recession or nationalization - proof is confusing health - care , which is indispensable , with the current system , which is unsustainable .
This is a lot to lay on you in a few minutes of exposition , and I 'm tempted to apologize ; however , nursing - –unlike , say , public relations -- is where the rubber meets the road .
So let me make a few closing comments and then take your questions .
Summary
1 . I feel safe observing that the vast majority of insurance companies , medical associations , HMOs and other hospital associations will resist facing the stark consequences of peak oil because they are benefiting from the status quo .
On the other hand , those hospitals with a mission for stewardship of the earth and charitable activity are likely to be among the first to recognize the need for radical change in medical care .
2 . In the same vein , it 's obvious that nursing is not prospering even though it is in some ways the backbone of the system .
Your profession 's main themes for reforming the healthcare system should center - –I hate to use the word " should " -- around radical resource conservation and efficiency , and the elimination of wasteful and environmentally harmful practices .
In other words , reduce , reuse , recycle , and repair .
3 . Simultaneously , there will be a political struggle for the soul of healthcare :
We will look to other nations with decent health systems where three core values predominate : 1 ) no one goes bankrupt due to medical status ; 2 ) no one is denied treatment for any reason , and 3 ) preventive and treatment medicine are integrated .
This means one response to energy downturn leads to healthcare for all .
The alternative to this is medicine becoming something for the wealthy few , with the rest of society receiving what amounts to triage - –or , alternatively , home care or " folk medicine . "
In some respects these alternatives represent the familiar themes of the Jeffersonian / egalitarian and Hamiltonian / elitist traditions .
4 . By forming a coalition with public health and even some of the growing number of doctors who favor a " single - payer " system , nursing can shape the transformation of our healthcare system .
Rather than elaborate , let me thank you and open the floor for discussion .
Last month , Sen. John McCain dropped by “ Saturday Night Live , ” drawing laughs from his promise , if elected president , to fight expensive federal projects -- such as , he spoofed , a Department of Defense device to “ jam gaydar . ”
That was a joke .
But some scientists are , in a way , working on gaydar , the supposed ability to discern whether a person is homosexual by reading subtle cues from their appearance .
Just do n’t refer to it that way .
The preferred term is “ sexual orientation correlates . ”
These scientists are searching for innate traits that might not appear to be related to sexual orientation or even to standard clichés .
So measuring a subject ’s shoe size is permissible ; asking about ownership of Barbra Streisand albums would be cheating .
Some inborn traits might be expected if homosexuality is -- as most scientists believe -- rooted in biology , and they might provide clues about the biological origins of sexual orientation .
Finding and solidifying these links is n’t easy .
Studies contradict each other , and some promising paths do n’t pan out .
( A link between male homosexuality and finger lengths is n’t holding up , and a claim that gays have distinctive fingerprint ridge patterns is largely discredited . )
Scientists do n’t always agree on how to interpret the results , and more progress has been made with regard to men than to women .
* Big brothers .
Study after study -- including one of 87,000 British men published last year -- has found that gay men have more older brothers than straight men do .
Only big brothers count .
Lesbians do n’t show such patterns .
The numbers : Each older brother will increase a man ’s chances of being gay by 33 % , says Ray Blanchard of the University of Toronto , an expert on the “ big - brother effect . ”
That ’s not as dramatic as it might sound .
A man ’s chance of being gay is pretty low to begin with -- perhaps as low as 2 % ( lowered from 10 % by researchers in the early 1990s ) .
So having one older brother ups the chance to only about 2.6 % .
What it might mean : Psychological influences are probably not at work , because the pattern holds even for gay men who were n’t raised with their older brothers .
Instead , the mother ’s womb might be key .
After giving birth to a boy , her immune system might create antibodies to foreign , male proteins in her bloodstream .
Subsequent sons in the womb could be exposed to these “ anti-boy ” antibodies , which might affect sexual development in the brain .
Accordingly , you ’d expect the percentage of gay men in a society to vary depending on demographic differences in family size :
One study calculated that a one - child - per- family law would reduce male homosexuality by about 29 % from current levels .
* Left hand vs. right hand .
The hand you use to sign your name might have something to do with what gender you are drawn to .
The numbers : More lefties -- or at least more somewhat - ambidextrous folks -- crop up in the gay population than among straight people , several studies have shown .
An analysis of more than 23,000 men and women from North America and Europe in 2000 found that being non-right - handed seems to increase a man ’s chances of being gay by about 34 % , and a woman ’s by about 90 % .
What it might mean :
One guess is that different - than - normal levels of testosterone in the womb -- widely theorized to play a role in determining eventual sexual orientation -- could nudge a fetus toward brain organization that favors left - handedness as well as same - sex attraction .
Another theory is that development of a fetus might be disturbed by factors such as a mother ’s illness , steering the fetus into being less than strictly right - handed -- and , in some cases , less than strictly heterosexual .
It ’s a politically sticky idea , says Qazi Rahman of Queen Mary - University of London .
“ It ’s essentially saying that homosexual preference . . . is some kind of biological error , ” he says .
( It might tick off the left - handed folks too . )
* Hair whorl .
How does your hair grow ?
This might reflect your sexual orientation .
The numbers : A 2004 study of nearly 500 men -- 272 on Delaware ’s Rehoboth Beach , popular with gay men , 200 on a beach without that reputation -- found that hair on the heads of men on the gay beach was 3.5 times more likely to grow in a counterclockwise direction .
( Scalp hair typically resembles a clockwise - rotating typhoon . )
What it might mean :
One theory is that a single gene might influence hair - whorl direction , left - right brain organization and , somehow , sexual orientation .
Exactly how it would do all this , however , is anyone ’s guess .
The study , although intriguing , suffers from a lack of scientific rigor .
The author walked around while on vacation , collecting hair - whorl observations on men from a discreet distance .
He did n’t know anyone ’s sexual orientation for sure , and did n’t objectively examine any scalps up close .
Rahman ’s group is attempting to replicate the results in the lab .
* Penis size .
If exposure to testosterone in the womb influences sexual orientation , scientists reckon that straight and gay people would differ in body parts strongly affected by testosterone , such as the penis .
The numbers : Anthony Bogaert of Brock University in Ontario and his colleagues re-analyzed data on 5,000 gay and straight men from sexologist Alfred Kinsey ’s famous files , collected from the 1930s to the 1960s .
The results , published in 1999 , showed that gay men had longer , thicker penises than did straight men : on average , about 6.5 inches long and 4.95 inches around when erect , versus 6.1 inches long and 4.8 inches around for straight men .
What it might mean : Scientists do n’t really know .
One guess is that gay men could have been exposed to an odd mix of hormones in the womb .
Testosterone levels might peak early , causing enhanced penis growth , then drop off later in pregnancy -- leading to some feminine characteristics .
There ’s one catch : Kinsey asked his subjects to measure themselves at home and mail a postcard recording their dimensions .
It is within the realm of imagination that not every man reported the perfect truth .
If everyone lied , the essence of the results would n’t change .
It ’s a problem only if gay men were more factually creative than straight men .
Bogaert says that all the measures -- length and circumference , erect and flaccid -- seem to plausibly line up , which probably would n’t be the case if the men had tacked on a vanity half - inch or so .
Also , a smaller , 1960s study ( in which a physician did the measuring ) backs up the findings .
As to whether gay or straight men are more likely to exaggerate about penis size , “ It would be an interesting master ’s thesis project , ” Bogaert muses .
However , the next frontier in this kind of research seems to lie elsewhere -- with subtle differences in how gay and straight brains navigate new cities , respond to erotic movies and react to the scent of sweat and urine .
Step Right Up And Be Amazed
It struck me today that our fearless leaders , would - be’s , and corporate giants seem to think we ’re all a bunch of rubes gathered outside a carnival sideshow , leaning on the barker ’s every word .
Urging Congress to lift its ban on offshore oil and gas drilling , our fearless leader , you know , President Bush , told lawmakers , “ There is no excuse for delay “ .
It got worse , “ Families across the country are looking to Washington for a response . ”
Gimme a break .
In response , House Democrats , in a news conference , propose nationalization of refineries , a way to better control the flow of oil supply .
Stay tuned , this will be one hot potato .
One of our presidential wanna - be ’s , Sen John McCain ( R - AZ ) , has jumped on the bandwagon , even though he ’s on record supporting the moratorium on drilling .
Flip - flop , what do we believe ?
The Senator also proposed a gas tax holiday .
Woop .
Arizona made it clear the other day that it wo n’t happen here , and I doubt the idea will ever get off the ground .
Not only has McCain changed his tune , he ’s asking for 45 new nuclear reactors by 2030 , and pledged $ 2 billion a year in federal funds to “ make clean coal a reality . ”
You can bet that ’ll get my vote ; for Obama .
Florida ’s Governor , Charlie Crist has gone on record , changing his position on offshore drilling .
Gas prices too high , we must do something now .
Drill Now ?
How Long Will It Take To Get Some Relief ?
Think about it for a minute .
There are approximatley 68 million acres of offshore waters under lease by oil companies at this moment , but none are under development .
Let ’s say the oil companies decide to get busy and help us poor folks get out of the gas crunch .
By the time they set up new platforms , drill , recover and ship crude to refineries , my great - grandchildren will be voting .
How about that for a quick fix ?
See my point ?
It truly is a dog and pony show , smoke and mirrors , whatever , but let ’s look further .
Big Oil ’s Take On The Problem
In this case , “ BIG OIL ” is Chevron Corp , whose CEO David O’Reilly told CNN ’s Wolf Blitzer that big oil is n’t to blame for high gas prices .
It ’s a matter of supply and demand , that ’s what we ’ve been hearing all along , and it makes as much sense as anything .
Domestic production of crude , according to O’Reilly , has declined over the years , putting America further in debt to foreign oil producers .
Meanwhile , Chevron claims to be reinvesting it ’s $ 18.7 billion profit from last year in new supplies .
He did n’t say what constituted “ supplies . ”
Saudi’s To Increase Production
The world ’s leading producer of oil , Saudi Arabia , plans to increase production by 200,000 barrels a day through July .
That would bring production up to 9.7 million barrels a day .
The U.S. alone consumes an estimated 20 million barrels a day , roughly half of that amount is imported .
I doubt the 200,000 barrel increase in Saudi production will make a huge impact on the world ’s thirst for oil , or bring relief to high prices in America .
The rest of the OPEC nations have decided not to make a committment until their meeting on Sept 9th .
History has shown they usually follow Saudi Arabia ’s lead , but given the instability and tensions in that area , they may just take the money and enjoy .
Environmentalists Are Weakening
I read with great amusement this article in the LA Times , inferring that the environmental movement is now on the defensive .
It ’s worth a read , still more of the same as listed above .
What I find most interesting , in this time of environmental awareness , is the call for more oil out of one side of the mouth , while the other side speaks boldly of developing alternative energy sources .
So there it is folks , step right up and get your ticket now , the only cost : A gallon of gas for the greatest show on earth .
Welcome to the circus , are you having any fun , are n’t you glad you came ?
CNN’S “ Fueling America ” site .. interesting .

BBC , Nauru
There are not many countries you can bicycle around before breakfast .
One of the very few is Nauru , a Pacific island nation halfway between Australia and Hawaii .
The island of Nauru is the world 's smallest independent republic Dubbed Pleasant Island in the 18th Century by the captain of a passing British ship - it is the world 's smallest independent republic , a coral speck dwarfed by the vastness of the Pacific Ocean .
On most assignments , one of the first tasks is to hire a car .
On Nauru , it did n't really seem worth the bother , I opted instead for a battered mountain bike .
It took me about an hour and a half to cycle the narrow coast road , sweating profusely beneath the fierce equatorial sun .
Before I knew it , I was back where I started .
I had just circumnavigated the entire country .
Nauru may be little , but it once enjoyed enormous wealth .
In fact Nauruans were among the richest people , per capita , in the world .
Hardly anyone thought of investing the money .
Dollar notes were even used as toilet paper
A quirk of nature means that their island consists of some of the world 's purest phosphate - the legacy of millions of years of sea bird droppings reacting with an uplifted coral .
Spending spree From independence from Britain and Australia in 1968 , until the 1990s , Nauru earned a fortune exporting its phosphate for fertiliser .
Islanders are returning to fishing now the money has run out
The decades of mining left the once - lush interior a bleak moonscape of strange , grey coral spikes - all that is left once the phosphate - rich top soil is scooped out of the ground - but Nauruans did not care .
They gave up their jobs , brought in migrants from other Pacific islands to do the hot , dirty work of digging and sat back waiting for the royalty cheques to drop into their hands .
They then went on an extraordinary spending spree .
Families who had never left the island would charter aircraft to take them on shopping expeditions in Hawaii , Fiji and Singapore .
Sports cars were imported , despite the fact that Nauru has only one paved road and the speed limit is 25 mph .
A police chief memorably bought a sleek yellow Lamborghini , only to find he was too portly to fit in the driver 's seat .
" We just did n't know how to handle it all , " a barefoot islander told me as he played his guitar beneath a tree .
" Hardly anyone thought of investing the money .
Dollar notes were even used as toilet paper , " his friend told me .
" It 's true , " he insisted seeing my look of disbelief .
" It was like every day was party day . "
The Nauraun children are still hopeful for the island 's future A procession of conmen and carpetbaggers persuaded successive governments to invest in a string of bizarre schemes , including a West End musical about the life of Leonardo da Vinci .
Nauru amassed a property portfolio of hotels and office blocks around the world .
But corruption and downright incompetence took their toll and by the early part of this century , most of the assets had to be sold off to pay for the country 's mounting debts .
Now all the money is gone .
Angry islanders Signs of Nauru 's former wealth are few and far between .
Homes are dilapidated , with holes punched through their walls .
An area known as Location is one of the most squalid slums I have come across in the South Pacific , a concrete ghetto of smashed windows , stray dogs and graffiti .
We 're doing our best to climb out of it .
It wo n't be like in our heyday , but at least we 'll be comfortable
Marcus Stephen , Nauru president
The brand new cars which islanders bought are rusted wrecks smothered in tropical undergrowth .
Last week a mob of angry islanders burnt down Nauru 's only prison in what the government said was politically motivated unrest orchestrated by a former president .
Now comes another blow to this Micronesian micro-nation .
A refugee detention centre , set up by Australia seven years ago , will close down at the end of this month .
It was built by the government of Prime Minister John Howard at a time when hundreds of boat people were trying to reach Australia .
It proved a huge vote - winner , but Mr Howard was turfed out in November and his successor , Labour Prime Minister Kevin Rudd , swiftly moved to shut it down .
Nauruans are distraught - the facility brought much - needed jobs and hundreds of big - spending contractors , police and officials .
Phosphate mining has resumed in on the island of Nauru Despite all these trials , Nauru is determined to get back on its feet .
A new reformist government is hatching plans to establish the island as a pit -stop for international tuna boats to refuel and repair .
A mining company hopes to extract precious metals from the surrounding sea-bed .
Phosphate mining has resumed with the government claiming there is another 30 years of reserves up in the scarred interior .
Hangover " We find ourselves in a big hole , " concedes newly - elected president and former weight - lifting champion , Marcus Stephen .
" We 're doing our best to climb out of it .
It wo n't be like in our heyday , but at least we 'll be comfortable . "
Nauruans realise that the party is well and truly over .
Now comes the hangover and then , with luck , some sort of recovery .
But it will take squeaky clean governance , hard work and rock - solid investments for Pleasant Island to once again live up to its name .
It may not yet be paradise lost , but it is most definitely paradise postponed .

Tanks and other military hardware have been paraded through Moscow 's Red Square for the first time since the collapse of the Soviet Union .
On display at the V - Day parade were weapons such as the Topol - M ballistic missile .
The annual ceremony commemorates the defeat of Nazi Germany in 1945 .
This year the Russian leadership revived the Communist - era custom of showing off hardware .
Dmitry Medvedev , who was inaugurated as Russia 's new president on Wednesday , watched the parade alongside his predecessor , Vladimir Putin .
Soldiers goose - stepped across the square , and rode in a T - 90 tank .
Observers say the Russian leadership was keen to show off the country 's military might .
The leaders insisted the event was not intended to threaten anyone .
Some soldiers wore replica World War II uniforms .
The cobbles of Red Square had to be reinforced to cope with the tanks and other heavy weaponry .
Commentators say that despite the show of force , the Russian army suffers from lack of money , a shortage of training , and low morale .
But President Medvedev said Russia 's army and navy were gaining strength .

Shop ’n ’Freude , and Other Observations on Consumerism .
I recently ( ish ) got a job at the consumerist , as an intern sorting the almighty tipline .
I have been a little successful so far , a few of my posts bubbling to the surface in a sort of panic - induced joy .
I mean , if I am doing a bad job , not of them will get to the front page , right ?
So , in what little time I have of solitude , I have been meditating on what would make a good story , or more generally , what it means to exist as a consumer – what is customer service , what is good customer service , what is a lie , and what is true ?
What laws does one lose when they enter a retail establishment , and what responsibilities do businesses have to the consumer , and vice versa ?
This came to a boiling point - more appropriately , a climax - when I was visiting a friend who had recently came back from Iraq .
He was telling a story ( to someone else - my ears are giant ) about how a thrifty retailer was selling a t - shirt for 19 bucks , and the shirt meant you got one free lapdance .
Apparently , there were rules about lapdances , and someone had a lot of shirts .
My mind did n’t bother trying to deduce the specific situation , as much as all the thoughts and feeling coalesced into a single bubble of thought .
The Lapdance shirt had you paying more money for a greater output .
Therefor , why not pay less for lesser output ?
Well , that ’s walmart .
But what about a severely lowered payment for a severely lesser outcome - in fact , a direct bad think would happen to you ?
What if you could pay for something in shame ?
The Horrible amalgam of retail outlets and Shadenfreude : Shop ’n ’freude .
( Schadenbaums also acceptable ) .
This may be my one great idea , so bear with me .
The idea is that the prices would be so low , because you are literally paying in shame .
Everything at SNF would have two prices : one would be the regular , big - box retail outlet price , sales et all .
Beneath that , however , is a color - coded pricing system that is only available to those precious SNF card club holders .
The colors respond to discounts , so that one item ( For example , a 56 ′ HDTV ) would have a ridiculously low cost ( $ 300 ) , but more importantly , the color would also respond to a specific list of acts of shame that would be wrought upon you ( You are forced to strip into your underwear , cover yourself in KY , and make a slip - and - slide out of the linoleum floors until skin rubs with tile ) .
Things need not be as horrible -
Want that shirt for 50 cents ?
Ok – but the person ringing you out has to give an open palm slap to your face .
Have a Nice day .
Here ’s the genius of the idea :
It ’s all videotaped .
Live streaming video , like porn , DVD ’s put out of all the best ones , Even a bi-weekly tv - show hosted by Bob - fucking - saget !
Jesus Christ , it ’s the shame of fear factor except now it ’s NATIONWIDE , and everyone ’s grandma is lining up to get ass - smacked with a piece of Ham to afford the newest iphone !
It ’s wonderful , delightful , delicious chaos that is marketable and would ruin walmart .
Can you imagine ?
The Retail outlets trying to adopt SNF ’s new world order , with target opening “ Grievance Lanes ” to accommodate the writhing masses , demanding to walk paces around the store with their pants around their ankles to get milk for a nickel ?
Each one trying to out - do the next one , with people darting to blue - light specials covered in Tar , or maybe Jam , just awaiting whatever the next challenge will be , so ready to forgo their self respect for the new Miley Cyrus CD ?
Would n’t even be illegal .
All SNF club - card members would have to sign a waiver , forgoing them for suing SNF , and knowing that they are getting these prices because they are agreeing to perform these acts , and can absolutely buy them at the normal price if they so choose .
They forgo all rights to their image , and understand that they could be used in television - fuck it , people wanna be on TV !
They ’d come dressed and Mimes , or Luchadore , or any god damn costume and perform the ” Walk with a banana between your thighs ” trick over and over again , hoping to get introduced by BOBFUCKINGSAGET !
And what about returns !
What exchanges only , yea , but what if something is out of stock , nothing able to replenish it ?
Oh man , that ’s a special .
Charge a ticket for that , because he gets to enact out the revenge on the establishment !
Oh , yeah , a little revenge !
Buy it up , America !
It ’s everything that we hate about America , and it ’s everything we ’d love to watch .
It ’s beautiful , it ’s horrible , and it ’d be a fucking goldmine .
So who ’s up ?
Who ’s got the balls to take us this low ?
C’mon people , I just lost myself in a whole rant !
This should be addressed .
Jobs are Fun .
While it seems most humans on Earth are busy looking for iPhones , the National Academy of Sciences has published a report that states we need to start looking for alien life with novel biochemistries .
Skepticality correspondent Fraser Cain , of Universe Today , helps Derek & Swoopy interpret the The Limits of Organic Life in Planetary Systems , and what it means for the search for life in the universe .
What ’s with all the media hype over the latest must - have electronic device , the iPhone ?
This week on Skepticality , Derek & Swoopy talk to Rob Walch , host of the Today in iPhone podcast , about the cult of Apple ’s newest release — and ask whether it lives up to the hype .
DNA as Evolution ’s Proof
book review by Kenneth W. Krause
Publishers have flooded the popular science market in recent years with respectable but frustratingly sketchy accounts of evolution .
Generalizations , metaphors , and defensive polemics have all too frequently been offered not as supplements to , but as surrogates for , authentic science .
Arguably , the most essential and epic narrative ever , notwithstanding those relating to the origins of life and the universe itself , surely deserves better .
And so does the reasonably intelligent reader .
Enter Sean Carroll , University of Wisconsin - Madison professor of genetics , who has served up an intellectual feast for the second time in as many years .
In 2005 , he catered Endless Forms Most Beautiful , the much - acclaimed application of embryonic development science to the standard evolutionary paradigm .
And now , in The Making of the Fittest , Carroll shares with us some of the finer and more satisfying details of natural selection and descent with modification .
A rapidly expanding library of DNA sequences and the new science of genomics , the comparative study of various species ’
DNA , have finally allowed scientists , nearly 150 years following the first publication of Darwin ’s
On the Origin of Species , to actually see how the fittest are made , to identify the specific genetic changes that have enabled species to adapt to their diverse environments through the ages .
Carroll begins with a look at the most ancient DNA on Earth , genetic text that has somehow withstood a steady barrage of mutations for more than two billion years .
These “ immortal genes ” endure not because they avoid all mutations , but rather because natural selection has “ purified ” certain amino acid sequences to prevent them from changing in ways that would compromise certain functions basic to all domains of life , archaea , bacteria , and eukaryotes ( including humans ) alike .
Carroll ’s reasoning goes like this :
Each amino acid is composed of three nucleotide bases , or a triplet ( AAG , ACT , etc. ) , in the DNA molecule .
For each possible triplet , there are 576 potential single random base mutations .
Some changes are called “ synonymous ” because , despite mutation , the resulting triplets encode the same amino acid , allowing the protein to perform an equivalent function .
Other changes are said to be “ nonsynonymous ” because mutation results in a different amino acid , which in turn alters the protein ’s utility .
If mutation occurred in a completely random fashion , one would expect nonsynonymous changes to outnumber synonymous changes three to one .
That is not what is found .
In fact , the real world ratio is reversed , three to one in favor of synonymous changes .
“ DNA sequences that encode the same protein but that are substantially different , ” Carroll surmises , “ are unmistakable evidence of natural selection allowing mutations that do not change protein function , while acting to eliminate mutations that would . ”
But evolution is not merely loss prohibitive ; it is intensively creative as well .
Consider first the development of color vision in certain primates .
All Old World ( African and Asian ) apes and monkeys , including humans , possess trichromatic color vision encoded by three opsin genes , SWS ( sensitive to blue light tuned to a wavelength of 417 nanometers ) , MWS ( green to 530 nm ) , and LWS ( red to 560 nm ) .
New World monkeys and most other mammals have dichromatic vision and just a single gene responsible for encoding the MWS / LWS opsin ( light to wavelengths from 510 to 550 nm ) .
Carroll demonstrates how , in humans , the first set of three opsins evolved from the second set of two possessed by the common ancestor of apes and Old World monkeys .
Our separate green and red opsins are 98 percent similar and lie together head - to - toe on our X chromosome .
Such characteristics are highly suggestive of gene duplication followed by a divergence of function .
By isolating amino acids , replacing one with another , and measuring the effects of such replacements , biologists have determined that only three amino acid positions are responsible for the fine spectral tuning of human MWS and LWS opsins to 530 nm and 560 nm .
Such precise color tuning , Carroll concludes , must have been under intense selective pressure in the natural world .
Indeed , detailed field studies of food preference and consumption habits among trichromatic chimpanzees , lemurs , and colobus and spider monkeys consistently revealed a fondness for redder leaves , indicative of high protein levels and low toughness .
Discriminating between a light source ’s wavelengths , of course , is the occupation of the eye ’s cone photoreceptor cells , which are most useful in brightly lit environments .
Consider next the evolution of deep - sea vision .
Seeing in dim light , by contrast , requires the use of a species ’ rod photoreceptors .
Rhodopsins in most terrestrial animals are tuned to maximally absorb wavelengths of approximately 500 nm ; but , at ocean depths of 200 meters or so , only a narrow band of blue light with a wavelength of 480 nm is available .
Amazingly , the rhodopsins of dolphins , Sowerby ’s beaked whales , and deep - sea fish are “ blue - shifted , ” or fine - tuned 10 – 20 nm toward the blue end of the light spectrum .
Exactly how did this happen ?
By replacing amino acids found in one species with those of another , scientists have distinguished three positions , 83 , 292 , and 299 , that are primarily responsible for the 11 nm shift in bottlenose dolphins .
The beaked whale ’s rhodopsin is further blue - shifted to 484 nm and differs from its dolphin counterpart only at site 299 .
Interestingly , deep - sea eels possess a rhodopsin that is blue - shifted to 482 nm and contains the same three crucial amino acids as that of the beaked whale .
Shallow - water eels , by contrast , have a rhodopsin sensitive to a wavelength of 502 nm , akin to that of terrestrial mammals , and identical at the three crucial sites to the rhodopsins of harbor seals and manatees , two surface - dwelling mammals .
Perhaps even more significant , however , is the fact that eels are fish , the evolutionary lines of which split away from other vertebrates hundreds of millions of years ago .
Whales and dolphins are cetaceans — mammals descended from a terrestrial ancestor that eventually returned to the water .
Only independent evolution can explain this phenomenon .
According to Carroll , “ When two species or groups of species evolve the same exact amino acids in a protein in adapting to similar environments , this is very strong evidence of natural selection for the same adaptation . ”
But in some notable instances natural selection relaxes altogether , allowing harmful mutations to accumulate and to “ fossilize ” an organism ’s DNA .
Take the coelacanth , for example , a large , primitive fish thought to be closely related to the first four - legged vertebrates .
With no MWS / LWS gene , the coelacanth ’s only hope for color vision lies with its short - wavelength SWS gene .
But alas , this opsin , though still recognizable , is so riddled with mutations that it is no longer capable of constructing a functional protein .
Dolphins and whales also possess a fossilized SWS opsin gene .
But of course we should n’t feel sorry for these deep - water creatures because , unlike their ancestors , they have absolutely no use for color vision .
Predictably , nocturnal and subterranean mammals like the owl monkey , bush baby , slow loris , and blind mole rat also possess independently fossilized SWS genes .
These pathetically useless remnants of a primordial ancestor ’s lifestyle supply solid evidence against theories of design .
Unlike an intelligent creator , “ [ n ] atural selection cannot preserve what is not being used and it cannot plan for the future , ” writes Carroll .
“ The fossilization and loss of genes are exactly what is predicted to evolve in the absence of natural selection . ”
At this point , one can hardly help but recognize a profound similarity in the mechanisms of vision among complex animals .
Indeed , recent discoveries have shown that tremendously different - looking eyes have much more in common than anyone had previously thought .
For example , the same “ tool kit ” protein — now referred to as Pax - 6 — controls the construction of eyes belonging to creatures as diverse as worms , flies , mice , squid , and humans , implying an extremely ancient , common ancestor with a primitive eye composed of photoreceptor and pigment cells .
“ The eye , ” Carroll observes , “ far from being one of the most difficult structures to account for by evolution , has become instead one of the leading sources of insights into how evolution works with common genetic tools to build complex organs . ”
A remarkably comprehensive presentation , The Making of the Fittest does not confine itself to ocular - based discussions .
Readers will delight in challenging illuminations of everything from the evolution of human skin color and sickle cell anemia to the invention of an “ antifreeze ” gene in the bloodless icefish of Bouvet Island .
And despite two concluding chapters censuring the popular denial of science and ecological irresponsibility , Sean Carroll ’s text is refreshingly void of pretension and politics .
Clearly , this is the work of a truly impassioned scientist .
To mark the tenth installment of Popular Delusions , I ’m turning my attention to one of the most common and enduring superstitions among the New Age set : the belief that naturally occurring crystals have some sort of special power to store , concentrate , or focus vaguely defined “ energies ” .
A web search readily brings up hundreds of sites discussing the magical potencies of various crystals , most of which have to do with their supposed healing powers .
Here ’s an entirely typical example :
Bloodstones are believed to have mystical and magickal powers , thought to be able to control the weather and have the ability to banish evil and negativity and to direct spiritual energy .
It heightens the intuition and stimulates dreaming .
It is a powerful revitalizer of your body and your mind .
Bloodstone calms the mind , dispels confusion and aids in the decision making process .
As the name suggests , they are very good at cleansing the blood and are known to be a powerful healer .
It is used for an energy cleanser and immune stimulator for acute infections .
It aids the circulation and reduces the formation of pus , neutralizing over acidification .
It cleanses the lower chakras and realigns their energies .
All that in one stone !
Others even discuss the supposed side effects or dangers of improper crystal use :
If a woman is trying to get pregnant or is in the first two trimesters of pregnancy , she should avoid any direct contact with Green Tourmaline … .
Manipulating a woman ’s male energies by wearing Green Tourmaline could upset her endocrine system and could compromise the pregnancy or possibly harm the fetus .
Who knew ordinary crystals could be so dangerous ?
If this was true , one would think the many sites that sell green tourmaline should come with warnings .
They might be exposing themselves to serious legal liability by selling those stones to just anyone !
( I have to admit , I would just love to see that lawsuit … )
On the other hand , other crystal - boosting sites seem to shrug off these dangers .
For example :
RULE NO . 1 – There are no rules for use of crystals or minerals in healing .
Now how could this be ?
If crystals do anything at all , there must be correct and incorrect ways to use them .
If all methods of using crystals work equally well , the only possible explanation for this is that crystals are completely useless .
As with the green tourmaline example , one of the most ironic things is that different crystal - hawking sites often disagree about what the crystals they sell are supposed to do .
One site says , “ Fluorite ’s ordered crystalline structure brings stability and order into the wearer ’s life . ”
But a different site advertising purple fluorite explains that it is for “ Change .
Helps one get out of ruts . ”
And how exactly do crystals work their magic ?
Do they have their own power ?
Apparently not :
There are a lot of people who think that crystals have power .
They do n’t …
Crystals are only tools which extend the power of intent of the healer and a medium .
On the other hand :
… we have proof that all crystals have power .
The Power of love , from deep in the earth .
This flood of conflicting claims presents the sincere believer with a variety of serious dilemmas .
Is there a right way or a wrong way to use crystal power ?
Which crystals are most effective for a given aim ?
Can crystals be dangerous ?
Is it possible that some crystals are dangerous in ways not yet recognized ?
Plainly , all of these are important questions , especially the last two .
But how is the crystal enthusiast to go about answering them ?
There are a multitude of conflicting answers .
What answer should we believe , and why ?
As with all cases of religious confusion , these conflicting claims have come about because there is no evidence whatsoever that crystals have any supernatural or magical abilities .
As one pseudoscience site puts it :
… no instruments can pick up these vibrations or record any difference in energy around a crystal as crystals are things of Mother Earth not of man .
But if this alleged energy ca n’t be measured or recorded , then how does anyone know it exists in the first place ?
What is the basis for all these grandiose and fanciful claims about the ailments and maladies that specific types of crystals can solve ?
The above mentioned site calls it a “ hard and fast intuitive fact ” , which is just another way of saying that all of this is made up .
Crystal use can be rescued from danger and chaos , but only by consigning it to irrelevance .
As often happens , New Age misunderstandings are built on a kernel of genuine scientific fact .
Some crystals , such as quartz , display a useful property called the piezoelectric effect : they generate an electric voltage when stretched or compressed .
This property has led to their use in a wide variety of industrial applications , including sensors that measure pressure , vibration and frequency .
They ’re also used to build miniaturized motors , record player needles , radio transmitters and receivers , and even loudspeakers .
The piezoelectric effect is a well - understood and precisely measurable phenomenon , however , and has nothing to do with meaningless handwaving about healing powers , chakra points or positive energies .
There ’s no doubt that crystals are an elegant example of the beauty that arises from the laws of physics .
Fantastic formations like those of New Mexico ’s Lechuguilla Cave prove the point .
But we do n’t need to believe crystals have any kind of magical power to appreciate their beauty .
Such superstitions cheapen and undermine what there is of genuine wonder in the world .
We need no supernatural add - ons to place between us and nature .

The Defense Secretary and Congress have been pounding on the Army , to start showing some results from its massive modernization project , Future Combat Systems .
The Army is getting the message , sending a platoon of Future Combat 's flying robots to Iraq , immediately .
30 of the Micro Air Vehicles , or MAVs , " are on their way to Baghdad two weeks from now , " Future Combat Systems program manager Maj .
Gen .
Charles Cartwright tells Defense News .
Unlike other small drones – which fly like miniature airplanes – the MAVs use ducted fans to float in the air .
Hovering in one place , they can stare down with " electro­optical and infrared cameras , and soon will have a gimbal - mounted camera and a laser designator , " * Defense News * notes .
Pressure from Congress and from the E - Ring may not be the only bureaucratic push to put the MAV on the Sandbox Express .
There 's also a bit of an inter - service rivalry surrounding the drones .
The Navy announced back in January that their bomb technicians would use the 18 - inch high , 40 - pound machines look out for roadside explosives .
( The MAVs were originally developed in a joint service program , and were only later sucked into Future Combat Systems . )
The Army is keen on showing off FCS '
relevance in today 's fights – especially since the Defense Secretary said that program " must continue to demonstrate its value for the types of irregular challenges we will face . "
So the service is working to get other FCS gear out the door .
There 's talk of speeding up the Fire Scout robotic helicopter project , for instance .
Last week , the service brought Future Combat 's first prototype of its
next - generation cannon to the Capitol .
But the display did n't go precisely as planned .
FCS enthusiast Sen. James
Inhofe , for one , was n't interested in talking about how such a weapon might contributein Iraq or Afghanistan .
First , he told a story about how Russia and China 's growing military might .
The he said :
* The United States Army currently ranks behind four other countries in cannon artillery capabilities ; British , Russian , South African and
German artillery systems are better than the United States ...
I am happy to be able to say that those days are over , and today , with the rollout of the Non - Line - of - Sight Cannon , the United States once again retains for itself the greatest artillery piece in the world . *

Who wants to be a defense scientist ?
Apparently , almost no one , according to the New York Times .
" In the past 10 years or so , as spending on new military projects has reached its highest level since the Reagan years , the Pentagon has increasingly been losing the people most skilled at managing those projects , " the Times notes .
" That brain drain , military experts like [ former undersecretary of defense Paul ] Kaminski say , is a big factor in a breakdown in engineering management that has made huge cost overruns and long delays the norm . "
The Times article looks at the breakdown of " systems engineering , " which ensures the various pieces of hard and software all work together on a big project .
" Without it , projects can turn into chaotic , costly failures , " the article notes .
The main culprit in this breakdown is the loss of engineering talent , according to the article .
But it 's not just a brain drain .
Some might argue it's also the growth of complex " system of systems " technology programs , among other factors .
In the wake of George W. Bush ’s re-election in 2004 , frustrated liberals talked secession back to within hailing distance of the margins of national debate — a place it had not occupied since 1861 .
With their praise of self - rule and the devolution of power , they sounded not unlike many conservatives had in the days before Bush & Cheney & Limbaugh wedded the American Right to the American Empire .
While certain proponents of the renascent secessionism were motivated by spite or pixilated by whimsy or driven by the simple - minded belief that the United States can be divided into blue and red — as though our lovely land can be painted in only two hues ! — others argued with cogency and passion for a disunionist position that bordered on the , well , seditious .
Emphasizing both culture ( “ Now that slavery is taken care of , I ’m for letting the South form its own nation , ” said Democratic operative Bob Beckel ) and economics ( Democratic pundit Lawrence O’Donnell noted that “ ninety percent of the red states are welfare clients of the federal government ” ) , writing in forums of neoliberalism ( Slate ) and paleoliberalism ( The Nation ) , liberals helped to disinter a body of thought that had been buried at Appomattox .
And — surprise ! — three years later , the corpse has legs .
Secession is the next radical idea poised to enter mainstream discourse — or at least the realm of the conceivable .
You ca n’t bloat a modest republic into a crapulent empire without sparking one hell of a centrifugal reaction .
And the prospect of breaking away from a union once consecrated to liberty and justice but now degenerating into imperial putrefaction will only grow in appeal as we go marching with our Patriot Acts and National Security Strategies through Iraq , Iran , and all the frightful signposts on our road to nowhere .
Some of the contemporary secessionists are puckish and playful ; others are dead serious .
Some seek to separate from the main body of a state and add a fifty - first star to the American flag while others wish to leave the United States altogether .
Some proposals are so sensible ( the division of California into two or three states ) that in a just world they would be inevitable ; others are so radical ( the independent republic of Vermont ) as to seem risibly implausible — until you meet the activists and theoreticians preparing these new declarations of independence .
For these movements are , in the main , hopeful and creative ( if utopian ) responses to the Current Mess engulfing our land .
They are the political antidote to the disease of giantism .
We are a nation born in secession , after all , and of rebellion against faraway rulers .
Ruptures , crackups , and the splintering of overlarge states into polities of more manageable size , closer to the human scale , are as American as runaway slaves and draft resisters .
“ SECESSION , ” SAYS ROB WILLIAMS — Vermont filmmaker , radio host , Champlain College professor , and singer - songwriter of the ought - to - be classic “ Kill Your Television ” — “ is every American ’s birthright . ”
It ’s been almost a century and a half since any significant number of Americans believed that , but last November Williams ’s verdantly democratic state hosted the first - ever nationwide conference of those who wish to make the nation a little less wide .
Yeah , sure , I know : breaking away is impossible .
Quixotic .
Hopeless .
So was dancing on the Berlin Wall .
The Vermont gathering was convened by Kirkpatrick Sale , founder of the Middlebury Institute , a secessionist clearinghouse whose “ ultimate task ” is “ the peaceful dissolution of the American empire . ”
Sale is the author of the decentralist compendium Human Scale and books on the Luddites and Students for a Democratic Society .
So that agents of the Department of Homeland Security wo n’t have to pore over his works , he offers this description of his political vision : “ I am an anarchist who wants to see society organized on a small , human scale , based on self - determining communities . ”
Sale scheduled the confab just three days before the 2006 election , not for any symbolic reason but because it was “ the first cheap weekend after the fall foliage season . ”
So upon Burlington converged the divergent .
Forty - three delegates from eighteen states met around a long table in the Lake Champlain Salon of the Wyndham Burlington .
I saw ponytails and suits , turtlenecks and sneakers , an Alaskan gold miner and one delegate from the neo-Confederate League of the South who wore a grey greatcoat , as if sitting for a daguerreotype just before the battle .
The location might seem , at first , thuddingly inappropriate .
Secession talk in New England , cradle of Unionism , bête noire of the Confederacy , source of the “ Battle Hymn of the ( indivisible ! ) Republic ” ?
Yet no region of the country has been as fertile a ground for secessionist thought as New England .
Yankees threatened to leave the Union in 1803 when Jefferson doubled the American realm with his constitutionally dubious Louisiana Purchase , and the cries of separation once again rang through the Northeast in 1814 , when New Englanders , appalled by the War of 1812 , met at the Hartford Convention to discuss going their own way .
The Massachusetts Federalist Timothy Pickering heard “ no magic in the sound of Union .
If the great objects of union are utterly abandoned . . . let the union be severed .
Such a severance presents no Terrors for me . ”
The subject of an amicable divorce was raised in the 1840s during the debates over the annexation of Texas and the Mexican War .
In each instance New England had a strong moral case for secession — and a practical one , too : the country had gotten too damn big to govern from a swamp on the Potomac .
Daniel Webster , the God - like Daniel ( on his good days ) , argued in 1846 that “ there must be some limit to the extent of our territory , if we are to make our institutions permanent .
The Government is very likely to be endangered . . . by a further enlargement of its already vast territorial surface . ”
By the 1850s , with its courageous defiance of the Fugitive Slave Act , New England had become the epicenter of states ’ rights — the logical end of which is secession — and of localist defiance of tyrannical central government .
Yes , yes , a century hence racist governors would take possession of the phrase , but why should the fact that some southern politicians used “ states ’ rights ” to justify segregation in the 1950s forever discredit the philosophy of Thomas Jefferson and Patrick Henry ?
I mean , look : George W. Bush uses the word “ freedom ” as often as a pimpled mall - rat says “ fuck . ”
Does that mean we ought to junk “ freedom ” ?
Or should we reclaim it ?
In its latest incarnation , secession has something of a greenish cast .
It is reaching its fullest flower in Vermont , and if the idea of breaking away from the United States has not yet proven as exportable as , say , Vermont Teddy Bears or Cherry Garcia , give it time .
Thomas Naylor is the gentle godfather of the Vermont independence movement .
Naylor taught economics at Duke for thirty years before , in best contrarian fashion , he and his wife Magdalena did a reverse snowbird and moved north in retirement to Charlotte , Vermont .
In October 2003 he founded the hopefully named Second Vermont Republic ( SVR ) .
( The first one lasted from 1777 - 1791 , before the Green Mountain Boys threw in with the United States . )
Naylor proposed separating from the U.S. , he says , almost as an afterthought .
He was delivering an anti-war speech when he said , “ If we stop this war there will only be another one .
Whenever Bush or Slick Willie or Reagan need to improve their popularity they ’ll bomb someone . ”
He came to a realization : A citizen of an independent Vermont might hope to live in a free and peaceful republic ; a subject of the American Empire is doomed to watch helplessly as her taxes feed an unquenchable war machine .
So why not leave the empire and pledge allegiance to Vermont ?
Naylor ’s call struck a chord .
A minor chord , perhaps , but a chord that has reverberated since 1776 .
Because the Vermont secessionists were not sallow ideologues but rather men and women deeply in love with their state , they gained a foothold .
The state has , perhaps , the most well - developed sense of itself of any state in the lower 48 , and the SVR is awash in Vermontishness , from maple syrup to Robert Frost .
Member Jim Hogue frequently dresses as the state ’s rollicking founder , Ethan Allen , and delivers hortatory speeches .
Rob Williams , editor of the SVR quarterly Vermont Commons , seeks to “ create a visual iconography of Vermont secession ” as a means of making secession “ sexy — an attractive , interesting , viable political option . ”
Vermont Commons is a gem : a literate , polemical , thought - provoking , radical newspaper that has featured contributions from the likes of Wendell Berry , Bill McKibben , James Howard Kunstler , Burlington mayor Peter Clavelle , and a cast of politically uncategorizable Vermonters .
For the stream of secession is fed by many American springs : the participatory democracy dreams of the New Left , the small - is - beautiful ethos of the greens , the traditional conservative suspicion ( fading fast under the Bush eraser ) of big government and remote bureaucracy , and that old - fashioned American blend of do n’t - tread - on - me libertarianism with I ’ll - give - you - the - shirt - off - my - back communalism .
The Vermont Commons contributors ask and sometimes even answer the hard questions about secession :
How would a local currency work ?
How do we revive town meeting democracy ?
How does Vermont achieve “ a sustainable food system ” ?
How does it encourage community supported agriculture , organic farms , co-ops , roadside markets , and backyard gardening ?
What would an independent Vermont energy policy look like ?
In October 2005 , the SVR hosted 250 Vermont secessionists at a statewide conference in the capitol building in Montpelier ( rent : $ 35 ) .
It was richly symbolic , messily democratic , and sweetly audacious .
You can do that in Vermont .
( California is another story . )
The group ’s next goal is “ 200 towns by 2012 ” : that is , using the venerable direct - democracy institution of town meeting , the SVR hopes by 2012 to persuade 200 of Vermont ’s 237 towns to call for a convention at which Vermonters can debate the merits of independence .
Scoff if you will , but remember that the front - runners for the Democratic and Republican presidential nominations of 2008 supported the Iraq war and the Patriot Act .
In 2012 , a decade into a nightmarish “ war on terror ” that our rulers have assured us will last our lifetimes , will Americans be content with a status quo of perpetual war and profligate empire ?
MY SYMPATHY FOR THE SECESSIONISTS bleeds all over the page .
I am , after all , native to and still citizen of rural western New York , which is about as close as one can find to a powerless colony .
Still , a state of West New York would be a new star on Old Glory .
So would proposed fissioned states in northern California and southern Oregon ( which would combine to form the felicitously named State of Jefferson ) and the Upper Peninsula of Michigan .
On the other hand , the secessionists assembled at Kirk Sale ’s Burlington convention wanted , for the most part , out of the Union altogether .
They wish to be lone stars .
Or if that sounds too grand — for a star , up close , is burning and blinding and unfit to love — maybe we should just say that they want to be , like demoted demotic Pluto , “ dwarf planets ” whom the giants disdain to notice .
Or attack .
“ This is n’t right or left , ” said one advocate of an independent New Hampshire .
Peaceful hippies , good - naturedly radical Vermonters , and anticorporate leftists broke bread with southern Christians and men wearing Confederate flag lapel pins , and the skies did not darken nor the earth crack .
In fact , the most striking feature of the conference was that if an auditor closed his eyes and blocked out the accents , it was hard to tell who was the leftist and who was the arch - conservative .
I heard mentioned , as heroes , Martin Luther King Jr. , Robert E. Lee , community organizer Saul Alinsky , Thomas Jefferson , and the strategist of nonviolence Gene Sharp .
Denunciations were made of “ corporate greed , ” “ federal empire , ” television , the Iraq war , and the Patriot Act .
Were there fruits and nuts ?
Sure , a few .
But just as cranks keep this country turning , so too are fruits and nuts a sapid alternative to Wonder Bread .
The furry , troll - like man who proclaims himself King of Kansas is imaginative and harmless ; the shaven men in tailored suits who call themselves President of the United States have been , of late , unimaginative and grossly harmful .
I ’ll take the King of Kansas , thank you very much .
If some secessionists are wool - gathering gnomes , the best of them are patriots in the truest sense : they cherish the music , literature , accents , agriculture , history , and quirks of their places .
Secessionists — most of them , anyway — are all too aware that what they seek ( the dissolution of the mightiest empire on the planet Earth ) borders the inconceivable .
But they have made peace with its implausibility and moved on .
Reform they scorn ; he who works within the system is swallowed by the system .
Taking up arms is madness .
“ Rebellion and revolution are useless , ” says Sale .
“ You would be crushed . ”
If you want out of a bloated empire and dehumanizing system , secession is the path .
“ The left - right thing has got to go , ” declares Ian Baldwin , cofounder of Chelsea Green Publishing and publisher of Vermont Commons .
“ We ’re decentralists and we are up against a monster . ”
What might replace left and right , liberal and conservative , as useful political bipolarities ?
Globalist and localist , perhaps , or placeless versus placeist .
Baldwin argues that “ peak oil and climate change are linked and irreversible events that will within a generation change how human beings live .
The world economy will relocalize . ”
He dismisses homeland security as “ fatherland security ” — for “ homeland , ” with its Nazi -Soviet echoes , has never been what Americans call their country .
What we need , says Baldwin , is “ homestead security ” : sustainable agriculture , small shops , a revival of craftsmanship , local citizenship , communal spirit .
The vision is one of self - government .
Independence from the empire but interdependence at the grassroots .
Neighborliness .
The other American Dream .
Why should Vermont ( or Kansas or Mississippi ) be compelled by strangers in Washington to implant computer chips in its cattle and send its state militia ( now known as the National Guard ) to fight in overseas wars and register its firearms and subject its children to standardized tests and participate in federal farm programs that privilege corporate agribusiness ?
Are n’t Vermonters , guided by their intimate knowledge of local conditions , capable of fashioning their own laws ( or non-laws ) on such matters ?
Step back and it sounds fantastical : little Vermont wanting out of the United States .
But secessionists are fond of the Soviet example .
If , in 1985 , you had stood on a platform and predicted that within a lustrum the Soviet Union would be all but dissolved , the snickers would have filled a candy factory .
Sale also likes to point out that the United Nations , founded with 51 members in 1945 , now has 192 .
Why not 193 ?
Still , the S - word has , to some , a treasonous taint .
It ’s not that Americans see it as a black - and - white issue ; no , they see it through a haze of blue and gray .
“ Abraham Lincoln really did a number on us , ” admits Naylor .
“ He convinced the vast majority of Americans that secession is illegal , immoral , and unconstitutional . ”
Naylor ’s frustration over Lincoln ’s giant shadow is shared by Donald Livingston , a philosopher at Emory University and the “ guru ” of the new secessionists , as Naylor calls him .
“ Historiography in America is based on the fundamental postulate that the Union should have been preserved at all costs , ” says Livingston .
He proposes to challenge that assumption , to inspire students and colleagues and those tired of the consolidationist consensus to write history from a decentralist perspective .
Livingston ’s educational foundation , the Abbeville Institute , takes as its motto , “ Divided We Stand ; United We Fall . ”
The U.S.A. , he believes , no longer works ; why not try the Disunited States of America ?
Critics of secession wonder if devolving power might not empower local tyrannies .
For instance , the Vermonters have taken flak for cooperating with the League of the South , which is either a southern cultural organization with an official commitment to equality before the law or an unsavory group nostalgic for the Confederacy , depending upon whom you believe .
Yet the range and potential of oppressive government has natural limits in a small jurisdiction .
If a town in Alabama — or an upscale precinct in Manhattan — falls under the sway of knaves or crooks , abused minorities can remonstrate , face to face , with the authorities .
They can organize resistance on a human scale .
Or , if all else fails , they can leave .
Even at the state level , redress is not impossible .
Subjects of a large empire have no such option ( other than expatriating ) .
And unlike the Alabama town or Manhattan block , the U.S. government can wage wars , fill prisons , and curtail liberties on a scale undreamt of by petty tyrants .
I suppose it comes down to this :
Do you trust your neighbors , or do you trust George W. Bush and Hillary Clinton ?
THE CRIMES AND FOLLIES OF THE Bush - Cheney administration have boosted secessionists ’ fortunes , but when Bush - Cheney , like all things , passes , the case for radical devolution loses none of its cogency .
The problem with the U.S. is one of scale , and it cannot be solved by electing new or different or better people to public offices .
As Donald Livingston says , “ The public corporation known as the United States has simply grown too large for the purposes of self - government , in the same way that a committee of three hundred people would be too large for the purposes of a committee .
There needs to be a public debate on the out - of - scale character of the regime and what can be done about it . ”
The average congressional district now contains 647,000 persons .
And this is the “ people ’s house , ” thought by the Founders to be the most responsive and grassroots of federal institutions .
How is anything like representative government possible on such an enormous and impersonal scale ?
Decentralizing power would have the additional virtue of localizing those coalition - splitters known as “ social issues . ”
Case in point :
When one of the southern delegates at the Burlington convention calls abortion a heinous crime , I sit back to watch the fireworks .
They are doused in the fresh waters of federalism .
There is general agreement on a mind - your - own - damn - business principle .
If Marin County wants to serve joints with school lunches and Tupelo , Mississippi , wants the Ten Commandments in the classroom , well , that ’s up to the people of Marin and Tupelo .
Ain’t none of my business .
Yours , either .
Let Utah be Utah , and let San Francisco be San Francisco .
The policy will drive busybodies mad with frustration , but for the rest of us , it just might be the beginning of tolerance .
There is no reason why this kind of hands - off mutuality requires secession — they did n’t used to call the U.S. system “ federalism ” for nothing — but the urge to intervene is so irresistible to Dobsonian conservatives and Clintonian liberals that states and cities and towns have been deprived of the right to make their own laws , shaped by local circumstances , on such matters as the legality of marijuana and abortion and the proper way ( if any ) to define marriage .
Does anyone really think that the Christian Right or feminist left will ever agree to denationalize such issues and trust local people to make their own laws ?
Trust local people .
That , really , is the soul of the case for secession .
Bringing it all back home , as a small - town Minnesota boy who took the name Bob Dylan once wrote .
For home is where secession must be rooted .
Ideology of any sort is not so much a dead end as it is a road without end that carries the enthusiast far from any place resembling home .
It unmoors him , it leaves her without anchorage , quick to blame societal ills on outsiders , on dark alien forces .
I know : we live in the seventh year of the bloody and imperial Bush Octennium .
If Dick Cheney is n’t a dark alien force I do n’t know what is .
But a healthy secessionist movement must be founded in love : love of a particular place , its people ( of all ethnicities and colors ) , its culture , its language and books and music and baseball teams and , yes , its beer and flowers and punk rock clubs .
Maybe the Burlington conference was a sideshow , an amusing tour of the more outré precincts of American politics .
Or maybe it was a harbinger .
Think what you will .
This is radicalism deep - dyed in the American grain .
“ The military - industrial - energy - media complex is running an empire on the ruins of the republic , ” says Rob Williams , who does not think that merely putting Democratic hands on the levers of power will solve anything .
It ’s the levers themselves that have to be removed .
Would the union miss Vermont ?
Sure .
But as a young John Quincy Adams said , “ I love the Union as I love my wife .
But if my wife should ask for and insist upon a separation , she should have it , though it broke my heart . ”
Besides , Vermont ’s not going anywhere .
Even if she were to secede , the Green Mountains will not be moved , the sap will still flow , the novels of Howard Frank Mosher and Dorothy Canfield Fisher will remain ; hell , even Ben & Jerry ’s will keep dishing it out .
But why should n’t Vermonters run Vermont ?
Why should , say , Senator Hillary Clinton or Senator John McCain or Speaker Nancy Pelosi or President George W. Bush have even a whisper of a say in how Vermont orders her affairs ?
“ I want to leave my country , ” says Kirk Sale , “ without leaving my home . ”
That line packs a jolt , at least for this Little American .
My home comes first .
Yet I also want my country .
I ’m not sure what I think about leaving the U.S.A .
But is n’t it time that we gave the matter some thought ?
A FATAL JOURNEY TO THE WEB A FATAL JOURNEY TO THE WEB Who : Zach Johnson , 25 , and Jeffrey Max , 24 , met at a Dallas all - boys high school , where they encouraged each other 's then - offbeat interest in making funny videos .
" Now it 's the rage , " Johnson says .
" If everyone was hot on investment banking in 2003 , today people are flocking to entertainment jobs . "
Early success :
The duo moved to NYC and dived into the ad world .
A quirky effort , " Sushi , " won praise ; in it , one doctor consoled another at a Japanese restaurant after a surgery gone bad , only to find his buddy can't even pick up a piece of fish with chopsticks .
" We started spending more time messing around and less having drinks with ad execs , " Johnson says .
Aim to annoy :
One of their passions is lampooning pop culture .
They took mocking aim at Disney 's Duck Tales , the Scrooge McDuck vehicle , in a video tale of kidnapping .
" We were hoping to get a cease - and - desist notice from Disney to , you know , get noticed , " says Johnson .
" Instead , a Disney animator actually e-mailed us , saying he found it funny .
Oh well . "
Eureka moment : A clumsy tech infomercial made the two wonder , " What if everything this guy was saying was a lie ? "
That spawned Infinite Solutions .
Episode 1 , which promised viewers access to " Google TV , " quickly snowballed .
" We watched the hits climb from a few hundred to 100,000 in a day , " Johnson says .
The current tally is 500,000 .
Ultimate goal :
The pair have " not made any money yet " on their Internet fare and have day jobs to pay the bills .
" We 're in Hollywood , so of course everyone is always asking if you have a screenplay , " Johnson says .
" For the moment , though , we really want to stay online longer and make a name for ourselves there . "
No matter how tech - savvy you think you are , it 's difficult not to fall prey to Infinite Solutions .
The Web - based series features appropriately nerdy Mark Erickson , who calmly explains how to turn your cellphone into a WiFi network or shows you how to log into a Beta version of Google TV .
Viewer comments often praise the tips , while noting the procedure often took them , uh , quite a while .
Amusing , considering there is no Mark Erickson , and his gizmo solutions are actually hokum .
" We 've gotten e-mails from people saying , ' Finally got Google TV , thanks . '
It 's a crack - up , " says Zach Johnson , 25 , who along with Jeffrey Max , 24 , make up Fatal Farm , a blossoming Web - comedy production team whose subtle satirical videos often border on high - concept performance art .
The WiFi cellphone episode is the most popular , drawing 1.3 million views .
" We built our reputation on stuff that 's silly , " Johnson says .
" Now we want to branch out to more mature work with a stronger narrative . "
That 's why the Los Angeles duo is back in Dallas where they once attended the same boys ' school before eventually heading off to film programs at New York University ( Max ) and the University of Southern California ( Johnson ) .
Lured by familiar surroundings and lax production codes ( " You ca n't point a camera in LA without being asked for a permit , " says Johnson ) , the team is filming its final Solutions goof .
The decision to create a new episode was n't easy .
Fatal Farm dreamed up 17 Solutions , then burned out .
E-mails clamored for more .
The team was torn .
" You do n't really want to walk away , but it 's so high - concept it 's really not sustainable , " Johnson says .
In other words :
Once you know it 's fake , where 's the joke ?
In contrast to the usual 2 to 3 minute fare , this episode could run as long as 10 minutes and " is more like a pilot for a TV show than a Web - based video , " says Johnson , who plays Erickson .
However the ambitious finale goes over , the Fatal Farm guys are n't worried .
They have two other successful video concepts to their name , as well as sustained interest from Hollywood agents who they continue to rebuff .
" So much on the Web today is B - movie lite , " says Jason Nadler , head of the online division of United Talent Agency .
" They 're the sort of pioneer voice we 're looking for , people who are taking risks and moving the dial . "
While Fatal Farm hopes to eventually be in business with mainstream entertainment companies , they 'd prefer to stay independent for the moment .
While that means taking occasional editing or advertising jobs to cover costs , it also allows them to keep control .
Max says he and Johnson are " interested in longevity , and we 're not in a rush to make deals and crank out media .
What 's great about doing work directly for the Web is that there 's a community out there that will instantly give you a sense of how you 're doing . "
Max stars in another popular series , Lasagna Cat , which was born when the two found a ratty cat costume and decided to act out Garfield comic strips that segue into surrealistic music videos .
In a flurry of invention , they created 27 over the course of a few days .
The work that brought Fatal Farm its first bit of Web fame consisted of strange takes on TV show intros .
One of the most successful is their tweaking of Doogie Howser , M.D. , the late ' 80s sitcom about a boy - genius doctor .
When you first watch Fatal Farm 's video , it seems like nothing more than a replaying of the show 's theme - song intro .
Look closer , however , and you notice Johnson is artfully squeezed into every scene — sometimes as a photo in a newspaper clipping , other times seen walking past Howser in a hospital hallway .
" So much of American comedy is performance - based , the Will Ferrell model , " Johnson says .
" But there are more avenues to express comedy .
We 'd like special - effects comedy ( such as the Howser intro ) to be our special niche . "
In the meantime , there 's one more chance to hoodwink an Infinite Solutions virgin into spending hours following Mark Erickson 's guidebook to nowhere .
Enlarge By Jessica Rinaldi for USA TODAY Zach Johnson , 25 , left , and Jeffrey Max , 24 , are the production team behind Fatal Farm , which has several hit series , including one about tech gizmos that do n't exist .

Myths and legends
It does n't really matter which version of the Java platform you use , does it ?
Well I know for sure that thread context switching is expensive .
Is n't it ?
OK , but there 's no doubt that 32 - bit Java Virtual Machines ( JVMs ) are faster than 64 - bit JVMs .
Right ?
The truth is , most of the things we think we know about Java performance are actually pretty hard to quantify .
That 's the conclusion Google engineers Jeremy Manson and Paul Tyma have come to through what they humbly describe as " an unending search for the truth " .
" We had been writing a lot of code - server code , fast code , Java code , C++ code - and we realized one day that there are a lot of myths out there about Java performance , beliefs that we just knew were n't true , but had never been tested , " Manson said at this Spring 's Software Development West .
" We came to see that these unexamined beliefs actually make everybody 's life more difficult , " Tyma added .
" They make you write lousy , broken code , because you 're working around something that might not even be true .
And then your code becomes unreadable . "
Not precisely myth - busters , Manson and Tyma took on the roles of assumption challengers and shared their insights with SD West attendees , during a joint preso that touched on some timeless themes .
" This is n't about optimizing your code , " Manson said .
" It 's about challenging those assumptions you make while you 're writing it . "
And what are those assumptions ?
Number one : versions do n't matter .
" A lot of people think that they can keep on using 1.4 forever , and it wo n't affect performance , " Tyma said .
" Well , it turns out they 've been improving Java steadily over the past 13 years , and 1.6 is a lot faster than 1.5 , and 1.5 is a lot faster than 1.4 .
And remember , you can run 1.4 byte code on 1.6 VMs . "
Number two : 64 - bit code is slower than 32 - bit code .
" I 've heard this from a lot of people , " Manson said .
" And the reason those people seem absolutely convinced of this is that the pointers are twice as large , and all of a sudden you 're taking up between one and two megs of memory ... and now that you 're using more memory , your code is n't going to fit into the L1 and L2 cache , which will slow down your code . "
But this scenario does n't always manifest in the x86 world , he said , because 64 - bit code has twice as many registers , so there 's less register spillage , and you can have longer pipelines in your processor .
So code that is very intensive in terms of registers and integer performance can be a lot faster in 64 - bit .
Number three : thread context switching is expensive .
In the Linux 2.6 NPTL library , which is where Tyma and Manson ran their tests , context switching was not expensive at all .
Even with a thousand threads competing for Core Duo CPU cycles , the context - switching was n't even noticeable .
Number four : locking is expensive .
If they 're uncontended , no .
Uncontended synchronization is cheap , and can even be free .
Add a thread , and that picture changes .
Synchronized locking with contention gets more expensive ; the cost goes up significantly .
But increase the number of threads , and the cost does n't change much after that , Tyma noted .
" So yes , contended synchronization does cost more , but [ that cost ] does n't tend to scale , " he said .
" The moral here , " said Manson , " is do n't avoid synchronization .
When doing tricky things to avoid synchronization , you end up writing really bad code . "
So what 's Tyma and Manson 's bottom - line advice to developers seeking to write faster Java code ?
" If you want your code to be faster , do n't waste your time trying to take advantage of any of these kinds of performance myths , " Manson said .
" Just write the best code you can .
Profile it to find the bottlenecks .
Remove the bottlenecks .
Rinse and repeat . "
You can read Manson 's summarized takeaways here . ®
[ The following is an exact transcript of this podcast . ]
A team of Finnish and American geneticists has found that that , for some people at least , music is in their genes .
In what the researchers called the first study of its kind , they found specific regions of chromosomes that were connected to musical ability .
The report appeared in the Journal of Medical Genetics .
The tax rebate of 2008 , which is scheduled to begin this week when the first checks go into the mail , is the latest example of American mercantilism in action .
I did my best to explain American mercantilism in the April 26 issue of Gary North ’s Reality Check .
There , I explained modern Keynesian economics as the American version of mercantilism .
My article , “ Climbing of China ’s Paper Money Tiger , ” warned that the United States has adopted the Keynesian version of mercantilism : national consumption without production .
It is a perfect match for China ’s more traditional mercantilism , national production without consumption .
You can read my analysis here .
While I do my best to make economics clear , I am no match for America ’s most beloved retired humorist , Dave Barry .
Breaking his book royalty - based silence , he has offered a stunningly brilliant insight into the likely economic effects of the 2008 tax rebate , which is called an Economic Stimulus Payment .
I can do no better than to quote him verbatim .
Q. What is an Economic Stimulus Payment ?
A . It is money that the federal government will send to taxpayers .
Q. Where will the government get this money ?
A. From taxpayers .
Q . So the government is giving me back my own money ?
A . Only a smidgen .
Q. What is the purpose of this payment ?
A . The plan is that you will use the money to purchase a high - definition TV set , thus stimulating the economy .
Q. But is n’t that stimulating the economy of China ?
A. Shut up .
In presenting this analysis , he offered neither a graph nor an equation .
He will therefore not receive the 2009 Nobel Prize in Economic Science and the $ 1.6 million economic stimulus payment it brings .
But his analysis , I predict , will turn out to be far more relevant and unquestionably more coherent than any analysis ever offered by next year ’s prize winner .
GOOD NEWS AND BAD NEWS
The good news is that the Federal government is sending a little tax - free money back to us .
Never look a gift horse in the mouth , especially when it ’s coming from the horse thief who stole it from you .
The bad news is that this money will be borrowed .
Every penny will be added to the on - budget debt of the United States government .
What is the estimated deficit today for fiscal 2008 ?
This figure is buried in the recently released report , “ The Cyclically Adjusted and Standardized Budget Estimates ” ( April 2008 ) .
The figure is $ 361 billion .
A year ago , it was $ 162 billion ( Table 1 , p. 3 ) .
Next year , the CBO estimates , the deficit will be a mere $ 133 billion .
Write that figure down in your diary of accounting illusions .
( The phrase “ Arthur Andersen ” comes to mind . )
On March 12 , the Treasury made its estimate : $ 410 billion .
This was the same as in February .
These are large figures .
We are only in the early stage of a recession .
It has barely begun to raise the unemployment rate .
Yet consumer confidence is at the lowest level since the recession of 1982 ( Reuters / University of Michigan Surveys of Consumers ) .
Recall that 1982 was the year of the low point of the Dow : 777 ( August ) .
Today ’s loss of confidence has not yet affected the stock market significantly .
Optimism still reigns among most stock market investors .
As the deficit soars , which it will , the government will absorb more resources that would have gone into the private sector .
This is denied by Keynesians and some monetarists , but this process is obvious .
In a recession , investors seek safety .
They want to protect themselves against falling stocks and bankrupt corporations .
They buy Federal government - issued debt on the assumption that the Federal government will not default in a recession .
This money does not go to fund private capital .
This is bad for the economy but good — in the short run — for investors .
Because the government is involved , we get the reverse of Bernard Mandeville ’s pathbreaking book and poem , Fable of the Bees : Private Vices , Public Benefits ( 1714 ) .
We get private benefits and public vices .
PRIVATE SPENDING
I am in favor of tax - free rebates from the Federal government — any time , any place , any amount .
Just send out the checks .
The taxpayers can do better things with their money than the Federal government can .
So , I am in favor of Federal deficits , if the alternative is higher taxes .
I am in favor of lower taxes , even if these lead to higher deficits .
I think the Federal government will not cut spending for any reason but one : bankruptcy .
So , as long as the beast is going to spend money , it might as well raise it by borrowing .
Let the people who trust the government wind up as creditors to the government .
When the government defaults , one way or the other , those hurt most will be those who trusted politicians the most .
This is as it should be .
There is a kind of raw justice in the arrangement .
The assumption of the politicians and Keynesian economists is that what is needed is consumer spending .
But why should n’t taxpayers put their money into savings ?
Why not fund the private sector ?
The hostility of Keynesians to thrift is legendary .
They believe that consumption stimulates the economy .
They ignore what economists had argued for two centuries before Keynes ( except for Mandeville , a dentist ) : ( 1 ) consumption comes from prior production ; ( 2 ) production comes from an increased supply of capital ; ( 3 ) so , an increase in the supply of capital leads to increased consumption .
Will the rebate recipients save most of the money ?
Probably not .
They will pay their bills .
The best we can reasonably hope for is that they pay off their credit card debt or other forms of non-mortgage debt .
This will get them out of the habit of borrowing to buy consumer goods .
But people today are emotional Keynesians , even if they have never heard of Keynes .
They believe in spending their way to wealth .
The politicians know their marks .
They assume that a large percentage of voters will use this money to buy consumer goods and services .
They assume , as Keynesians always assume , that consumer spending will stimulate the U.S. economy .
This will provide profits for retailers .
It will convince producers to produce even more .
But why should producers produce any more ?
This is a one - shot rebate .
Spending will reduce inventories of unsold goods , but it will not convince producers to order more raw materials , hire more workers , or cut back on their cutbacks .
Retailers around the country are offering deals for shoppers with a little extra money in their bank accounts .
How much money are we talking about ?
In total , about $ 106 billion .
The expectation is that over $ 40 billion will go directly into the retail sector .
To imagine that this will in some significant way roll back the recession is grasping at economic straws .
But the vote was mainly about grasping at political straws .
It was one more example of politicians ’ unwillingness to sit there and do nothing , meaning spend nothing .
This , they will not do .
They did not want to go into the November election with a target on each of their backs : “ He did nothing to fight the recession . ”
WHAT TO DO WITH THE MONEY
On March 8 , I sent out this report in my weekly “ Tip of the Week . ”
What is the best thing to do with your income tax refund , i.e. , the return of your enforced , interest - free “ loan ” to the U.S. Treasury ?
If you have any credit card debt , pay off principal .
If you have no credit card debt , pay down some other debt , other than your mortgage .
If you have no debt to pay down , make a contribution to your IRA .
If you are maxed out on your IRA , set the money aside in a special bank account for your next car repair or new tires .
This way , you can avoid charging this to your credit card .
If you can get an extra year out of your car , you can defer purchasing a new car for another year .
( Do this for the next five years .
Then buy a used car . )
What you should not do is use any of the money to fund a consumer purchase .
The money should be used to pay down non -tax - deductible debt , if you have any , or increase a thrift account .
I realize that this is n’t much fun .
But recessions are not much fun except for entrepreneurs with cash reserves who buy distressed property .
CONCLUSION
Keynes was wrong .
What we need is less government spending .
But since we ’re not going to get it , no matter what we do or how we vote , let ’s give Keynesian politicians two cheers for the rebate .
The money is better in our bank accounts than the government ’s bank account .
The government will spend every dime that comes in .
It is buying votes , and it is always in that market spending whatever it can beg , borrow , or steal .
We will spend the money , too .
The question is : On what ?
On the future .
Fifty years ago , Mort Sahl revolutionized American comedy with his album , The Future Lies Ahead .
He could have easily gotten his basic idea across with the addition of a colon : The Future : Lies Ahead .
The biggest lie of all is that the government is competent to spend our money better than we can .
So , enjoy your rebate .
Do something useful with it .
Save it .

A severed " foot " in a running shoe found in Canada 's British Columbia is not human , the province 's coroners service says .
It said the remains found near Campbell River on Vancouver Island on Wednesday belonged to an animal , describing the hoax as " reprehensible " .
Five human feet in shoes have been found in the area since last August .
All but one were right feet .
Police have not reached any conclusions on the origins of the feet .
' Skeletonised animal paw '
The latest find was on Wednesday when a woman collecting rocks spotted a shoe - clad foot on a beach .
This type of hoax is reprehensible and very disrespectful to the families of missing persons
British Columbia 's Coroners Service Another woman , who manages a tourist campground at Campbell River , a fishing town on Vancouver Island , accompanied her to the spot .
" I could see two white bones sticking out of a black sneaker , " Sandra Malone told the National Post newspaper .
" It was definitely severed , like it had been sawn off . "
But British Columbia Coroners Service ( BCCS ) later said the remains belonged to an animal .
" The coroners service , a forensic pathologist and an anthropologist have all examined the shoe and remains , and determined a skeletonised animal paw was inserted into the shoe with a sock and packed with dried seaweed , " it said in a statement .
" It is the position of BCCS that this type of hoax is reprehensible and very disrespectful to the families of missing persons .
" It fuels inappropriate speculation and creates undue anxiety for families and communities while wasting valuable investigative time and resources that could be spent on the main investigations , " BCCS said .
Gruesome finds
On Monday , a human foot was found on another island off Vancouver .
Like the previous four , it is believed to have become detached at the ankle , in a process called disarticulation .
Forensic scientists say it is not unusual for body parts to become separated after they have been in the water for a long time .
Running shoes help to preserve the remains and because the soles are buoyant , the feet are brought to the surface .
Last August , two human feet washed up on the beaches of small islands off Vancouver .
Then in February a third single right foot drifted ashore .
The fourth foot was discovered on a beach in suburban Vancouver in May .
Investigators are looking at the cases individually but are also trying to establish if there any links .
Forensics teams are taking DNA samples and police are also trying to find out who made the shoes and where they were sold .
But with so little concrete information , theories abound .
Organised crime , boating accidents , even the 2004 Asian tsunami are all being offered as possible explanations .

What are these ?
Reprinted from Uncle John's Bathroom Reader : Fast - Acting Long -Lasting .
" It was the best of times , it was the worst of times , it was the age of wisdom , it was the age of foolishness ... " wrote Charles Dickens , whose life was a rich mixture of all of the above .
Here are the 8 odd facts about the novelist : WHAT THE DICKENS ?
Charles Dickens was the first literary superstar - his popular works reached a wider audience than any writer before him .
With classics like Oliver Twist , A Christmas Carol , Great Expectations , A Tale of Two Cities , and David Copperfield , Dickens dominated the literary life of 19th - century England and the United States .
But like many remarkable people , Dickens was a complex , multi- layered individual , full of peculiar quirks and odd habits .
• OBSESSIVE - COMPULSIVE .
Dickens was preoccupied with looking in the mirror and combing his hair - he did it hundreds of times a day .
He rearranged furniture in his home - if it was n't in the exact " correct " position , he could n't concentrate .
Obsessed with magnetic fields , Dickens made sure that every bed he slept in was aligned north - south .
He had to touch certain objects three times for luck .
He was obsessed with the need for tidiness , often cleaning other homes as well as his own .
• NICKNAME -IAC .
Just as some of his most endearing characters had odd nicknames ( like Pip in Great Expectations ) , Dickens gave every one of his ten children nicknames like " Skittles " and " Plorn . " • EPILEPTIC .
Dickens suffered from epilepsy and made some of his characters - like Oliver Twist 's brother - epileptics .
Modern doctors are amazed at the medical accuracy of his descriptions of this malady .
• PRACTICAL JOKER .
Dicken 's study had a secret door designed to look like a bookcase .
The shelves were full of fake books with witty titles , such as Noah 's Arkitecture and a nine - volume set titled Cat 's Lives .
One of his favorites was a multi-volume series called The Wisdom of Our Ancestors , dealing with subjects like ignorance , superstition , disease , and instruments of torture , and a companion book titled The Virtues of Our Ancestors , which was so narrow that the title had to be printed vertically .
• EGOMANIAC .
Dickens often referred to himself as " the Sparkler of Albion , " favorably comparing himself to Shakespeare 's nickname , " the Bard of Avon . "
( Albion is an archaic name for England . ) • FAIR - WEATHER FRIEND .
Hans Christian Andersen was Dicken 's close friend and mutual influence .
Andersen even dedicated his book Poet 's Day Dream to Dickens in 1853 .
But this did n't stop Dickens from letting Andersen know when he'd overstayed his welcome at Dickens 's home .
He printed a sign and left it on Andersen 's mirror in the guest room .
It read : " Hans Andersen slept in this room for five weeks , which seemed to the family like AGES . " • MESMERIST .
Dickens was a devotee of mesmerism , a system of healing through hypnotism .
He practiced it on his hypochondriac wife and his children , and claimed to have healed several friends and associates .
• CLIFF -HANGER .
When The Old Curiosity Shop was published in serial form in 1841 , readers all over Britain and the United States followed the progress of the heroine , Little Nell , with the same fervor that audiences today follow Harry Potter .
When the ship carrying the last installment approached the dock in New York , 6,000 impatient fans onshore called out to the sailors , " Does Little Nell die ? "
( They yelled back that ... uh - oh , we 're out of room . )
WASHINGTON ( AP ) 
The government is hiring so many new air traffic controllers to replace departing veterans that it cannot efficiently train them , an inspector general reported Tuesday .
The Transportation Department 's inspector general said the Federal Aviation Administration is so swamped with new hires that it has exceeded its own maximum trainee numbers at 22 % of its 314 air control facilities .
The FAA uses a database replete with erroneous information to manage the training program and has failed to implement remedial steps the agency itself promised in 2004 , the IG report added .
Even inside the FAA , it was n't clear who was in charge because four vice presidents at FAA headquarters have authority over some part of hiring and training controllers .
" Facility managers , training managers and even headquarters officials were unable to tell us who or what office was ultimately responsible for facility training , " the IG report said .
In a written response , the FAA accepted most of the IG 's recommendations .
But the FAA rejected the idea of making public an accurate count each year of how many fully certified controllers and how many trainees work in each of its facilities .
Noting the figures change frequently , the FAA said , " Publishing annual static snapshots of total trainees by facility will be of little meaningful use . "
The FAA has known for decades it would have to replace a major portion of its work force during a few years early in the 21st century because President Reagan fired 10,438 controllers in 1981 .
After Reagan broke an earlier controllers union during that contract dispute , replacements were hired over a few ensuing years .
The FAA began issuing plans for this hiring surge in 2004 and earlier this year said it expects to hire 17,000 controllers through 2017 .
But the FAA has consistently underestimated how many controllers would retire or quit since the fall of 2006 when the Bush administration declared an impasse in contract negotiations .
The FAA imposed new work rules , a 30 % cut in starting pay , a freeze on base pay of current controllers and elimination of their premium pay opportunities .
The IG 's report said the imposed contract cut top pay from $ 143,984 to $ 106,200 and starting pay from $ 44,800 to $ 37,800 .
" This report is vindication , " said Patrick Forrey , president of the National Air Traffic Controllers Association .
" Three years ago we urged them not to impose what they did because it would exacerbate this problem they knew was coming .
With work schedules being changed daily , vacations being canceled and more time required on work positions , our veteran members are saying , ' I 'm out of here . '
Under the old contract , far fewer controllers retired as soon as they were eligible . "
Forrey said the result has eroded safety margins and increased delays in the air traffic system .
The FAA denies the system is unsafe .
The IG report said that , from 2005 through last December , to fill vacancies the FAA hired 25 % more controllers than it had expected .
As of December , there were 11.026 fully qualified controllers and 3,584 in training , compared with 12,328 veterans and 2,209 trainees in April 2004 .
New hires off the street or emerging from the FAA academy and even veteran controllers transferring to a new facility all must undergo on - the - job training to qualify to work each radar position at their new workplace .
This can take up to three years before they are fully certified to work all stations .
The FAA says that each facility can accommodate up to 35 % trainees and still control air traffic and train the new hires .
But the IG found that 70 facilities exceeded that limit last December , compared with only 22 facilities over the limit in April 2004 .
Among the 70 were the Teterboro , N.J. , tower where 52 % were trainees , Las Vegas Terminal Radar Approach Control , with 50 % trainees ; and Oakland , center , with 38 % trainees .
FAA 's hiring " is now outpacing the capabilities of many air traffic facilities to efficiently process and train new hires , " the IG said .
" Many facility managers , training officers and union officials we spoke with disagreed with the FAA 's " view that 35 % of a facility 's controllers could be trainees and instead believe trainees should not exceed 20 % to 25 % of a facility 's staff , the IG said .
The report recommended the FAA work with field managers and union officials to set optimal targets for each type of facility .
The IG also said the FAA must clean up its training database , where the investigators found such errors as : four terminals that claimed their average time to fully train a new hire was a negative number , one terminal that listed a trainee as fully certified six months before he even arrived at the facility and one control tower that showed it took almost eight years apiece to certify two trainees .
And the IG found that the FAA never fulfilled promises in 2004 to make training a priority second only to operations and to make sure that training at facilities picked up where academy instruction left off .

The media really does n't care for policy ( especially complex policy that has to be explained ) , but they love a good fight .
They will report on one even when there is n't much of a fight anymore ( and do n't ever ask them to referee , because they 'll not call one until it 's way too late to matter ) .
Given the current situation , we still have an amazing amount of IOKIYAR ( it 's okay if you 're a Republican ) , the thinking that allows McCain to not know his Shi'a from his Sunni and yet have his demonstrated foreign policy ignorance and indifference ignored because ' everyone knows '
McCain and Republicans are strong on foreign policy , even though as it happens Biden or Richardson know more about that topic than the entire Republican party candidate list combined – but that does n't fit the narrative , so no one talks about it ) .
And , btw , if you think that 's exaggerating , where was the press as we were getting into Iraq at the behest of another Republican who was known to be just as ignorant and indifferent to facts ?
And by the way , Bush is still a foreign policy moron ( Bush erroneously says Iran announced desire for nuclear weapons ) , but IOKIYAR .
As for analysis , well , forget broadcast media for that .
Takes too much time ( and spoils the narrative ) .
Print media is much better at it , but there 's way too much horse race these days and not enough coverage of fundamentals ( like how bad the economy really is ) .
Well , here are some fundamentals to chew on .
Latest House Retirement Leaves GOP Reeling
In his old role as chairman of the National Republican Congressional Committee , Rep. Tom Reynolds ( N.Y. ) often cajoled wavering Republicans into running for re-election .
Back home in his district Thursday afternoon , Reynolds announced that he wo n't be running again himself .
Consider it a sign of how the House GOP views its prospects for November .
Hey , it 's not just the candidates that want nothing to do with the tarnished , corrupt , competence free Larry Craig Republican party of the 21st century , it 's the people .
Pew has a fascinating trend poll that bodes ill for the shrinking number of Republicans in November .
The balance of party identification in the American electorate now favors the Democratic Party by a decidedly larger margin than in either of the two previous presidential election cycles .
In 5,566 interviews with registered voters conducted by the Pew Research Center for the People & the Press during the first two months of 2008 , 36 % identify themselves as Democrats , and just 27 % as Republicans .
The share of voters who call themselves Republicans has declined by six points since 2004 , and represents , on an annualized basis , the lowest percentage of self - identified Republican voters in 16 years of polling by the Center .
The Democratic Party has also built a substantial edge among independent voters .
Of the 37 % who claim no party identification , 15 % lean Democratic , 10 % lean Republican , and 12 % have no leaning either way .
By comparison , in 2004 about equal numbers of independents leaned toward both parties .
When " leaners " are combined with partisans , however , the Democratic Party now holds a 14 - point advantage among voters nationwide ( 51 % Dem / lean - Dem to 37 % Rep / lean - Rep ) , up from a three - point advantage four years ago .
Despite these trends , the proportion of voters who identify with the Democratic Party outright has not increased in recent years .
Currently , 36 % say they think of themselves as a Democrat , virtually unchanged from 2004 ( 35 % ) and 2000 ( 35 % ) .
Instead , as the proportion of self - identified Republicans has decreased , the percentage of independents has grown substantially , from 32 % in 2004 to 37 % today .
What everyone ought to realize is that when Bush , or McCain ( or Buchanan and Scarborough ) play for their base , it 's a shrinking base .
People do n't jump from one party to another .
When they 're unhappy with Republicans , they become proud independents .
And Karl Rove 's wet dream of base politics and playing only to the base is dead .
The decline in the number of self - identified Republicans is evident in all parts of the country , but is perhaps most significant in the politically important " swing " states that were closely contested in the 2004 presidential election ( see " How the States are Analyzed " below ) .
Four years ago there were about as many Democrats ( 35 % ) as Republicans ( 33 % ) in the 12 states where the voting was closest in 2004 , and the balance was similar in the 2000 election cycle .
But so far in 2008 , Democrats hold a substantial 38 % to 27 % identification advantage in these states .
Now we know this does n't predict victory in 2008 .
Whether the Republican losses in these swing states will translate into an electoral advantage for Democrats remains uncertain .
There is not a one - to - one correspondence between the balance of party identification in a given state and the electoral outcome in presidential elections .
But it does bode well for the foundation , and it also suggests that slanting stories to favor and cover up lazy and ill - prepared Republicans ( Lieberman had to teach McCain what Purim was in an Israel trip ) has a limit .
The viewing and reading audience is n't what it once was .
Republicans are a distinct and fading minority .
And as for Iraq ?
As Joe Galloway notes :
Some may find cause for celebration in the partial successes achieved in Iraq , but I have a nervous feeling that those celebrating are the same people who are comforted by the knowledge that President Bush and his appointees are working overtime to contain the damage done by that little setback in our economy .
Add a recession , and Republicans like Reynolds are right to get out while they can .
So what you can do is pay less attention to horse race polls and pay more attention to fundamentals .
The race has n't started yet and Obama is n't yet the official nominee .
And once he is , ( sorry , but Hillary can't win ) the election is going to be decided by independents in November because no one wants to be a Republican .
GENEVA ( Reuters ) - China is drawing on natural resources such as farm land , timber and water twice as fast as they can be renewed in its drive for development , a report from Chinese and international environmentalists said on Tuesday .
The report said the next 20 years would be critical to correct the situation and put the Asian giant ’s burgeoning economy , with a rapidly growing population , on to a sustainable path .
“ China ’s average ecological footprint has doubled since the 1960s and now demands more than two times what the country ’s ecosystems can sustainably supply , ” said a summary of the report , issued by the Swiss - based WWF International .
It said China ’s “ footprint ” -- a measure of how much productive land and inland water resources are used up to satisfy the average current lifestyle of each member of the population -- was running at 1.6 hectares per person .
This suggested that for China ’s current 1.2 billion people -- one sixth of the world population -- to sustain this rate , it would need to either double the land and water area it uses or cut back to nearer the available 0.8 hectares per person .
The report was commissioned jointly by the WWF , formerly the World Wide Fund for Nature , and the China Council for International Cooperation on Environment and Development ( CCICED ) in Beijing .
CHINESE EXPERTS
It was drawn up with the help of Chinese experts by a U.S. - based group , the Global Footprint Network , which works with the WWF to produce reports on the global , regional and national ecological impact of use of resources .
The Network reported with the WWF on Monday that many African countries were running down their natural resources in the drive for development as their populations grow , but were still using only 1.1 hectares per head , compared with the 1.3 hectares available .
It said the global average footprint was 2.2 hectares per head -- significantly more than the 1.8 hectares available .
By 2050 , the whole world ’s current rate of drawing on natural resources and disposing of waste will require an entire extra planet , Monday ’s report said .
CCICED Secretary General Zhu Guangyao , an author of the later study , “ Report on Ecological Footprint in China ” , was quoted by WWF as saying the next 20 years would be “ a critical period ... for China to realize sustainable development ” .
WWF said the report presented two strategies to tackle the Chinese problem , starting with “ easy ” and “ slow ” measures that would be simple , cheap and popular , such as investing in clean technology and changing to energy - efficient light bulbs .
After that , it said , China could implement a wider approach focusing on compact urban development , individual action , reducing hidden waste flows , carbon reduction strategies , land management and efficiency increases .

If a study of 18,225 American men ( health professionals ) age 40 — 75 years is reflective of the entire population of middle - aged males , three - quarters of adult males in the U.S. face a doubling of their risk for a heart attack due to low vitamin D levels .
A vitamin D deficiency is far more predictive of a future heart attack than cholesterol , says a report due to be published in the Archives of Internal Medicine on Monday , June 9 , 2008 .
Vitamin D deficiency is almost totally preventable with dietary supplementation .
High cholesterol combined with a vitamin D deficiency served to increase the risk of a heart attack by about 2.4 times , but a vitamin D deficiency alone accounted for 2.0 times of that risk , or 83 % of the increased risk .
The study compared men with vitamin D levels at or below 15 nanograms of vitamin D per milliliter of blood ( 37.4 nanomoles per liter ) to men with vitamin D levels above 30 nanograms per milliliter ( 74.8 nanomoles per liter ) .
Men with a low ( less than 15 nanograms / milliliter ) level of vitamin D would need about 3000 international units ( IU ) of supplemental vitamin D3 per day to reach a 30 nanogram blood concentration , say study researchers .
Most multivitamins provide a paltry 400 IU of vitamin D .
Men in the study group averaged 200 — 205 total cholesterol , which is considered a healthy range .
Most of the decreased risk for a heart attack among men who had higher vitamin D levels was attributed to vitamin D’s ability to prevent arterial calcification , not cholesterol plaque .
Researchers at the Institute of Physical Medicine , University Hospital Zurich , Zurich , Switzerland , cite that vitamin D has widespread health benefits ( reduced risk for falls , admission to nursing homes , fractures , cancer prevention , less high blood pressure and even fewer dental cavities ) , with the most advantageous serum levels at least 30 nanograms per milliliter ( 75 nanomoles / liter ) , with a higher optimal range for cancer prevention , 36 — 48 nanograms / milliliter ( 90 — 120 nanomole / liter ) .
[ Advances Experimental Medicine Biology 624 : 55 — 71 , 2008 ]
This translates to more than the suggested 3000 IU in the Archives of Internal Medicine study .
This study means the Recommended Daily Allowance ( RDA ) for vitamin D is woefully inadequate , particularly for a population that is being advised to avoid midday sun exposure because of risks for skin cancer .
Most natural vitamin D is produced in the skin upon exposure to solar ultraviolet radiation .
( It takes about 18 minutes of total - body midday summer sun exposure to produce 3000 IU of natural vitamin D3 . )
Furthermore , many Americans falsely believe their diet , or fortified milk , provides sufficient amounts of vitamin D .
This study also indicts public health authorities for being remiss in re-establishing a higher RDA for vitamin D , an essential vitamin discovered by Professor Edward Mellanby in 1922 .
The millions of lives lost due to a common vitamin D deficiency is a failure that is indefensible .
Anytime in the past 8 decades this increased risk could have been identified .
Instead , modern medicine chose to combat heart attacks with near useless statin drugs .
According to Dr. John Abramson of Harvard Medical School , statin drugs have not been shown to reduce the risk for a mortal heart attack .
[ Lancet 2007 Jan 20 ; 369( 9557 ) : 168—9 ]
The Therapeutics Letter says statin drugs like Lipitor prevent only 1 non-mortal heart attack for every 70 healthy adults taking a statin drug for prevention .
[ Therapeutics Letter 2003 ; 48:1—2 ]
According to the US Census Bureau , there are about 37 million men age 45 — 64 , who fall within the age group in this study .
Each year , approximately 543,000 men suffer heart attacks .

Whenever I lose my watch , I take my sweet time to get a new one .
I savor the freedom from my compulsion to carve my days into minute - size fragments .
But my liberty has its limits .
Even if I get rid of the clock strapped to my wrist , I can not escape the one in my head .
The human brain keeps time , from the flicker of milliseconds to the languorous unfurling of hours and days and years .
It ’s the product of hundreds of millions of years of evolution .
Keeping track of time is essential for perceiving what ’s happening around us and responding to it .
In order to tell where a voice is coming from , we time how long it takes for the sound to reach both ears .
And when we respond to the voice by speaking ourselves , we need precise timing to make ourselves understood .
Our muscles in the mouth , tongue , and throat must all twitch in carefully timed choreography .
It ’s just a brief pause that makes the difference between “ Excuse me while I kiss the sky ” and “ Excuse me while I kiss this guy . ”
Scientists are finding that telling time is also important to animals .
At the University of Edinburgh , researchers built fake flowers with sugar inside to reveal how hummingbirds tell time .
After hummingbirds drink nectar from real flowers , it takes time for the flowers to replenish their supply .
The Scottish researchers refilled some of their fake flowers every 10 minutes and others every 20 .
Hummingbirds quickly learned just how long they had to wait before coming back to each kind .
Scientists at the University of Georgia have discovered that rats do an excellent job of telling time too .
They can be conditioned to wait two days after a meal to poke their noses into a trough and be rewarded with food .
For 40 years , psychologists thought that humans and animals kept time with a biological version of a stopwatch .
Somewhere in the brain , a regular series of pulses was being generated .
When the brain needed to time some event , a gate opened and the pulses moved into some kind of counting device .
One reason this clock model was so compelling : Psychologists could use it to explain how our perception of time changes .
Think about how your feeling of time slows down as you see a car crash on the road ahead , how it speeds up when you ’re wheeling around a dance floor in love .
Psychologists argued that these experiences tweaked the pulse generator , speeding up the flow of pulses or slowing it down .
But the fact is that the biology of the brain just does n’t work like the clocks we ’re familiar with .
Neurons can do a good job of producing a steady series of pulses .
They do n’t have what it takes to count pulses accurately for seconds or minutes or more .
The mistakes we make in telling time also raise doubts about the clock models .
If our brains really did work that way , we ought to do a better job of estimating long periods of time than short ones .
Any individual pulse from the hypothetical clock would be a little bit slow or fast .
Over a short time , the brain would accumulate just a few pulses , and so the error could be significant .
The many pulses that pile up over long stretches of time should cancel their errors out .
Unfortunately , that ’s not the case .
As we estimate longer stretches of time , the range of errors gets bigger as well .
Click clock
These days , new kinds of experiments using everything from computer simulations to brain scans to genetically engineered mice are helping unlock the nature of mental time .
And their results show that the brain does not use a single stopwatch .
Instead , it has several ways to tell time , and none of them seems to work like a conventional clock .
Dean Buonomano , a neuroscientist at UCLA , argues that in order to perceive time in fractions of a second , our brains tell time as if they were observing ripples on a pond .
Let ’s say you are listening to a chirping bird .
Two of its chirps are separated by a tenth of a second .
The first chirp triggers a spike of voltage in some auditory neurons , which in turn causes some other neurons to fire as well .
The signals reverberate among the neurons for about half a second , just as it takes time for the ripples from a rock thrown into a pond to disappear .
When the second chirp comes , the neurons have not yet settled down .
As a result , the second chirp creates a different pattern of signals .
Buonomano argues that our brains can compare the second pattern to the first to tell how much time has passed .
The brain needs no clock because time is encoded in the way neurons behave .
If Buonomano turns out to be right , he will have explained only our fastest time telling , because after half a second , the brain ’s ripples dissipate .
On the scale of seconds to hours , the brain must use some other strategy .
Warren Meck of Duke University argues that the brain measures long stretches of time by producing pulses .
But the brain does not then count the pulses in the way a clock does .
Instead , Meck suspects , it does something more elegant .
It listens to the pulses as if they were music .
Meck first began to develop his musical model when he discovered how to rob rats of their perception of time .
He had only to destroy certain clumps of neurons deep inside the brain .
Some of these neurons , known as medium spiny neurons , are unlike any other neurons in the brain .
Each one is linked to as many as 30,000 other neurons .
And those linked neurons can be found throughout the cortex , the outer rind of the brain that handles much of the brain ’s most sophisticated information processing .
Certain neurons come from regions that handle vision , others from areas that apply rules to what we perceive , and so on .
By receiving so many signals from all over the brain , Meck believes , the medium spiny neurons give us a sense of time .
Imagine you are listening to a 10 - second tone .
At the beginning of the tone , neurons around your cortex reset themselves , so that they all begin to fire in sync .
But some fire faster than others , and so at any moment some are active and some are quiet .
From one moment to the next , a medium spiny neuron receives a unique pattern of signals from the neurons that link to it .
The pattern changes like chords on a piano .
When the 10 seconds are over , the medium spiny neuron can simply “ listen ” to the chord to tell how much time has passed .
Meck has found support for his model by recording the electrical activities of neurons and in other researchers ’ studies on people with a skewed sense of time .
Certain neurotransmitters , such as dopamine , control pulsing neurons .
Drugs such as cocaine and methamphetamine alter the brain by flooding it with dopamine , and studies have shown that they also change the second - to - second perception of time .
In one experiment at UCLA , reported in 2007 , scientists rang a bell after 53 seconds of silence .
Healthy people estimated on average that 67 seconds had passed .
Stimulant addicts guessed 91 seconds .
Other drugs have the opposite effect on dopamine and compress the subjective experience of time .
In real time
Even in a healthy brain , time is elastic .
Staring at an angry face for five seconds feels longer than staring at a neutral one .
It may be no coincidence that the pulse - generating neurons are directly wired into regions of the brain that handle emotionally charged sights and sounds .
And recent experiments by Amelia Hunt at Harvard University hint that we may actually backdate our mental time line every time we move our eyes .
Recently , Hunt had people stare straight ahead with a ticking clock off to one side .
She asked people to move their eyes over to the clock and make a note of the time when they had done so .
On average , they reported seeing the clock about four hundredths of a second before their eyes actually arrived there .
Moving time backward may actually serve us well , by letting us cope with an imperfect nervous system .
Each of our retinas has a small patch of densely packed , light - sensitive cells called the fovea .
In order to get a detailed picture of our surroundings , we have to jerk our eyes around several times a second so that the fovea can scan them .
On its own , this stream of signals from our eyes would produce a jarring series of jump cuts .
Our brains manufacture the illusion of a seamless flow of reality .
In the course of that editing , we may need to fudge the time line — both in anticipation of an event and after the fact .
But the most radical reworking of time may come as we inscribe it in our memories .
We recall not just what happened but when .
We can recall how much time has passed since an event occurred by tapping into our memories .
Injuries and surgeries that destroy a particular part of the brain can give some hints about how the brain records time in memory .
French scientists in 2007 reported their study of a group of patients who had suffered damage to a region known as the left temporal lobe .
The patients watched a documentary , and a familiar object appeared on the screen , then reappeared a few minutes later .
The patients had to guess how much time had passed .
On average , the patients thought an 8 - minute period was roughly 13 .
( Normal subjects were off by only about a minute . )
These experiments are helping scientists zero in on the regions of the brain that store memories of time .
Exactly how those regions record time is still mysterious .
It ’s one thing to listen in on the brain ’s music , recognizing chords that mark the passage of five minutes .
But how do the brain ’s memory - related neurons then archive those five minutes so that they can be recalled later ?
File - save , file - open
At Humboldt University of Berlin in Ger­many , scientists have been building a model of how memory may store time .
When neurons produce a regular cycle of signals , some signals come a little sooner and some come a little later .
The researchers propose that as neurons pass these signals along , they can add tiny advances , some bigger than others .
With these tiny wobbles , the brain can compress memories of time from several seconds down to hundredths of a second — a small enough package to store for later retrieval .
As it stores time in memories , the brain may alter it in another way that is even more radical .
It may record time so that our brains recall events in backward order .
Scientists at MIT discovered reverse memories in an experiment on rats .
They had rats run down a track and then stop to eat food at the end .
When rats ( and humans ) become more familiar with a place , individual neurons start becoming active when the rats reach particular spots .
The scientists identified “ place cells ” that fired when the rats moved to different spots along the track .
When the rats stopped to eat , the scientists eavesdropped on their brains again .
They heard the place neurons fire again — probably as the memories of the track were becoming stronger in the rat brain .

How far will the right - wing blogosphere go to promote the meme that Obama is “ gaffe - prone ” ( I know , I know , stop laughing .
They did support George Bush unflinchingly for eight years ) ?
This far :
Buchenwald , on the other hand , while atrocious beyond normal human understanding , was merely a slave labor camp , and not historically abnormal in a time of war .
The people who died there did so under the stress of work and disease , rather than as a deliberate attempt to wipe them off the planet .
Which , of course , says much more about human nature and history than it does about the Nazis .
Buchenwald , as described by Wikipedia :
Buchenwald concentration camp was a Nazi concentration camp established on the Ettersberg ( Etter Mountain ) near Weimar , Thuringia , Germany ( at the time , Nazi Germany ) , in July 1937 , and one of the largest such camps on German soil .
*** Buchenwald ( German : “ beech forest ” ) was chosen as the name for the camp because of the close ties of the location to Goethe , who was being idealized as “ the embodiment of the German Spirit ” ( Verkörperung des deutschen Geistes ) .
The Goethe Eiche ( Goethe ’s Oak ) stood inside the camp ’s perimeter , [ 2 ] [ 3 ] and the stump of the tree is preserved as part of the memorial at KZ Buchenwald .
Similarly , the camp could not be named for another town nearby ( Hottelstedt ) because of administrative considerations ( it would have resulted in a lower pay grade for the camp ’s Schutzstaffel ( SS ) guards ) .[ citation needed ]
Between July 1937 and April 1945 , some 250,000 people were incarcerated in Buchenwald by the Nazi regime , including 168 Western Allied POWs .
One estimate places the number of deaths in Buchenwald at 56,000 ( discussed further below ) .
The Jewish Virtual Libary places the death toll at 33,462 .
The Jewish Virtual Library also tells us this took place at Buchenwald :
In or about December 1943 , and in or about October 1944 , experiments were conducted at the Buchenwald concentration camp to investigate the effect of various poisons upon human beings .
The poisons were secretly administered to experimental subjects in their food .
The victims died as a result of the poison or were killed immediately in order to permit autopsies .
In or about September 1944 experimental subjects were shot with poison bullets and suffered torture and death .
The defendants Genzken , Gebhardt , Mrugowsky , and Poppendick are charged with special responsibility for and participation in these crimes
And this :
From about November 1943 to about January 1944 experiments were conducted at the Buchenwald concentration camp to test the effect of various pharmaceutical preparations on phosphorous burns .
These burns were inflicted on experimental subjects with phosphorous matter taken from incendiary bombs , and caused severe pain , suffering , and serious bodily injury .
The defendants Genzken , Gebhardt , Mrugowsky , and Poppendick are charged with special responsibility for and participation in these crimes .
And here is some more background on Ohrdurf , the labor camp that was the sub-camp of Buchenwald that Obama ’s relative helped to liberate , here , including this picture :
Prisoner corpses at Ohrdurf , although not as bad as Auschwitz .
Prisoner corpses at Ohrdurf , although not as bad as Auschwitz .
Corpses sprinkled with lime and stacked like wood , but note - not as bad as Auschwitz .
So basically , Obama ’s relative helped to liberate a forced labor camp attached to Buchenwald , with approximately 33,000 - 56,000 deaths , forced medical experiments , chemical weapons experiments , BUT IT WAS NOT AS BAD AS AUSCHWITZ .
This is going to be the longest , sickest election year ever .

A widespread Arctic melt would have major impacts on wildlife
Arctic sea ice is melting even faster than last year , despite a cold winter .
Data from the US National Snow and Ice Data Center ( NSIDC ) shows that the year began with ice covering a larger area than at the beginning of 2007 .
But now it is down to levels seen last June , at the beginning of a summer that broke records for sea ice loss .
Scientists on the project say much of the ice is so thin as to melt easily , and the Arctic seas may be ice - free in summer within five to 10 years .
I think we 're going to beat last year 's record , though I 'd love to be wrong
Julienne Stroeve " We had a bit more ice in the winter , although we were still way below the long - term average , " said Julienne Stroeve from NSIDC in Boulder , Colorado .
" So we had a partial recovery .
But the real issue is that most of the pack ice has become really thin , and if we have a regular summer now , it can just melt away , " she told BBC News .
In March , Nasa reported that the area covered by sea ice was slightly larger than in 2007 , but much of it consisted of thin floes that had formed during the previous winter .
These are much less robust than thicker , less saline floes that have already survived for several years .
After a colder winter , ice has been melting even faster than last year
A few years ago , scientists were predicting that Arctic waters would be ice - free in summers by about 2080 .
Then computer models started projecting earlier dates , around 2030 to 2050 .
Then came the 2007 summer that saw Arctic sea ice shrink to the smallest extent ever recorded , down to 4.2 million sq km from 7.8 million sq km in 1980 .
By the end of last year , one research group was forecasting ice - free summers by 2013 .
" I think we 're going to beat last year 's record melt , though I 'd love to be wrong , " said Dr Stroeve .
" If we do , then I do n't think 2013 is far off any more .
If what we think is going to happen does happen , then it 'll be within a decade anyway . "
Rising tide Countries surrounding the Arctic are eyeing the economic opportunities that melting ice might bring .
Canada and Russia are exploring sovereignty claims over tracts of Arctic seafloor , while just this week US President George Bush has urged more oil exploration in US waters - which could point the way to exploitation of reserves off the Alaskan coast .
Summer ice cover in the Arctic has declined sharply
But from a climate point of view , the melt could bring global impacts accelerating the rate of warming and of sea level rise .
" This is a positive feedback process , " commented Dr Ian Willis , from the Scott Polar Research Institute in Cambridge .
" Sea ice has a higher albedo ( reflectivity ) than ocean water ; so as the ice melts , the water absorbs more of the Sun 's energy and warms up more , and that in turn warms the atmosphere more - including the atmosphere over the Greenland ice sheet . "
Greenland is already losing ice to the oceans , contributing to the gradual rise in sea levels .
The ice cap holds enough water to lift sea levels globally by about seven metres ( 22 ft ) if it all melted .
Natural climatic cycles such as the Arctic Oscillation play a role in year - to - year variations in ice cover .
But Julienne Stroeve believes the sea ice is now so thin that there is little chance of the melting trend turning round .
" If the ice were as thick as it was in the 1970s , last year 's conditions would have brought a dip in cover , but nothing exceptional .
" But now it 's so thin that you would have to have an exceptional sequence of cold winters and cold summers in order for it to rebuild . "

Committee report finds Abramoff influenced White House Nick Juliano
Published : Monday June 9 , 2008
|
Print This Email This Contrary to the White House 's claims , corrupt lobbyist Jack Abramoff had access to the highest reaches of the Bush administration and influenced numerous decisions within the executive branch , a draft report from the House Oversight Committee has concluded .
" The testimony and documents obtained by the Committee ... confirm that Mr. Abramoff had access to the White House , " reads the report , which was released Monday .
" Further , the record before the Committee contradicts White House claims that with respect to his White House contacts , Mr. Abramoff got ' nothing out of it . '
Not only did Mr. Abramoff achieve some positive results from his White House lobbying , but White House officials sought out the views of Mr. Abramoff and his colleagues on matters of official business . "
Abramoff was convicted in 2006 on several corruption charges related to his fraudulent dealings with Indian tribes he represented .
Fallout from revelations of Abramoff 's influence peddling rippled through Congress and contributed to several Republican lawmakers losing their seats in the Democrats ' takeover that same year .
The committee 's proposed report documents gifts that Abramoff spread around the White House , including lavish meals and expensive concert tickets .
Among the recipients of Abramoff 's largess , as TPMMuckraker notes was Carlos Bonilla , a former special assistant to President Bush for economic policy .
Bonilla is now an economic adviser for Republican presidential nominee John McCain , who conducted his own investigation of Abramoff 's shady dealings beginning in 2004 when the Arizona Senator chaired the Indian Affairs Committee .
The 35 - page Oversight Committee report documents a two - year investigation by the committee into Abramoff 's influence within the White House .
It uncovered six photographs of the corrupt lobbyist and members of his family shaking hands with President Bush ; the committee also found evidence of more than 70 previously unknown contacts between Abramoff and his associates and administration officials .
The report was issued with the approval of Oversight Committee Chairman Henry Waxman ( D - CA ) and Ranking Member Tom Davis ( R - VA ) .
The full committee is slated to mark - up the report Thursday .
Committee investigators interviewed or deposed eight Abramoff associates and administration figures and reviewed more than 20,000 pages of documents .
Several former White House officials , especially those most closely connected to Abramoff , were hesitant to speak with the committee and invoked Fifth Amendment rights against self - incrimination to avoid offering a full airing , including Susan Ralston , a former aide to Karl Rove .
As Ms. Ralstons counsel described , Ms. Ralston declined to respond to any questions about  the relationship between Jack Abramoff and his associates and White House officials , including Ms. Ralston . 
With regard to President Bush , the committee 's investigation was unable to find evidence that Abramoff " ever personally lobbied the president " or directly influenced any of Bush 's actions .
It was able to demonstrate at least a half - dozen meetings between Abramoff and Bush through the photographs of the two it received .
Abramoff 's influence of other administration officials was concentrated in areas his clients paid him to lobby , specifically protecting the interests of his clients on the Northern Marianas Islands , a US territory that has been criticized as a haven for unfair labor practices .
The committee documented Abramoff 's ability to influence staffing decisions within the Department of the Interior 's Office of Insular Affairs , which oversees island territories .
One example of the Abramoff teams access to the White House regarding the nomination process is a February 20 , 2001 , e-mail from Susan Ralston to Matt Schlapp to let him know that Jack Abramoff had called Karl Rove a few days earlier to discuss appointments at OIA .
According to this e-mail , Mr. Abramoff had heard that Esther Kiaaina was going to be considered for a position and wanted to let Karl know that he didnt think this was a good idea .
Ms. Ralston continued ,  Karl asked that you return his call .
117 Ms. Kiaaina was not appointed to a position at OIA .
Monday 's proposed report is a follow - up to an earlier Oversight Committee effort to document 's Abramoff 's reach into the White House .
Bush administration officials attempted to dismiss the committee 's earlier findings without having all the facts , according to the latest review .
After Abramoff 's conviction , the White House downplayed his influence claiming he had participated in just " a few staff - level meetings " along with attending some holiday receptions .
After the Oversight Committee 's first report , the administration conducted a more thorough review , which resulted in Ralston 's resignation , but even that review was lacking .
" [ T ]he Committees investigation has revealed that before making these public statements , " the report states , " the White House never questioned five former White House officials who were key points of contact for the Abramoff team . "

Chris Oakasaki has a blog post about teaching functional programming using Ada .
He says
Why , with excellent functional programming languages like Haskell or ML easily available , would I choose to do a functional programming project in Ada ?
( I CAN STILL HEAR YOU LAUGHING ! )
Partly because we use Ada in some courses at our institution , and I wanted a library that could help in teaching recursion to novices .
But , honestly , mostly I just wanted to see if it could be done

Asked if he still had those views , Mr. McCain said in an e-mail message that he still believed the antiwar movement had hurt the morale of some prisoners , although he added the vast majority “ performed their duty with courage and resolve irrespective of how controversy about the war influenced their view of it . ”
Image John McCain arrived at Clark Air Base in the Philippines on March 14 , 1973 .
The time he spent as a prisoner in North Vietnam helped mold his views on war policy and conduct that he discussed later in a thesis .

Associated Press
Historians , though , say his assertion that the antiwar movement weakened the resistance of Americans captured late in the war is misleading , in part because almost all the most cooperative prisoners were captured early and in part because many other cultural shifts contributed to differences in the later war captives .
And some of his fellow prisoners also question the connection between the war protests and the camp collaborators .
“ Do n’t connect those guys with the antiwar movement , ” said Orson Swindle , a prisoner who became a friend of Mr. McCain .
“ It was the guy in the next cell who was the reason we were trying so hard to uphold the code and our honor , and those guys just betrayed everything we stood for . ”
But others say it is easy to see how Mr. McCain ’s dismay at prisoners ’ propaganda statements could feed his current impatience with calls for a withdrawal from Iraq .
In the crucible of the camps , it was easy to see the collaborators  broadcasting antiwar statements over prison loudspeakers , smiling for Jane Fonda and visiting peace activists , enjoying the rewards of better food and less torture  as embodiments of the war protesters that the North Vietnamese counted on to wear down the American war effort .
“ Just like the ‘ pull - out movement ’ today , as I call it , the peace movement would give them something to hang their hats on , ” said Richard A. Stratton , another former prisoner incarcerated with Mr. McCain .
“ You are being tortured and all you have to do to get them to stop is say the same thing that Bobby Kennedy is saying .
The same thing that George McGovern is saying .
You do n’t even have to make anything up . ”
Determination Redoubled
Mr. McCain , then a Navy lieutenant commander , was by all accounts what the American prisoners called a “ tough resister . ”
He was nicknamed Crip for the severity of the injuries he sustained  a shoulder , both arms and his knee broken , with a bayonet wound near the groin  when his fighter plane was shot down in October 1967 .
Military rules only allowed P.O.W. ’s to go home in the order of their capture , but some senior officers said his medical condition justified accepting an offer of release from the North Vietnamese .
Mr. McCain , the son of a prominent admiral , did not want to be part of North Vietnamese propaganda , so he chose to endure years of torture instead .
At times , Mr. McCain seemed to court punishment , noisily cussing out his captors while giving “ thumbs up ” signs to his fellow prisoners .
“ No matter what he did , he always played to the bleachers , ” Robert Coram , a military historian , wrote in a book about the camps .
Krugman is right , but his arguments do more than defend the Fed .
They also unintentionally demolish the foundations on which central banks have based monetary policy the past twenty - five years .
In effect , re-thinking the inflation of the 1970s also compels re-thinking economic policy .
Re-thinking That ‘ 70's Inflation Show , by Thomas I. Palley :
The Federal Reserve has recently received much criticism from economic conservatives who claim it has ignored inflation , thereby risking a rerun of the 1970 's inflation show .
In response , renowned Princeton economist Paul Krugman has come to the Fed 's defense arguing today 's inflation is fundamentally different from that of the 1970s .
Thomas Palley says " if the union price - wage spiral story of inflation is correct ( which it is ) , Friedman 's natural rate theory is wrong .
My comments , along with supporting graphs , are at the end :
The essence of Krugman 's argument is that we are not watching a rerun of the ‘ 70's show because this time round there is no mechanism for creating a price - wage spiral .
That is because unions are now dead so that workers are unable to ask for wage increases that match prices .
As an example , Krugman contrasts the United Mine Workers contract of 1981 which bargained a three year eleven percent annual average wage increase with current conditions .
Where now are the unions demanding 11 - percent - a- year increases ?
Indeed , where are the unions , period ?
Today 's reality is indeed characterized by absence of a price - wage spiral mechanism , and it is the reason why the Fed 's easy monetary policy is unlikely to cause general inflation .
However , that raises a critical additional point .
Recognizing that the inflation of the 1970's was the result of a price - wage spiral triggered by conflict with unions over income distribution , compels rejection of the theory of the natural rate of unemployment .
This theory has dominated economists ' thinking about inflation for over a generation and has twisted public thinking .
The late Milton Friedman was the originator of the theory of the natural rate of unemployment , yet according to Friedman unions have absolutely nothing to do with inflation .
Instead , inflation is everywhere and always an exclusively monetary phenomenon .
For Friedman , the only role of unions is to increase unemployment , which fundamentally contradicts the union wage – price spiral story of inflation
That means if the union price - wage spiral story of inflation is correct ( which it is ) , Friedman 's natural rate theory is wrong and policymakers should abandon it .
Instead , the focus of policy can formally return to probing the boundaries of full employment .
Moreover , since inflation involves conflict over income distribution , there remains an unsolved policy challenge of how to fairly distribute income at full employment without triggering inflation .
Seen in this light , it becomes clear that Friedman 's natural rate theory has been used to justify running policy in a business friendly way .
Thus , in the 1980's high interest rates were used to tamp down inflation , thereby causing unemployment and weakening unions by weakening manufacturing .
In effect , fighting a price - wage spiral with high interest rates is a form of class based policy that breaks the spiral by undercutting the bargaining power of workers .
A final implication concerns the economics profession and its teaching of economics .
In the 1980s Friedman 's natural rate of unemployment theory became the mainstay of economics textbooks .
However , if the union wage – price spiral story of inflation is correct , it is time to re-write those textbooks .
Today 's students deserve a theory that explains both the inflation of the 1970s and why the Fed is right in downplaying current inflation fears .
Natural rate theory asserts the economy self - organizes with full employment , and that inflation is the result of monetary policy trying to push the economy beyond the natural unemployment rate .
The theory is fundamentally ideological and it flooded into the academy as part of the conservative capture of economics in the 1970s .
It has always struggled to fit the facts , and now may finally be the time to discard it .
Here 's how I understand the union 's role in the wage - price spiral of the 1970s ( in a natural rate framework ) .
Start at equilibrium with employment at the natural rate of output ( Y*) and prices ( P ) that are stable :
The position of the short - run aggregate supply curve ( SRAS ) depends upon input costs , including wages .
As costs increase , the SRAS curve shifts inward ( to the left ) .
Now , suppose workers are unhappy with the current level of real wages , W/P , and , through unions or other means , they demand a higher wage .
The goal is to get a larger share of output consistent with the distributional arguments above :
This causes higher prices and lower output and employment .
( But initially the real wage , W/P , does rise since W increases more than P increases .
As a side note , however , the distribution of income for workers as a group depends upon what happens to the product of real wages times the number of employed , real wages increase but employment decreases so the change in total real income could potentially be postive or negative , and this needs to be compared to the new smaller level of output to see how the overall share of output for workers has changed . )
If policymakers do not respond , natural rate theory says that since resources are unemployed ( Y ' < Y* ) , input costs will fall .
As input costs fall , the SRAS begins to shift outward toward the natural rate , and this continues until the equilibrium shown in the first diagram is restored .
This is natural rate theory in action , i.e. there are automatic mechanisms to return the economy to the natural rate whenever shocks ( including policy shocks ) move output away from Y*.
But suppose instead that policymakers have a full - employment target , and are obligated to try and meet it .
Let monetary policy be the policy instrument ( I 'll explain why I did n't use use fiscal policy to illustrate this below ) .
Then the monetary authority will increase the money supply and this shifts the aggregate demand curve ( AD ) to the right :
So output is back where it started ( Y*) and hence so is employment , and prices are higher at P' ' .
So far , we have an increase in the price level from P to P ' , but we do n't have continually increasing prices , i.e. this i snot inflation .
How to get inflation ?
Let workers say to themselves :
For a little while real wages rose and I was doing better ( when the economy was at Y ' and P' ) .
But then that darn inflation came along and eroded all of my hard - earned gains away ( as AD shifts and prices go up to P '' ) .
I was ahead when the union helped , now I 'm behind again , so it looks like it 's time to demand higher wages as before .
Suppose they do .
If we use the first diagram as the new starting point ( i.e. relabel the equilibrium Y* and P '' ) , the process repeats itself , except now prices would rise even higher by the time it is all done ( i.e. , if the graphs were actually drawn , as the SRAS shifts in the second diagram , prices go up from P'' to P ''' , then as AD goes up in the third diagram , prices go up even more to P ' ' ' ' ) .
Let workers have the same reaction , i.e. we were ahead for awhile , but then inflation eroded the gains , so we need to do this again .
As they demand higher wages as before this leads , after all is said and done , to even higher prices .
As it repeats over and over , prices continue to rise and we have inflation .
[ Point of clarification after reading comments :
If there is no union power to speak of , as today , then there is no way to get this process started and then sustain it .
That is , there would be no way to make effective wage demands and shift the SRAS curve inward , and no way for the process to repeat and cause inflation . ]
So it is policymaker 's pursuit of a high employment target within the natural rate framework that generates inflation .
Note also that this is consistent with Friedman 's contention that inflation is always and everywhere a monetary phenomenon .
If we define inflation as a continuous increase in prices over a long time frame , and we try to use fiscal policy to do it , then in the story above each time the AD curve shifts outward government would get bigger ( G increases ) or taxes would get smaller ( T decreases ) , but both G and T are bounded .
G can't increase above output ( and practically would be limited before that ) , and taxes cannot fall below zero .
So in either case , eventually inflation would end since G could not go any higher and T could not go any lower after some point .
This is not a problem with money since more can always be printed , hence there is no bound to price increases and that is why I chose monetary policy to illustrate the example .
Thus , I do n't see the conflict Thomas is pointing to when he says that this " compels rejection of the theory of the natural rate of unemployment . "
What have I missed in his argument ?
Update :
Let me add that in this story , it is not the unions that are causing the inflation .
It is the continuing increases in the money supply in pursuit of the full employment target that cause the inflation .
To see that unions are not directly causing the inflation , note that if there is no policy response at all , then under the natural rate story the SRAS in the second diagram would return to its original position and the price level would stabilize ( though it might take longer to get back to Y* than it would if there is a policy intervention ) .
Thus , if the Fed stops increasing the money supply , the inflation will end .
One more update :
This model can also be used to tell a declining unionization story .
Lets go back to the second diagram , but add an arrow showing the automatic return to the long - run equilibrium if policymakers do not respond to the initial shift in the SRAS :
The shift in the SRAS curve labeled " a " is from the higher wage demand , and the shift labeled " b " is the self - correcting response that returns the economy to full employment .
Suppose , at first , that there is only one factor of production , labor .
Then the return to full employment shown as " b " comes about as , over time , wages are bid down by the presence of unemployed workers .
To the extent that workers and unions are able to resist these downward wage adjustments , the SRAS curve will be sticky , i.e. it will take a long time to adjust .
The persistent unemployment that would result could cause union support to erode ( policy intervention can help by reducing the time it takes to get back to full employment by shifting the AD curve outward ) .
Now suppose there are two factors of production , labor and capital ( or the potential to purchase goods from foreign suppliers and / or move production offshore ) .
Again , let labor demand higher wages resulting in the shift labeled " a " above , and once at Y ' suppose the union strongly resists any cut in wages .
In this case firms , facing higher labor costs can substitute capital for labor ( this might impact the natural rate but let 's abstract from that complication ) or shift production to foreign countries where wages are lower .
To the extent that firms are able to use these strategies and substitute away from high cost labor , unions will be undercut so that in the long - run support and membership is likely to erode ( and technological change may make capital an increasingly effective substitute for labor , and make it easier to produce where labor is cheapest so that these pressures have intensified over time ) .
Again , though , this is a model based story - there may be other reasons for the decline in union membership .
Iran continues to enjoy the dubious success of the military missile drill , which the Islamic Republic 's Revolutionary Guard held last week .
The Iranian news agency IRNA reported to the country 's residents on Monday that the Israelis were so terrified by the display of power that it has sparked a mass emigration .
Iran 's national news agencies have become famous for their hyperbolic reports on the state 's successes , and this time was no exception .
According to recent reports , there has been an increase in " massive emigration from Tel Aviv following the military maneuver . "
Photoshop ?
Did Revolutionary Guards doctor missile photos ?
Ynet Discrepancies between photo , video of Iranian missile test indicate possible attempt to cover up technical difficulties during Persian Gulf exercise Did Revolutionary Guards doctor missile photos ?
Israel , which Iran has refused to recognize or mention by name .
" Following the successful maneuver executed by Iran last week , which included the firing of new missiles , Zionist residents living in occupied Palestine have begun to flee from there , " the report said .
" The residents told their illegitimate government that this was the reason they refused to go on living there . "
Documentation falsified ?
( Photo : AFP )
It is unclear what information the report was based on , but the slurs may be an attempt at countering negative reports by the West , which described the documentation of the missile firing as " doctored " .
These speculations cited the military 's failure to fire long - range missiles as the reason for the editing of the footage .
Iranian reports also claimed that " some of the Western news agencies have tried to create a negative atmosphere in the media , and deny Iran 's military capabilities . "
Earlier a senior official from Iran 's Defense Ministry claimed that the military maneuver has improved Iran 's position in the diplomatic talks over the fate of its nuclear program .
These most recent news reports are reminiscent of the Iranian media 's accounts of the Second Lebanon War .
Following a speech made by Hizbullah Secretary - General Hassan Nassrallah , in which he denounced Israel , an Iranian newspaper published the headline : " Tel Aviv was evacuated " .
The paper , loyal to Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , wrote that " following recent threats made by Nasrallah , Israeli government agencies have been moved from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem . "
ATLANTA , Georgia ( CNN ) --
A teenager Saturday was struck and killed by a roller coaster at the Six Flags Over Georgia theme park outside Atlanta , authorities said .
The 17 - year - old park visitor was killed after scaling two fences -- one of which was six feet tall -- around the Batman roller coaster , park spokeswoman Hela Sheth said in a statement .
The teen , who visiting the park with a church group from Springfield , South Carolina , was decapitated , she said .
It was unclear how fast the outside - looping coaster was moving when it struck the teen , but according to the park 's Web site , the ride reaches speeds of 50 mph .
" We do not know why this person was intent on gaining access to this restricted area , " the statement said , noting that multiple signs are posted stating , " Danger Zone , " " Do Not Enter " and " Authorized Personnel Only . "
Watch a park patron describe the scene »
" Some witnesses have stated that the individual was trying to retrieve something he had lost , " Sheth said .
" Others reported that he was trying to touch the ride .
This is merely speculation at this point , and we are working with park visitors and local police to learn more . "
No one on the ride was injured , she said .
Police said the incident occurred about 2 p.m .
The ride was closed Saturday , but park officials said they expected it to reopen Monday .
The victim 's family was at the park with him , Sheth said , and park representatives were with them Saturday evening .
" Our thoughts and prayers are with the family , " she said .
Cobb County police spokesman Dana Pierce said officers would continue to investigate the incident , but " all indications are that the park had done everything they could to maintain a safe environment . "

We did not include American versions of these genres in our tasting , on the theory that they were not new stylistically .
Nor did we include beers that used unusual ingredients or flavorings , like maple syrup , kumquats or whatever .
Instead , we focused on beers that took existing styles and exaggerated them .
For the most part , this means beers that are hoppy in the extreme .
Brewers have always used the resiny cone of the hop plant to add bitterness and aromas to beer .
Hops and alcohol also act as a preservative , and you could make the case that India pale ale , with its higher - than - normal alcohol and hops content , was an extreme beer of the 18th century .
So it makes sense that most of the extreme beers today are characterized by their ultrahoppiness .
Of the 25 beers we tasted , at least 20 of them would fall into the category of exaggerated I.P.A. ’s regardless of what they call themselves .
To carry their extraordinary bitterness and aromatic zest , these beers need a sturdy foundation , so they tend to have outsize malty qualities as well as high alcohol .
They are not therefore session beers , brews that you can drink in multiple pints over the course of an evening .
Still , the best versions , in which all the elements are well balanced , are highly appealing .
Florence , in particular , was surprised at how many she found likable , and even elegant .
Our favorite was the robust 90 Minute Imperial I.P.A. from Dogfish Head , a beer that balances its exaggerated caramel and chocolate sweetness with a bracing bitterness derived from hops .
If you sneer at the 90 Minute , Dogfish also occasionally issues its 120 Minute I.P.A. , which , at 20 percent alcohol , may well be , as the brewery contends , “ the biggest I.P.A. ever brewed . ”
Our No. 2 beer , the Weyerbacher Double Simcoe I.P.A. , seemed to embody the term “ killer , ” the extreme beer fan ’s favorite compliment .
Killer hops , killer fruit , overwhelming yet bearable , even enjoyable , because it is so well balanced .
The No. 3 beer , the I.P.A. Maximus from Lagunitas , was something of a lightweight in this crowd with a mere 7.5 percent alcohol , yet it was lively and energetic with a lush citrus perfume .
By contrast , the Gordon from Oskar Blues  the only beer in our tasting to come in a can  was practically mellow and subdued .
Was that a good thing ?
We thought so , because the flavors were nonetheless distinct and complex .
The Tohono O’odham Nation , the second largest Indian reservation recognized by the U.S. with territory and members on both sides of the U.S. - Mexico border , is calling for a halt in the construction of a fence along the Southwest border .
“ As original people of the territory , the Tohono O’odham have lived on and cared for that land long before such a boundary even existed ; before there was a U.S. or a Mexico , ” Ofelia Rivas , a representative of the Indian tribe , said Thursday in Washington .
“ Now , however , the construction of the border wall along the entire U.S. –Mexican border is splitting border communities and indigenous nations alike , including the Tohono O’odham , ” Ms. Rivas said during a press conference .
The Tohono O’odham Reservation , whose 24,000 members live on 2.8 million acres on both sides of the Arizona border south of Tucson , is comparable in size to the state of Connecticut .
It said the proposed border fence would “ destroy the Tohono O’odham way of life , its traditions and religious practices , ” along with the “ many rights sworn to the O’odham people that are being violated . ”
“ This wall and the construction of this wall has destroyed our communities , our burial sites and ancient O’odham routes throughout our lands , ” Ms. Rivas said .
“ The entire international border has divided and displaced our people .
“ The wall also is severely affecting the animals .
We now see mountain lions going into areas where people live because of the wall , ” she said .
Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff has said his goal is to have actual fencing along 370 miles of the U.S. - Mexico border and barriers that would allow foot traffic but prevent vehicles on another 300 miles before the end of President Bush ’s term , which ends in January .
Mr. Chertoff has waived dozens of federal laws and regulations to build the fence .
But Tohono O’odham elders and traditionalists maintain their legacy through oral history , conducting natural ceremonies that include offerings to the land and sea .
They also use many of the region ’s plants and environmental resources as a source of food and medicine .
Many of these sacred ceremonies take place in Mexico .
Ms. Rivas said the right of the Tohono O’odham people to travel freely and safely over traditional routes in their territory had been guaranteed under U.S. , Mexican and International Law .
She said the American Indian Religious Freedom Act of 1978 acknowledges the rights of the O’odham people that the fence violates .
“ By restricting the mobility of the O’odham people , the wall prevents the free practice of their religion and their cultural traditions .
Further , rights granted by the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights , the Declaration of Human Rights for Indigenous Peoples , and the American Declaration of the Rights and Duties of Man are also being ignored due to a waiver issued by the Department of Homeland Security , ” she said .
“ Under this document , the president claims the power to waive any and all environmental and federal Indian laws in order to build the wall in the name of national security , ” she said .
Ms. Rivas also said the construction has increased the military presence within the O’odham territory , further affecting their lives and communities .
“ This wall has militarized our entire lands , ” she said .
“ We , as original people , are now required to answer to United States armed forces as to our nationality on our own lands . ”
Ms. Rivas said that once she was asked at gunpoint to produce identification to establish her right to be on the lands where she was born and where her ancestors lived since before Columbus arrived .
Ms. Rivas is in Washington with members of many different indigenous nations and allies who walked from San Francisco to Washington in what was billed as “ The People ’s Walk ” to protest the fence .

In a good world driven by simply media hype and FOMO [ Fear Of Missing Out ] , this is becoming clearer each day that a thorough crypto enthusiast needs to be able to have a litmus test out for picking a token to support in some sort of entire world where genuine worthwhile assignments are hard in order to find and excellent projects with long term leads are even harder in order to distinguish from money catching ‘ shitcoins ’ .
With all the recent innovations where nearly all new cryptos are striking record levels , and innovative ICO Jobs not living up to their hypes after the Crowdsale , it is now common regarding unhappy ‘ investors ’ to get all around blaming the ICO causes with Social Advertising , instead than blame them selves for not doing often the right due diligence for you to pick a just about all possible post - crowdsale winner just before getting a token through its ICO .
From my own intensive remark , it shown up that most crypto buyers just purchased coins during a good ICO based on typically the FOMO ( Fear of Missing out on Out ) produced by the experts of the nonsense behind those coins .
Numerous easily bought without comprehending the post -ICO purpose of the lieu , or what the expression was initially supposed to do after the Crowdsale .
Whenever nothing happened after the particular ICO , as is usually the case now for many ICOs , they would in that case hop on social media to help scream their displeasure at the top of their lungs .
Recently , me personally and my own team just finished the tour of Africa and a few parts associated with USA to showcase the Nollycoin ICO .
We structured and sponsored several conferences , did live GOBERNANTA ( Ask Me Anything ) push meetings , and held tons one on one meetings with Crypto whales , little investors , and even crypto millionaire wannabes of any colour .
Through it most , one thing that amazed me personally beyond all else was initially that MOST token slots had ZERO CLUE regarding the underlying business enterprise or maybe project behind the particular small sales they participated throughout .
Even new person within my statement , was the Amazing idea that many could not notify you the value proposition associated with the project , it is objectives or the plan on the company to disrupt industry and grab a bit in the buyers in their very own industry .
His or her purchased typically the ICO since several telegram or Facebook Pages they frequented kept showing them to ‘ Buy .
Hodl and get more ’.
Most simply acted about herd instinct rather as compared to intent deliberation .
Now , in the event that most people I actually met were just simply adolescents or folks with out education and learning , I would certainly not have already been hence surprised on the degree of lack of edcuation of many of typically the crypto ‘ investors ’
I met .
However , several of those people I attained were university graduates and folks of some means .
Still less compared with how 10 % of them may quickly articulate why these people bought a coin within hope that it might increased value over time period .
Everywhere
My partner and i went , quite few in the audience could tell me the particular name , experience and functionality of the corporate managers of the company providing the coins .
The sole thing many of them could level out was that typically the coins were recommended by simply ‘ respected ’ influencers when information have proved that more of which were paid chills to generate FOMO and respectability regarding otherwise useless shitcoins .
Further than canadian crypto exchange - called bogus influencers , all many crypto purchasers knew was that the names on the workforce leaders were Russian , Offshore or Korean while that they knew absolutely nothing about them .
It was as in case all you wanted to have got a new successful ICO was initially to list names of people from Korea or Cina or Russia that nobody could even check with a straightforward Google look for .
While I concur one can find certainly several things to consider selecting whether often the tokens of a job would increase in cost after a while , I think often the acid test , as well as most immediate evaluation conditions , should be the utility involving the coin itself outside of what might come about in the crypto swaps .
Though most crypto small owners I met do n’t even know it , typically the reality is that if an individual bought a token via more ICOs , you were not really ‘ investing ’ throughout that company .
You will not be buying shares of the company and you were definitely not acquiring any security from the corporation .
And on best , that which you have been doing when a person bought tokens during most ICOs was ‘ donating ’ to a good project in swap to being given a utility token as well as lieu that legally had zero real value further than typically the company ecosystem regulated by the issuing company .
In order words , apart from your hope that this price of the particular tokens will ‘ moon ’ or rise to cause you to a uniform , there is not many else you could accomplish with the token different compared to making the most of the utility connected to that by simply often the ICO firm , if any kind of .
Since not a soul could actually predict without a doubt how a new Crypto would execute on a crypto alternate as soon as this finally acquired now there , and most recent experience have shown that this prices on most tokens would likely most likely nose area jump in the first few weeks of hitting a exchange ( due to huge sell offs by speculators ) , it may well make a few sense for you to be able to look at what other value or utility you could get from your token , over and above the expected ‘ mooning ’ around the exchange .
As the crypto trend continued to add some kick , change and adapt to help different advancements in the market place , the sole way to assure your funds is not being thrown into the gutter is usually to be certain anyone could still use those tokens to get excellent value and benefits possibly if you could very well offer it for profits right away on a exchange .
Making this determination you must consult yourself this main concern :
What is worth , product or service as well as service the fact that the company promoting this token with generate of which will give me sufficiently worth for my income for making this purchase worthy of my own while ?
In a new associated with crashing prices associated with bridal party at diverse deals , the harder chances you own to obtain real world utilization with a token not in the expected listing on typically the crypto exchange , the better the chances which you would not end up being frustrated or stranded with tokens which might be useless to you .
So , you have to question over and over : IN CASE this gold coin never traded in on an change , would likely I still be delighted that I supported this perception ?
If this symbol lost 70 percent of it is value upon an exchange , can easily I still use it and get value for the money in another place with that ?
Should you could not remedy these issues positively soon after critiquing often the WHITEPAPER and even investing the claims connected with the company , then you definately need to think twice before buying that will coin .
A New Case - Study
Have a current ICO like Nollycoin which is the token at the rear of the Blockchain enabled film supply ecosystem .
The causes regarding the coin have produced different utility scenarios with regard to customers of the gold coin to ensure that no matter what occurs to Nollycoin within the crypto exchange , their backers and token hodlers can keep smiling .
Some of often the great power attached to the Nollycoin token throughout the Nollytainment environment incorporate
� Ability to make use of Nollycoin tokens to see exclusive videos with this cinemas in addition to motion picture houses
� Chance to use the particular Nollycoin tokens to access 1 , 000s of movies on their Netflix - on - steroids blockchain Movie submission .
� Ability to employ Nollycoin tokens to obtain products and services at the NollyMall which can be like an Amazon system with regard to entertainment - based products .
� Capacity to use the Nollycoin as well to pay for school fees in the NOLLY Academy platform and companion companies
As you can see , over and above the standard hope that the tokens might be listed on a crypto trade platform , you need to look over and above the particular hype of an ico the immediate and prospective utility of the expression and viability of this underlying project powering that .
On July 5 , 2005 , in a game between his New York Yankees and the Baltimore Orioles , Randy Johnson -- flamethrower extraordinaire -- unexpectedly joined an admirably gutsy fraternity .
In the third inning , Johnson faced Sal Fasano of the Orioles .
His catcher , John Flaherty , could not decide where to set up for the pitch , and Johnson , in a fit of remarkable whimsy , threw Fasano what The New York Times called an " eephus . "
Surprised ( to say the least ) , Fasano nearly dropped his bat as the unusual offering reached the plate and was called a ball .
The fearsome Big Unit actually smiled as Flaherty stood up and stretched out his hands in disbelief .
From a novice of such a pitch like Johnson , the eephus -- or blooper pitch -- gets little more than a rise out of the crowd and a chuckle from the batter on the receiving end .
It was a different scenario when a master of this rare and bedeviling pitch threw it in the 1946 All - Star Game .

Enlarge Getty Images Rip Sewell did n't reach the majors for good until he was 31 , but still won 143 games .
On July 9 , 1946 , pitcher Rip Sewell sat on the National League bench for the first seven innings of the All - Star Game , nursing a sore arm and watching his team fall behind 8 - 0 .
American League aces Bob Feller and Hal Newhouser dominated , hurling thumbnail versions of their signature work , and Ted Williams had knocked out a home run and driven in three .
Before the top of the eighth , Sewell 's manager for the day , the Cubs ' Charlie Grimm , told the pitcher the next three outs would be his to get .
" See if you can wake this crowd up with that pitch of yours , " he told Sewell .
Even as he warmed up , the hum in Fenway Park jumped an octave .
Three singles , two outs and another American League run later , Williams again stepped into the batter 's box .
Back from his first stint as a U.S. Marine Corps aviator during World War II , The Kid now faced Sewell , who had flourished against draft - depleted offenses after being declared unfit for military service .
The matchup became an instant classic : the premier 4 - F pitcher of the day against the greatest hitter of the age .
Williams knew the eephus was coming , but he urged Sewell to reconsider his strategy .
" You 're not going to throw me that damn pitch of yours , are you ? " he called to Sewell .
" I might ! " Sewell hollered back .
He did throw it on the first pitch , and Williams swung and missed .
The Boston crowd applauded the Pittsburgh pitcher , who at this stage of his career was not surprised to find himself cheered by the enemy .
The fans , he had learned , loved the spectacle more than they did any single man , no matter how talented .
After debuting with the Pirates in 1938 , Sewell pitched serviceably in ' 39 , his first full season .
In 1940 , he improved , going 16 - 5 with an ERA of 2.80 .
Even as Sewell enjoyed his run of success , the National League was figuring him out .
The next year , Sewell lost more than he won , his ERA rose by almost a full point and he felt the lukewarm fingers of mediocrity tighten their grip .
Events in Europe overshadowed his individual struggles ; a draft and a looming war made the outlook for all able - bodied American men seem grim indeed .
Displaying the craftiness that became his trademark , Sewell found a way to avoid conscription and irrelevance :
He was shot .
On Dec. 7 , 1941 , the same day as the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor , Sewell was on vacation , hunting deer near Ocala , Fla. , when a companion accidentally deposited 14 pellets of buckshot into him .
The shotgun blast , he told writer Elson Smith in " Blooper Man , " " tore holes in me as big as marbles .
My legs looked like screen doors . "
His right foot fared the worst , and doctors were unable to remove several pieces of shot .
After four weeks of medical care , Sewell was released from the hospital and told to forget about baseball .
The accident put Sewell 's career in jeopardy but guaranteed that he would not have to trade his jersey for battle fatigues like so many other players .
Even during a world war , the American military took few chances evaluating a person 's fitness for combat .
Included among the conditions for exemption were astigmatism , partial hearing loss , significant depression and even flat feet .
Sewell , with buckshot forever buried in one foot , received a swift disqualification .
He was designated 4 - F : " not acceptable for military service . "
Against medical recommendations , Sewell boarded a train for California and training camp , carrying a bag full of bandages and instructions to scrupulously clean his wounds twice a day if he wished to keep his legs .
Sewell kept his injuries a secret from everyone but the Pirates ' trainer , who promised to keep the matter under wraps , so to speak , while his pitcher toiled through unprecedented pain .
Once he refined this delivery to protect his diminished right foot , Sewell was able to pitch , but his new mechanics took the zip out of a fastball and the bite out of a curve .
To endure in the majors , he would require another weapon .
The enterprising hurler peered deep into the Pitcher 's Bag of Tricks and , in a forgotten crevice , half - covered in dust , found a pitch that made a virtue of mediocrity .

Sewell shows his grip for his infamous eephus pitch .
Sewell introduced the eephus in a spring exhibition game against the Detroit Tigers , who , incidentally , had traded him to Pittsburgh after six fruitless years in their minor league system .
Dick Wakefield became the blooper 's first victim .
Sewell gripped the ball at a seam with three fingers and tossed it home , the pitch rising as high as 25 feet at its apex .
A successful effort topped out at just 50 mph but rotated with plenty of backspin , which , according to Sewell , was his secret sauce .
The batter , who had no idea what was coming , had no chance .
According to Sewell , as told to The Boston Globe in 1981 , " [ Wakefield ] started to swing , he stopped , he started again , he stopped , and then he swung again and almost fell down when he missed . "
For men trained to lay off high fastballs , this was high comedy , and both benches took turns applauding Sewell and jeering Wakefield .
After the game , Pirates manager Frankie Frisch demanded to know what , exactly , his pitcher had thrown to Wakefield .
Maurice Van Robays , an outfielder with the club , replied that Sewell had thrown an eephus .
When asked to elaborate , Van Robays said , " ' Eephus ai n't nothing , and that 's a nothing pitch . "
Because Sewell had no opinion on the moniker ( " I do n't name 'em , I just throw ' em " ) , eephus stuck , despite the Pittsburgh newspapers ' early attempts to christen him the master of the " dipsy doodle . "
One theory on the origin of Van Robays ' nonsense word ties it to the Hebrew language , which does not have a numerical symbol for zero but does have a word for the concept : efes , which can also mean " nothing . "
Also consider the lexicon of tarot cards , where The Fool card is often numbered zero .
Sewell may have looked foolish , lobbing rainbows toward professional batsmen , but it quickly became clear that he was dealing the zero not drawing it .
He threw his first regulation blooper on April 17 , 1941 , striking out Cubs center fielder Dom Dallessandro and stranding two runners .
The startled hitter pointed his bat at Sewell , saying , " If this was a rifle , I 'd shoot you right between the eyes . "
History did not record Sewell 's response , but here 's hoping the pitcher pointed to his right foot and said , " Get in line . "
The Cubs argued that the eephus was illegal , but Bill Klem , the National League 's supervisor of umpires , declared it legal , which was the final word on the matter .
Before they realized how effective the eephus could be , many batters regarded the pitch as an illegitimate offering -- a hurled insult .
St. Louis third baseman Whitey Kurowski made a point of spitting tobacco juice at the ball as it floated past him .
In 1943 , Reds shortstop Eddie Miller caught an eephus and fired it back at Sewell .
Though that particular eephus never reached the catcher 's mitt , the umpire called it a strike .
Casey Stengel , then manager of the Boston Braves , took particular umbrage at the pitch .
He once sent a rookie up to bat with instructions to hit from a kneeling position if Sewell threw him the blooper .
The rookie grounded out on a ball hit deep into the hole at short , and the shortstop said that had the batter been standing , he probably would have been safe .
Sewell won 17 games in 1942 and 21 in ' 43 to lead the National League that year .
He won 21 again in ' 44 , throwing 49 complete games in that two - year stretch .
In 1943 , he pitched 265 innings and gave up just six home runs .
Most significant : the zero ( there 's that number again ) home runs hit off Sewell 's blooper in regular - season play throughout his entire career .
" Eephus " might mean nothing , but against the long ball , it certainly was something .
Nonetheless , after Sewell retired , the pitch disappeared , only sporadically summoned back to service by pitchers who had surplus quantities of gall and little left to lose .
During the 1980s , when Dave LaRoche , a formerly talented reliever , started leaking miles per hour from his fastball , he went to the eephus , which he renamed " LaLob . "
Like Sewell , LaRoche was stingy with his signature pitch , offering it less than once per inning .
Also like Sewell , he took advantage of the fact that those who hit the fastball the hardest tended to hit the eephus the least .
On Sept. 9 , 1981 , LaRoche and the Yankees hosted the Milwaukee Brewers .
In the sixth inning , Milwaukee center fielder Gorman Thomas stepped in with two outs and runners on second and third .
Thomas -- famous for a Fu Manchu mustache and an all - or - nothing power stroke -- twice led the American League in home runs despite making steady progress toward a lifetime batting average of .225 .
At a mound conference , it was nearly decided that the right - handed slugger would be pitched around , but LaRoche somehow persuaded his manager , Bob Lemon , to let him bait Thomas with four " slow curves " out of the strike zone .
If the slugger laid off , he could have his free pass .
Thomas , for his part , did not want to walk .
He no doubt wanted a piece of Dave LaRoche and his mediocre stuff , and the reliever obliged , throwing Thomas the slowest pitch he'd ever seen .
LaLob missed outside , ball one .
Lemon -- who had never known a " slow curve " to rise out of view from the dugout -- blinked and rubbed his eyes .
Thomas , who had a much better look , nonetheless could not believe it .
[+]
Enlarge Mark Rucker / Getty Images Ted Williams hit .304 with four home runs in 46 career All - Star Game at - bats .
" Why me ? " he asked catcher Barry Foote .
" Because you 're you , " Foote replied .
Assuming that LaRoche had had his little joke , Thomas crouched again , anticipating a legitimate offering .
Along came a second LaLob .
This time , Thomas swung , fouling it off for strike one .
As LaRoche got a new baseball , the Brewers slugger picked up on the strategy being used against him .
" He 's gonna throw that $ &*@ ! * thing again , is n't he ? "
Foote replied truthfully that he had no idea what LaRoche might be thinking .
On the next pitch , events took an even sharper turn toward the surreal .
LaRoche threw another floater , and Thomas -- as unfamiliar with small ball as he was with daily shaving -- tried to bunt it .
To that point in the season , he had collected zero sacrifice bunts , and with two outs , even a successful sacrifice would have done no good .
In any event , the bunt rolled foul , leaving Thomas down to one final strike .
As both contestants abandoned rational thinking , catcher Foote told himself to sit back and enjoy the show .
And indeed , he could not have predicted LaRoche 's next offering , a fastball , likely thrown out of sympathy .
On the best pitch he'd see in the sequence , Thomas held up , taking it for a ball that put the count at 2 - 2 . LaLob appeared again .
The Brewers slugger took a final , mighty swing .
He missed , and the grandiose flail spun him off his feet and onto the seat of his pants .
Thomas removed his batting helmet and tossed it up , taking a last cut and finally making good contact with something .
The largest piece remaining was an ear flap , which he autographed and sent to LaRoche with compliments .
Hitting LaRoche 's trick pitch became Thomas ' mission .
He insisted that the reliever throw him nothing else whenever their paths crossed on the diamond .
If LaRoche did not honor the request , Thomas would not swing .
The next season , when Stormin ' Gorman finally hit one fair , a line drive over third base , the Milwaukee fans gave him a standing ovation .
Thomas ' woes underscore the devious nature of the eephus , which turns a hitter 's eyes and brain against him .
When a moving object enters a person 's field of view , the brain engages a process called " smooth pursuit " tracking , which allows the eyes to follow the target as it travels .
Only a few species possess this useful adaptation , including our own extended family , the primates , and creatures belonging to the order mantodea , the praying mantises , which are among the most effective predators ( ounce for ounce ) in the world .
Objects moving vertically and horizontally give our smooth pursuit systems particular trouble , which is why a good rolling curveball can " freeze " a hitter .
The indolent eephus is far more than a 12 - 6 curve : Coming in as much as two - thirds slower , with the rise and drop of a roller coaster , it gives a batter 's front brain plenty of time to overthink .
The advanced calculations pile up , throwing off his timing on other pitches in the at - bat as well as on the eephus itself .
When to throw an eephus matters as much as the quality of the pitch itself .
Used improperly , a blooper can bring fame for all the wrong reasons .
Yankees pitcher Orlando Hernandez offered one to then - Texas Ranger Alex Rodriguez in 2002 .
After watching Rodriguez take it for a ball , Hernandez decided to throw another , which was last seen rattling around the upper deck at Yankee Stadium .

Even more famous is the " spaceball " blooper thrown by Red Sox pitcher Bill " Spaceman " Lee in Game 7 of the 1975 World Series .
With Boston leading 3 - 0 in the sixth inning and on the verge of its first championship since 1918 , Lee decided to throw a third spaceball ( he did n't throw it as high as Sewell 's eephus pitch ) to Cincinnati Reds first baseman Tony Perez after the slugger missed two in a row .
Fool a Hall of Fame hitter once , shame on him .
Fool him twice , you got lucky .
Fool him three times , and you did better than Bill Lee .
Perez gave the third spaceball a wallop that sent it soaring over the Green Monster .
According to Lee , the ball is still traveling 33 years later .
Two runs scored , and the rest is history .
Lee 's folly carries an important lesson for those pitchers who play the zero card : Beware the number three .
On that note , we return to the master practitioners , Rip Sewell and Ted Williams , facing off in the 1946 All - Star Game .
Williams did not just miss the first blooper Sewell threw him , he missed it badly .
Though not quite a Gorman Thomas - esque failure , the Splinter 's off - balance flail emboldened Sewell , who threw a second blooper .
Williams swung again , fouling it off .
Fenway howled .
The Kid looked out at the pitcher and shook his head pleadingly , to no avail .
Over the din of the crowd , Sewell shouted :
" Here it comes again ! "
In his biography , " My Turn at Bat , " Williams recalled his pregame chat with Yankees catcher Bill Dickey .
The Einstein of hitting , Williams wondered aloud whether it was even possible to hit Sewell 's trick pitch for a home run .
With little energy coming from the ball , the batter needed to supply the full power , and he did n't know whether a body possessed such wattage .
Dickey wagered that a moving man could get the job done .
" Advance on it a step or two , " Dickey said .
" Kind of run at it . "
With two men on and a favorable count , Sewell threw a third eephus , one he later described as a " Sunday super - duper blooper . "
It fell with near - perfect accuracy , the ball tumbling down through the strike zone .
As the pitch arrived , Williams charged , taking two quick steps out of the batter 's box .
He swung , connected and dumped the Sunday super - duper blooper into the right - field bullpen .
Pandemonium erupted as Williams laughed his way around the bases .
Though chuckling himself , Sewell was not impressed .
" You only got it ' cause I told you it was coming ! "
He got the next batter on a foul pop to record his third out , and the delirious crowd gave Sewell a standing ovation as he left the field , gracious in apparent defeat .
Here , though , we must refer to Major League Baseball Rules 6.03 and 6.06 ( a ) :
" A batter 's legal position shall be with both feet within the batter 's box . "
and ,
" A batter shall be called out for illegal action when he hits a ball with one or both feet on the ground entirely outside the batter 's box . "
That was some pitch Sewell found in that old bag of tricks : not a single home run allowed in regular - season play , just one given up in an All - Star Game -- to one of the game 's greatest hitters -- and Williams might have cheated to get it .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - Democrat Barack Obama has asked three people , including Caroline Kennedy , to lead a search for a prospective vice presidential running mate , his campaign said on Wednesday .
Kennedy , daughter of former President John Kennedy , will be joined by former Fannie Mae CEO Jim Johnson , who performed the same task for John Kerry in 2004 and Walter Mondale in 1984 , and former deputy Attorney General Eric Holder .
“ Senator Obama is pleased to have three talented and dedicated individuals managing this rigorous process .
He will work closely with them in the coming weeks but ultimately this will be his decision and his alone , ” spokesman Bill Burton said .
Obama clinched the nomination on Tuesday and will face Republican John McCain in November ’s U.S. presidential election .
Julio Alonso , the founder of the leading Spanish blog network Weblogs SL , has been fined € 9,000 plus legal costs for comments made by other people on his personal blog .
What makes the story more interesting is that Alonso was sued by SGAE , ( the General Society of Authors and Publishers ) , the Spanish equivalent of the RIAA .
The post that ultimately led to the court case was made way back in 2004 , and was titled SGAE=Thieves .
That post then hit the top of the Spanish version of Google for the term “ ladrones ” ( Thieves ) .
It ’s not clear from the email Julio sent me ( nor the links provided ) exactly what the comments were , and as of July 4 they were removed per the court order .
What I did make out ( with some Google translate help ) is that the court found that the 22 comments posted by readers in response to that post had damaged the ‘ honor ’ of SGAE .
Alonso still has the right to appeal against the sentence .
The questions then raised : is it safe for anyone is Spain to offer open comments on a blog ?
and is this even a legal under European law ?
If you speak Spanish , you can follow the case on Julio ’s blog here , and I ’ll be keeping in touch with Julio as the appeal is put together ( I ’ve been following Weblogs SL since the early Blog Herald days ) .
I ’m not sure if there is anything we can do from outside of Spain , but I ’m sure many will join me in offering moral support to Julio at this time .
The city that they lost .

I believe we are all aware now that George W. Bush is a psychopath , with a personality disorder characterized by chronic immoral and antisocial behavior .
His mental health problem will be his only defense if the War Crime Tribunals catch up with him one day .
I will go through his " psychopath 's checklist " later .
Keep in mind that his full political agenda has not yet been entirely played out , and before it is over , George W. Bush will certainly present a perfect case of a full - fledged dictator .
We still have the time to stop him , but we wo n't for much longer .
So let 's explore what is really happening .
The following George W. Bush and Dick Cheney " Dictators ' Checklist " was gleaned from many websites , but is not exhaustive , and goes something like this :
1 ) a leader who holds and / or abuses an extraordinary amount of personal power ,
2 ) the power to make laws without effective restraint by a legislative assembly or a Constitution ,
3 ) cult of personality / megalomania ( like when someone states that God has spoken to him and told him to go to war , or when a leader portrays himself as the symbol of patriotism ) ,
4 ) head of the military , association with the military and wearing a military uniform ( which Bush did ) ,
5 ) repression of political or other opponents without abiding by rule of law procedures or moral and ethical code ( threatening and succeeding in shutting up one 's opponents , Bush has been highly successful at this ) ,
6 ) rule by decree ( losing the elections and yet proclaiming oneself the ruler ) ,
7 ) proclamation of a state of emergency to further one 's agenda ( 9/11 ) ,
8 ) suspension of civil liberties ( several terrorist acts , being able to imprison and convict people without due process , use of torture ) ,
9 ) control of mass media ( Fox Network at the very least , and probably most of the mass media since they are all so quiet about all this ) ,
10 ) suspension of elections following a large scale false flag / government sponsored terrorism event .
As you can see , everything has already been accomplished except for the last item : suspension of elections through a state of emergency .
Wikipedia states that modern dictators have usually come to power in times of emergency , and so we can certainly expect that someone as desperate as George W. Bush must be planning another state of emergency to fully establish his dictatorship .
Bush 's emergency is entirely predictable and likely ; it is just a question of time , months at most , probably weeks .
One could even argue that elections have already been suspended for two elections , through cheating in Florida and Ohio , and manipulation of voting machines .
Also that the main false flag / government sponsored terrorism events could be 9/11 and other terrorist acts in London and Spain , all of which point to false flag events .

Burnout Paradise ended up being a great entry in the series , and we 've known for a while now that the game would be enjoying some rather unexpected and beefy updates .
Critierion has also given word on a very neat feature : the ability upload your save game file to Criterion 's website and then see what you 've done and what you still have to do .
Sadly , this is only for the PS3 version , but it 's a neat idea for those of us who have the game for Sony 's console .
Here 's how it works : PS3 players with the recently - released Bogart software update will be able to import their save game via USB drive or Memory Stick and analyse it on criteriongames.com !
Based on that , we create an interactive map that allows you to view the location of all incomplete discoverables .
That includes Jumps , Smashes , Billboards , Junkyards , Body Shops , Paint Shops , Gas Stations and Car Parks .
Our technicians are just putting the final touches to this feature – we expect it to go live imminently !
I like things that come sooner rather than later .
If you have n't had a chance to play Paradise yet ( and you should ) , there is a metric ton of stuff to do in the game ; any way to make the job of finding out what you still need to do easier is welcome .
I hope more developers are paying attention to Criterion .
This is how you support your game after launch .
Israel ’s prime minister scammed his country ’s revered Holocaust memorial , a charity for disabled children and other groups out of $ 100,000 in a brazen double - billing scheme , investigators said yesterday .
They said Ehud Olmert personally ran the fraud and used the money to finance lavish family trips abroad .
One law - enforcement official said Olmert would have been arrested already if he were n’t prime minister .
The dramatic new charges sharply expanded the three - month probe and greatly increase the likelihood that Olmert will be indicted and forced from office .
Police revealed the new allegations after questioning the prime minister , for the third time , yesterday in what they described as a “ tense ” two - hour confrontation .
They turned the focus of the investigation to trips that Olmert took with his wife , Aliza , and children before he became prime minister in 2006 , when he was mayor of Jerusalem and a cabinet minister .
Olmert told detectives he financed the vacations through frequent - flier miles he accrued on his many foreign trips , including speaking tours of the United States .
But investigators suspect the real source was nearly $ 100,000 he amassed in a special bank account arranged with an Israeli travel agency , Rishon Tours .
They said Olmert often spoke abroad on behalf of groups like the Yad Vashem Holocaust memorial , a charity for mentally disabled children , and a support group for Israeli Defense Force soldiers .
But he would have Rishon Tours send the same bill for his trips to each of the groups , as if they were the only one paying .
A senior police officer with the national fraud unit said Rishon Tours “ acted like a bank branch for the Olmert family . ”
Police raided the Rishon Tours offices recently and seized documents .
Olmert ’s spokesman said the prime minister “ is convinced that he is innocent of any wrongdoing and firmly believes that , as this investigation continues , that innocence will become apparent to all . ”
Supporters said the police were making the investigation a “ personal campaign ” to oust Olmert .
But an Israeli newspaper quoted a law - enforcement source as saying “ anyone else would have been arrested ” by now .
Olmert has said previously he would step down if indicted .
Until now , the most damning evidence had come from Long Island businessman Morris Talansky , who tearfully testified in May that he tried to help Olmert ’s political career by giving him $ 150,000 in cash - stuffed envelopes .

Tortillas are a staple for some 40 m Mexicans surviving on little One is never enough .
Fill them with meat , with beans , with rice , with nothing , but one tortilla is never enough .
The size of a small plate , this soft , thin , unleavened corn bread is present at nearly every Mexican meal you eat .
Few people can make do with just one of them - a good half a dozen is about average .
That is , if you can afford it .
About 40 m Mexicans live on $ 5 ( £ 2.50 ) a day , or less .
More in the BBC News series :
Lesotho tackles crisis Cheap food era over
What should EU leaders do ?
Special report :
Food price crisis Tortillas are what these people live on , so they are much more than just bread .
And when the price of tortillas rises , it is big news .
That is why a recent announcement by Mexico 's National Chamber for the Tortilla and Dough Industry made such an impact .
The chamber predicted that tortilla prices would rise by about 18 % in the next month because of rising costs of fuel and corn .
It said the average price for a tonne of milled corn had gone from 3,000 pesos in January to 3,650 pesos now and that those rises would have to be passed on to consumers .
In simple terms , that would mean the price of a kilogram of tortillas would go up from about 8.5 pesos ( 80 US cents ) a kilo now to around 10 pesos a kilo in June .
Protest marches
If you live on $ 5 a day , that kind of increase is a big deal - and the government knows it .
Tens of thousands marched in protest at tortilla price rises last year Last year , tens of thousands of people marched in protest at similar price rises for tortillas .
People were angry and there were scuffles .
Many blamed American corn farmers for diverting their crops away to produce bio-fuels .
For a time the situation looked volatile .
The government stepped in to peg prices and it is making the same soothing noises now .
" My government wo n't remain with its arms crossed in the face of this problem , " Mexico 's President Felipe Calderon said recently .
His economy minister , Eduardo Sojo , added that the government was working with the tortilla industry to keep a lid on prices .
" There is no price increase , " he said .
" It will not go up tomorrow . "
And , to some extent , he is right .
Go to any street - corner vendor around Mexico City 's central Zocolo Square and prices appear stable - for now .
The government does not directly subsidise tortilla prices , but it offers help for transport and warehousing , which , in effect , helps keep the price at tolerable levels .
Record crop
But , with other forecasters predicting tortilla prices will shoot up by as much as 40 % , to 12 pesos a kilo , the government 's ability to deal with those market forces may not be so great .
The government has tried to help keep prices at reasonable levels
That is because inflation is already at a three - year high .
Growth is down in the past quarter and oil production is running at 400,000 fewer barrels than at the same time last year .
The situation has left the government 's bank balance short of 100bn pesos , according to Mr Calderon .
One bright note is that Mexico is on target for a record 2008 corn crop , which would mean two good harvests in a row .
But it is starting from a low base .
Even the president has admitted that the country 's ability to produce more grain is limited , because so many farmers have abandoned their fields in recent years to find better paid work in the neighbouring US .
" For many years , developing countries , in particular Mexico , faced the problem of very high subsidies in the United States and Europe , and this drove a lot of producers out of the competition , " Mr Calderon said .
" This has meant that when we see this rise in world demand for food , the reaction from the supply side is not as fast . "
Daunting reality
The irony is that this is happening in Mexico , the land where corn was first domesticated some 7,000 years ago .
If tortillas become too expensive for the poor , stability could be threatened Everyone has a favourite target to blame for all this .
Whether it is rising demand for food and fuel from India and China , or the North American Free Trade Agreement ( Nafta ) between Mexico and the United States , there are arguments to be made for cause and effect .
But countries like Mexico have to live with the daunting reality now , that prices of the core - of - life food so many millions rely on may soon start to rise beyond their reach .
And that could cause problems - a staple that may make a country unstable .
One tortilla may not be enough , but it may soon be all that many can afford .

Many of you have probably heard about or seen clips of the librarian , Carol Kreck , who was kicked out of a McCain town hall meeting in Denver .
( Just in case you have n’t click here . )
This is , in and of its self , more than a bit concerning .
However , more concerning is that this is not an isolated case .
Back in May , I attended an AFL - CIO event in Portland with a focus on McCain ’s health care plan .
The AFL - CIO had rented a room at the hotel where McCain was holding a fundraiser .
They then invited Mr. McCain to speak to a group of working class folks about his health care plan .
The invitation was never answered , not even to say , “ No , thank you . ”
Just before the AFL - CIO event started , a representative from the hotel came into the room to let the organizers of the event know that they were not to attempt to talk to Senator McCain .
Any attempt to go into the part of the hotel where the fundraiser was being held would result in arrest .
When the hotel representative was asked about who made the decision , he responded that he had been told this from McCain ’s campaign staff .
One of the organizers of the event then asked to hear the news directly from someone from the McCain staff .
The hotel employee left the room and retrieved a staffer for McCain .
She promptly recanted the statement the hotel employee had given the event organizers :
Any attempt to go into the area of the hotel where the McCain Fundraiser and to talk to Senator McCain would result in arrest .
So much for democracy and the free exchange of ideas .
Oh !
And that thing called the First Amendment .
I do not believe that the threat of arrest to the AFL - CIO event attendees or the ticketing and removal of Carol Kreck at these McCain events are special or isolated incidents .
McCain is obviously scared of being called on his BS and wants anyone who will do that removed .
We cannot continue to allow these kinds of threats to our freedoms .
Spread the word , and if McCain happens to be in your town , maybe take a video camera and see what happens .
Democracy depends on you and your actions .
PS - I heart the “ two peas in a pod ” costume that is in the background of the Carol Kreck video .
I kept getting distracted by that guy and had to watch the video several times to catch what was going on .
Also , Rachel Maddow had a great take on the Kreck incident while hosting " Countdown "
Here 's the video of that :
Using embryonic stem cells from mice , UT Southwestern Medical Center researchers have prompted the growth of healthy – and more importantly , functioning – muscle cells in mice afflicted with a human model of Duchenne muscular dystrophy .
The study represents the first time transplanted embryonic stem cells have been shown to restore function to defective muscles in a model of muscular dystrophy .
The researchers ’ newly developed technique , which involves stringent sorting to preserve all stem cells destined to become muscle , avoids the risk of tumor formation while improving the overall muscle strength and coordination of the mice , the researchers found .
The mice used in the study lacked dystrophin , the same protein that humans with the fatal wasting disease also are missing .
The study , headed by Dr. Rita Perlingeiro , assistant professor of developmental biology and molecular biology , is available online today and in the February issue of Nature Medicine .
“ We envision eventually developing a stem - cell therapy for humans with muscular dystrophy , if we are able to successfully combine this approach with the technology now available to make human embryonic stem cells from reprogrammed skin cells , ” Dr. Perlingeiro said .
“ These cells can be transplanted into the muscle , and they cause muscle regeneration resulting in stronger contractility . ”
The study represents a major step in the field , she said , because the researchers were able to tease out exactly the cells they wanted .
“ The problem had been that embryonic stem cells make everything , ” Dr. Perlingeiro said .
“ They make a great variety of cells .
The trick is to pull out only the one type you want . ”
The UT Southwestern researchers focused on manipulating genes that are active in the very early stages as embryonic stem cells start to develop into more specialized cells .
At first , they activated a gene called Pax3 , which is involved in creating muscle cells , and then injected those cells into the animals ’ muscles .
Those cells caused tumors containing many different types of cells , indicating that there were still residual undifferentiated embryonic stem cells in the cultures at the time of implantation .
“ Even if there are 10 undesirable cells , that ’s too many , ” Dr. Perlingeiro said .
The researchers then began using fluorescent dyes to sort cells depending on whether some surface markers were turned on while others were turned off .
By analogy , it was as if they were dealing with a crowd of people and wanted to pull out only those with red hair , green scarves and blue coats , while those with red hair , green scarves and no coats would be disqualified .
The final selection of cells , containing only one type , was again injected into the animals ’ hind - limb muscles .
After a month , the fluorescent dyes showed that the cells had deeply penetrated the muscle , an indication that they were growing and reproducing as desired , and many of the muscle fibers also contained dystrophin , the key protein lacking in muscular dystrophy .
After three months , the mice also showed no signs of tumors .
Tests of isolated muscles showed that the treated muscles were significantly stronger than untreated mice lacking dystrophin , although not quite as strong as those of normal mice .
The treated mice also were tested for coordination .
Again , their performance was better than that of untreated mice , but not as good as that of normal mice .
“ The improved coordination is significant because it shows the embryonic stem cells have benefited the animal ’s quality of life , not simply caused an isolated growth with no overall improvement , ” Dr. Perlingeiro said .
The researchers will next investigate whether these transplanted cells can make “ muscle stem cells , ” which are partially developed cells in muscle tissue that serve as a reserve to replenish muscles .
They also are testing their implantation approach in animal models of other types of muscular dystrophy .
Other UT Southwestern researchers involved in the study were lead author Dr. Radbod Darabi , postdoctoral researcher in developmental biology ; allied health student Kimberly Gehlbach ; Dr. Robert Bachoo , assistant professor of neurology and internal medicine ; Shwetha Kamath , research assistant in developmental biology ; Dr. Mitsujiro Osawa , postdoctoral fellow in developmental biology ; Dr. Kristine Kamm , professor of physiology ; and Dr. Michael Kyba , assistant professor of developmental biology and molecular biology .
The work was supported by the Dr. Bob and Jean Smith Foundation .
Cast member Mike Myers gestures at the premiere of " The Love Guru " at the Grauman 's Chinese theatre in Hollywood , California June 11 , 2008 .

LOS ANGELES ( Hollywood Reporter ) - After the “ Austin Powers ” trilogy , there was a sense that comedian Mike Myers had elevated his game .
He evolved the series from slapdash skits into real movies that had connective tissue and continuing characters .
“ Love Guru ” is a regressive step in the extreme .
Not only does the film stumble badly from one skit to another , but the skits themselves have too much dead air .
Neither Myers nor a group of hesitant actors -- who seem more like an endless number of sidekicks than supporting players -- show much confidence in the material .
They seem to deliver lines or perform bits so that they may quickly duck the rotten tomatoes surely headed their way .
Two film comedies go head to head this weekend , “ Love Guru ” and “ Get Smart , ” a strategy that ’s anything but smart on the studios ’ part .
But the real question is , which is the worst ?
Quite possibly “ Love Guru ” will out - awful “ Get Smart . ” Myers ’ name should ensure a respectable No. 2 finish , but all bets are off the following weekend .
The basic problem with “ Love Guru , ” as it was for “ Get Smart , ” is that the filmmakers never define the central joke .
Myers plays Guru Pitka , the No. 2 Near - Eastern Self - Help Specialist .
( Deepak Chopra is No. 1 . ) This inspires all sorts of spoofs of self - help mumbo jumbo , inane mantras , Bollywood dances and Beatles - era costumes .
These almost get lost , though , amid gags involving urination and defecation , elephants , ice hockey and penis size .
Not to mention Verne Troyer , the little person who played Mini - Me in two “ Austin Powers ” films , who here is the butt of endless size jokes as well .
Oddly , Myers entrusted his first film with a new character to a rookie director , Marco Schnabel , who directed second unit on all three “ Austin Powers ” films .
Schnabel not only lacks visual flair and the ability to pull together a style to link the skits , but he is probably too young and inexperienced to help Myers edit himself .
When , say , one in four gags hit with any force , there is a need for serious editing .
Guru Pitka is hired by the Toronto Maple Leafs owner ( Jessica Alba ) to reunite her star player ( Romany Malco ) with his wife ( Meagan Good ) , who is shacked up with Los Angeles Kings goalie Jacques “ Le Coq ” Grande ( Justin Timberlake ) ; on the eve of the NHL ’s Stanley Cup Finals , that turn of events has sent her player ’s game into the toilet .
This tissue - thin plot gets interrupted for flashbacks to Pitka ’s guru classes at an Indian ashram by an exalted cross-eyed guru played by Ben Kingsley .
A good actor is a terrible thing to waste , but this profligate film totally marginalizes Kingsley , Alba , Good and Malco .
Timberlake fairs not too badly because he has a fun caricature to play , a Quebecois goalie with a huge crush on Celine Dion and an even larger physical endowment .
The only actor who really scores is Stephen Colbert , who plays a drug - addled , sex - addicted hockey broadcaster .
He is absolutely hysterical .

Scientists have discovered a wave pattern , or oscillation , in Saturn 's atmosphere only visible from Earth every 15 years .
The pattern ripples back and forth like a wave within Saturn 's upper atmosphere .
In this region , temperatures switch from one altitude to the next in a candy cane - like , striped , hot - cold pattern .
The planet Saturndoes the wave in its atmosphere , but it 's only visible from Earth every 15 years , a new study finds .
Two decadesof staring at the ringed planet in ground - and space - based studies paid off whenscientists discovered a wavepattern similar to one found in Earth 's upper atmosphere .
" Youcould only make this discovery by observing Saturn over a long period oftime , " said the ground study ?s lead author Glenn Orton , a planetaryscientist at NASA 's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena , Calif .
" It 'slike putting together 22 years worth of puzzle pieces , collected by a hugelyrewarding collaboration of students and scientists from around the world onvarious telescopes . "
Researchfrom Orton ?s study and a space - based one using the Cassini spacecraft is detailedin the May 8 issue of the journal Nature .
The wavepattern ripples back and forth in Saturn 's upper atmosphere due to bands ofdifferent temperatures at various altitudes .
Changing temperatures force thewind to keep whipping back and forth from east to west , causing the entireregion to move like a wave .
NASA 's Cassinispacecraft provided a space - based infrared snapshot of Saturn 's wave inaction , allowing scientists to compare it with similar atmospheric patterns onEarth and Jupiter .
Earth 's wave takes about two years and Jupiter 's wave takesmore than four Earth years , but changes on Saturn may occur over much longerperiods of up to 30 Earth years , or one Saturn year .
" It 'sthis great synergy of using ground - based data over time , and then getting upclose and personal with the oscillation in Saturn 's atmosphere through Cassini , " said Mike Flasar , a principal scientist for Cassini at NASA 's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt , Md. , and co-author of the space - based study .
" Without Cassini , we might never have seen the structure of theoscillation in detail . "
Cassini'ssnapshot with its Composite Infrared Spectrometer further revealed thatSaturn 's equator flips from hot to cold .
The temperatures on either side of theequator also apparently switch every Saturn half - year .
Longerstudy of Saturn may allow scientists to better understand this phenomenon , andparticularly why the temperature switch happens as the sun is directly overSaturn 's equator .
Suchstrange climate behavior is hardly new for Saturn , which has displayed baffling weather such as a swirling hexagon circling its north pole .

Colonizers , merchants , and ruthless raiders , the Vikings swept out of Scandinavia to terrorize Europe in swift vessels like this Danish reproduction .
Ted Spiegel / National Geographic / Getty Images
It is late m­orning at a monastery on the coast of Ireland .
The year is 817 .
From the shore comes a cry of alarm -- dragon boats have appeared on the horizon , approaching quickly with wind filling their sails .
A monk runs into the monastery to warn the others .
This place holds Christian holy relics , gold , tapestries , jewels and spices .
It is also home to a small herd of cattle and other livestock , plus two dozen monks and several nuns .
All of these things make the monastery a magnet for the men on the dragon boats -- the Vikings .
Quickly the monks work to hide the holiest of artifacts , to mount some kind of defense , but the Vikings hit the shore with stunning speed .
They wear terrifying masks and helmets of iron , bearing iron swords and wooden shields .
The monks and nuns alike are slaughtered in the attack , and some of them are tortured .
Everything of value is loaded into the low - slung dragon boats , including the cattle and the holy relics .
The surviving men and women are captured ­as well -- they will be sold as thralls , slaves to their new Scandinavian masters .
Anything built of wood is set on fire .
By late afternoon , the site of the monastery is silent , the Vikings long - since gone , and nothing remains but ash .

This is the terror that swept much of Europe in the ninth through 11th centuries , the Age of Vikings .
These are the Vikings as we most commonly know them , through the writings of survivors , pop-culture depictions , and even their own epic sagas -- brutal , merciless raiders striking from the northern seas .
But the Vikings were more than raiders and pillagers .
They were a key part of a rich Scandinavian culture that not only ravaged the shores of Europe , but settled them as well .
Vikings founded Dublin , conquered Normandy , ruled more than half of England , and even discovered and settled in North America centuries before Christopher Columbus was born .
They also set up profitable trade routes that reached as far as North Africa .
Today we 're going to strip away the mythology and take a look the real Vikings and the culture that spawned them .
We 'll try to understand where they came from , what made them so bloodthirsty and what drove them to become one of the world 's superpowers at the apex of their era .
Then we 'll explore the mythology , in all its hammer - wielding , horned - helmeted , battle - crying glory .

But they were able to piece together a dramatic hour - by - hour diary of the nightmare which saw them carried away by the current and eventually stranded on an island with a deadly Komodo dragon - the world 's biggest lizard .
After taking diving courses in Thailand the couple , both from Devon , had worked their way through Indonesia before they reached Flores , the mysterious island where scientists claim to have found the sub - human they have named the Hobbit .
It is where pygmy elephants once roamed and where , on a tiny island to the west , the Komodo dragon still roams .

James Manning and his girlfriend Charlotte Allin smile on arrival in Bali's Airport , Kuta , Indonesia , today .
All five Europeans who went missing while scuba diving in treacherous waters were found alive Saturday on a remote island
The couple made contact with another Briton , Kath Mitchinson , who runs the Diveseekers Company on Flores .
They left for what was to be a three - day adventure among the spectacular coral reefs .
Their first two days of diving left them awestruck by the underwater beauty .
Then , last Thursday morning the couple set out with Miss Mitchinson , a French diver named Laurent Pinel and a Swedish woman , Helena Neradairen .
' We had a wooden dive boat and spent the early part of the day on a walking trip before starting that day 's dive , ' says Charlotte , whose family live in Bideford .
' We explored an underwater site called Hanging Garden , then at 3.05 pm we went down a second time to explore an area called Manta Corner . '
James took pictures with his waterproof camera .

Thursday , 4.10 pm : The party surface after 65 minutes , as arranged , 30 yards from the boat but the crew have their backs to the divers and do not see them .
' We blow whistles but still the crew do n't respond , so we put up an inflatable 4 fthigh orange marker buoy , again to no avail , ' says Charlotte .
' We have no cause for concern at that stage .
We are sure they will see us and pick us up .
But it does n't happen - the five of us find ourselves being swept further from the boat .
' At 5.15 pm we can still see the boat in the distance , but it is impossible for the crew to see us .
We decide to swim for land , but the current takes us around the first island we head for . '
Alive : Charlotte Allin
6 pm : Darkness begins to fall .
' We all agree as we swim together , kept afloat with our dive vests , that we have to make land , ' says Charlotte .
' But the currents have a different idea and push us around each island we approach . '
7 pm : ' We see lights of fishing boats but our shouts and whistles fail to attract attention .
We are all becoming weak .
Then a new problem arises - the cold .
While we had been warm as we dived , being exposed from the chest up , with water splashing down inside of our wetsuits , we begin to feel a chill running through our bodies .
' Weakness is going to be our main problem - will we have the strength to make it through the night ?
I am wondering that myself and I suspect the others are thinking the same . '
7.30 pm : ' We have an incredible stroke of luck .
A dead tree trunk , about 6ft long , drifts by .
We grab it and use it as a buoy to cling on to .
' What is frightening me is the night .
I do n't want to be out there in the dark , but we all know no one will be able to find us and we just have to hang on to that log .
I hook my arm through the back of Jim 's wetsuit gear and my other arm is around the log . '
8 pm : ' The wind stirs up waves that crash over us .
Helena , the Swedish girl , is badly seasick and getting weak and we have to make sure she hangs on to the log .
But nobody is crying or grumbling - we just try to keep talking about anything that comes into our minds to keep everyone awake . '
10.45 pm : ' The sea becomes calm as the wind drops .
By now we have discarded our weight belts , which were dragging us down .
But we are suffering from cramp from constantly kicking our flippers , trying to force the log to take us to land . '
Midnight : ' Jim and Kath decide to break away from the log and swim to land , believing they can see the outline of a white beach in the darkness .
They are almost dashed against rocks by the surf and Kath has to return to the log .
But Jim manages to make it to the beach - which turns out to be nothing but light - coloured large boulders and rocks .
He believes the group can get in and eventually manages to help us all in to the beach , particularly Helena who is now pretty weak . '
Friday , 12.52 am : ' We 're all assembled on the beach , hugging one another , collapsing on to our knees , ' says Charlotte .
' We 've been in the water for nearly nine hours . '
By sunrise , the group are all bitterly cold after lying in their soaking wetsuits all night in the hope that it would be warmer than taking them off .
' Jim decides to try to find help after Kath tells him she believes we are on Pandaua island , where there will be fishing boats moored off one of the bays , ' says Charlotte .
In fact they are on a deserted island called Rindja - one of the homes of the Komodo dragon .
Kath tries to accompany Jim because she speaks the local language but as they scale a steep slope he tells her to go back because it is too dangerous .
It is now that he has to use all his training from his days in Iraq and Afghanistan as a member of 59 Independent Commando Squadron RE .
He has taken off his wetsuit and is now in an undervest , shorts and slim rubber diving boots .
8 am : He is almost at the top of a cliff when a snake wriggles in front of him , causing him to reel back and almost fall .
10 am : He suffers a second shock - knocking back a branch he almost disturbs a huge bee colony .
' If the branch had hit them they would have gone berserk .
It terrified me much more than the snake . '
There are dried stream beds all around but not a drop of water to be had .
11 am : Back on the beach , the other four are desperately trying to make a fire , using a magnifying glass Kath had in her diving gear , but all they manage to make is smoke and no flame .
' The thirst is terrible , ' says Charlotte .
' My lips are swollen and white .
It is just unbearable and we know we have to try to find water .
There was shade from big rocks in the morning but the sun is getting higher and we are losing that shade .
There are no trees .
The sun is very , very , hot . '
Noon : ' I find a coconut and break it open hoping to find milk , but it is rotten inside .
Desperate for food and water , we turn to scooping mussels and other things off the rocks .
At least we are getting protein and there are some juicy bits . '
1 pm : The party build the letters SOS with huge white rocks on the side of the hill , hoping to attract a boat .
' It is very hard work , ' says Charlotte .
' The sun is beating down and the rocks are very heavy , but we have to do it to attract attention . '
2 pm : As thirst attacks Charlotte again , Kath tells her : ' Pretend that you have just had a long , cool , icy , drink . '
It helps her overcome the craving for water .
4 pm: By now Jim has scrambled down cliffs and tried to make his way around the coast by clambering over rocks and swimming , but seems to be getting nowhere .
It is dangerous work .
Several times he knows he could have been smashed against rocks .
And exhaustion is driving him to his knees .
' One thing keeps me going , ' he says .
' One phrase , over and over again , " You 've got to get help for Char and the others .
They are depending on you .
You 're the scout - do your work " . '
At the same time , back at the beach , a Komodo dragon lumbers into view .
More than 10ft long , it can easily kill a human with its massive jaws and toxic saliva .
In its mouth is the wetsuit Jim left behind when he began his scouting .
The giant lizard almost bites Helena in the head as it snatches at her wetsuit hood , lying beside her .
' We eventually chase it off using stones and Kath pokes at it with a stick , ' says Charlotte .

5 pm : ' We 're desperate on the beach and we know by now we will have to spend another night in this rocky , isolated place , uncertain whether a major search has been launched for us .
A plane has passed overhead but it did n't see us .
We 've also seen boats in the distance , but again our frantic waving , whistling and calling went unheeded .
I do n't know if Jim is alive or dead . '
5.15 pm : On a rocky outcrop around the coast , Jim sees two people on a beach .
' I yell and scream at them but they do n't turn around .
Finally I realise they are just two rocks that look like people .'
6.45 pm : He settles in for the night .
He does not know what has happened to Charlotte and the others .
He has gone too far to turn back .
He just knows he must stay warm , find some strength to carry on looking for help when the next morning breaks .
Back at the beach , the four try to sleep and ignore their crippling thirst .
Dawn :
On their different parts of the island , the five pray for rain and rescue .
12.30 pm : Jim 's prayers are answered .
A speedboat comes into the bay , heading towards the rock on which he is lying .
People on board are waving , cheering .
There is Charlotte waving among them .
The ordeal is over .
German Frank Winkler , who runs another dive club , had worked out where the divers could be , taking account of the current and tides , and his calculation proved right .
Yesterday : Charlotte , Jim and Kath sit in a jungle clearing on an island off Flores .
They are cut and bruised .
Their throats are scarred from the chafing of their wetsuits .
But they are alive .
On Monday Jim and Charlotte will fly home and start looking for work .
' It will be lovely to see Devon again , ' says Charlotte .
' I thought of the green hills and the moors when I was in the water .
It will be lovely to touch it .'

FBI slowed terror investigation by using ' secret letter ' John Byrne
Published : Tuesday April 15 , 2008

Print This Email This Documents undermine FBI defense of ' National Security Letters '
The use of National Security Letters by the Bush Administration has long been controversial -- allowing the Justice Department and the FBI to demand financial and telephone records , e-mails and conduct surveillance without the supervision of a court .
The FBI says these letters are critical to law enforcement , because it allows the agency to act in a more timely manner with regard to terrorist suspects than waiting for a court - issued warrant .
But new documents , obtained by the Electronic Frontier Foundation , seem to upend that claim .
In the investigation of a student suspected of links to terrorism , the FBI delayed its own investigation by employing an improper NSL to seek information on the suspect , at the direction of FBI Headquarters .
The FBI failed to report the misuse for almost two years .
The report comes on the eve of hearings in the House and Senate on the misuse of the letters .
" This report raises important questions about the FBI 's use of these very powerful investigative tools , " said EFF Senior Staff Attorney Kurt Opsahl .
" Congress should determine why FBI headquarters insisted on an improper NSL instead of using the appropriate tools , and why the FBI failed to report the misuse for almost two years . "
More from the Electronic Frontier Foundation :
In the report , EFF used documents obtained through a Freedom of Information Act ( FOIA ) request coupled with public information to detail the bizarre turns in the FBI 's investigation of a former North Carolina State University student .
Over the span of three days in July of 2005 , FBI documents show that the bureau first obtained the educational records of the suspect with a grand jury subpoena .
However , at the direction of FBI headquarters , agents returned the records and then requested them again through an improper NSL .
As expanded by the PATRIOT Act , the FBI can use NSLs to get private records about anyone 's domestic phone calls , e-mails and financial transactions without any court approval -- as long as it claims the information could be relevant to a terrorism or espionage investigation .
However , NSL authority does not allow the government to seek educational records , and the university refused the request .
The FBI finally obtained the documents again through a second grand jury subpoena .
Later in July of 2005 , FBI Director Robert Mueller used the delay in gathering the records as an example of why the FBI needed administrative subpoena power instead of NSLs so investigations could move faster .
" The FBI consistently asks for more power and less outside supervision , " said Opsahl .
" Yet here the NSL power was misused at the direction of FBI headquarters , and only after review by FBI lawyers .
Oversight and legislative reforms are necessary to ensure that these powerful tools are not abused . "

How Will Good News in Iraq Affect Obama Vs. McCain ?
Recent successes in Iraq could affect presidential candidates in unexpected ways
June 9 , 2008  --
Their strong views on the Iraq War helped them stand out from their competitors during the presidential primaries .
And Republican John McCain and Democrat Barack Obama 's sharp policy differences on the conflict continue to define them as the presumptive nominees prepare for the general election .
But the recent spurt of good news out of Iraq -- from the drop in American casualties to the increasing political stability of the Maliki government -- presents new challenges for both candidates and could change the dynamic of the race .
Recent success in Iraq " would seem to hurt Obama , but it seems as though many Americans have a fixed opinion about this and are impervious to changing facts , " said James E. Campbell , chairman of the political science department at the University of Buffalo .
" It will take some time and continued success in Iraq to change those numbers . "
Obama , who touts his early opposition to the war and was skeptical of the surge policy last summer that increased the number of American troops on the ground , has acknowledged that things have improved in Iraq .
But Obama has said that good news only reinforces his argument that troops should start withdrawing from Iraq .
McCain , who repeatedly promoted a surge policy until the Bush administration took action , has basked in the apparent success of the surge and criticized Obama for supporting a withdrawal , telling ABC News ' Charles Gibson , " I believe if we 'd done what he said -- and I think it 's becoming clearer to the American people -- there would have been chaos , genocide , and we'd have been back . "
The facts on the ground have changed substantially in recent months .
Violence across Iraq hit a four - year low in May , according to the U.S. military , and the number of American casualties that month were the lowest since the invasion .
Starting with security gains in Anbar province , the surge was replicated in parts of Baghdad and spread to some of the Shiite areas .
And Iraqi security forces have taken the lead in several difficult operations in Basra , Sadr City and Mosul , reported ABC News ' Jonathan Karl .
On the political front , Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al - Maliki 's government , after much stagnation , has never been stronger .
And there has been some success on several of the benchmarks long - sought by the Bush administration as evidence of progress .
Last week , 100 delegations at a Stockholm conference scheduled to discuss the country 's progess according to a five - year peace and economic development plan titled the International Compact with Iraq expressed their confidence in the country 's recent changes .
They adopted a declaration that stated they " recognized the important efforts made by the [ Iraqi ] government to improve security and public order and combat terrorism and sectarian violence across Iraq . "
In his speech at the conference , United Nations chief Ban Ki-moon said Iraq was " stepping back from the abyss that we feared most . "
Of course , it may be too early to predict what recent events will mean for troop levels , and there is no guarantee that some of the positive developments will last .
Essential government services and economic development still lag , according to Karl .
In recent days , McCain has stepped up his attacks on Obama , questioning the Democrat 's judgment on the surge and claiming that Obama lacks a " fundamental understanding of the entire situation that warranted the surge . "
The Republican has also criticized the fact that Obama has not made a trip to Iraq since 2006 and is certain to pressure the Democrat to make such a trip during the campaign season .
Although , the recent successes in Iraq would seem to benefit McCain , the actual effect on the general election is difficult to predict , say campaign observers .
And part of that is due to the unique nature of the Iraq conflict compared to previous wars , said Scott Sigmund Gartner , professor of political science at University of California at Davis .
" It 's not clear what winning or losing is here , " he said .
" In World War II , you 've got Gen .
Patton chewing up miles across Europe .
The relationship between good news and the outcome you want is clear .
Here the good news itself could be the outcome .
" The McCain view is that the news is good , let 's keep going .
It 's working .
But you can also ask the question :
Why do we need to be there if things are good ?
And that is Obama 's argument . "
Gartner said the crucial factor that could affect the election in coming months is American casualties .
" If the growth and rate remains low , it 's much easier for McCain to make the case that Obama is being a pessimist , " he said .
" If , however , American casualties start increasing , even if they 're lower but the direction is up , my research would suggest that it would be hard for McCain to make the case for the war . "
One stubborn problem for the McCain campaign will be the intransigence of the American public , which continues to oppose the war despite the recent improvements .
Just over six in 10 Americans say U.S. efforts to bring stability and order to Iraq are going badly , with a third saying " very badly , " according to a CBS News poll this week .
Those numbers have n't changed much since April .
While there remains a sharp partisan break , with 83 percent of Democrats saying things are going badly versus 29 percent of Republicans , a majority of independents agree with the Democrats .
If McCain is able to heighten public attention to the war progress , he might be able to succesfully call Obama 's judgment into question by arguing he is not open to the changing facts on the ground , said Campbell , at the University of Buffalo .
" One big factor in the 2006 elections was that the voters saw that the administration was nonresponsive to the facts , " he said .
" They just kind of dug in .
If centrists in American politics see Obama in that light , it 's going to hurt him . "
In the last year , the Iraq War has fallen out of the headlines , and it is unclear how that lack of media attention could influence public opinion on the issue .
Comparing the first 10 weeks of 2007 and 2008 , the amount of time devoted to Iraq on network news programs fell from 23 percent to 3 percent , according to a study by the Project for Excellence in Journalism .
Gary Schmitt , an informal foreign policy adviser to the McCain campaign , said the argument over Iraq
War policy will focus on independent voters given the partisan divide on the issue , and that the good news out of Iraq will hurt Obama .
" [ Obama 's ] got a problem when it comes to pulling out the troops and he 's waffled on the issue , " Schmitt said .
" Now he 's got to argue that we 've got to pull out because things are going better , but that will remind people that things are going better . "
McCain 's strategy on the issue in coming months will be to make it an issue of judgment , said Tom Donnelly , an informal adviser to the McCain campaign .
" McCain can say with some credibility , ' I was for the surge before the Bush administration and look how it 's worked . '
He can show that when times are hard , he 's got the intestinal fortitude to choose the harder right over the easier wrong . "
As he has done in recent weeks , McCain will likely argue that Obama has been pessimistic on Iraq , said Donnelly .
" There is one exception to [ Obama 's ] ' Yes , we can " mantra , " he said .
" [ Obama 's ] argument in Iraq has always been ' No , we can 't ' and McCain can say that he found a way to succeed .
...
There has always been the follow - up question , how do we get out .
You do n't want to get out in a dishonorable way or in a way that creates greater chaos . "
Richard Danzig , one of Obama 's national security advisers , said that while the recent military success is admirable , there has been less progress on the political front , and what is required is a strategy that ratchets up pressure on Iraqis to come to terms with some difficult decisions .
" Our view is that an indefinite American presence is not a good thing , " he said .
" A plan for withdrawal of combat troops is the most likely thing to catalyze action .
This has a second big advantage in that it frees American resources for reallocation to Afghanistan where you have absolutely critical issues regarding terrorism and it enables the rebuilding of the American military . "
He emphasized that a strategy of withdrawal can be undertaken responsibly , leaving an American military presence in Iraq " with a substantial ability to search out terrorists , to train Iraqis , to protect our embassy , and to provide a hedge against risks there . "
Another adviser to the Obama campaign argued that while the surge has brought about phenomenal changes on the ground , security remains fragile and the situation in Iraq can change overnight , just as the bombing of the al - Askari Mosque in Samarra in 2006 , which plunged the country into horrific sectarian violence , showed .
( Found |Read interviewed me about Y Combinator , but edited the questions and answers so much that the sense was often changed .
Here are my original answers .
I 've used their new questions whenever possible , but kept the original ones when they 'd changed so much that my answer became mysterious . )
F|R : What is the mathematical function from which Y Combinator takes its name , and why did you choose this ?
Graham :
It 's a function that builds recursive functions without them needing to have names .
The Y Combinator is one of those things that seems miraculous when you first encounter it .
You would n't necessarily have expected such a thing to be possible .
We named the company after it partly because we thought it was such a cool concept , and partly as a secret signal to the kind of people we hoped would apply .
F|R : How quickly can you now tell whether a start - up will make it ?
And what are the key characteristics that indicate potential success to Y Combinator ?
Graham :
We can never tell for sure .
No investor can .
But we are trying hard to get better at predicting .
I think the key quality is determination .
The founders who do the best are the type of people who just refuse to fail .
Most startups have at least one low point where any reasonable person would give up .
That bottleneck is the reason there are so few successful startups .
The only people who get through it are the ones who have an unreasonable aversion to failing .
F|R : Several copycat incubators have sprung up since Y Combinator launched in 2005 ( TechStars , Y Europe , Seedcamp , BoostPhase ) .
Can your model be replicated ?
Graham :
There are a few things they have n't copied correctly , but really it 's not our model that distinguishes us .
It 's the people that make the difference — not just us , but the 250 or so founders we 've now funded .
The amount of knowledge accumulated in all these heads is remarkable .
F|R : I read that when you call Y Combinator winners , the founders have only five minutes to accept .
( " If people turn us down , " he says , " as far as we 're concerned they 've failed an IQ test . " )
Have startups turned you down ?
Are there any that have turned Y Combinator down and still gone on to succeed with a liquidity event ?
Graham :
You 're confusing two separate things .
The reason people are supposed to decide quickly whether or not to accept is that they already know everything except the percent we 'll ask for .
They 've already seen the deal terms , and they already know as much as they 're going to know about YC before actually working with us .
So they should already know when we call what percentage they'd be ok with .
Since all they have to do is subtract one integer from another , five minutes should be enough .
The " IQ test " quote refers not to how fast they have to decide , but the amount of equity we usually ask for .
In the median case it 's 6 % .
If we take 6 % , we have to improve a startup 's outcome by 6.4 % for them to end up net ahead .
That 's a ridiculously low bar .
So the IQ test is whether they grasp that .
There was one startup that turned us down because they received an acquisition offer during the weekend when we did interviews .
It was a pretty good offer .
I 'd have taken it in their position , and they did .
But other than that I do n't know of anyone who turned us down and went on to succeed .
There have only been about three others who turned us down .
F|R : How did you determine the 12 - week term of each Y Combinator class ?
Why is two months too short , or six months too long to " incubate " a startup ?
Graham :
We discovered it by accident .
When we first started YC , we began with a summer program .
We were trying to learn how to be investors , so we invited college students to come to Cambridge and start startups instead of getting summer jobs .
Now we 're looking for founders who consider the startup as a real job , not just a summer one .
But we kept the 3 month cycle because it is a good length of time to build a version 1 .
Some startups may not be able to launch in such a short time , but they should all be able to build something impressive .
F|R : Name one thing founders can do to increase their odds of being selected by Y Combinator .
Is Andreessen right that " the market " matters more than the idea , the tech , and even the talent ?
Graham :
Get good cofounders .
You can't change who you are , at least not in a short time .
And the idea does n't matter to us as much as the people .
So the best thing any indvidual can do is find good people to work with .
I think Marc may be right that market is the biggest determinant in the outcome of successful startups .
But that 's not unrelated to the qualities of the founders .
Smart people will find big markets .
DUBAI ( Reuters ) - Osama bin Laden will issue a “ very strong ” statement to Muslims across the world soon , an Islamist website said on Sunday .
“ A very strong statement to the Islamic nation by the lion of Islam sheikh Osama bin Laden , ” read a banner posted on the al Qaeda - linked website .
The website said the statement would be issued “ soon ” , without giving further details .
Such messages usually appear within 72 hours .
In his latest message , posted on Friday to mark Israel ’s 60th anniversary , bin Laden vowed to continue fighting the Jewish state and its allies in the West .
In a message on March 20 , he urged Muslims to maintain the struggle against U.S. forces in Iraq as a path toward “ liberating Palestine ” .
Al Qaeda has vowed attacks on Jews both inside and outside Israel and regularly expresses support for the Palestinians .
The Saudi - born militant leader was based in Afghanistan until its Taliban rule was overthrown by U.S. - led forces in 2001 after the September 11 attacks .
Since then , U.S. and Pakistani officials have said they believe he and his top aide Ayman al - Zawahri are hiding somewhere on the Afghanistan - Pakistan border .
Al Qaeda says it seeks to punish Washington and its allies for bias toward Israel at the expense of Muslims ’ interests and their “ crusades ” in Muslim countries -- the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq .

Former South African leader Nelson Mandela has added his voice to the growing international condemnation of the political violence in Zimbabwe .
In his first public comments about the crisis , he noted " the tragic failure of leadership " of President Robert Mugabe .
Southern African leaders earlier called for Friday 's run-off presidential vote to be postponed because conditions did not permit a free and fair election .
Opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai has urged foreign help to end the crisis .
Speaking at a dinner in London to mark his 90th birthday , Mr Mandela said : " We watch with sadness the continuing tragedy in Darfur .
Nearer to home we have seen the outbreak of violence against fellow Africans in our own country and the tragic failure of leadership in our neighbouring Zimbabwe . "
Mr Mandela had held his silence until now , says the BBC 's diplomatic correspondent James Robbins , to avoid undermining South Africa 's President Thabo Mbeki 's efforts as chief mediator on Zimbabwe .
Mr Mbeki 's policy of " quiet diplomacy " has been criticised for its failure to resolve the crisis in Zimbabwe .
Nelson Mandela spoke few words but they will carry immense weight simply because of who he is , says our correspondent .
I am asking the AU [ African Union ] and Sadc to lead an expanded initiative supported by the UN to manage what I will call a transitional process
Morgan Tsvangirai
Harare diary : Shell - shocked Can Sadc solve Zimbabwe 's crisis ?
Mugabe stripped of knighthood Earlier on Wednesday , southern African leaders holding an emergency summit in Swaziland called for the run -off vote to be postponed .
The governments of Swaziland , Tanzania and Angola said conditions would not permit a free and fair election .
The three countries from the Southern African Development Community ( Sadc ) are responsible for overseeing peace and security in the region .
The leaders said they were concerned and disappointed by Morgan Tsvangirai 's withdrawal on Sunday from the vote .
But they said that holding the election under the present circumstances might undermine the credibility and legitimacy of its outcome .
They also said the people of Zimbabwe deserved a " cooling - off period " .
Knighthood stripped
The opposition Movement for Democratic Change ( MDC ) , says some 86 of its supporters have been killed and 200,000 forced from their homes by militias loyal to the ruling Zanu - PF party .
The government blames the MDC for the violence .
Mr Tsvangirai said he withdrew from the election over fears for the lives of his supporters .
President Robert Mugabe has vowed to go ahead with Friday 's vote
The government and Zimbabwe 's election authority insist Friday 's vote will go ahead because Mr Tsvangirai 's withdrawal came too late to prevent his name appearing on the ballot paper and was therefore invalid .
Mr Mugabe officially came second to Mr Tsvangirai in the first round in March .
The governing Zanu - PF party , led by Mr Mugabe , also lost its parliamentary majority for the first time since independence in 1980 .
' Sham vote '
The crisis has drawn growing international condemnation of Mr Mugabe and his government .
Britain has said it will withdraw an honorary knighthood granted to President Robert Mugabe .
Mr Mugabe is the first foreigner to be stripped of the award since Romanian dictator Nicolae Ceausescu in 1989 , the day before his execution .

US President George W Bush said Friday 's vote appeared " to be a sham " because the opposition had not been able to campaign without fear of intimidation .
The US has said it will not recognise the results of the vote .
Mr Tsvangirai has appealed for the African Union and Zimbabwe 's neighbouring states to intervene to resolve the situation .
" I am asking the AU [ African Union ] and Sadc to lead an expanded initiative supported by the UN to manage what I will call a transitional process , " he said at a news conference in Harare .
Dismissing Friday 's planned election as pointless , he said Zimbabwe should work out a political settlement based on genuine and honest dialogue .
Mr Mugabe has said his government was open to negotiations with " anyone " but only after the elections .

Meet the make - believe strategists of TV
Jane Fleming Kleeb went on “ The O’Reilly Factor ” two weeks ago to talk about global warming , a topic on which , by her own admission , she ’s hardly an expert .
So who , then , is Jane Fleming Kleeb ?
Well , according to the Chyron that flashed across the screen after Bill O’Reilly introduced her , she is a “ Democratic strategist . ”
But she ’s hardly that , either .
“ The first time they called me a strategist , ” Fleming Kleeb recalls , “ I literally laughed on TV . ”
Advertisement
She kept a straight face this time , however , because she has grown accustomed to the misbegotten label .
It all started in 2006 , when Fleming Kleeb , the deputy director of Young Voter PAC , was asked to appear on MSNBC and Fox to talk about young voters .
She did well enough in those early forays that she was soon brought back on the air to discuss a wider range of political matters .
Thus , Fleming Kleeb was anointed a “ Democratic strategist ” and made regular appearances on cable news shows as such , before decamping from Washington for Nebraska , where her husband is running for a U.S. Senate seat .
She now makes about one appearance per week via satellite feed from the heartland .
“ There is a whole group of us like that , ” says Fleming Kleeb .
Indeed there is .
Among the things that the proliferation of TV cable news has wrought is slackened standards for what constitutes a political strategist .
Now used as a catchall tag for a whole host of people with varied — and often peripheral — backgrounds in electoral politics , the term has all but lost its meaning .
“ I think it ’s absurd , ” says Ed Rollins , a bona fide strategist who has held high - ranking positions in numerous Republican presidential campaigns .
“ Everyone calls themselves a strategist .
I have been doing this for 40 years , I know most of the players , and I go on these shows and think , ‘ Who are these people ? ’ ”
“ It ’s like Noah ’s ark .
There are a couple of these people , a couple of those people , with no skill and no real analytical ability . ”
As Fleming Kleeb tells it , this group of make - believe strategists has become something of a pundits club , with participants working together to compensate for each other ’s experiential or informational deficiencies .
“ There is a small group of us that rely on one another to help each other with talking points , ” she says .
“ Then I have a small group of friends who make sure it ’s on message with the Democratic talking points . ”
Of course , the very benefit of bringing a strategist on the air is to break through the echo chamber of talking points .
“ If you are a professional political strategist , ” says CNN Political Director Sam Feist , “ this is what you ’ve done for your career .
You have worked on a campaign or been a significant member of a campaign team . ”
The morning before she went on O’Reilly ’s program , Fleming Kleeb said she distributed an e-mail to her kitchen cabinet — a cadre that includes the likes of Democratic National Committee spokesman Dag Vega — to bandy about her talking points for the show .
“ Many of these sort of more junior folks who have sort of made it into the ranks of analyst / commentator / strategist , ” says one high - ranking cable news executive , “ are only too happy to talk about things they do n’t know about .
Part of the problem is that because , again , they ’re very glib , they ’re good on TV .
And if you ask someone the question and they give you a good - sounding answer , you might not know by asking them that it ’s not their area of expertise . ”
Others concur that the fractured nature of cable news time , particularly midday , allows almost anyone who ’s articulate and politically inclined to act like a campaign insider .
Rollins , who often appears on CNN himself , blames the cable news networks for “ dumbing down ” good analysis in the name of multitudinous voices .
“ I think the networks are idiotic in that they have capable people who have been around , but they want 12 panels , ” he says .
Independent TV analyst Andrew Tyndall thinks the “ mislabeling ” is also the product of the media ’s unyielding “ bid to seem as though they are inside the horse race . ”
For those who are actually in the strategy business , the armchair quarterbacking can be maddening at times .
“ What ’s frustrating for people who worked on campaigns is seeing these folks second - guessing decisions every day , ” says one Republican strategist who has been a veteran of several presidential campaigns .
“ It has to be like an astronaut who spent their whole career and life trying to get to space , and you ’ve got somebody who has never been there giving you an opinion of what it ’s like on the moon . ”
Close observers and participants in the cable news cycle say that , while this trend has been afoot for years , it seems to have reached a new apex this election cycle , fueled perhaps by the interest in attracting a more diverse crew of expositors .
“ It truly is about availability , ” says the cable news executive .
“ Everyone is always interested in having a wide spectrum of guests , whether that ’s a woman or people of color , but I would n’t necessarily say that ’s the reason .
The principal reason is the amount of hours to fill . ”
Tom Rosenstiel , director of the Project for Excellence in Journalism , sees this incidentally elevating the position of the TV booker in the modern cable news culture .
“ That is often a young person who is told by the show producer , ‘ We are going to talk about X ; we need some people who can talk about that .
Find some people , ’ says Rosenstiel .
“ And the bookers tend to watch other shows , so if they see somebody who is interesting or provocative , they think those people would be interesting . ”
Betsy Goldman , who worked as a booker and producer for CNN and MSNBC from 1988 to 2006 , says that , when it came to identifying guests , she “ never paid attention to it .
I would just put ‘ strategist ’ or ‘ consultant . ’ ”
Goldman , who now runs an on - air placement firm , says that news programs have become far more interested in the TV footage reels of potential guests than in their backgrounds or résumés .
“ When I was coming along , we never looked at their picture , ” she says .
“ I was talking on the phone to see if they were a good talker and if they had credentials .
Now they just want to see if they were good - looking . ”
When it comes to presenting talking heads to the TV viewing public , Goldman says , “ it ’s pretty easy to just throw up that title as a ‘ strategist . ’
Nobody is going to check it . ”
If you do check , you ’re certain to find that many of the faces appearing are n’t quite what they ’re cracked up to be .
Recently , CNN contributor Amy Holmes was filling in as a guest co-host for Glenn Beck ’s “ Headline News ” show .
Before Holmes was a “ CNN political analyst , ” she was often labeled by the network as a “ Republican strategist , ” even though her only experience working for a politician was in the role of speechwriter for former Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist .
Holmes got her big TV break during the 2000 election , when MSNBC invited her on to talk shop alongside Chris Matthews , Brian Williams and Paul Begala .
“ You ’re just learning as you go along , ” Holmes recalls of her maiden voyage into campaign coverage .
“ Who ever knew about chads and hanging chads ?
I had not worked on campaigns , so I did not have that knowledge . ”
Holmes does n’t claim to be a strategist , and she says that she has been talking with CNN recently about her TV classification , concerned that the “ Republican strategist ” label gives her audience the wrong impression about her background .
“ If it has happened , it is by accident , ” says Feist , “ because I do n’t consider her to be a political strategist , and we do n’t describe Amy Holmes as a political strategist . ”
Frequent Fox and MSNBC guest Laura Schwartz says she asks producers to identify her on air as an “ analyst , ” yet she is still often designated as a “ Democratic strategist . ”
She says it depends on what show she ’s on .
Schwartz also says that , when she was under exclusive contract at Fox , she would be identified as a “ political analyst ” on O’Reilly ’s show and then as a “ Democratic strategist ” on “ Hannity & Colmes . ”
While Schwartz spent eight years in the Clinton White House , her jobs were hardly those of a political strategist .
She was press secretary for the Midwest , director of television and then special assistant to the president and White House director of events .
Several sources who were interviewed for this story voluntarily offered her up as the quintessential make - believe strategist .
“ ‘ Political strategist ’ is a term that can be very broad or very narrow , ” says Angela McGowan , who has been appearing on Fox News since 1999 , sometimes as a “ Republican strategist . ”
“ You ’ve had Hispanic activists for years helping with the Hispanic community and spreading issues that impact the community , ” she says .
“ You had black activists ; you had political strategists during the civil rights movement .
‘ Political strategist ’ can also be taken from the standpoint of fundraising .
...
You can be in front of the stage , behind the stage , or you can be the secret weapon . ”
McGowan rejects the notion that a strategist should be defined purely by conventional Beltway establishment standards .
She considers herself to have as much of a right to claim the title as anyone else on TV , even though her most recent strategic work consisted of being director of government affairs for News Corp. and an unregistered lobbyist in Mississippi for casino magnate Steve Wynn .
To their credit , the cable networks have begun running additional graphics that further detail a guest ’s résumé while he or she is speaking .
But the networks still keep handing out the term “ strategist ” like it ’s candy .
“ If you had a bunch of us in a room and asked if we are political strategists , ” says Fleming Kleeb , “ I think you would get a lot of laughter . ”
Federal regulators are prepared to take action against sellers of Internet access that want to restrict what their customers can do online .
Kevin J. Martin , chairman of the Federal Communications Commission , said Friday that Comcast , the nation ’s largest cable company , should be sanctioned because it had interfered with the Internet connections of users who were exchanging files with other people .
Mr. Martin ’s recommendation is a strong push for network neutrality , the idea that Internet access providers like Comcast should not be allowed to favor some uses of their networks over others .
Internet companies like Google and free speech advocates have backed this approach .
The cable and phone companies that provide most of the nation ’s Internet service have argued that such rules were not needed .
They have said that they should be free to run their networks as they see fit , and that there had been no cases of problems with such discrimination .
On Tuesday Arab and Muslim countries defended a resolution they pushed through at the United Nations , to have the body 's expert on free speech police individuals and news media for negative comments on Islam .
Muslim Fears Muslim leaders discuss Islamophobia
The Media Line 2 - day Dakar summit focuses on expressions of anti-Muslim sentiments in West , situation in Palestinian territories Muslim leaders discuss Islamophobia
" The resolution adopted attempts to legitimize the criminalization of expression , " Warren W. Tichenor , the US Ambassador to the UN in Geneva told the 47 - nation body .
According to Tichenor , the statement proposed by Egypt and Pakistan , which passed 32 to zero last week at the council , seeks to impose " restrictions on individuals rather than to emphasize the duty and responsibility of governments to guarantee , uphold , promote and protect human rights . "
The resolution was the latest move initiated by the Arab and Muslim countries dominating the council to protect Islam from religious hatred and defamation .
In defense of the resolution they cited the 2006 incident in which a Danish magazine published caricatures of Muhammad .
They also referred to the Pope 's recent controversial comments on the religion , and the recent release of ' Fitna ' , the anti-Islamic Dutch film .
From protection to limitation
Slovenia 's ambassador , Andrej Logar , speaking on behalf of the European Union , warned that Ligabo 's role as an independent expert was shifting from protecting free speech toward limiting it .
Ligabo said in an interview last month that he was against any incitement of hatred based on religious belief .
" But , " he said , " We advocate the rights of individuals , not of a particular belief or ideology . "
Pakistan 's ambassador , Masood Khan , speaking on behalf of the 57 - nation Organization of the Islamic Conference , denied the resolution would limit free speech .
" It only tries to make freedom of expression responsible , " he said .
Paris - based Reporters Without Borders condemned the amendment .
" It turns someone who is supposed to defend freedom of opinion into a prosecutor whose job is to go after those who abuse this freedom , " the organization said .
Some time ago , I wrote a GUI for a large OCaml project in C++ using WxWidgets , linked to OCaml in a single executable .
It was hard and slow to write and crashed all over the place .
So I ’ve redone it in a particularly low - tech way .
Consider the following :
A GUI layer in pure Python , using the wxPython library
A GUI library written in pure OCaml
We start the two in separate processes , and have them talk via a socket .
Sounds horrible – works fine .
Advantages of this as a long - term approach to the building of a proper OCaml GUI library :
Pure .
No FFI involved
Wxwidgets is very good .
It ’s a whole platform and a mature one
Cross - platform by default .
Native appearance on Windows , Unix , OS X
Effort required by OCaml community lower than for any other option
Build single executables for release with py2exe and py2app
Write OCaml interfaces to hundreds of python libraries
Disadvantages ( please add more in the comments ! )
Python and OCaml processes can fail independently
Might need to work on getting executable sizes down
Asynchronous event loops need care : work required to ensure mouse events do n’t get out of sync etc – but this is fairly easy to overcome .
Here is a screenshot of our rendering engine using this approach on the Mac , on Windows and under Ubuntu .
I do n’t have the time to write a generic OCaml / wxpython library at the moment , so I ’m just going to stick with my special purpose implementation in our software for now .
In Part Two , I ’ll release the basic libraries :
mltalk.py , pytalk.ml ( Establishing a connection between Ocaml and Python processes )
camlpy.ml pycaml.py ( Marshalling and Unmarshalling Ocaml and Python data )
Wxgui.ml ( Event polling and synchronous events )
main.ml , main .py ( Main programs )
Scripts for py2exe and py2app
Hopefully someone will have the time to build a proper library from this example .
Today they would learn about drawing , Russian Orthodox saints and God .
The 7 - year - olds sat straight at their desks , sun pouring through lace curtains and cherry trees blooming in the fields beyond .
The teacher set a birch branch before the children and told them it was fragile and unique , just like their souls .
“ If you think you ca n’t draw properly , who will help you ? ” she asked .
“ God will help us , ” a boy called out .
“ Yes , God will guide your hand , so be confident , have faith . ”

This is Tuesday , one of the two days a week dedicated to Orthodox education at this sleepy public school in the lush forests outside Moscow .
All the girls and women have forgone pants in favor of skirts , and every student is learning Christian catechism along with reading , writing and arithmetic .
It ’s an unlikely scene , not least because this is a public school in a country that , just a few decades back , prided itself on institutional atheism .
It ’s also a strange sight because as many as half of the pupils are Muslim , with a few Jews , Buddhists and nonbelievers mixed in .
Many of their families arrived recently from Central Asia and the Caucasus in search of better schools and jobs .
At school , the students paint massive murals of Jesus , memorize myriad details about Orthodox saints and discuss New Testament stories with the local priest , who barrels into class in flowing black robes to oversee the students ’ spiritual formation .
At home , some of the children are learning to read the Koran in Arabic .
“ Some of the parents doubted .
Some were against it , ” school administrator Natalia Korolchenko said .
“ But I told the parents , because more and more children of different nationalities are coming , something should unite them .
Something should be done to make them respect the culture of this country . ”

Pictures of Jesus , saints
Whereas the United States has haggled over prayer in schools , many Russian schools have swung wildly from Marxist havens to institutions steeped in Orthodox symbols and doctrine .
With pictures of Jesus and the saints displayed on the walls , Kostrovo ’s public school probably would be mistaken for a parochial institution by an uninformed visitor .
The struggle over the national religion is playing out across this vast country .
A grass - roots movement driven by eager priests and local school officials has brought “ Basics of Orthodox Culture ” classes to regions throughout Russia in recent years .
The constitution orders the separation of church and state , but many observers believe that the gap is narrowing .
Under the eight - year presidency of Vladimir Putin , who is rumored to be a fervent believer , Orthodox leaders took on a new prominence .
They blessed the military , praised the country ’s rulers , encouraged priests to work on behalf of national interests and carefully avoided any criticism of the government ’s human rights or democracy record .
Advertisement
In exchange , the government and oligarchs close to the Kremlin have lavished the patriarchy with cash to restore monasteries and churches that went to seed during the Soviet era .
An Orthodox construction boom is underway across the country .
The government has so far avoided entanglement in a growing debate over whether the classes are appropriate for public education .
The decision over whether to add them -- and the nebulous question of where culture ends and theology begins -- has been left in the hands of local school officials .
The advent of religious education has provoked outcry from diverse segments of Russian society : Communists , Muslim and Jewish leaders and wary educators have raised alarms over the growing popularity of the classes .
“ This seriously affects the unity of the country , ” said Arsan Sadriyev of the Russian section of the Spiritual Directorate of European Muslims .
“ This will lead to the breakup of the country .
Ethnic groups will consolidate themselves and look for ways to protect their interests . ”

But supporters believe that the courses in Orthodox history and culture will unify Russia by filling an ideological void left by the collapse of the Soviet Union .
Orthodox Christianity is the defining core of Russian history and identity , they say , and should be a compulsory subject for every student .
Muslim immigrants from Central Asia and the Caucasus are in particular need of Orthodox understanding , they contend , so they can grasp the culture of their new home .
“ If we go to Turkey , we must learn the basics of Islamic culture , ” school administrator Korolchenko said .
“ When children come here , they should learn Orthodox culture .
It will be easier for them . ”
Clerics are locked in debate with the Education Ministry over whether the Orthodox courses should be discontinued or standardized , said Archpriest Vsevolod Chaplin , a spokesman for the Moscow patriarchy .
“ Some people are afraid of any religion in the schools , ” he said .
“ They still want to keep the monopoly of materialism and positivism that existed in Soviet times . ”

A flood of newcomers
But Russia itself is changing .
In Soviet days , this bucolic town was home to a homogenous population of ethnic Russian families who made their living working at the government cattle farm .
Today this region of rolling , fertile hills has been flooded with newcomers : Chechens , Azerbaijanis , Armenians , Tajiks and Uzbeks .
Korolchenko declares , proudly , that the school is no less dogmatic today than it was when she arrived 30 years ago as a Communist Party member .
But now , instead of communism and agriculture , the school is teaching religion to give the children a moral framework .
“ If you understand the general Christian dogmas and the moral code of communism , it ’s the same thing , ” she said .
Advertisement
The federal government has made its approval plain .
In 2004 , the Education Ministry presented the school with an award for “ spiritual and moral rebirth of village residents . ”
The town ’s priest , Vadim Sorokin , is also a former Communist who was an adult when he was baptized .
He came to Kostrovo in 1995 and set about reconstructing the ruined hulk of St. Nicholas the Sanctifier Church .
Today , sunlight streams through intricately painted cupolas .
Gold chandeliers dangle from an ornate ceiling , throwing light on icons etched with a wolf ’s fang and set in hand - carved mahogany .
The renovation cost millions of dollars , all donated by the government and wealthy businesspeople .
Sorokin started out buying books for the school and slowly worked up to introducing the Orthodox culture classes in 2003 .
Advertisement
He haunts the hallways on appointed days , popping from class to class as the pupils , ages 7 to 17 , talk about saints and souls .
In an upstairs classroom , Sorokin beamed as teenagers in the oldest class thrashed through a theological discussion .
“ What did Cain and Abel do ? ” the teacher grilled them .
“ They both brought gifts to God .
So what was the difference ? ”
“ Sincerity and lack of sincerity , ” one of the girls called out , springing to her feet and then sitting again .

“ Good kids ! ” the teacher exclaimed .
“ You understand ! ”

Fossil is its own full version control system that integrates a bug tracker as well
bugs everywhere -- perhaps abandonware , last commit was July 2007
DITrack -- subversion only , " planning to be backend agnostic " ( not sure how svn matches up with distributed , but ok )
DisTract -- only a web interface using Firefox - specific Javascript to write to disk ( ? ) , requires monotone , latest news August 2007
TicGit -- just learned about it five minutes ago so not sure yet ; seems a bit janky to keep bugs in a separate branch
Ditz -- seems the most appealing to me except that it's all of three weeks old , has emacs integration * , last commit last week
* I 'm a vim user , and do n't really care about editor wars , so I mention it only to note that emacs integration is n't as useful for me .
Distributed bug tracking is the natural extension of distributed version control .
Aside from the normal benefits of distributed version control , like being able to interact with bugs database while offline , there also seems to be a trend of making the interface to them work via the command line instead of annoying web - based systems .
And , like with Trac , the integration of issue tracking with the source is pretty natural : when you 've fixed a bug on a branch you can mark the bug as fixed in that branch , and when that branch lands on your " main " tree that tree 's bug state is also merged as a natural consequence of how merges work .
It seems like there is n't dominant software for this yet .
Here 's my five - minute take on the software I can find :
For whatever reason these all seem to involve the most obscure technologies available : in the above list I see fossil , bazaar , monotone , and even Haskell .
From reading through these I find a surprising variety of models .
Here 's what seems to me to be the simplest and sanest model : the bugs live in a normal top - level directory in your tree alongside " src " or whatever other directories you have ; each issue is in its own file ; comments are modifications of the per-issue file .
But more generally , I 'm not even sure if distributed is the appropriate model .
The action of recording a new bug modifies the current version of a branch but the bug 's existence usually is older than the most recent commit ( for example , it often belongs in older branches that have branches off before the bug was added ) .
So if a new bug is fixed in an older branch , there 's no way to merge that new bug into the older branch without merging the entire state of the newer branch in .
Is that sensible ?
I 'm not sure .
The alternatives all seem to involve tracking bugs separately from branches and trying to match them up after you commit ( like when commit messages mention bug numbers ) which always feels like a failure of technology .
The other issue that 's I 'm unsure about is how to integrate a sane web - based frontend for casual users who want to be able to query and report bugs without checking out the code .
Some systems have web frontends but it seems to me conflicts could be hard to resolve .
Maybe if you make sure a modification to an issue is always appends , and then add some smarts that auto - merges simultaneous adds by some textual timestamp included in the add .
Needs more thought .
Sorry for the braindump .
The nation shed 62,000 more jobs in June , bringing total losses for the year to 438,000 and rekindling concerns that the United States is in recession .
What ’s more , the Labor Department ’s unemployment report , released Thursday , showed job losses in April and May were significantly deeper than initially thought .
That contraction , combined with higher gas prices , suggests weakness ahead in consumer spending , which accounts for about 70 % of economic activity .
“ The economy has entered a slow - motion recession , ” said Dean Baker , co-director of the Center for Economic and Policy Research , a Democratic - leaning think tank .
“ It is not seeing the dramatic plunges in jobs that characterized prior recessions , but the collapse of the housing bubble is slowly sinking more and more sectors of the economy . ”
The economic stimulus payments the government issued to taxpayers in the last few months have helped ease the strain of higher energy prices , but that boost is about to fizzle out , said Joel Naroff of Naroff Economic Associates in Holland , Pa .

“ When people run out of rebate money for gasoline and food , they will be in trouble , ” Naroff said .
“ This tepid , limping economy will be with us for a while .
We ’re not crashing and burning ; it ’s just not an economy that ’s going anywhere . ”
The news could have been worse .
The unemployment rate was unchanged after shooting up from 5 % in April to 5.5 % in May , the biggest one - month jump since 1986 .
And job losses were in line with expectations , contributing to a stock rally on Wall Street .
But some economists took little comfort in the flat unemployment rate .
They noted that many workers have stopped looking for jobs altogether and are not being counted among the jobless because they have not actively sought new employment within the last four weeks .
“ Many more adults are sitting on the sidelines , neither working nor looking for work , ” said Peter Morici , an economist at the University of Maryland .
“ Factoring in discouraged workers raises the unemployment rate to about 7.2 % . ”

In addition to the 8.5 million Americans counted as unemployed , an additional 5.4 million were working part time because they were unable to find full - time work , the government said .
About 1.6 million others were “ marginally attached ” to the labor market -- that is , they had looked for work sometime in the last 12 months but had become discouraged , entered school or decided to stay home to care for family .
Not surprisingly , some of the steepest job losses were in the troubled housing sector , which has been walloped by falling home values and foreclosures against borrowers who ca n’t make escalating payments on adjustable - rate loans .
Construction , depressed by the collapse of the housing market , lost an additional 43,000 jobs in June .
Since its peak in September 2006 , construction employment has fallen by 528,000 .
An additional 33,000 jobs were lost in the manufacturing sector .
But there were also signs of weakness in other areas , including retail trade and financial services .
Government jobs were a bright spot , accounting for 29,000 new positions , and there was hiring in the healthcare and hospitality sectors .
But those gains were outpaced by the losses in other parts of the economy .
Advertisement
Altogether , the private sector contracted by 91,000 jobs .
Generally , the economy must create about 100,000 jobs a month to keep pace with the increasing population ; this year , the economy has lost an average of 73,000 jobs a month .
The employment reports for April and May , meanwhile , were revised downward to show an additional 52,000 job losses .
“ It ’s persistent bad news , ” said Diane Swonk , chief economist with Mesirow Financial in Chicago .
“ The economy is growing , but realistically it feels like a recession to most people . ”
Recessions are generally defined as periods when gross domestic product slips into negative territory for two or more consecutive quarters .
But the National Bureau of Economic Research , the panel that makes the official designation of a recession , tends to use a more complex analysis that emphasizes job creation and industrial production .

The economic bureau usually waits until downturns are over before applying the “ recession ” label .
But economists said the sense of a downturn is so strong that an official declaration has become almost irrelevant .
“ Technically , we ’re probably not in a recession , but that does n’t matter , ” Naroff said .
“ It feels as if we are , and that ’s much more critical than any definition . ”
Soaring oil prices are not making the job picture any brighter , said Steven Davis , a labor economist at the University of Chicago .
He said uncertainty about how high energy prices could climb may keep some firms from investing in new plants and new workers .
“ Oil prices are high , but there is also a lot of uncertainty about whether they will go higher , ” Davis said .
“ The answer to that question has a big impact for businesses in terms of what kinds of capital equipment they will adopt .
This uncertainty is also depressing economic activity and hiring . ”

In New York futures trading Thursday , oil closed at a record $ 145.29 a barrel , up $ 1.72 , or 1.2 % .
Traders pointed to market nervousness about tension in the Mideast and fears that global fuel demand may test tight oil supplies .
