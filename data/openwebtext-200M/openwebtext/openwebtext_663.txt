" Please help !
I took my husband 's i-phone and found a raunchy picture of him attached to an e-mail to a woman in his sent e-mail file ( a Yahoo account ) , " Susan wrote .
" When I approached him about this ( I think that he is cheating on me ) he admitted that he took the picture but says that he never sent it to anyone .
" He claims that he went to the Genius Bar at the local Apple store and they told him that it is an i-phone glitch : that photos sometimes automatically attach themselves to an e-mail address and appear in the sent folder , even though no e-mail was ever sent . "
Susan then pleaded with the Apple experts on the discussion board to tell her if they had ever heard of the bug , saying " the future of my marriage depends on this answer " .
Susan did not leave any contact details so it is not possible to contact her to verify the story .
Her account on the Apple site says she is located in New Jersey .
Most of the initial responses informed Susan that it was not possible for images to be attached to emails automatically .
Curiously , two newly registered users then posted responses saying they had experienced the glitch several times but did n't know how to fix it .
They were quickly shot down by regulars of the discussion board who queried whether the posts were made by Susan 's husband or online miscreants .
Susan did not publish the photograph online but described it in G - rated language for the benefit of the morbidly curious onlookers .
" It was a close - up shot of him pleasuring himself taken at the exact moment of maximum pleasure ...
It 's such a good shot that one must wonder if he actually practiced it a few times before getting it right , " she wrote .
Susan thanked the discussion board users for their assistance but not before declaring that her lawyer was " working on the divorce complaint " .

If we are to believe the Washington Post , French president and current EU leader Nicolas Sarkozy has pledged to save us from nameless “ freewheeling bankers and traders ” who get the blame for the current economic crisis .
British Prime Minister Gordon Brown speaks to French President Nicolas Sarkozy during the financial crisis summit gathering Eurogroup heads of state and government at the Elysee Palace in Paris .
Sarkozy , Gordon Brown , and EU honcho José Manuel Barroso are talking up an international summit to discuss an “ urgent overhaul of the world ’s financial architecture , ” that is to say a new Bretton Woods to establish a brand spanking new international economic order .
Sarkozy has managed to grab George Bush ’s ear and he will travel to Washington on Saturday to lay the groundwork for a conference .
In 1944 , 44 allied nations met at a resort in Bretton Woods , New Hampshire , to fiddle with monetary standards , fix exchange rates , and create the IMF and World Bank .
“ Launching a remake of this old model — particularly in such a short time , with so many new participants — would represent a daunting challenge at any time , but particularly during the twilight of the Bush presidency and the crisis that is still jolting banks and stock markets around the world , ” reports the Post .
Sarkozy and the EU leaders would have us believe this new Bretton Woods will call for “ globally coordinated regulation of the financial industry , elimination of tax havens and a compensation system in which traders are not rewarded for dangerous risk - taking , ” among other things .
It was the demise of Bretton Woods in 1971 , insists European Central Bank president Jean - Claude Trichet , that led to the abandonment of regulation and subsequent market turmoil .
“ The explosion of the first Bretton Woods in a way could be interpreted as a rejection of discipline , ” said Trichet , reports Bloomberg .
At 55 seconds into this video , AFP reports on the prospect of a " worldwide currency system . "
Gordon Brown , the former Chancellor of the Exchequer , wants to fix that turmoil with a new spate of regulations aimed at international finance .
On October 13 in London , Brown said “ we must devise new rules for a world of global capital flows ” just as the founders of Bretton Woods “ devised rules for a world of limited capital flows . ”
“ We now have global financial markets but what we do not have is anything other than national and regional regulation and supervision , ” Brown lamented from Brussels .
All of this is nonsense .
It should be obvious by now the bankers engineered the current crisis in order to consolidate their hold on the global economy and all the talk about rogue traders , tax havens , and over - compensated executives is merely that — talk , or more specifically a sales pitch , a slick parlor trick devised to fool the commoners .
Glossed over in all the corporate media coverage is the global elite demand that a global currency be established .
“ Europe wants to present a blueprint for a new worldwide currency system , ” reports the AFP in the video here .
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
“ Another subject in tomorrow ’s world is that of the great currencies , ” Reuters reported Sarkozy musing on October 16 .
“ How many should there be ?
What should the agreement between these great currencies be ?
Should we organize a discussion ? ”
Any discussion would be purely academic , as the ruling elite long ago decided to force a global currency down our throats .
In fact , a global currency is at the very core of their plan to dominate the world .
Control money and you control the destiny of states , you eliminate national sovereignty .
“ The control of money and credit strikes at the very heart of national sovereignty , ” A.W. Clausen , president of Bank of America once observed .
As Georgetown professor and CFR historian Carroll Quigley noted , the goal of the banking families and their minions consists of “ nothing less than to create a world system of financial control in private hands able to dominate the political system of each country and the economy of the world as a whole … controlled in a feudalist fashion by the central banks of the world acting in concert , by secret agreements arrived at in frequent private meetings and conferences . ”
It remains to be seen if the EU will realize its “ solution ” to the world economic crisis .
In 2007 , Robert Mundell , “ the father of the euro , ” noted that “ international monetary reform usually becomes possible only in response to a felt need and the threat of a global crisis . ”
Certainly , the elite cooked up an appropriate global crisis , now they will engage in a full court press to establish a global currency and eventually a global government .

The " media gravediggers " were wrong again about Matt Drudge , said Jack Shafer in Slate .
A string of observers cited " wishful headlines on the Drudge Report hinting at a possible upset of Barack Obama by John McCain " as evidence that Drudge had lost his ability to influence the mainstream media .
But Drudge will endure as long as there are readers who " want an information site that would rather err on the side of recklessness once in a while than be right all the time . "
You 're missing the point , said Eric Boehlert in Media Matters .
Drudge did n't drive the news during the general election , " he was an irrelevant bystander . "
He clearly does n't have the influence he craves .
Drudge can't be happy " posting headlines that have no impact on American politics . "
It 's nice of Shafer to spell out all the reasons why it 's wrong to deny Drudge 's impact , said Drew Grant in Jossip .
But Matt Drudge does n't need a white knight .
" People have been calling for his head since the conception of his Web site back during the Lewinsky scandal , and the fact that it 's still trooping along , despite , or perhaps because of , Obama 's victory should be proof enough that the man is n't going anywhere . "
GM opens USD300 million assembly plant in Russia
SEE ALSO : ALL GM ARTICLES
ST . PETERSBURG , RUS .
November 7 , 2008 : General Motors ( GM ) opened today a $ 300 million , flexible assembly plant in St. Petersburg , Russia , in presence of President Dmitry Medvedev .
The plant will add 70,000 units of capacity to more than 100,000 already available to GM at joint venture and partner facilities in the country .
It will build the Opel Antara and Chevrolet Captiva SUVs and , as of late 2009 , the all - new Chevrolet Cruze compact sedan .
The plant features a flexible , modern design that can accommodate a variety of different models .
“ Today ’s plant opening underlines GM ’s strong commitment to Russia , ” said GME President Carl - Peter Forster at today ’s opening ceremony .
“ This new plant will cement our position as the number one non-domestic manufacturer in Russia , a high - volume growth market with outstanding potential . ”
The new GM plant in Shushary on the outskirts of St. Petersburg is the third manufacturing site to build GM vehicles in Russia .
In Togliatti , the GM Avtovaz joint venture plant is manufacturing the Chevrolet Niva SUV , and in Kaliningrad GM ’s partner , Avtotor , is assembling various Chevrolet , Cadillac and Hummer models for the Russian market .
“ GM ’s investment in this modern , flexible car plant is an investment in the future , ” said Valentina Matvienko , Governor of the St. Petersburg region .
“ We are proud to be the home of the first General Motors plant to open in the company ’s second century . ”
GM sales boom in Russia
GM nearly doubled industry growth in Russia from January - September 2008 with sales up 44 percent to 256,765 cars and SUVs .
GM reached a market share of 11 percent and was the leading international vehicle manufacturer in Europe ’s second biggest market .
Chevrolet sales in Russia grew by 33.5 percent or 44,145 units in the first nine months of this year to 175,798 .
Opel is the fastest growing brand in the Russian vehicle market with sales rocketing to 78,051 in the January - September period , which corresponds to a growth rate of 73.3 percent .
Top quality through standardised manufacturing methods
“ Our St. Petersburg plant will work to the same high standards that have recently resulted in major quality awards for our cars , ” said Carl - Peter Forster .
GM ’s new employees in St. Petersburg have undergone intensive training in the company ’s global manufacturing system which focuses on top quality in all processes , continuous improvement and involvement of the workforce .

Last year , we reported that WIPO Member States had decided to postpone holding an intergovernmental diplomatic conference to adopt the controversial Broadcasting Treaty .
For us , and the many others who had expressed concern about the proposed treaty , this was welcome news .
But it was short - lived .
In 2008 , the Broadcasting Treaty is being pushed by its supporters with a vengeance .
Surprisingly , the US seems to have reversed its most recent position , and expressed support for continuing treaty negotiations so long as it includes webcasting .
Despite the fact that there has been no agreement on fundamental elements of the treaty after over 10 years of negotiations , in March there was a concerted move to resurrect negotiations , led by the European Community and Japan , with support from a set of other countries .
At the September 2008 WIPO General Assembly meeting , a number of WIPO national delegates expressed support for finalizing treaty negotiations .
Then in October , the long - standing WIPO Copyright Committee Chair , Mr. Jukka Liedes of Finland , produced an " informal paper " describing the process of negotiations so far , and proffered several options which would result in continuing discussions and finalization of the treaty .
Yesterday , the Broadcasting Treaty was the main topic of discussion at this week 's meeting of the WIPO Standing Committee on Copyright in Geneva .
In spite of the enthusiastic efforts of treaty supporters , consensus still seems quite a long way off .
Several country delegations ( France on behalf of the European Community , Japan , El Salvador and China ) expressed support for concluding a treaty .
Others repeated that the treaty must be limited to protection of signals and not grant exclusive rights , which the current draft does ( Pakistan on behalf of the Asia Group , the Africa Group , South Africa , India . the US ) .
As in previous meetings , the most contentious issue was whether the treaty should give broadcasters and cablecasters exclusive rights over Internet retransmissions of broadcast and cablecast content .
The Africa Group , China , Nigeria , India , South Africa and Egypt all opposed inclusion of webcasting or extension to Internet transmissions .
Japan , the US , Australia and the Ukraine supported the extension of the treaty to the Internet .
The US delegation said that if discussions are to continue , the treaty should include webcasting .
This is a reversal of the United States ' most recent position , and harks back to a May 2006 meeting , where it was agreed to take out webcasting and divide the treaty into two tracks -- first , a treaty on broadcasting and cablecasting , and then second , an instrument dealing with broadcasting on the Internet -- webcasting or " netcasting " , as the US had wanted , and " simulcasting " , as supported by the EU .
Yesterday , the United States ' delegation stated it had agreed only temporarily to limit the scope of the treaty to traditional broadcasting entities , provided that simulcasting was also excluded , and with the failure to move to a diplomatic conference in 2007 , any agreement on the two - track approach had now expired .
In other words , the US apparently wants to go back to 2006 and bring webcasting or " netcasting " back in to the treaty .
Finally , in case there was any doubt , the North American Broadcasters '
Association repeated that their strong preference is for a treaty with exclusive rights for broadcasters and extending to Internet retransmissions .
EFF and a diverse group of public interest NGOs , libraries and major U.S. tech industry players continue to oppose the current treaty draft because it's not limited to signal protection , but would instead create a new layer of exclusive intellectual property rights for broadcasters and cablecasters that would harm access to knowledge and consumers ' existing rights under national copyright law , endanger citizen broadcasting on the Internet , raise competition policy concerns and stifle technological innovation .
Here and here is the joint statement presented by that group to WIPO this week .
And here 's EFF 's briefing paper on our concerns with the current treaty draft .
Discussions at WIPO wound up today , after heated discussions on the issue of copyright exceptions and limitations .
Member states agreed to keep the Broadcasting Treaty on the Copyright Committee 's agenda and asked WIPO to convene an information session at the next meeting in May to discuss outstanding issues .
The Committee did not make a decision on the various options presented by the Chair in his informal paper .
Perhaps most importantly , Member States affirmed the mandate previously provided by the WIPO General Assembly -- that the treaty must be framed on a signal - based approach , and that the convening of a diplomatic conference could be considered only after agreement has been achieved on the treaty 's objectives , specific scope and objectives .
We 'll be back shortly with the full text of the final adopted conclusions of the meeting and our analysis of this week 's key issue , copyright exceptions and limitations for the visually impaired , libraries and archives , education and innovative services .

Citing changes to its billing and costs that are doubling every month , Twitter announced that it will no longer support outbound SMS to Canadians .
Twitter ’s searching for a business model ( and a Business Product Manager to help out ) , and in the meantime it has to curtail costs — but it does n’t help that Canadian carriers are trying to charge huge fees for text messaging , resulting in consumer lawsuits .
Canadian Industry Minister Jim Prentice called the decision by Bell and Telus a “ poorly thought out decision , ” back in July , but reneged in August following meetings with the carriers , saying , “ I would encourage consumers dissatisfied with existing plans to seek alternatives .
The telecommunications market in Canada is dynamic — choice is available . ”
Given today ’s news , it would seem that alternatives are n’t available , at least for Twitter , and probably not for Canadians in general .
The statement from Twitter is below .
Unexpected changes in our billing have forced us into a difficult situation with our Canadian SMS service .
We ca n’t afford to support this service given our current arrangement with our providers ( where costs have been doubling for the past several months . )
As a result , effective today we are no longer delivering outbound SMS over our Canadian shortcode ( 21212 ) .
The ability to update Twitter over SMS will still be supported over 21212 .
But we know that this is only part of the experience and we want to make Twitter work in the way folks want … regardless of where they live .
There is a realistic , scalable SMS solution for Canada ( and the rest of the world . )
We ’re working on that and will post more details on the Twitter blog as we make progress .
The Language Technology Group
News and Events
The REMU project - Reliable Multilingual Digital Communication : Methods and Applications .
Third GF Summer School 2013 - Frontiers of Multilingual Technology .
Background
The Language Technology Group at the Department of Computer Science and Engineering was founded in 2001 .
It built on the Department 's earlier competence areas :
logic and type theory
functional programming
compiler construction
With this background , the group was in the beginning very much profiled towards precision - oriented tasks , rather than to wide coverage
multilingual generation
technical translation
natural language interfaces
spoken dialogue systems
In more recent years , the efforts have been extended to the creation of tools and resources usable in all kinds of language technology tasks :
grammar formalism implementations
generation of speech recognizer language models
lexicon building tools
extraction of lexica from raw text data
extraction of inflection rules from raw text
The main characteristics identifying our group are
multilinguality : theories and tools that apply to many languages simultaneously
: theories and tools that apply to many languages simultaneously compiler technology : many of our NLP ideas are generalizations from modern compilers ; we have also developed compiler tools inspired by NLP
Currently ( February 2008 ) , the group has 8 members with a PhD and 4 PhD students .
Some of the senior members have their principal affiliations at the Departments of Linguistics and Swedish Language .

Multilingual grammars
Grammatical Framework ( GF ) , grammaticalframework.org , is a multilingual grammar formalism based on the idea of a shared abstract syntax and mappings between the abstract syntax and concrete languages .
GF has hundreds of users all over the world .
The GF Resource Grammar Library , grammaticalframework.org/lib/doc/synopsis.html , implements the morphology ( inflection ) and basic syntax ( phrase structure ) of 16 languages : Bulgarian , Catalan , Danish , Dutch , English , Finnish , French , German , Italian , Norwegian , Polish , Romanian , Russian , Spanish , Swedish , and Urdu .
These resources are , freely available as open - source software .
More languages are under construction , in both in - house and external projects .
Embedded grammars are parsing and generation programs compiled from GF grammars and usable as parts of programs written in other languages : Haskell , Java , and JavaScript .
Multilingual grammar applications
The Numeral Translator , http://www.cse.chalmers.se/alumni/bringert/gf/translate/ , is a demo of embedded grammars in Java .
It translates number words between 88 languages .

Cleveland Police , the force that will today bring six people to court for alleged involvement in the OiNK BitTorrent network , does not pay licensing fees to legally play music in its canteens , it has emerged .
Rumours that Cleveland Police was infringing copyright law have been circulating for several months .
Yesterday the Middlesborough Gazette reported the force admitted the transgression and said it had not decided whether to pay its Performing Rights Society ( PRS ) subs .
The PRS collects royalties for artists and record companies from non-domestic performance of recorded copyright music .
A spokeswoman confirmed Cleveland Police 's position to El Reg today .
A statement from Cleveland Police Deputy Chief Constable Derek Bonnard said : " We continue to assess the position and are seeking advice to determine if we are required by law to spend a significant amount of public money , which we consider is better committed to crime fighting , in this way . "
The PRS argues that police forces are required to pay the same as other organisations .
It issued a High Court writ against police in Lancashire earlier this year for the same infringment Cleveland has admitted .
PRS said only 11 forces nationwide have paid for the legal right to play copyright music in staff areas .
Action against the Lancashire Constabulary has been suspended while the parties attempt to negotiate a settlement .
Depending on where and how it it plays copyright music , Cleveland Police can expect a PRS bill of between a few hundred and a few thousand pounds .
Alan Ellis , the 25 - year - old administrator of OiNK , will face Teesside magistrates today on a charge of conspiracy to defraud .
Five individuals who were arrested following last year 's raids on Ellis and OiNK 's servers will also appear , accused of criminal copyright infringement for uploading new trackers to the site .
All of the alleged offences could carry prison sentences . ®
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - Whether it is Barack Obama or John McCain , the new U.S. president will take over one of the most awesome of responsibilities -- his finger will be on the trigger of the country ’s huge nuclear arsenal .

In advance of the election , some of Washington ’s most influential national security thinkers have argued for a dramatic shift in U.S. policy , to actively pursue the eventual elimination of all nuclear weapons from the Earth .
Many dismiss this goal as a dream , given the lack of trust among the nuclear weapons powers and the entrenched role that atomic weapons have in the global balance of power .
But Democratic front - runner Obama , who is leading in polls before Tuesday ’s election , endorsed it and his Republican rival John McCain said he hopes to move to “ the lowest possible number ” of U.S. nuclear weapons .
“ I will not authorize the development of new nuclear weapons , ” Obama said in September .
“ And I will make the goal of eliminating nuclear weapons worldwide a central element of U.S. nuclear policy . ”
The debate , which dates back to the early days of the Cold War , was revived around the start of the election campaign in January 2007 when four Washington national security heavyweights published a call for a total ban .
They were Henry Kissinger and George Shultz , who served as secretaries of state in Republican administrations , William Perry , who was Democratic President Bill Clinton ’s defense secretary , and former Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman Sam Nunn , who has been advising Obama .
In 2008 , they said their vision was supported by 14 more former top national security officials from recent administrations .
WORLD WITHOUT NUCLEAR WEAPONS
George Perkovich , director of the nonproliferation program at the Carnegie Endowment , says nuclear weapons can be banned even if they cannot be “ disinvented ” -- much like Nazi - style gas chambers .
“ Those ( gas chambers ) have n’t been disinvented but we do n’t have them around now and do n’t think they should be around and we ’re prepared to take action to enforce that , ” he told a Washington audience last week .
“ The next American president should emphasize the goal of a world without nuclear weapons -- and really mean it , ” Perkovich said .
Most nuclear weapons , which for many are a symbol of the Cold War , are still held by the United States and Russia .
President Ronald Reagan discussed the idea of a total abolition of the weapons in 1986 with Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev -- to the shock of some of their advisers .
The 1968 Nonproliferation Treaty obliged the five declared nuclear weapons states -- China , France , Russia , Britain and the United States -- to work toward disarmament .
India , Pakistan and North Korea have all since tested nuclear weapons and Israel is widely assumed to have them .
The United States accuses Iran of wanting to build a bomb , although Iran says its nuclear program is for peaceful purposes .
In their January 2007 article in the Wall Street Journal , the four prominent figures noted a growing fear that non-state groups like al Qaeda could get their hands on a bomb -- and use it as the “ ultimate means of mass devastation . ”
But if the world had zero nukes , there would be none for either governments or non-state groups to acquire , they said .
REALISTIC PROPOSAL ?
Some worry about how to reach such a goal given the perils for Washington of leading by giving up bombs when others , like Russia and China , are modernizing their stockpiles .
In the current edition of the journal “ Foreign Affairs ” two other U.S. experts say Washington must launch a vigorous diplomatic effort to convince the world of “ the logic of zero . ”
Ivo Daalder , senior fellow at the Brookings Institution and Jan Lodal , immediate past president of the Atlantic Council , say that a “ remarkable ” bipartisan consensus has grown around the idea .
They said as part of the process Washington should reduce its arsenal to no more than 1,000 total weapons .
Defense Secretary Robert Gates last week said the United States should update its nuclear arsenal .
But he added he would advise the next president to seek agreement with Russia on cuts in nuclear warheads below the limit of 1,700 to 2,200 deployed warheads in an existing treaty .
Gates noted that three past presidents he had worked for favored eliminating all nuclear weapons and said so publicly .
They were Jimmy Carter ; George Bush , the current president ’s father ; and Reagan .
But Gates said some efforts toward a nuclear weapons - free world had not been realistic .
“ All have come up against the reality that as long as others have nuclear weapons , we must maintain some level of these weapons ourselves to deter potential adversaries and to reassure over two dozen allies and partners who rely on our nuclear umbrella for their security , making it unnecessary for them to develop their own , ” he said .
Prototype Generator Harnesses Vibration Power
November 21st , 2008 by Ariel Schwartz
Omron Corp. recently debuted a small prototype generator that harnesses power from vibrations to create electricity .
The model will be cheap — approximately $ 10.36 — due to its simple structure and packaging .
Omron ’s generator works with an “ electret power generation system ” that changes capacitance depending on the relative position of opposing electrodes .
A change in capacitance generates electric current .
The prototype produces only 10μW of power with vibrational inputs at 20 Hz frequency and 1G acceleration , which is not enough to continuously operate a cell phone .
But despite its minimal power - generating ability , there are important uses for the prototype .
Omron plans on placing the generator in devices installed on highways to detect road problems .
Eventually , the generator could be installed inside car tires for tire pressure monitoring since tires vibrate strongly during movement .
Stay tuned for a release date — Omron has n’t yet said when the generator will be commercially available .

Latest Cleantech Talk Episode
Programmer and self - described internet entrepreneur Evan Prodromou has been involved in starting open source and open content projects .
His best - known is Wikitravel , a Wiki site for collaboratively edited travel guides .
Indenti.ca , his current project , is his attempt to develop a free network service using shared , open data .
But to the uninitiated , the site and service look — and function very much — like a clone of Twitter .
The big difference is that the software running Indenti.ca , which Prodromou has also been developing , Laconica , is free and open source .
People can copy the code and use it on their own servers .
Originally from San Francisco , Prodromou is now based in Montreal where he has established a company , Control Yourself , to turn Indenti.ca into a business .
Howard Wen :
What term would you use to describe this communication architecture — the Twitter or Facebook - style " user status update " system ?
Evan Prodromou :
If it [ were ] up to me , I would probably choose something like " short message hub " or " universal messaging hub . "
But the name that 's really sticking with this kind of service is " microblogging . "
I think that comes out of the fact that a lot of [ these ] services have a web interface and it looks like a blog .
I do n't think it 's a fully accurate term , but it 's good enough , and it gets the idea across .
HW : Can you sum up how the architecture for microblogging basically works in a service like Twitter or Indenti.ca ?
EP : Typically , you have a web service that serves as a hub for messages , and messages can go into this hub through many different media .
They can be posted from a web page , but they could also be sent from an IM client , SMS or e-mail .
They can be sent in through a web API , too .
Twitter , for example , [ has ] a number of desktop clients that support their API .
Then each user in these networks can subscribe to messages from friends , from people they 're interested in .
So the messaging hub does this switching process of saying , " Of all these messages coming in , where do I send them out to ? "
The messaging hub sends them out to subscribers .
These messages go out over RSS , web pages , IM , SMS or to API clients .
So , it 's a " multiple channels in ; multiple channels out " messaging system with a social networking aspect .
HW : To clarify , what 's the difference between the archicture of a microblogging system and that of an instant messenging service ?
EP : IM tends to not have a lot of persistence .
You do n't expect to be able to find a particular message or something that someone said in IM kept around on the web forever , and that 's something that does happen with microblogging .
We expect things to be persistent .
There 's also an expectation of real - time conversation with IM .
Whereas in microblogging , the conversation can happen over a period of days .
So it 's a more extended conversation .
Finally , most IM conversations are one - to - one .
With microblogging , even a relatively antisocial person will usually end up with 50 , 60 , 100 people listening to them .
It 's common to get up into the triple digits fairly quickly , even for someone who 's not looking to add a lot of friends .
One funny thing is that in IM if I 'm in a conversation with you and another person , we can all three " hear " each other .
But in microblogging , I might send out a notice , and you and the other person can both hear what I 'm saying , but can't hear what each other are saying , because you 're not subscribed to each other 's messages .
So there 's a disconnect .
The way notices propagate is a little bit more fractured across time and across a social network .
HW : Why did you create an open source version of the Twitter system ?
EP : As someone who 's very active in open source software and open source web software , I 'm very interested in how much of our online life we are putting into the hands of services that are very proprietary .
Some people call it the " roach motel model " — you put your data in and it wo n't come out .
I put tons of information about myself and my life into services like Facebook .
Twitter was another one that I was participating in quite a bit .
But if anything happened with Twitter , if Twitter had reliability problems , or if Twitter was n't on the web for a while , I could n't take my data , put it into my instance of that software , and run it somewhere else .
I find that frustrating .
I think a lot of other people find that frustrating , too : giving up control of your social life and your sociality online to someone who does n't necessarily have your best interests at heart .
It 's not that the people who start Facebook or MySpace or Twitter are bad or anything .
But losing one user 's data , or dropping one user 's set of messages is not a big deal to them , whereas it 's a really big deal to me .
So I wanted to experiment with providing web services where the user is in control .
I 'm interested in doing this in different fields in the web services area .
Microblogging just happens to be very popular .
I wanted to get the idea in front of people who are interested in Twitter , and say maybe there 's another way that we can do this .
HW : What language and libraries did you use to create Laconica , and why ?
EP : Laconica is written with PHP and MySQL .
We have off - line processing daemons that do a lot of the same kind of work that the Twitter off - line daemons do .
They do routing and they do sending stuff out over different channels .
We do n't have a dedicated queuing server that 's built into the system right now , but that will be in an upcoming version .
Right now , we just use our MySQL database as kind of an ad - hoc queuing server .
It 's not a very good way to do things and it kind of hurts our performance .
I think it 's a little more unusual to do long - running processing , like queue handlers in PHP , than it is to do it with other scripting languages , like Ruby or Python or Pearl .
However , once we made PHP work that way , it 's been actually a pretty decent choice for implementation .
And the fact that the web interface and the off - line daemons use the same language and libraries makes contributing to both a lot easier .

Within minutes of the announcement by the media that Senator Obama ( D - Ill ) had been elected President , the media ’s talking heads were telling us that you do not have a chance of getting the Republican nomination for President in 2012 .
I hope they are correct .
You can do much better for yourself — and the country — if you forego a run for that office .
The satirical publication , The Onion , put it best .
WASHINGTON — African - American man Barack Obama , 47 , was given the least - desirable job in the entire country Tuesday when he was elected president of the United States of America .
In his new high - stress , low - reward position , Obama will be charged with such tasks as completely overhauling the nation ’s broken - down economy , repairing the crumbling infrastructure , and generally having to please more than 300 million Americans and cater to their every whim on a daily basis .
As part of his duties , the black man will have to spend four to eight years cleaning up the messes other people left behind .
The job comes with such intense scrutiny and so certain a guarantee of failure that only one other person even bothered applying for it .
Said scholar and activist Mark L. Denton , “ It just goes to show you that , in this country , a black man still ca n’t catch a break . ”
The fact that the talking heads are already doing their best to torpedo your 2012 candidacy for President reveals a curious fact : you are now the nation ’s leading Republican spokesman .
This may not last , but for the moment , you are .
Weird , is n’t it ?
The Republicans now suffer from the problem faced by the Democrats in late 1968 : no visible spokesman .
Lyndon Johnson did not run in 1968 .
Hubert Humphrey was out of the picture in 1969 because he did not defeat Nixon in 1968 .
It was not 1952 any more .
In 1952 , Adlai Stevenson was defeated by Eisenhower , yet he was still the front - runner for 1956 , just as Tom Dewey was still the front - runner after his defeat in 1944 .
People could get two shots at the office back then .
They still could in 1968 .
Nixon lost to Kennedy in 1960 , then to Pat Brown in California in 1962 .
But , after 1968 , the door closed .
It ’s “ one shot and you ’re out . ”
In 1961 , after Nixon ’s loss , the titular head of the Republican Party was Eisenhower .
He had served two full terms .
He was the Grand Old Man of the Grand Old Party .
As an ex- President , he was expected by informal protocol not to say anything negative in public about Kennedy , but he could give unofficial advice to those who came to Gettysburg to see him .
George W. Bush is more like Lyndon Johnson than Eisenhower .
He is a pariah .
Under the post -1968 rules of the Presidential game , McCain has become the equivalent of Humphrey in 1969 , McGovern in 1973 , and Mondale in 1985 .
He can return to the Senate and then retire gracefully .
With the exception of Abraham Lincoln in 1860 , William Howard Taft in 1908 , and Herbert Hoover in 1928 , there are only four paths to the modern Presidency : Vice President , the Senate , a governorship , or a successful generalship in a popular major war .
( World War II was the last one . )
There is no eligible Vice President .
With the Democrats in power in the Senate , Republican Senators will be competing against each other for the media spotlight .
They may not have enough votes to stop a vote for cloture .
They are now all relegated to background noise .
There are only two governors anyone knows outside their states : you and Gov. Schwarzenegger , who is not eligible to run .
As for Republican Senators , they are an invisible lot .
Not one of them has national recognition .
This leaves you : the last woman standing .
WHAT SHOULD YOU DO NOW ?
If you were looking ahead , you now have several hundred thousand names and email addresses in your own personal data base .
If you do n’t , your job now is to get them .
Set up a Website .
Offer a public section and a closed section for members only , which requires people to register in order to get access to the “ inner sanctum . ”
This way , you will build a huge mailing list of dedicated activists .
The conservatives are the largest voting bloc in the Republican Party .
They are behind you more than any other candidate .
The Christian conservatives are even more committed , with even fewer options .
You are it .
There is no fall - back spokesman for them .
What should you do with your bully digital pulpit ?
Let me suggest the following : show people how you got elected mayor of Wasilla .
Tip O’Neill once uttered a famous phrase : “ All politics is local . ”
He was not correct , but at some point , it will be .
As the government of the United States veers toward default on its debt , probably through mass inflation , local politics will become more important .
There is nothing like checks from Washington D.C. that do not buy much of anything to get people focused on local politics .
If you position yourself as the hockey mom who got elected mayor , you will inspire other people to run for local office .
Show them how to do it .
If you provide access to a large audience for technicians in the party to teach your site ’s registered members the technical details , you will provide what no other national politician has ever bothered to provide .
You will become the first nationally known politician to focus on local politics rather than Beltway politics .
Break the site into multiple sections , with departments on specific topics .
Offer forums to registered members .
Use my site as an example .
It is powered by a program called Membergate .
Each department can be edited by a specialist .
He can moderate a forum .
You do n’t have to do all of this .
There are skilled political technicians all over the country who will donate time to do this for you .
Trust me .
They would love to have the opportunity .
Start by promoting a classic book by California ’s retired state Senator , H. L. “ Bill ” Richardson : What Makes You Think We Read the Bills ?
It was written a generation ago , but it still holds up .
He might even let you offer a digital version to people who register for the members - only section of your site .
This will help sell the printed version .
You should charge $ 50 a year for membership in the members - only section of the site .
Set up a political action committee to dispense the money to local candidates .
Let the media know what you are doing with the money .
The information will be public .
You are not profiting .
Local candidates will be the beneficiaries .
By charging $ 50 a year , you will keep out most of the crazies .
Crazies want a forum for free .
Do n’t provide one .
Write short columns .
Post audios .
Post brief
YouTube videos that pull people to your site .
The idea is to keep in front of the Republican hard core .
You can do more good as a trainer than as a candidate .
People want leadership .
They want someone to trust .
Tell them up front that you are in this to train people for local politics , not to create a base for a self - interested run for the Presidency .
Long - term , you can have far greater impact on American politics by training people in local politics than by spending other people ’s money on a run for the Republican nomination .
The Eastern Establishment will not let you be successful .
The media will torpedo you .
But if you use the Internet to create a true grass - roots political movement , you will scare them to death , for good reason .
I wrote about this just after the election of 2000 , in an article called “ The Dogcatcher Strategy . ”
The idea is to identify a local office so obscure that people say , “ I would n’t vote for him for dogcatcher . ”
This is where serious candidates for political office should begin .
Move from obscurity to authority , one minor office after another .
Move up the chain of command .
You are the supreme recent example .
You became a national figure because you were once mayor of Wasilla .
Clone yourself .
CONCLUSION
You can retain long - term influence through service .
This positioning will drive the media nuts .
They will know you are out there , training the troops .
There will be nothing they can do about it .
They are the gatekeepers .
The Internet is destroying the office of gatekeeper .
I have written about this here .
Take advantage of the vulnerability of your enemies .
Do n’t fight the battle on their turf .
Make them fight it on yours .

In contrast to the average American adult , who watches three hours of television a day , non-watchers fill their free time with a greater variety of activities .
For many Americans the thought of life without TV is akin to forgoing food , shelter or , God forbid , the Internet .
But about 1 to 2 percent of Americans do abstain from the boob tube , and they might seem like strange bedfellows .
A recent study of those who live without found that about two - thirds fall into either the " crunchy granola set " or the " religious right , ultraconservative " camp , said researcher Marina Krcmar , a professor of communication at North Carolina 's Wake Forest University .
Krcmar interviewed 120 people from 62 different households who do not watch television , as well as 92 people from 35 households with TV , and described her findings in a new book , " Living Without the Screen " ( Routledge , 2008 ) .
Aversion to television , it turns out , is a common ground for the very liberal and the very conservative .
" I interviewed one guy who was 31 , single , an artist living in Boston , who saw himself as countercultural , " Krcmar told LiveScience .
" The next day I had an interview with a religious woman with ten children who lived in the Midwest .
These people seem like they would disagree about almost everything , but if you ask them about television the things that came out of their mouths were almost identical . "
Why do people give it up ?
Krcmar herself lives on the dark side , having given up television about 13 years ago .
" It 's just something I do n't want in the home — it 's a perpetual annoyance , like a gnat , " she said .
The motivations for most people who abandon TV fall into three categories , Krcmar found .
Some give it up to avoid exposing their families to the excessive sex , violence , and consumerism they feel are promoted onscreen .
Others object to the medium itself , claiming television intrudes too much into their lives , interferes with conversation and takes time away from the family .
Finally , some people have a beef with the power and values of the television industry and do n't want its influence in their homes .
In contrast to the average American adult , who watches three hours of television a day , non-watchers fill their time with a plethora of activities .
" Non-viewers had a greater variety of things that they did with their free time than viewers did , " Krcmar said .
" It 's not just that they were reading instead of watching TV .
They were hiking and biking , and going to community meetings and visiting with friends .
Overall , they tend to do more of everything . "
Are they right ?
Science does in fact support many non-watchers ' worst fears about TV .
" The research tends to show that increased exposure to television and violence results in greater aggression in children , " Krcmar said .
" That 's a pretty consistent finding . "
Though not all children become more violent , and everyone reacts uniquely , it 's fair to say that what we watch affects us .
When parents did cut television out of their homes , they reported that their kids did n't bug them as much for junk food and toys advertised on TV .
They also said giving up television made their children easier to manage .
" It 's sort of counter - intuitive , because people think their kids would drive them nuts without TV , " Krcmar said .
" But parents found that kids became very good at entertaining themselves and did n't need to be entertained all the time by something that was lively and active .
They did n’t complain about being bored . "
Downsides of life without TV
People who had relinquished television did n't report too many downsides .
Most felt satisfied getting their news from newspapers and radio , and while some people said they felt less connected to pop culture , " many adults noted that as a point of pride , " Krcmar said .
Even most kids in non-watching households seemed to agree with their parents that they were better off without the reviled medium , though a number of kids around ages 10 to 13 said they resented feeling left out when other kids talk about shows and actors on television .
By the time they reached later adolescence around age 14 and 15 , though , most had come full circle and said they did n't really like TV and did n't mind doing without .
For those who want to experience some of the benefits of life without the tube , but do n't feel ready to go cold turkey , Krcmar said she thinks good things can come just by setting limits .
" I think you can have the benefits just by having kids watch less television , " she said .
" Be selective about content .
You do n’t go to a restaurant and let them eat anything on the menu .
Instead you say choose something that 's healthy that you would enjoy . "
A similarly restrained approach to TV could go a long way toward protecting kids from the downsides of TV .
Last week , you probably noticed new computers from Dell , Gateway and others using a brand new , bizarre - sounding chip from Intel : the Core i7 .
You might have even seen some benchmarks and features showing that this is a real beast of processor .
Well , we 're pretty excited about the Core i7 , so here 's a quick guide to why it 's so awesome :
Advertisement
Hokay , so the way Intel develops chips is on what it calls the " tick - tock cycle " .
The " tick " is the improvement of its current microarchitecture , mainly shrinking it down to make it more energy efficient , along with other tweaks .
As you now can guess , the " tock " indicates the launch of a totally new microarchitecture .
Penryn , for instance , was the tick to the Core 2's tock , shrinking it down from a 65 - nanometer process to 45 nm .
Core i7 is a tock , using a completely new microarchitecture codenamed Nehalem .
Core i7 Nehalem is actually a dramatic step forward , remedying several lingering Intel architecture deficiencies that AMD actually had them beat on years ago .
So , here are four things that specifically make the new chip awesome :
Advertisement
Bye Bye Front - Side Bus
The ancient front - side bus setup has long been a drag on Intel 's chips , and they 're finally ditching it .
The FSB essentially carried data between the CPU and memory controller hub ( which is also out the window , more on that in a sec ) , but that did n't work so well when you started talking buckets of cores .
In its place is a new tech called QuickPath Interconnect that 'll make the old bottlenecks history and running tons of cores even better .
QPI uses direct point - to - point connections that have a bandwidth of about 25 GB /s , way faster than what FSB could offer .
The downside is that it requires a new QPI - friendly motherboard .
This concept is kind of cribbed from AMD , whose HyperTransport has been doing something similar for a longass time .
Integrated Memory Controller and Triple - Channel Memory
You might notice a pattern that a lot of Nehalem 's performance boosts have to do with better access to memory and fatter bandwidth .
Yet another tech that AMD held over Intel 's head for years is an integrated memory controller , which Core i7 finally uses .
Basically this just means that the memory controller is on the same die as the CPU , cutting down memory latency .
Before , with Intel chips , communication had to take place across the front - side bus , making stuff slooooow .
The last memory bonus is that Core i7 supports triple - channel memory .
Right now , you 're probably on a computer using dual - channel memory ( in English , I mean that it uses RAM sticks in sets of two ) .
Core i7 will make three sticks of RAM the new standard — so keep an eye out for plenty of 6GB and 12 GB systems running around .

The Return of Hyper - Threading
Intel abandoned Hyper - Threading after the Pentium 4 , but it 's back in Core i7 ( and Atom , but really , psh ) .
Basically , it 's a parallel - processing tech that runs multiple threads simultaneously .
In English , it divvies up tasks so they can be crunched by a processor simultaneously , instead of one after the other .
It short , it makes video encoding and other parallel - friendly processes run faster .
We 're interested to see what kind of gains this will produce in tandem with programs coded to take advantage of threading , not to mention the next great operating systems , Snow Leopard and Windows 7 , which will supposedly make better use of multiple cores and parallel processing than current OSes .
Built - In Power Management and Overclocking
Core i7 is pretty much a beast already , but whereas Intel used to say that overclocking was bad for your processor , now with the Core i7 , it 's built right in .
The Core i7 is really aggressive with power management , more so than Core 2 , so it 'll sip juice when it 's not busy , and then crank the power when it needs it .
In the BIOS now , you can set it to overclock the CPU in certain situations , and customize that by thermal ratings so it wo n't overheat .
Advertisement
So yeah , Core i7 gets our engines running , and we 're not even chip nerds .
( Honest ! )
Sadly though , right now there are just a few Core i7 chips available , and they 're all for desktops .
There 's not much of a downside for portables — save for the need for new motherboards and the DDR3 RAM already used by premium laptops — but before you see it in a Dell XPS notebook or MacBook Pro , you 're going to see it in a lot of desktop gaming and graphics - intensive systems .
Laptops probably wo n't appear until way into next year , but we think they 'll be well worth the wait .

Delaware County Democrats are claiming that Republicans are intimidating voters with tables that are set up outside polling places .
Republican campaign workers are manning the tables and are asking for voters ' names and party affiliation .
" The Republican are acting like it's an official check in sheet , " said Democratic strategist Tom Hickey .
" You walk up and they say ' What 's your name ? '
But it 's not an official place . "
Hickey said officers from the Delaware County Sheriff 's Department were dispatched to three sites in Ridley Township to dismantle tables .
The sheriff 's department did not answer calls requesting confirmation and comment .
Hickey expects the officers will be making several more appearances through the county .
" We 'll probably find a lot more in Upper Darby , " Hickey said .
He said Republicans set up similar tables in 2004 .
" We called it voter intimidation then , " Hickey said .
How big and bad is the Gangster Burger ?
After online interest in what must be the most massive sandwich on St. Paul ’s North End , the Pioneer Press had to see for itself .
Jason Tall , the chef of the Rice Street Deli , took a full 20 minutes Friday to fry up his culinary opus : two half - pound hamburger patties , three six - ounce steaks , a half - pound of gyro meat , a half - pound of Italian beef , and six slices of cheese – on a sesame seed bun .
“ You sure you want it ?
You know what ’s on it ? ”
Tall asked .
Yes .
“ You want the deluxe ? ” Tall asked .
Sure – that included a leaf or two of lettuce and a wedge of onion .
Picture a sprig of parsley on a porterhouse .
Though the sandwich goes for $ 15.99 , Tall said he tries hard to discourage people from ordering them .
“ I do n’t make too many of these .
I do n’t make any money on them .
Look at all that meat ! ”
Then there ’s the logistics of sizzling up four types of meat on a tiny grill .
The meat required for just one G - Burger took up every bit of fry space .
“ If anyone else orders anything right now , I ’ll be screwed , ” Tall fretted .
Patrons crowded to watch : “ Oh man , have n’t seen one of these yet , ” one gaped .
The seven - inch high creation , too big for any of Tall ’s to - go boxes , much less a pair of human jaws , had to be packaged in several layers of foil .
It took two people to wrap it .
“ See ?
Like a pyramid , ” Tall said , carefully tucking the three - pound mound in a plastic bag .
Four hours later , Pioneer Press staffers had yet to consume the G - Burger .
Most were content to stare at it .
Culinary assessments varied .
One reporter , a vegetarian , jokingly tried to file a police report for terroristic threats .
“ That ’s not a crime .
That ’s delicious ! ” said St. Paul police spokesperson Peter Panos .
The deli is tucked in one corner of the Reemco Gas Stop at Rice Street and Maryland Avenue .
It was opened in August as a way to help the struggling gas station survive .
Tall said one of his other creations – Gangster fries , or fried potatoes topped with gyro meat , melted cheese and cucumber sauce – is a big hit .
“ I had a 70 - year - old lady come in and ask for Gangster fries .
That made my day , ” he said .

A family in western Mexico were left in shock after finding a tiger which had escaped from a circus lying on their patio , police said .
The tiger terrified the town of Zitacuaro , in western Michoacan state , as it wandered the streets for an hour - and - a - half before entering a house , a local police officer said .
The tiger " went through the house and lay down on the patio , " the officer said .
" The family was terrified and they hid .
" But these tigers are peaceful , they do n't attack , " he added .
A total of three tigers escaped from their circus cages when the doors were left open Wednesday .
A trainer recovered two of them quickly , using chickens as bait , while the local pound picked up the third tiger after its town excursion .
A bus hit a stray elephant that had escaped from a circus on a central Mexican highway in September , killing the driver and the animal .

Before my visit to the New York Chocolate Show on Sunday ( November 9 ) , I continue my exploration of exhibitors , especially new ones .
While doing that , I was glad to see that the old fashioned named Lillie Belle Farms from Oregon are smart enough to offer handmade chocolates that could soothe our ailing wallets .
They introduce the aptly named Financial Crunch this way :
" Do n't let these uncertain times get to you .
Let the sheer bliss of our Financial Crunch help you relax .
Extremely crunchy bits of caramelized rice and dark organic chocolate .
Its the cure for what is ailing us all !!!
At only $ 5 a bag we recommend you buy several for you and your friends , other wise the shipping is gonna shock you ..... "
I will let you know if they taste as good as they sound after the show .

Some people sleep around , but others are proudly chaste .
Why would evolution have thrown up such a wide range of strategies ?
( Image : Alan Powdrill / Getty )
SOME people revel in a reputation as a Casanova and others proudly proclaim their chastity .
But most of us probably prefer not to advertise our sexual proclivities .
Still , if you think your attitudes to sex are a private affair consider this .
Earlier this year , Lynda Boothroyd of the University of Durham , UK , and colleagues published a study showing that the majority of men and women were able to accurately judge whether a person would be a good bet for a committed relationship or were more interested in a fling , just by looking at a photograph of their face .
How exactly we make this assessment based on such minimal information is up for debate , though Boothroyd ’s study did yield one clue .
She found that men who were judged to be more “ masculine ” and women who were considered more “ attractive ” , were likely to be seen as more inclined towards casual sex – and to actually be so ( Evolution and Human Behavior , vol 29 , p 211 ) .
This surprising talent for accurately reading people ’s attitude to sex has an obvious benefit – it allows us to hook up with a partner who is likely to want the same out of a sexual relationship as we do .
It also raises the more fundamental question of why individuals have such widely varying attitudes to sex in the first place .
The answer is not simply that beautiful people have more opportunity .
So what does make one person sexually restrained and another outrageously promiscuous ?
And how much do our attitudes …

The hands - on way to budding minds
EVERY year Britain 's school - children provide gratifying evidence of their increasing smartness .
More leave primary school having done well in tests of reading , writing and arithmetic ; more get top grades in national exams at ages 16 and 18 .
Nay - sayers , though , think this progress overstated , even illusory .
They attribute rising marks to dumbed - down curricula , downward - drifting grade boundaries and teaching to the test .
But even the gloomiest assessment , it appears , may not go far enough .
In important ways , the country 's children appear to be becoming dumber .
Michael Shayer of King 's College London has been testing children 's thinking skills since 1976 , when he and colleagues started studying the development of reasoning abilities in young people .
In 2006 and 2007 he got 14 - year - olds to take some of the same tests as 30 years earlier .
The findings , to be published early next year , are sobering .
More than a fifth of youngsters got high scores then , suggesting they were developing the ability to formulate and test hypotheses .
Now only a tenth do .
The tests did not change , so the decline was not caused by different content or marking .
And since they explored the ability to think deeply rather than to regurgitate information or whizz through tasks , the results matter deeply .
In the purest test of reasoning , pupils were shown a pendulum and asked how to find out what affects the rate at which it swings .
“ Their answers indicated whether they had progressed from the descriptive thinking that gets us through most of our days , to the interpretative thinking needed to analyse complex information and formulate and test hypotheses , ” Professor Shayer explains .
In 1976 more boys than girls did well , a fact the researchers put down to boys roaming further out of doors and playing more with tools and mechanical toys .
Both sexes now do worse than before , but boys ' scores have fallen more , suggesting that a decline in outdoor and hands - on play has slowed cognitive development in both sexes .
Britain 's unusually early start to formal education may make things worse , as infants are diverted from useful activities such as making sand - castles and playing with water into unhelpful ones , such as holding a pen and forming letters .
British children 's schooling may be hampered , too , by the tests that show standards rising .
These mean teachers ' careers depend on coaching the weakest , rather than on stretching all children , including the most able .
This interpretation is supported by another , more positive , finding from the research : that fewer children do very badly now than did 30 years ago .
When asked to speculate further on why fewer British teenagers now display mature reasoning , Professor Shayer eschews local explanations and puts the blame squarely on television and computers .
They take children away from the physical experiences on which later inferential skills are based , he thinks , and teach them to value speed over depth , and passive entertainment over active .
That chimes with other researchers ' findings of cognitive gains on tasks that require speed rather than close reasoning — useful , perhaps , as the pace of life accelerates , but hardly a substitute for original thought .
So what of children elsewhere ?
Britain's are not the only ones kept inside for fear of traffic or paedophiles , or slumped in front of a screen for much of the day .
“ There is no similar evidence from elsewhere , ” says Professor Shayer .
“ No one has looked for it . ”
Perhaps they should .
Filk is a science fiction and fantasy inflected subgenre of folk music — you know , tales of hobbits and Tatooine all done up with acoustic stylings .
But filk is also heavily associated with the 1960s hippie generation , and nerdy rockers these days need something that has a more millennial feeling .
Enter Trock , or Timelord Rock .
It 's all about Doctor Who , and it's a lovely smashup of emo shoegazing and electronic zoom .
This phenomenon is so huge , so world - changing , that it has its own internet forum .
And it has a flagship band : Chameleon Circuit , whose first single " Blink , " is about one of the most popular Doctor Who episodes in recent memory ( it was written by Stephen Moffat , the new Doctor Who showrunner ) .
Here is " Blink " with explanatory images from the episode :
And here is " Blink " with an introduction and full emo-tastic Who - gazery from the lead singer :
The band also has a new song called " Exterminate Regenerate " - it 's got a synth flair and is actually quite a bit better than " Blink . "
You can hear it on the band 's MySpace page .
What can we expect next from Trock ?
Hopefully a huge upswelling of tragic tales of love and betrayal featuring the Master , along with some angry breakup songs from Sarah Jane .
I am prepared to fully back this awesome new trend , as long as nobody spins it off into Twock - you know , Torchwood rock .
I am not ready to face that quite yet .

I was struck by this story in the NYT this morning :
As the day wore on , the carefully maintained silence surrounding her campaign - that - is n’t cracked , then shattered under the weight of the intense public interest her bid has drawn .
She declined any questions in Syracuse , grudgingly answered a few in Rochester , and then gave what almost felt like but was not a full - fledged news conference in Buffalo , joined by the mayor there , Byron W. Brown .
Remind you of anyone ?
In fact , Sarah Palin was more qualified to be vice - president than Caroline Kennedy is to be a Senator .
Both are celebrities , but Palin made her own way herself , winning election as mayor and governor without the kind of raw nepotism now on display in New York State .
The model now , of course , is similar - finding a way to get elected without actually exposing your inadequacies .
Hence the press shutdown .
But Kennedy 's self - defense is even more painful than Palin's :
“ I just hope everybody understands that it is not a campaign but that I have a lifelong devotion to public service , ” Ms. Kennedy said as she left the office of the Monroe County Democratic Committee in Rochester .
“ I ’ve written books on the Constitution and the importance of individual participation .
And I ’ve raised my family . ”
Good for you .
But so have millions of others .
And why do you get to parachute in to the Senate ?
Who do you think you are , a Clinton ?

While no future president will take these steps unless compelled to by the people and our representatives in Congress , and while many of these steps should be taken by Congress itself rather than by the president , the first step in placing this critical set of tasks on the agenda of both the next Congress and the next White House is to ask every member of Congress to cosponsor this resolution immediately .
Baldwin Calls for Executive Accountability To Reverse Illegal Actions and Prevent Further Abuses
Congresswoman Tammy Baldwin has introduced the Executive Branch Accountability
Act of 2008 , calling on the next President to reverse the damaging and illegal actions taken by the Bush / Cheney Administration and to collaborate with Congress to proactively prevent any further abuses of executive branch power .
“ Over the past several years , serious questions have been raised about the conduct of high ranking Bush / Cheney Administration officials in relation to some of the most basic elements of our democracy : respect for the rule of law , the principle of checks and balances , and the fundamental freedoms enshrined in the Bill of Rights , ”  said Baldwin .
“ The list of abuses of executive branch power is long , as are the Administration ’s attempts to impede congressional oversight .
Indeed , Congress has presented President Bush , Vice President Cheney , and other Bush / Cheney Administration officials with ample opportunities to reverse these abusive actions and restore our democracy .
At each step , they have , instead , chosen to show contempt for the Congress and the American public .
We must look to the next administration “ “ and the next President “ “ to show leadership in restoring executive branch accountability , ”  Baldwin said .
The Executive Branch Accountability
Act of 2008 calls on the next President of the United States to immediately and publicly reaffirm our nation ’s commitment to the rule of law .
It specifically directs the next President to :
Fully investigate Bush / Cheney administration officials ’ alleged crimes and hold them accountable for any illegal acts .
Ensure that any Bush / Cheney administration official guilty of a war crime is prosecuted under the War Crimes Act and the Anti-Torture Act .
Affirm that it is the sole legal right of Congress to declare war .
Restore the writ of habeas corpus as an essential principle of our democracy .
Ensure that torture and rendition are uniformly prohibited under United States law .
Immediately close the Guantanamo Bay Detention Camp .
Ensure that Americans can bring claims against their government .
Immediately take affirmative steps to protect all documents from the Bush / Cheney Administration and publicly reaffirm that the Office of the Vice President is indeed part of the executive branch .
Publicly review potential abuses of the presidential pardon process .
Reform the use of presidential signing statements .
“ On January 20 , 2009 , the next President of the United States will stand before the American people and take an oath of office to “ ˜” ¦preserve , protect and defend the Constitution of the United States . ’
Along with this oath , it is my fervent hope that he will take the decisive actions detailed in this legislation to restore our democracy , ”  said Baldwin .

On Wednesday , October 29th , this Tesla was being driven at 100 MPH when the driver , a sales director for Tesla , was giving a demonstration ride and tried to take a turn too fast .
Wet roads and poor visibility contributed to the accident which took place in southern France .
The accident was very serious , with the passenger being ejected upon impact .
Fortunately , both driver and passenger survived this terrible accident .
The driver suffered a broken hand and some minor bruises and the passenger has been released from the hospital .
This marks the 3rd time the electric car has crashed on public roads .
The first was when a technician was testing the vehicle and ran into the back of a truck .
The 2nd crash occurred in San Francisco after the driver failed to slow down at a red light and rear ended another vehicle .
So far , the Tesla has proven to be a fairly safe vehicle with none of the 3 crashes resulting in serious injuries .

Viral marketing tips
Viral marketing increases online sales !
That concept seems to pop up everywhere on Internet marketing resources .
So what exactly is viral marketing ?
The simplest way to explain viral marketing is to think in terms of mainstream networking .
Your contacts know about you and your site and you hope to that they pass that information on to someone else .
But hoping is not a good way to approach web marketing , you need to be pro-active in promotion .
By implementing viral marketing strategies , you provide an incentive for web site visitors to carry a sales message .
This incentive is usually a free " carrier " tool for that marketing message or a means by which it is easier for people to spread the word about your products and services .
The idea is not to push your visitors into delivering your sales message to others , but as a side effect of them gaining benefit from a utility or service that you offer .
Free email services = free advertising
A good example of viral marketing is many of the free email services available on the Internet .
The messages that you send from some these free services invariably contain promotion for the company providing the service ; plus there 's advertising in their user interfaces .
Take Hotmail for example .
It handles 100 million legitimate .
emails each day , for 230 million active users worldwide .
Imagine having your sales message in 700 million emails a week !
Even at very low CTR rates , that can translate to a whole lot of new visitors to your site .
OK , so those are pretty huge figures that most of us can only dream of achieving , so how does the little guy utilize the viral marketing concept on a budget of say .... $0 .
Articles as a viral marketing tool
A very successful strategy is the development of articles and tutorials such as these .
You will notice that at the end of each article and tutorial in the copyright info , I request that if the content is going to be reproduced that reference is made to Taming the Beast .
net .
If I am fortunate enough , a webmaster may place an article on a high traffic web site ( along with the proper acknowledgement ) and this will create some traffic to our web site .
Using this strategy , you are relying on the honesty of the user to acknowledge the origin of the tool .
Once you have published a number of articles , you can also submit them to article directories and archives .
I am still a firm believer that written content is king , and no matter what subject you choose write about , there will always be plenty of people wanting the information , especially if it 's for free !
If you do decide to publish your own articles , ensure that the theme is related to your web site , otherwise the traffic you receive will be of little or no value .

Friends are More Dangerous than Beer Posted on Friday , February 15 2008
Everyone has their threshold .
I ’ve just reached mine .
Thanks to AmericaBlog for pointing me to this and this .
Also a hat tip to TPM Election Central .
John “ Country Last ” McCain and Sarah Palin held some truly hate filled rallies on Monday .
Here ’s a montage from McCain ’s hatefest 2008
During this rally , a McCain supporter answers the question posed by Senator Country Last , “ Who is the real Barack Obama ? ”
The unmistakable answer : terrorist !
McCain says nothing .
From The Washington Post and AmericaBlog on Palin ’s rally :
“ Now it turns out , one of his earliest supporters is a man named Bill Ayers , ” Palin said .
“ Boooo ! ” said the crowd .
“ And , according to the New York Times , he was a domestic terrorist and part of a group that , quote , ‘ launched a campaign of bombings that would target the Pentagon and our U.S. Capitol , ' ” she continued .
“ Boooo ! ” the crowd repeated .
“ Kill him ! ” proposed one man in the audience .
Palin went on to say that “ Obama held one of the first meetings of his political career in Bill Ayers ’s living room , and they ’ve worked together on various projects in Chicago . ”
Palin says nothing .
I understand why McCain and Palin are going negative .
The economy is falling apart around us , and they have no solutions .
They are losing in Colorado , Florida , Ohio , North Carolina , Pennsylvania , Nevada and Virginia .
Obama , despite McCain ’s repeated claims , understands what a surge is , because he ’s pulling one off right now .
But the current political environment does not excuse remaining silent when a candidate for president is referred to as a “ terrorist ” in your presence .
A desire to win does not excuse remaining silent during a threat on the life of a U.S. Senator at one of your rallies .
There are no excuses for evil such as this .
John McCain and Sarah Palin , the GOP and all who support them have lost all rights to legitimate argument .
They are liars .
They are wrong .
They are evil .
Yes , evil .
They are one small step short of inciting violence at their rallies .
They are letting physical threats go unchallenged .
I was at Obama ’s rally at Independence Square in Philadelphia back in April .
When he mentioned Hillary Clinton ’s name , the crowd booed , and he told them to stop .
Barack Obama intervened when his supporters booed his opponent .
He called for civility .
Yet , when faced with supporters who label senators terrorists and call for their assassination , John McCain and Sarah Palin said nothing .
This is how evil spreads , from domestic violence to genocide .
People in a position to stop it choose to do nothing .
John McCain is obsessed with his own honor .
No one believes in the myth of the maverick as thoroughly as he does .
He ’s called for civility in campaign tactics while lying about Obama ’s position on sex education .
That ’s ok .
It ’s politics .
If he were n’t a bit of a hypocrite , I would get suspicious .
But the man who would make his name synonymous with honor stoked hatred in his rally today and let one of his senate colleagues be referred to as a terrorist .
We know what America does to terrorists .
And while Obama and William Ayers served on a board together , this is nothing like McCain ’s pro-terrorist history .
He voted repeatedly to protect domestic terrorists who bomb abortion clinics .
He counts as an “ old friend ” one G. Gordon Liddy , an ex-convict who served time for the Watergate break - in , plotted to kill journalists , firebomb a think tank and called for violent resistance against the U.S. government .
While Obama and Ayers ’s relationship is minimal and old news , McCain was on Liddy ’s show this year during the campaign and has accepted $ 1,000 from him as recently as February .
So who ’s the terrorist ?
Now to Sarah Palin .
This simple - minded , overwhelmed , frightened , delusional nitwit thinks she ’s doing “ big things ” by going on “ the attack . ”
She presumes to challenge Obama at his level as if she had earned her position rather than having been selected by an old white man for the job .
She is filled with pride and self - adoration .
She is a fool .
This weekend , she said Obama was “ paling around with terrorists . ” ( a lie debunked by CNN ) .
The irony is almost crippling to my mental functions .
This is from the woman whose church says terrorism vs. Israel is God ’s judgment .
This is a woman who was so close to the radical , separatist Alaska Independence Party , that people thought she was a member .
She spoke to their convention , and her husband was a seven - year member of this organization whose founder was killed in a “ plastic explosives deal gone bad . ”
Palin would know about “ paling around with terrorists . ”
She fornicates with one .
A few weeks ago CPL posted a story which seemed plausible but could n’t be verified .
It said Palin was a racist .
While the specific truth of that story is still unsettled , the pattern is clear : this ticket is painting Obama as the “ other ” and someone to be feared .
This campaign is counting on stoking prejudice and racism .
The McCain - Palin campaign is grotesque and dangerous .
They are picking up where Hillary left off , but have gone much , much farther .
They are presiding over hate rallies where people feel free to yell out murderous threats , and the candidates smile it off and keep going , essentially endorsing such mob mentality .
I want to know who still supports this ticket .
I want to know because if anything should happen to Barack Obama .
If he so much as slips on the jetway or stubs his toe playing basketball , I ’m holding John McCain and Sarah Palin responsible , and I ’m holding those who vote for them responsible for doing nothing to stop an atmosphere of violence .
Enough is enough .
Those of you who have retained your soul and your senses , I ask you do to the following in response to this insane and hate - filled campaign .
Do n’t be one of those people that recognizes wrong and evil and does nothing to stop it .
We are all responsible for creating the world we want to see .
Let ’s go about doing that .
Update : there ’s more hatred .
see my followup post .
In a rather somber article over at Forbes , Henry Manner , former Dean at George Mason University School of Law , sees dark times ahead for freedom :
The political direction of the country is now determined for a long time to come , and it is inevitably leftward .
Politicians would never resist a popular but massive demand for more government regulation ( even the few with enough brainpower to recognize what is going on ) .
The business community has never been a strong supporter of free market capitalism , and it certainly cannot be counted on to change its stance this time around .
The media , the various leftist trend - setting elites and university faculties have been waiting a long time for an opportunity just like this , and we can be sure that they wo n’t squander it .
The shrillness of their attacks on free markets will reach new heights of righteous indignation and assumed moral and intellectual superiority .
No policy issue based on private property , low taxes , small government or free trade will escape the charge that any unregulated free market will lead to disastrous excesses just as happened with the great financial crisis of 2008 .
This will be true for such soon to be rebuffed ideas as tuition vouchers for private schools , private health care , lower estate taxes , deregulation in its many forms , reduced use of eminent domain , tort liability restraint and free trade .
We can anticipate a new reign of mercantilism , as the protectionists among us wield this strong new weapon against globalization and open markets .
And all of this is true in large degree regardless of who wins the forthcoming election .
If Sarbanes - Oxley was any indication of the kind of legislation that results from crisis , then we can be sure that even more ham - handed regulation of all kinds will be the main product of the next Congress .
Henry Waxman ’s grandstanding this past week about bankers ’ greed has been merely the warm - up for what is to follow .
Bankers eager for federal help now will find themselves regulated not far short of total federal control of their business behavior .
Banks wo n’t be permanently nationalized , but what we will get will differ from that result semantically more than factually .
Derivatives , for all their promise of alleviating panics and distributing risk , will not now be allowed to evolve into the brave new system once predicted for them .
Accounting rules will become even more convoluted as we continue to ask for more information out of double - entry bookkeeping than it can ever deliver .
Author Herman Melville spent several years in his youth sailing on whaling ships .
His experiences and his knowledge of the fate of the Essex led to the writing of Moby Dick . *
Photo : Corbis * View Slideshow 1820 : The whaling ship Essex is rammed and sunk by a sperm whale 2,000 miles off the west coast of South America .
The ordeal of the crew inspires Herman Melville 's classic , Moby Dick .
The Essex was an aging vessel from Nantucket , which at the time possessed the largest whaling fleet in the world .
The three - masted ship was 87 feet long and weighed 238 tons .
She was captained by George Pollard Jr. , at 28 already an experienced whaler .
By November 1820 the Essex had been at sea for over a year ( three years out was not uncommon ) , surviving an early knockdown in an Atlantic squall and a rough passage around Cape Horn .
Once the ship reached the fertile Pacific whaling grounds , however , things began looking up .
If the risks of whaling were many , the rewards could be great .
Whale oil was prized as a lighting fuel .
A successful voyage could make a captain wealthy , and meant a good payday for the crew as well .
The Essex had taken its share of whales and on Nov. 20 appeared ready to take a few more when a pod was sighted off the starboard beam .
The ship 's three remaining whaleboats — one had been destroyed by a whale 's flukes during an earlier hunt — were dispatched for the kill .
As the harpooning began , First Mate Owen Chase , commanding one of the whaleboats , looked back and saw a large sperm whale , which he estimated at 85 feet , approaching the Essex .
As he watched helplessly , the whale propelled itself into the ship with great force .
Some crewmen on board were knocked off their feet by the collision , and Chase watched in disbelief as the whale drew back and rammed the ship again .
This time the Essex was holed below the waterline , and doomed .
The crew organized what provisions they could and two days later abandoned ship aboard the three whaleboats .
Twenty men left the Essex .
Eight would ultimately survive the harrowing ordeal that played out over the next three months .
Fearing the " cannibalistic savages " of the South Seas islands ( the irony of that reasoning will become apparent momentarily ) , Pollard decided to head for the more distant coastlines of Chile or Peru , first heading south to catch the expected favorable winds .
The winds , it turned out , were n't favorable at all , but Pollard was determined to reach South America .
Eventually the three boats became separated from one another .
One vanished and was never heard from again .
The other two , one commanded by Pollard and the other by Chase , thrashed against the elements , and as the provisions dwindled and ran out , men began to die .
The first to go were given proper burials at sea , but as food ran out and the survivors on both boats became delirious from hunger , they turned to cannibalism .
In Pollard 's boat , straws were drawn to see who of the remaining four would be sacrificed so that the other three might survive .
Pollard 's young cousin , Owen Coffin , drew short straw .
He was shot and eaten .
Only two men on that boat , Pollard and Charles Ramsdell , were alive when they were rescued by the whaling ship Dauphin after 95 days in an open boat .
Chase and the survivors of his boat were picked up after 90 days .
Three other men , who had chosen to remain on a small island shortly after the ordeal began , were also rescued .
What is known of the details of the ship 's ill - fated voyage rests largely on Chase 's memoir .
He could offer no reason why the whale should attack the ship .
But another young Nantucket whaleman , Herman Melville , drew his own conclusions .
Moby Dick was a very , very smart whale .

WASHINGTON ( MarketWatch ) -- International Monetary Fund Managing Director Dominique Strauss - Kahn said Sunday that leading economies now have coordinated , detailed and comprehensive plans to resolve the severe credit crisis .
He said almost all of the affected nations now have taken strong action to shore up their financial sectors .
Strauss - Kahn made the remarks at a press conference Sunday following two days of intense talks on two continents .
Strauss - Kahn also expressed support for an action plan hammered out Sunday in Europe by leaders of the euro - zone nations .
See full story .
He said the moves were " exactly the type of action " that is needed to reassure very jittery markets .
" We will see tomorrow " what the market reaction is , but " I am confident , " he said .
On Saturday , the IMF director had said policymakers from around the globe were united in their resolve to avert a global financial meltdown .
Although the talks in Washington this weekend have n't come up with the specific solutions needed for each nation , the whole world is committed to do whatever it takes to unfreeze credit markets , Strauss - Kahn said .
" No one is going to let an important financial institution fail , " he said .
The IMF also specifically endorsed the plan of action put forth Friday by the Group of Seven nations , which calls for public funds to recapitalize banks .
Critics said the G7 plan was woefully short on the specifics needed to calm jittery investors .
Although different countries may use different methods , they are all resolved to act as needed , said Youssef Boutros - Ghali , head of the IMF 's International Monetary and Financial Committee .
" No tool will be spared . "
Even as urgent talks continued in Washington , authorities in the United Kingdom were preparing to unveil the specifics of their plan to recapitalize its banking sector , according to a report in The Wall Street Journal .
See full story .
Working against the clock
Many observers say the officials are working against the clock , with global markets set to open on Monday , with or without a credible plan from the world 's governments .
The plan put forth by the Group of Seven on Friday was seen by many as only a first step .
President Bush urged global finance leaders on Saturday to work together quickly on a " serious global response " to " the serious global crisis " in credit markets .
Top policymakers from the Group of 20 largest economies were meeting later Saturday to work on a coordinated response to calm markets that have been shaken by massive losses and bankruptcies .
" We 're in this together .
We will come through this together , " Bush said Saturday after meeting with finance leaders of the G7 industrialized nations at the White House .
On Friday , U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson said his staff was working as quickly as they could to implement a plan to recapitalize important U.S. financial institutions .
Paulson was able to provide few details , however .
The G7 response was a five - part plan similarly lacking in details , although it did provide a common framework , calling for recapitalizing banks with public and private funds , insuring depositors and unfreezing credit markets .
Pointedly , however , the G7 plan did not include one of the two major suggestions made by Brown : government guarantees of all bank liabilities .
The G7 said that " urgent and exceptional action " is needed to stabilize financial markets .
The G7 vowed to use all available tools to support systemically important financial institutions and prevent them from failing .
Mixed reaction
At first blush , some analysts were not too impressed .
Vincent Reinhart , a former top staffer at the Federal Reserve Board , said markets had no interest in pledges but wanted to know exactly what the G7 would do before trading resumes Monday .
" I think the finance ministers just failed a test , or at best got a C minus , " wrote Paul Krugman , a Princeton University economics professor and New York Times columnist .
But Sherry Cooper , chief economist at BMO Capital Markets , said she thought the principles expressed by the G7 would reassure markets .
Ahead of the meeting , Ken Rogoff , a Harvard University professor and former chief economist at the IMF , told MarketWatch that there needed to be an " overwhelming " G7 statement .
" I think the worst thing to do would be to come out with a very tepid response , " he said .
" It would be the end of the G7 . "
On Saturday , Rogoff told Reuters that " markets are going to be very disappointed " by the G7 statement .
The Group of Seven includes the United States , Japan , Germany , France , Italy , the United Kingdom and Canada .
The European Union is also a participant .
The G20 includes those eight and adds China , Brazil , Russia , India , Mexico , South Korea , Saudi Arabia , Argentina , Australia , Indonesia , South Africa and Turkey .
Together , the G20 account for about 90 % of global gross domestic product .
The weekend meetings came as global stock markets endured another volatile day on Friday , capping one of the worst weeks ever .
Investors around the world scrambled to move their funds into the safest and most liquid investments , such as cash and government bonds , fearing that the seizing up of credit markets could lead to a major recession and the failure of large corporations .
Enlarge By Darren Lum for USA TODAY Nadine Artemis and Ron Obadia , pictured with their son Leif , are fighting U.S. narcotics charges .
For Nadine Artemis and Ron Obadia , August began with plans for a family vacation in Minnesota .
The vacation ended with the two Canadian citizens being led through Toronto 's airport in handcuffs , locked up and separated from their baby .
" We were dumbfounded , " Artemis says .
Police told them they could be facing years in prison for exporting narcotics , because 2.5 pounds of material found in their carry - on bag tested positive for hashish .
" All we knew was that we did n't have drugs . "
They were telling the truth .
They did n't have drugs .
They had chocolate .
The couple were caught up in what civil libertarians , public defenders and some narcotics experts say is a growing problem : the use of unreliable field drug - test kits as the basis to arrest innocent people on illegal drug charges .
The inexpensive test kits are used by virtually every police department in the country and by federal agents , including Customs officers at the nation 's borders .
The kits test suspicious materials , and a positive result generally leads to an arrest and court date , pending more sophisticated tests done after the sample is sent to a lab .
The kits use powerful acids that react with the substance in a plastic pouch .
If the liquid turns a certain color , it is a considered a positive result .
But a number of legal products and plants test positive : chocolate for hashish ; rosemary for marijuana ; and natural soaps for the " date - rape drug " GHB .
" The tests have no validity , " says former FBI narcotics investigator Frederick Whitehurst .
And as more organic products come on the market , " the potential for civil rights violations when these presumptive tests are out there is phenomenal . "
Although police have been using the field test kits for decades , " there 's no regulation , no oversight that these drug tests perform in any way , " says Dr. Bronner 's Magic Soaps President David Bronner , whose products have tested positive for GHB .
With the growth of organic and natural foods and products , experts say arrests may increase .
" We are alarmed by the growing number of people who have been taken to jail for simply possessing organic products , " says Ronnie Cummins , director of the Organic Consumers Association .
On Aug. 29 , Artemis and Obadia , founders of Living Libations , a company that makes organic and natural food and beauty products in Haliburton , Ontario , were cleared of the charges when lab tests showed they were simply transporting chocolate .
Then , on Sept. 11 , they were expecting to drive across the border in Lewiston , N.Y. , on their way to natural health festival .
The couple hired a lawyer to go with them just in case they were stopped again .
It did no good .
Officers searched their bags , and ran drug tests on their food and toiletries .
The chocolate again came up positive for drugs , as did a bottle of tea tree oil , a natural antiseptic and antifungal .
Officers arrested Obadia , and he is now home waiting for lab results that he says will exonerate him again .
The first time he was arrested , " I was so naive , " he says .
" I thought somebody must have planted drugs in our bag .
We did n't know the tests could be faulty . "
So far , the couple 's legal bills have topped $ 20,000 , covered in part by Bronner 's company .
Customs spokesman Lloyd Easterling declined to comment about the case or the use of the kits .
Others who have been wrongly accused : • Cornelius Salonis of Shakopee , Minn. , who spent two months in jail after police stopped him in August for driving drunk and tested deodorant in his car that registered positive for cocaine .
Mankato , Minn. , public defender Richard Hillesheim says Salonis admitted to the drunken - driving charge " but he was scared witless about this drug charge that came out of left field . "
Lab tests ultimately showed there was no cocaine .
• Punk rocker Don Bolles , who spent three days in jail in Newport Beach , Calif. , in 2007 after his Dr. Bronner 's soap tested positive for GHB .
The charges were dropped when lab tests found no drugs .
Government officials say there are no records on the number of people who have been wrongly arrested because of the tests .
Garrison Courtney of the Drug Enforcement Agency says the test kits are " not perfect but they give you a pretty good idea " whether a suspicious substance is an illegal drug .
Allen Miller of Forensic Source , which makes kits , says they find " families of chemical compounds " and are not meant to be definitive .
Any arrest should be the result of good investigative police work , Miller says .
But Adam
Wolf of the ACLU says " police officers and drug - test companies should not subject our constitutional rights to a game of chance . "

The first Boys From Brazil : Nazi graveyard discovered deep in the Amazon rainforest
A graveyard of former Nazis bent on creating a ' foreign Fatherland ' in the Amazonian rainforests from which to spread Hitler 's maniacal beliefs has been discovered in Brazil .
The relics betray a madcap plan back in the 1930s to create a master race thousands of miles from Germany .
The graveyard and other ruins that fanatical Nazis left behind are chronicled in a new book .
Entitled ’ The Guayana - Projekt .
A German Adventure on the Amazon ’ it says die - hard Nazis believed they were destined to settle the world like pioneers of the wild west in America .
Final resting place : Brazilian natives at a Nazi grave in the Amazon .
The wooden cross decorated with swastikas carries the inscription : ' Joseph Greiner died here on 2.1.1936 '
Discovered : Crosses mark the graves deep in the jungle
It has long been known that Nazis wandered post - war into the remote regions of South America , befriended by fascist governments and military dictatorships .
The 1978 film Boys From Brazil told a of a bizarre plot to clone Hitler that was hatched by Joseph Mengele in his jungle hideout .
But the harshness of the Amazonian jungle was a strange choice of destination .
Historical Nazi ' footprints ' are found in grave markers with swastikas , photos found in archives back home and the remains of dwellings .
On an island on a tributary of the River Jary in Brazil author Jens Gluessing found a nine - foot high wooden cross decorated with swastikas that testified to one of the explorers who never made it back to Berlin .
It carries the inscription : ' Joseph Greiner died here on 2.1.1936 , a death from fever in the service of German Research Work . '
Chilling : Gregory Peck as Nazi fiend Dr Joseph Mengele in the 1978 film Boys From Brazil
Locals call the site ' The Nazi graveyard ' but it was originally destined to be part of a string of Nazi settlements across the Amazon
which Hitler missionaries would use as jumping - off points to spread the gospel of totalitarianism .
In archives of the Brazilian State Department and the National Museum in Rio de Janeiro , Gluessing found details of Greiner ’s jungle mission .
Greiner arrived in 1935 , bankrolled by the Nazi government and died of yellow fever or Malaria .
He was one of three sent out by S.S race specialists as the vanguard of what they perceived would be a wave of settlers .
Greiner and his compatriots had dozens of helpers with them exploring the region bordering French Guyana with a view to populating it for the Reich .
They also had their sights on the neighbouring British and Dutch colonies .
The Guayana project : Nazi's in the jungle Camp .
In 1935 German researchers went on an expedition of the Brazilian jungles
With the natives :
In 1935 German researchers went on an expedition of the Brazilian jungles
They sent back to Berlin details of how a German soldiers should live in Brazil , even though their cover story was that they were collecting specimens of fauna and wildlife .
Schulz Kampfhenkel , an officer in the S.S. and leader of the expedition which claimed Greiner ’s life , returned from the jungles and submitted to his boss Heinrich Himmler details of the ’ Guayana Project . ’
' The two largest scantly populated , but rich in resources , areas on earth are in Siberia and South America , ' he wrote to Himmler .
' They alone offer spacious immigration and settlement possibilities for the Nordic peoples . '
As Siberia semed likely to fall at that time to China , he recommended colonising Amazonia for ' people without living space . '
He added in typically Nazi fashion : ' For the more advanced white race it offers outstanding possibilities for exploitation . '
They applied to conquer the Amazon jungle
A film was produced showing Greiner 's work in the jungle in the 1930s .
He believed the Nazis could colonise ' Amazonia '
As befitting an S.S. man who bought wholly into concepts of Nazi race purity he said the people who lived there ' cannot be measured in civilised terms as we known them in Germany . '
With one million German settlers in Brazil already , he argued the seedcorn was already there for the expansion of the Third Reich and that they could secure a ' bridgehead ' against American influence in the region .
The author found evidence , however , that Himmler had ' scant interest ' in his grandiose settlement plans .
A Nazi film was made of his travels – but no mention made of the Guayana Project : it remained classified by S.S. intelligence .
' Given time , the plan may be submitted again , ' Himmler wrote to his jungle emissary .
But his experiences were put to use by the Nazi war machine : he became Nazi Germany ’s leading expert in aerial photo - reconnaissance interpretation .
After the war the Americans arrested him and he was placed in a POW camp in Salzburg , Austria .
Released , he died in 1989 , still dreaming of a German colony amid the rain forests .

The robot that can pull faces just like a human being
Scientists have created the first ' humanoid ' robot that can mimic the facial expressions and lip movements of a human being .
' Jules ' - a disembodied androgynous robotic head - can automatically copy the movements , which are picked up by a video camera and mapped on to the tiny electronic motors in his skin .
It can grin and grimace , furrow its brow and ' speak ' as his software translates real expressions observed through video camera ' eyes ' .
Jules is the first humanoid robot who can realistically mimic a real person 's expressions merely by watching their face
Jules mimics the expressions by converting the video image into digital commands that make the robot's servos and motors produce mirrored movements .
And it all happens in real time as the robot can interpret the commands at 25 frames per second .
The project , called ' Human - Robot Interaction ' , was devised at the Bristol Robotics Laboratory ( BRL ) , run by the University of the West of England and the University of Bristol .
A team of robotics engineers - Chris Melhuish , Neill Campbell and Peter Jaeckel - spent three - and - a - half years developing the breakthrough software to create interaction between humans and artificial intelligence .
The robot is seen making a convincing attempt at being human automatically , controlled only by computer software
Robotics engineers say Jules 's expressions have to look natural in the same way as humans
Jules has 34 internal motors covered with flexible rubber ( ' Frubber ' ) skin , which was commissioned from roboticist David Hanson in the US for BRL .
It was originally programmed to act out a series of movements - as can be seen in the video - where ' Jules ' talks about ' destroying Wales ' .
The technology works using ten stock human emotions - such as happiness , sadness , concern etc - that the team ' taught ' Jules via programming .
The software then maps what it sees to Jules 's face to combine expressions instantly to mimic those being shown by a human subject .
Peter Jaeckel , working on Jules at his lab in Filton , Bristol
' We have a repertoire of behaviours that somehow is dynamic ' , Chris Melhuish said .
' If you want people to be able to interact with machines , then you 've got to be able to do it naturally .
' When it moves , it has to look natural in the same way that human expressions are , to make interaction useful . '
Peter Jaeckel , who works in artificial emotion , artificial empathy and humanoids at BRL , said : ' Realistic , life - like robot appearance is crucial for sophisticated face - to - face robot - human interaction .
Human face movements are picked up by a video camera and mapped onto the tiny electronic motors in Jules 's skin
' Researchers predict that one day , robotic companions will work , or assist humans in space , care and education .
' Robot appearance and behaviour need to be well matched to meet expectations formed by our social experience .
' Violation of these expectations due to subtle imperfections or imbalance between appearance and behaviour results in discomfort in humans that perceive or observe the robot .
' If people were put off , it would counteract all efforts to achieve trustworthiness , reliability and emotional intelligence .
' All these are requirements for robotic companions , assisting astronauts in space or care robots employed as social companions for the elderly .
' Unlike most research projects , the focus lies on dynamic , subtle , facial expressions , rather than static exaggerated facial displays .
' Copycat robot heads have been created before , but never with realistic human - looking faces . '
But not everyone is impressed by Jules 's mastery of mimicry .
Kerstin Dautenhahn , a robotics researcher at the University of Herefordshire , believes that people may be disconcerted by humanoid automatons that simply look ' too human ' .
' Research has shown that if you have a robot that has many human - like features , then people might actually react negatively towards it , ' she said .
' If you expose vulnerable people , like children or elderly people , to something that they might mistake for human , then you would automatically encourage a social relationship .
' They might easily be fooled to think that this robot not only looks like a human and behaves like a human , but that it can also feel like a human .
And that 's not true . '
It is hoped that the technology developed in Jules will help create robots for use in space , to accompany astronauts on solo missions , and in healthcare settings and nursing homes .

What a difference a month makes !
In Bottoming Out ( 321 Energy , September 10 , 2008 ) I predicted that oil prices would settle in the $ 75 - $ 80 range ( NYMEX WTI monthly average ) by 2010 or in 2009 if the economy continued to decline .
Today 's bargain price for a barrel of oil is about $ 73 .
I still believe the longer term 2009 price will fall into line with my original prediction when OPEC makes deep production cuts and the current credit crunch begins to ease .
A recession in the United States is in full swing even as we wait for lagging government indicators to catch up with the Conference Board and reality .
Our oil consumption is a proxy signaling levels of economic activity .
The IEA 's September Oil Market Report ( OMR ) states that " the correlation between economic activity and oil demand is very strong .
Between 1983 and 2007 , US GDP grew by 3.2 % per year on average , while demand expanded by 1.1 % per year on average over the same period " ( graph below ) .
U.S. oil demand is way down .
Last week 's EIA status report shows that " product supplied " ( actual consumption ) in the United States fell to 18.660 million barrels per day ( b/d ) , the lowest level since July , 1999 ( xls data series ) .
This week 's report is even lower at 18.614 million b/d .
Dramatically lower oil consumption is yet another sign of our ailing economy .
The plunge in demand does not betoken a response to high oil prices or a sudden miraculous increase in our energy efficiency .
The 4 - week moving averages show that product supplied fell from 20.292 million b/d in the last week of August to 18.660 in the first week of October , a fall of 8 % in a mere 6 weeks .
This dip occurred after oil prices , which averaged about $ 133 / barrel ( NYMEX WTI monthly ) in both June & July , fell to $ 116.61 in August and then further to $ 103.90 in September .
No doubt high oil prices have prompted Americans to curtail some of their oil consumption .
We would also expect some lag between the high summer prices and falling demand as consumers take the time necessary to make adjustments .
Some of the downturn is due to regional spot shortages following the hurricanes .
However , the short - run price elasticity of gasoline demand ( discussed here ) could not possibly be as large as the demand swan dive indicates .
The price elasticity of diesel fuel demand is probably even lower .
Distillate fuel oil demand was 6.9 % below the 2007 level in the latest EIA report , which points to a decrease in trucking volumes .
Jet fuel was down 6.4 % , signaling a similar fall in air travel .
Sagging U.S. car sales , even where people choose more fuel - efficient vehicles , could not have had much effect in such a short period of time .
" The research firm [ Global Insight ] predicts U.S. new - car sales to total 13.6 million this year , a 16 percent drop from the 16.1 million vehicles sold in 2007 . "
Finally , rising jobless claims must be affecting vehicle miles traveled because , as CNN Money 's Steve Hargreaves helpfully points out " unemployed people tend to drive a lot less " ( Oil Prices : Buckle Up for a Wild Ride ( October 8 , 2008 ) .
The IEA 's September Oil Market Report states that " The oil price doubled in real terms between 1978 and 1980 , leading to a 9.9 % oil demand contraction over that period . "
Despite the much lower energy intensity ( energy consumption per GDP ) in the United States now , which is supposed make oil use less sensitive to economic conditions , demand has fallen 8.9 % compared to the 2nd week of October , 2007 , with most of that coming in the last 7 weeks .
Such is the depth of the economic slowdown in the United States .
What about the longer term outlook for the oil markets ?
The Medium Term Economic Outlook
I assume the correlation between GDP growth and oil demand ( graph above ) since 1983 will remain largely the same in the medium - term ( 2009 - 2013 ) .
Making a significant increase ( > 10 % ) in our oil efficiency without our sacrificing economic health is a gradual process that takes a decade or more unless society makes a concerted effort along those lines .
Achieving greater efficiency also depends on the pace of new car sales , which depends in turn on the strength of the economic recovery .
So we must look at the economic forecasts to assess how much of a comeback OECD oil consumption will make after current recession .
The International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) has released their World Economic Outlook ( October , 2008 ) .
The advanced ( OECD , without Eastern / Central Europe ) economies are forecast to recover quickly after 2009 with real GDP rising to 3 % and then falling to 2.5 % in 2013 ( graph below and Table A1 Summary of World Output , p. 259 ) .
The emerging economies , which have clearly demonstrated higher output growth since the mid-1990s , slow down during the recession but recover a bit to achieve a growth rate of 6.9 % by 2013 .
Many observers do n't believe the IMF 's optimistic forecast .
In How to Get Growth Back on Track , Michael Mandel casts doubt on whether the output growth recorded previously in 2004 - 2007 was real , citing stagnant real wages and salaries , Americans ' over - reliance on credit and dubious worker productivity figures .
This view will come as no surprise to those who read Our Phony Economy ( ASPO - USA , May 21 , 2008 ) or are familiar with the work of Kevin Phillips .
The main product and export of the United States now appears to have been mortgage - backed collateralized debt obligations .
Mandel 's point is that if recent growth was illusory , how are we going to achieve such growth levels after the current downturn ?
Mandel also cites pessimists ( realists ? ) who would argue with the IMF :
" There will be less innovation [ in finance ] and less credit expansion , so the speed limit for the growth of the economy will be lower , " says Mohammed El - Erian , co-chief executive at Pimco , the giant bond - fund manager . "
This will be the regime for several years . "
Adds Rajeev Dhawan , director of the Economic Forecasting Center at Georgia State University : " This credit problem , whenever it 's solved , will have its fallout on the future growth rate of the economy .
It is going to cost resources that could have been used for other things . " [ like energy infrastructure ... ]
China remains the key to all future oil consumption scenarios .
The IMF expects China to keep growing , and so do the Chinese ( The Guardian , October 10 , 2008 ) .
China 's economy will grow 10.1 percent in 2008 and 9.5 percent in 2009 despite the crisis engulfing global markets , the government 's top think - tank [ the IMF ] said in a report released on Friday [ cited above , see Table A4 , p. 265 ]
The forecasts by the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences ( CASS ) are more optimistic than those of the IMF , which said this week it expects 9.7 percent growth in Chinese gross domestic product this year and 9.3 percent in 2009 .
" The financial crisis and the world economic slowdown will have an impact on us , but they wo n't change the fundamentals of the Chinese economy , " Chen Jiagui , vice - head of CASS , told a conference .
China 's GDP expanded 10.1 percent in the second quarter from a year earlier , down from 11.9 percent in all of 2007 .
" The slowdown in 2008 and 2009 should be read as a normal fluctuation in growth .
There is not enough evidence to say that an economic downturn is taking place , " the think - tank said in the report .
Domestic investment and consumption would keep the world 's fourth - largest economy on track , the report said .
[ China's
China 's GDP expanded 10.1 percent in the second quarter from a year earlier , down from 11.9 percent in all of 2007 .
" The slowdown in 2008 and 2009 should be read as a normal fluctuation in growth .
There is not enough evidence to say that an economic downturn is taking place , " the think - tank said in the report .
Domestic investment and consumption would keep the world 's fourth - largest economy on track , the report said .
[ China 's 3rd quarter GDP growth slowed to 9 % . ]
Even now during the worst part of the economic downturn , China 's " crude - oil imports totaled 15.03 million metric tons ( 3.54 million b/d ) in September , about 10 % above the 13.66 million tons a year earlier " ( or 4.89 million b/d , depending on the source ) .
Here 's a projection for future Chinese oil demand , assuming their domestic production plateau ( about 4 million b/d ) continues :
I believe anemic growth in the OECD countries along with the continued strong growth forecast by the IMF in the emerging nations is the most likely scenario in 2009 - 2013 .
As I discussed in Bottoming Out , non-OECD oil demand will slow a bit during the current downturn but should remain robust in 2009 and thereafter .
American oil demand is falling more precipitously than I had imagined possible even a month ago , so demand growth in the developing world ( the BRIC countries , the Persian Gulf ) will not completely offset falling consumption in the OECD in the next year or so .
American oil consumption is also likely to rebound some from its current level in the coming months .
Looking at what we have so far , the following scenario looks reasonable :
The correlation between GDP growth and oil demand ( IEA graph above ) since 1983 will remain largely the same in the medium - term ( 2009 - 2013 )
China and other developing economies will be consuming more oil in the coming years as their economic growth slows but remains strong OECD oil average annual consumption will bottom out somewhere well below 2006 consumption levels in 2009 Economic recovery in the advanced economies will be slow , characterized by low growth rates in the medium - term
The rebound in OECD oil consumption will thus lag well behind burgeoning consumption in the emerging economies
Taken together , none of this is particularly alarming as long as the word 's oil supply can continue to grow .
But if we add the following condition
The global crude oil supply will hit a permanent ceiling in 2011 , as argued in Peak Oil Is A Done Deal ( ASPO - USA , July 16 , 2008 )
then the implications for the U.S. and the world 's other advanced economies are enormous , and it is to this I now turn .
Demand Destruction versus Suppression
The IEA 's Oil Market Report discusses the consequences of the decrease in U.S. oil consumption .
As oil demand continues to shrink in the OECD as a result of adverse fundamentals – the economic slowdown and the high oil price – there is ongoing debate on whether this loss will be permanent or temporary – i.e. , whether demand has been ‘ destroyed ’ or merely ‘ suppressed ’ , notably in the US , the largest OECD ( and global ) oil consuming country .
Although , at first glance , historical evidence would lend some credence to the ‘ suppression ’ view , the ‘ destruction ’ case may be more persuasive and points to profound long‐term consequences .
The ' suppression ' argument relies on what happened after high oil prices following the oil supply shock of the late ' 70s and early ' 80s led to a demand crash .
After 1983 , an increasing global oil supply supported rising OECD demand , a trend that continued more or less uninterrupted until 2006 .
This cyclic view depends on the idea that a similar pattern will re-emerge this time , with lower oil prices stimulating demand again after the current recession .
This view assumes , contrary to the supply data since 2005 , that oil production can respond to demand as required .
The IEA argues , correctly in my view , that falling OECD consumption in the last few years likely represents a permanent move toward conservation and efficient oil use , i.e. we already reached peak demand in the U.S. and elsewhere in the developed world in 2006 .
( See pp. 8 - 9 of the OMR to read the discussion . )
The IEA believes a " more pertinent question " is
... whether the ongoing structural shift towards greater energy efficiency will be more pronounced than in the past .
Even though the current price slide from its July all ‐time record high is largely related to fundamentals ( the severe contraction in OECD demand , most notably in the US ) , the oil market will likely remain tight given the continued strength of demand growth outside the OECD and supply ‐side constraints .
From that perspective , sustained high prices and sluggish economic activity ( the economic rebound in the OECD is not expected to occur before late 2009 at best ) will continue to support the current wave of structural adjustments , which will further reduce US consumption per capita in the medium to long term .
[ emphasis added ]
The ongoing and permanent realignment of global oil consumption ( graph below ) is now accelerating .
The OECD 's share of the oil pie was 62 % in 1990 but only 57 % in 2007 .
Following current trends , oil demand in the developing world will make up about 46 % of global oil consumption by 2011 , a substantial redistribution of who gets to consume the available oil .
And by 2015 , the non-OECD share may be closing in on 50 % ( graphs below ) .
For example , once China is consuming 9 million barrels per day in 2011 , they will be loathe to give back any of that share to the world market , even if government fuel subsidies are lifted in the future .
The same is true of Saudi Arabia , Russia or India .
In a future price competition for oil between wealthy China and the debt - ridden United States , who would you place your money on ?
In the past a rising tide lifted all boats .
The oil pie was much larger in 2007 than it was in 1990 , which left room for growth for all oil consumers .
That wo n't be possible this time around if a peak in the world oil supply occurs in the medium - term .
Thus we come to the real meaning of the IEA 's " continued strength of demand growth outside the OECD and [ oil ] supply constraints . "
Eventually , every barrel of oil will be " allocated " according to who is using what , and only competitive price wars for oil will change the established arrangement , although the specific price / demand dynamics are sure to be complex and , from our vantage point in 2008 , unpredictable .
The IEA states that " sustained high prices and sluggish economic activity ... will continue to support the current wave of structural adjustments . "
Yes , that 's the hope , but the writing is already on the wall if my argument is correct .
Whatever amount of oil we 're consuming in 2011 is likely to be the most oil we 're ever going to get to use .
We will be forced to make structural adjustments or suffer the economic consequences .
I do n't believe the full implications of this accelerating structural shift in who consumes the world 's oil have been understood in the United States , the European Union , Mexico , Korea , Japan , or by the IEA itself .
Non-OPEC Production Going Down Hill
I 've made the " peak oil " argument in my Done Deal article and elsewhere , so I will not belabor the point here .
However , the EIA 's October Short Term Energy Outlook contains important updates about declining oil production outside of OPEC , thus reinforcing how urgent it is for us to examine how relative oil scarcity will affect our economic growth in the future .
From the EIA :
Non‐OPEC supply had been expected to increase in the second half of the year after declining by almost 300,000 bbl/d during the first half of 2008 compared with year ‐earlier levels .
However , a series of supply disruptions , especially the closure of the Baku ‐Tbilisi ‐Ceyhan oil pipeline and the impacts of Hurricanes Gustav and Ike upon the U.S. Gulf of Mexico , led to a revision in this Outlook .
As a result , non‐OPEC supply is expected to decline by about 115,000 bbl/d during the second half of 2008 , compared with the year ‐earlier level , and consequently non‐OPEC supply growth in 2008 is now expected to be negative for the first time since 2005 .
The 2009 growth in non‐OPEC supply of 730,000 bbl/d is expected to largely meet the anticipated increase in global consumption , barring delays in new projects and unanticipated disruptions .
The United States , Azerbaijan , and Brazil represent the bulk of non‐OPEC supply growth in 2009 , although some of the growth in two of these countries simply represents a return to normal production conditions .
Let 's put this in perspective .
When I wrote These Are the Good Years ( ASPO - USA , February 20 , 2008 ) , the EIA was forecasting that non-OPEC production would grow 0.9 million b/d in 2008 and 1.5 million b/d in 2009 .
At the time , I cut the EIA 's forecast in half ( over both years ) .
When I published Peak Oil Is A Done Deal , the EIA still expected growth of 230,000 barrels per day in 2008 and 830,000 in 2009 .
Now , the EIA reports that non-OPEC production declined in 2008 , partially due to the BTC and hurricane disruptions , and will only grow by 730,000 barrels per day in 2009 , some of which " simply represents a return to normal production conditions . "
How will lower oil prices affect the gloomy non-OPEC situation ?
1
It depends on the marginal cost of production for new projects .
The average cost for the most expensive new projects -- known as the marginal cost of production -- is about $ 75 - $ 80 a barrel , according to London - based analysts Bernstein Research .
" In the long run we continue to believe that oil and gas prices will trend up in line with the marginal cost of supply , " said Bernstein .
" However , prices should continue to cycle between the cash cost at the bottom , $ 45 - $ 50 a barrel , and the price of demand destruction , $ 110 - $ 125 at the top . "
I think it unlikely we 'll see $ 110 - $ 125 during a U - shaped recession ( barring a severe disruption ) but $ 50 / barrel is possible , which would signal a total economic collapse in the OECD countries .
A sustained run of oil prices below $ 70 / barrel will certainly delay new oil projects , but volatile prices in the range Bernstein Research cites will have the same effect .
In both cases , low prices , along with lack of capital for upstream oil exploration & production , would severely impair the non-OPEC world 's ability to replace ( let alone exceed ) declining output in the medium - term
Examples of price - project dependencies are not hard to find .
Concerning Jack / St. Malo in the ultra - deepwater Walker Ridge , Gulf of Mexico , Chevron Vice - Pres. Steven P. Thurston recently said " we believe we will find a commercial solution , " but obviously a commercial solution depends on oil prices staying ( well ) above their break - even point .
At the tar sands , new projects , not existing ones , will certainly be in trouble ( Calgary Herald , October 17 , 2008 ) .
As First Energy 's William Lacey was quick to point out Thursday , oilsands operations did not shut down when oil hit $ 10 a barrel in 1998 and early 1999 .
" They will keep running , no matter what . . . unless there is a massive shift somewhere . . . these are not easy projects to shut down or start up .
But it 's the new projects like Fort Hills that we estimate need a $ 115 oil price to achieve a 10 per cent after - tax return , that are in the territory of now being uneconomic , " he said .
As to what the break - even oil price is for these operations , Lacey says the way to look at it is the cash cost per barrel to operate .
The cash cost calculation typically includes operating costs , including expenses such as general and administrative costs , royalties and interest expense .
A recent analysis by Paul Horsnell of Barclays summarized the precarious supply situation down the road .
There is a strong asymmetry on the supply side in that quantities tend to respond faster to sharply lower than sharply higher prices .
It does not take long at low prices for supply to be compromised right along the curve .
Once projects are canceled or delayed , it can take a long period of higher prices before they start to move forward again .
Our view is that sub -$ 90 per barrel , the world faces a serious supply side crunch as little as two years away .
While all the attention is on demand , in the background credit conditions , liquidity preference and price uncertainty are such as to mean that large chunks are already falling off the supply profile for both oil and alternative energies .
We would then tend to disagree with the view that a falling oil price is the main bright spot .
If the source of the price fall is an expectation of a weaker global economy , and if it is just setting the world up for a more severe energy crisis , then that does not look like unambiguously good news .
I would be remiss if I concluded this section without noting that the EIA 's Outlook points out that U.S. " domestic oil production has been steadily declining since the 1970s and the 2008 projection for crude oil production falls under 5 million bbl/d for the first time since 1946 . "
You read that correctly — since 1946 .
The dip below 5 million b/d is due to the hurricane disruptions , so it is only a temporary setback , but this statistic should serve as a warning to America to sober up .
Oil production above 5 million b/d will likely become a thing of the past after 2012 .
The sharp price rise to $ 147 / barrel back in June also serves as a warning of Things To Come .
Worse yet , as production outside of OPEC falters , our dependency on the cartel increases , which will not come as welcome news to the unenviable Barack Obama , who has pledged to get American off Persian Gulf and Venezuelan oil in 10 years .
Perhaps he should worry about replacing Mexican imports and prepare for less oil from the tar sands , which " could be to the oil industry what sub - prime lending was to the banking sector . "
A Race Against Time
Should n't we welcome decreased oil consumption in the United States ?
Less demand will decrease our imports , lowering the tax on American consumers and shoring up our trade balance .
To the extent that reduced oil use does not affect our economic health , implying a further decrease in our energy intensity with respect to liquids fuels , we should be happy with our ability to get along without the oil .
But if reduced oil consumption in the U.S. after 2010 begins to cause economic hardship , impairing our ability to get back on our feet again , we should be quite concerned .
Wars get started over this kind of thing .
The IEA believes a structural shift may be in place , citing a move to more efficient vehicles , the drop in vehicle - miles - traveled , the tentative demise of suburban sprawl , and changes in business practices to promote efficiency .
But the jury is still out :
The available evidence so far , albeit admittedly anecdotal , suggests that US consumers are both expecting the oil price to stay high and the economy to remain subdued .
Nevertheless , we have kept our US 2009 forecast largely unchanged until more tangible proof of these trends becomes available .
If my analysis of our longer term oil consumption is correct , or nearly so , then we might view the next 3 years as a window of opportunity , our last chance to reduce our oil dependency through voluntary structural changes .
Otherwise , all changes will be made under duress .
These adjustments , in line with the new spirit of socialism , will have to be promoted , coordinated and largely paid for through federal policies that specifically target oil consumption .
Unfortunately , there is little in Barack Obama 's energy plan that indicates an appropriate level of concern , whereas ample measures are proposed to fight global warming .
Alas , Democrats have never understood the oil industry and probably never will .
C'est la vie .

Notes
1 . Here 's an extraordinary statement :
OPEC President Chekib Khelil and officials from Iran and Qatar have called on the group to reduce output after prices dropped from a record over $ 147 a barrel in July on slowing demand in developed economies like the United States .
Khelil on Monday said non-OPEC oil producers like Russia , Norway and Mexico also should cut production to help stabilize sagging prices .
He said that if oil prices fell below $ 70 a barrel , many oil projects internationally “ will be delayed or die . ”
Norway , Mexico , Russia cut production ?
That should be no problem !
Norway and Mexico have been " cutting " production for years now , and Russia started " cutting " production this year .
It was one of the notorious Somali pirates ' first defeats - and now the Indian Navy has released spectacular evidence of their sinking of a hostile ship .
The vessel , reportedly a pirate ' mother ship ' , exploded after an exchange with the Indian frigate INS Tabar in the Gulf of Aden near Somalia a week ago .
When the pirates opened fire , the captain of the Indian vessel retaliated , hit the ship straight on , and it burst into flames and sank .
The situation in the waters off the Somalian coast seems to be coming to a head .
Pirates recently hijacked the Saudi Arabian - owned supertanker ' Sirius Star ' , and it was anchored near the African country .
Somali pirates Somali pirate attack
Hero captain on how cruise ship was saved Ciro Pinto , hero captain of cruise ship ' MSC Melody ' , has told BILD how the passengers and crew were saved from a hijack attack by Somali pirates .
But after threats from Islamists to ambush the ship , the pirates navigated it back out into the open sea .
They are demanding a € 12 million ransom for its safe return , according to Arab media .
The German Navy has also been helping in the fight against the pirates .
On Sunday , the frigate ‘ Mecklenburg - Vorpommern ’ sent its onboard helicopter to help two cargo vessels .
The freighters had been attacked by pirates in speedboats .

If you look for a job , you must have a resume .
If you look for employees , you must assume that all resumes you see are full of lies ( since many if not most of them are ) .
Therefore what is the point ?
I simply can't understand how something so useless is also so necessary .
It 's like suborning perjury to ask for a resume .
So what do employers do to verify a resume ( or more accurately verify the prospective employee is n't a ditch digger ) ?
They ask you to take tests to see if you know something the employer deems useful .
Assuming you pass this gauntlet they ask you to interview and answer specific questions about the useful items .
So , again , what was the purpose of the resume ?
I 've always wanted to send out a resume that said nothing but :
Will write good code for good money
It 's just as useful , and a promise to boot .
Resumes are also useless to indicate particular skill that is n't a single technology .
My full resume ( one not edited for some useless reason to focus on the job being applied for ) has all these technologies that I have used in my career in a professional environment ( i.e. someone paid me or otherwise ( I do a lot of volunteer development ) for producing an asset ) :
I spent a lot of time learning and mastering every one of these things .
Some I 've practiced for many years , some only for a year or even less ( EDI and HIPPA ) .
I 've used languages for varying amounts of time ( from 10 years of C , 5 of C++ , 2 Obj - C , 10 of Java , and so far less than 1 of PHP ) and not necessarily in any continuous fashion .
What does this tell you ?
That I am so incompetent at everything I have to keep switching technologies to get a new job ?
Or that I am able to learn anything on the fly and apply all my skills to master its use ?
Or that I like to make up stuff and use big words without knowing what they mean ?
I guess people will assume the most negative view given that huge amount of lying that goes on in resumes .
So why put anything in a resume at all ?
To attract the few people who might actually believe what you say ?
Or to pass the HR or recruiter filters who think that matching buzzwords on the resume is the surest way to weed out ditch diggers ( as if they can't google for likely words ) ?
I did a really short term contract a year ago , only a single week , in South Carolina trying to adapt a " free " tool for a use it was n't really supposed to be able to do .
I had never seen the technology before ( an XML publishing tool ) and it had to interact with a system I knew nothing about ( J.D. Edwards ) and a week was all the time I had to learn , master , hack and deliver .
I managed to succeed in 4 days ( the fifth was a half day of just documenting ) despite all the barriers and left on a real positive note from the customer and the agency .
How do you put this in a resume ?
An ability to do anything that 's needed by learning rapidly , applying a lifetime of skills and a creative mind .
Yeah , that 's a real good resume line :
Able to rapidly learn anything you need and deliver professional results
Talk about a useless resume .
Yet it 's true , but lost in a sea of lies on resumes the statement may as well read " 234234 dsfsjkhsdf = % 432 " .
Maybe resumes are still necessary , since the industry can't figure out how to match employees and employers with a better method .
Maybe people should write tests and challenge anyone to pass them ( I think some people have tried that ) instead of trolling for perjury .
Even that is n't foolproof since tests can be googled and passing tests does n't really prove you can actually deliver ( I once knew a guy who passed the Java Developer Certification but could n't write two lines of code together that worked ) .
Maybe people should read your blog and see if you know anything meaningful .
I do n't have an answer , I just wish there was one people could agree on .
Meanwhile maybe I will try with the one line resume " Will write good code for good money " .
I 'd like to do some short term PHP work in the DFW area , so a short resume would be a plus .
At least it 's not a lie .
Who knows , someone might believe it .

I ’m touring around China with bloggers .
I hope to give you as many updates as possible about this land of endless opportunities .
Thanks to Spil Games for sponsoring me .
Lunch with Andrew Lih Lunch with Andrew Lih
Blogging is fighting for its image in the US , where one web influential after the other declares the medium dead .
These statements by Calacanis and the likes seem rather odd , as blogging is the communication channel in thousands of niches .
In China however , blogging might be really dead .
In the west , blogs ousted bulletin boards and forums from the market .
This never happened in China , where the bulletin boards still flourish .
Better yet , the discussion platforms keep growing .
According to author Andrew Lih , there are two main reasons for this phenomenon .
BBS are anonymous .
Well , actually , semi- anonymous since people do have nicknames and build up reputations .
For reasons well known , anonymity comes in handy in China .
Users get more comments on their BBS writings , sometimes thousands .
As for blogging , it can be lonely out there .
Impressive numbers
When Web2Asia‘s George Godula gave a presentation about Chinese social networks , he mentioned the following numbers about BBS .
There are three billion registered BBS users ( users can be members of multiple BBS ) .
More than 60 percent of the users log on to at least three different BBS more than three times a week .
Every day , ten million posts are published which manage to attract a total of 1.6 billion page views .
Source for journalists
No wonder Chinese journalists use BBS to see what the public opinion is like .
Especially in the occurrence of breaking news .
When the disastrous earthquake rocked Sichuan in May this year , journalists scouted the BBS to see what the Chinese people were really thinking of the disaster and its implications .
“ Because , ’ said Lih , “ that ’s where the honest conversations take place ” .

US troops talk to Newsnight 's Andrew North about their feelings on the mission in Iraq and how the effort is hurting the US economy and reputation .
Guardian photographer and film - maker Sean Smith spent two months with the US 101st airborne division in the Shia strongholds of Sadr City and Shu'la .
On the other hand , the most Lieberman accomplished with months and months of nonstop campaigning was to push McCain support in his home state of Connecticut to 38 percent .
Treachery is bad , but inept treachery is easier to get over .
Since Harry Reid , the Senate majority leader , needs the vote , you could understand him telling Lieberman that he ’s still welcome .
Lieberman , however , apparently is demanding that he also be allowed to keep his chairmanship of the homeland security committee .
CNN reported that he turned down appointments to less prestigious posts and went home to mull his options .
I know what you ’re wondering , but Lieberman did not promise to drown himself if Connecticut failed to go for John McCain .
The Republicans are being way more nasty to Sarah Palin than the Democrats are to Lieberman .
They ’ve been portraying her as both a shopaholic and a woman who walks around in nothing but a bath towel , a hillbilly who ’s also a prima donna .
The leakathon climaxed this week when Fox News ’s Carl Cameron announced that Palin did not know that Africa was a continent .
Palin says this is untrue .
But the worst part is that if these people get any meaner , we ’re going to wind up feeling sorry for her .
This is not something we are looking forward to , Republicans , and we will resent you for it .
Another bad role model on the postelection manners front is the House minority leader , John Boehner , who called Rahm Emanuel , Obama ’s future White House chief of staff , “ an ironic choice for a president - elect who has promised to change Washington , make politics more civil and govern from the center . ”
The only possible argument for this kind of language was that it was actually not all that inaccurate .
Still , nobody should want to be first in line to trash an administration that does n’t even exist yet .
Would it have killed Boehner to say something conciliatory ?
Something like : “ It will be good to see a familiar face in the new White House , and I want Rahm to know that I am not mad anymore about the time he bit me on the ankle . ”
Setting a much better example , Senator Graham called Emanuel “ a wise choice ” who “ understands the need to work together . ”
Of course , Graham is undoubtedly hoping that if he ’s nice enough , the Democrats will forget about you - know - what .
The details of customers of three banks were involved An investigation is under way into how a computer containing bank customers ' personal data was sold on eBay .
The computer , bought by IT manager Andrew Chapman for £ 77 , had the sensitive details on its hard drive .
Mr Chapman , from Oxford , said the machine contained information on several million bank customers .
Details of customers of three companies , including the Royal Bank of Scotland ( RBS ) and its subsidiary , Natwest , were involved .
RBS said an archiving firm told it the computer had been " inappropriately sold on via a third party " .
It said historical information relating to credit card applications for its bank and others had been on the machine .
Basic knowledge
The information is said to include account details and in some cases customers ' signatures , mobile phone numbers and mothers ' maiden names .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
The problem came to light when Mr Chapman , 56 , bought the computer , noticed the data and raised the alarm .
He said : " I was appalled when I found the bank account information .
That sort of thing should n't have been listed on there . "
Mr Chapman said anyone with a basic knowledge of computer software would have been able to find the data fairly simply .
" The information was in back - up CDs and in ISO files so it would have been possibly quite easy to find if you know something about computers , " he said .
Extremely regrettable RBS and Natwest said they were taking the issue very seriously and were working to resolve it " as a matter of urgency " .
A spokeswoman for the third company reported to be involved , American Express , said it took the security of its card members ' data " extremely seriously " .
" We are currently working as a matter of priority to establish exactly what data is impacted and identify the card members who may be affected , " she said .
A spokeswoman for data processing company Mail Source , which is part of the archiving firm Graphic Data , said it was investigating how the computer equipment had been removed from a secure location .
" The IT equipment that appeared on eBay was neither planned nor instructed by the company to be disposed , " she said .
The incident was " extremely regrettable " and the firm was " taking every possible step " to retrieve the data and ensure it was an isolated incident , she added .
Clearly such details should never have been included in the hard drive of the computer offered for sale on eBay
e Bay spokesman
When financial data goes missing A spokesman for eBay said the firm was also looking into what had happened .
" Clearly such details should never have been included in the hard drive of the computer offered for sale on eBay , " said the spokesman .
" We fully expect Mr Chapman to hand it back to Graphic Data as soon as possible .
We will of course work with Graphic Data to establish how it came to be available for sale on our site . "
The Information Commissioner 's Office said an investigation would be launched as soon as Mr Chapman had handed the computer in to them .
A spokeswoman said : " We are now investigating this potential data breach and will be seeking an urgent explanation from Graphic Data to establish what has gone wrong and the steps that are being taken to prevent a similar incident occurring . "
Banks have an obligation under the Data Protection Act to keep all personal information secure .
Last year the Financial Services Authority fined the Nationwide Building Society £ 980,000 for a security breach , after a laptop containing customer data was stolen from an employee 's home .

Managing changes to APIs is hard .
That is no surprise to anyone who has ever maintained an API of any sort .
Web services , being a special case of API , are susceptible to many of the difficulties around versioning as other types of APIs .
For HTTP based REST style web services the combination of resources and content negotiation can be used to mitigate most of the issues surrounding API versioning .
Let ’s assume you have a REST / HTTP web service that has some account resources .
Say you can make a request like this :
=== > GET / accounts / 3 HTTP /1.1 Accept : application/vnd.mycompany.myapp+xml <=== HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content - Type : application/vnd.mycompany.myapp+xml < account > < name > Inigo Montoya</ name > </ account >
First , you probably noticed that my example uses a vendor MIME media type to describe the representation .
Using a more generic MIME media type like application / xml is much more common , at least in my experience .
Using generic media types is perfectly legal but a bit silly .
You are not really asking for any old XML document , but rather an XML document that has a quite specific schema .
Aside from my idealistic rantings , using a specific media type has some strong practical benefits which are at the core of this post .
Backwards compatible changes
Often changes will need to be made to expose new behavior of the system that do not negatively impact correctly implemented clients .
Say , for example , you want to start tracking email address for accounts .
If the application / vnd.mycompany .myapp+xml format documentation is clear that elements that are not recognized should be ignored you can simply add a email element to the account representation .
< account > < name > Inigo Montoya</ name > < email -address>mailto:prepare-to-die@youkilledmyfather.example </email-address > </ account >
Any client that was created before the addition of the email element will simply ignore it ’s presence .
Problem solved .
Incompatible changes
Unfortunately , not all changes can be implemented in a way that is backwards compatible .
For example , a couple of months after adding email to accounts the sales team sign a deal for 1 bazillion dollars .
But the new customer demands that each account be allowed to have more than one email address .
After thinking for a while , you decide that the best way to expose that is by changing the account representation as follows .
< account > < name > Inigo Montoya</ name > < email - addresses > < email - address priority='1'> mailto:prepare-to-die@youkilledmyfather.example </email-address > < email - address priority='2'> mailto:vengeance@youkilledmyfather.example </email-address > < email - address > </ account >
That , of course , will break any clients that are expecting the old format – so pretty much all of them .
This is a place where we can bring content negotiation to bear .
You can simply define a new media type – say application / vnd. mycompany .
myapp-v2+xml – and associate new multi-email format with it .
Clients can then request whichever format they want .
Older clients do n’t know the new media type so they get served the older single email format .
=== > GET / accounts / 3 HTTP /1.1 Accept : application/vnd.mycompany.myapp+xml <=== HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content - Type : application/vnd.mycompany.myapp+xml < account > < name > Inigo Montoya</ name > < email -address>mailto:prepare-to-die@youkilledmyfather.example </email-address > </ account >
Newer clients do know the new media type so they can have access to the new functionality .
=== > GET / accounts / 3 HTTP /1.1 Accept : application/vnd.mycompany.myapp-v2+xml <=== HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content - Type : application/vnd.mycompany.myapp-v2+xml < account > < name > Inigo Montoya</ name > < email - addresses > < email - address priority='1'> mailto:prepare-to-die@youkilledmyfather.example </email-address > < email - address priority='2'> mailto:vengeance@youkilledmyfather.example </email-address > < email - address > </ account >
Everyone gets what they need .
Easy as pie .
Alternate approaches
The most commonly proposed approach for versioning REST / HTTP web service interfaces today seems to be to mutilate the URIs by inserting a version .
For example ,
http://foo.example/api/v1/accounts/3
I really hate this approach as it implies that an account in one version of the API is really a different resource than the account in a different version of the API .
It also forces clients into a nasty choice , either support multiple versions of the API simultaneously or break one of the core constrains of REST .
For example , say a client exists for the v1 API that saves references ( URIs that include the version indicator ) to accounts .
Some time later the client is updated to support the new version of the API .
In this situation the The client can support both versions of the API simultaneously because all the previously stored URIs point at the old version of the API or it has to mung all the URIs it has stored to the point at the new API .
Munging all the URIS breaks the HATEOAS constraint of REST and supporting multiple versions of the API is a maintenance nightmare .
Conclusion
Changes to REST / HTTP web service interfaces come it three basic flavors , changes to the properties associated with a type of resource , additions of new types of resources and deprecation of obsolete types of resources .
If you are following the HATEOAS constraint of REST the approach described here can be used to safely handle all three scenarios .
This approach does lead to media types being created , but media types are cheap so we can – and should – have as many as we need .
Used properly , content negotiation can be used to solve the problems related to versioning a REST / HTTP web service interface .

IMF director Strauss - Kahn under investigation Agence France - Presse
Published : Saturday October 18 , 2008
Print This Email This WASHINGTON ( AFP ) 
The International Monetary Fund has launched an investigation of its director , Frenchman Dominique Strauss - Kahn , for abuse of power while involved in a relationship with a subordinate , an IMF official said Saturday .
The probe was set in motion at the intitiative of a long - serving member of the institution 's governing board , Shakour Shaalan of Egypt .
Shaalan " has asked external counsel to conduct an independent investigation and determine the validity of the allegations , " an IMF spokesman told AFP .
" All allegations -- particularly those involving senior management -- are taken extremely seriously , " he added .
The Wall Street Journal reported that the law firm of Morgan , Lewis & Bockius LLP had been retained by the IMF to conduct the investigation expected to be completed by the end of the month .
According to the report , the investigation focuses on the former French finance minister 's relationship with Hungarian - born Piroska Nagy , a married former senior official in the IMF 's Africa department .
The two are said to have exchanged emails about a possible intimate relationship , which apparently began early this year during a conference in Europe , according to The Journal .
The IMF and Strauss - Kahn have been in the spotlight in the past weeks as governments grapple with the extent of the worst global financial meltdown since the Great Depression of the 1930s .
In an interview published Friday , the IMF chief said the fund was ready to help developing economies stung by financial turmoil .
In a statement , Strauss - Kahn said : " The IMF is examining an incident which occured in my private life in January 2008 .
" I have cooperated and am continuing to cooperate with outside counsel to the Fund concerning this matter , " he said .
" At no time did I abuse my position as the Fund 's managing director . "
Police dash cam .
Virginia , Recently released after trial : TEXT FROM SOURCE : Ashley McIntosh was killed in a violent collision with a Fairfax County police officer who ran a red light at a high speed with no siren on February 12 , 2008 .
The officer was charged with reckless driving and went to trial .
The court found that the officer 's actions were not reckless and delivered a not guilty verdict .
How could this happen ?
Because Virginia law says an officer 's speed and use of lights and siren when driving through a red light are determined by what is " reasonably necessary . "
In otherwords , at the discretion of the officer .
. This is not enough and jeopardizes lives .
Suggested change to law : Change the law to : a ) mandate that emergency vehicle operators always use their lights and siren when driving through red lights , and b ) mandate emergency vehicle operators slow their vehicles so they are able to make a controlled stop when driving through any intersection .
One Virginia Senator is planning to introduce legislation with our change in December , 2008 .

Which one are you ?
There are two types of travellers characterised by TV's Homer Simpson and Mr Spock , a study suggests .
Professor Glenn Lyons , of the University of the West of England ( UWE ) , in Bristol , says we make our travelling decisions along two lines .
Mr Spock types will use every source of information available to make an informed and economical choice of how to get from A to B .
While the Homers have a much more laid back approach to journeys .
Those who approach travelling like the alien scientist Mr Spock , star of TV series Star Trek , will use websites , ticket hotlines and offers to decide how to strike the best balance between journey cost , time and hassle .
However , Homer Simpson , the boorish father in the cult TV show The Simpsons , accepts congestion as a fact of life and gets on with it , turning attention instead to making the trip as enjoyable as possible .
Archetypal characters
The research concluded the transport industry focused on these two different types of travellers .
Homer Simpson , on the other hand , thinks that making trips is no big deal
Prof Lyons
It found some areas of the industry tackled congestion by providing advice and information for the Mr Spocks , while other sectors exploited the congestion to invent increasingly sophisticated in - vehicle products and services to help the Homer Simpsons pass the time .
The research was commissioned by the Economic and Social Research Council and the Technology Strategy Board .
Professor Lyons , director of the transport research society at UWE , said the two characters illustrated the range of individual behaviour among the travelling public .
" Mr Spock is the archetype of logic - he wants to be in possession of all the facts so he can make the best possible decisions when taking a trip , " he said .
" Homer Simpson , on the other hand , thinks that making trips is no big deal .
As long as things work out he has many other things on his mind besides ' optimising ' his travel .
" Research shows that an individual 's travel choices are bound up with many factors including their personality , habits , family structure and social networks . "

With all the disagreement over the past few days , it might seem like Merb and Rails are worlds apart .
But David 's latest post demonstrates what I 've been saying all along : we 're more alike than different .
In the latest installment , he takes on the myth that " Rails is hard because of Ruby " .
Effectively , a bunch of people are comfortable in their language of choice ( PHP , Java , Perl ) and prefer to switch over to an MVC clone in their language of choice than learn the big bad scary Ruby .
As David succinctly argued , Ruby is just not that hard a language to learn .
It 's better organized than PHP ( with its absurdly large global namespace ) and less ceremonious than Java ( no IStrategyBuilderFactories here ) .
And what 's fantastic about Ruby is how quickly and simply new programmers are exposed to advanced concepts like lambdas .
Because iteration is accomplished in Ruby almost exclusively with blocks , it 's near impossible to spend even a day in Ruby without learning what blocks are .
Spend a little more time with Ruby , and the power of the closures that come along with lambdas becomes obvious .
All without the need for an extensive study of the CS benefits of the construct .
Ruby is so easy , in fact , that the slim Learn to Program tome is written using Ruby as a base .
It 's so straight forward that my wife , who 's hardly a programmer , was writing a program to count down " 99 bottles of beer on the wall " within a few hours of picking up the book ( and was even embellishing the program with a few interactive touches :- D )
Finally , implicit in the " I do n't want Rails because it 's Ruby " claim is the oft - heard myth that Ruby is slow .
As I explained in my keynote at MerbCamp , Ruby does very well even compared with raw PHP .
But when you compare Ruby frameworks ( even Rails ) against CakePHP , Rails destroys the competition .
And Merb does even better .
That 's because PHP 's fundamental architecture does not play very well with large frameworks , while Ruby deployment options can manage a fairly large framework with very small runtime impact .
What I showed at MerbCamp was that it was possible to squeeze up to 4,000 requests per second through the Merb stack , or around 1,500 requests per second when going through a controller and template , but that frameworks like CakePHP got only about 100 requests per second , even with a code accelerator .
Bottom line : do n't let anyone tell you that Ruby web applications need be slow .
The language itself is certainly slow , but I do n't see a ton of Fibonacci web applications being built , so the real question is about where the bottlenecks are , and Ruby acquits itself very well .
WASHINGTON ( AP ) 
The Environmental Protection Agency has decided there 's no need to rid drinking water of a toxic rocket fuel ingredient that has fouled public water supplies around the country .
EPA reached the conclusion in a draft regulatory document not yet made public but reviewed Monday by The Associated Press .
The ingredient , perchlorate , has been found in at least 395 sites in 35 states at levels high enough to interfere with thyroid function and pose developmental health risks , particularly for babies and fetuses , according to some scientists .
The EPA document says that mandating a clean - up level for perchlorate would not result in a " meaningful opportunity for health risk reduction for persons served by public - water systems . "
The conclusion , which caps years of dispute over the issue , was denounced by Democrats and environmentalists who accused EPA of caving to pressure from the Pentagon .
" This is a widespread contamination problem , and to see the Bush EPA just walk away is shocking , " said Sen. Barbara Boxer , D - Calif. , who chairs the Senate 's environment committee .
Lenny Siegel , director of the Center for Public Environmental Oversight in Mountain View , Calif. , added : " This is an unconscionable decision not based upon science or law but on concern that a more stringent standard could cost the government significantly . "
The Defense Department used perchlorate for decades in testing missiles and rockets , and most perchlorate contamination is the result of defense and aerospace activities , congressional investigators said last year .
The Pentagon could face liability if EPA set a national drinking water standard that forced water agencies around the country to undertake costly clean - up efforts .
Defense officials have spent years questioning EPA 's conclusions about the risks posed by perchlorate .
The Pentagon objected strongly Monday to the suggestion that it sought to influence EPA 's decision .
" We have not intervened in any way in EPA 's determination not to regulate perchlorate .
If you read their determination , that 's based on criteria in the Safe Drinking Water Act , " Paul Yaroschak , Pentagon deputy director for emerging contaminants , said in an interview .
Yaroschak said the Pentagon has been working for years to clean up perchlorate at its facilities .
He also contended that the Pentagon was n't the source of as much perchlorate contamination as once believed , noting that it also comes from fireworks , road flares and fertilizer .
Benjamin Grumbles , EPA 's assistant administrator for water , said in a statement that " science , not the politics of fear in an election year , will drive our final decision . "
" We know perchlorate in drinking water presents some degree of risk , and we 're committed to working with states and scientists to ensure public health is protected and meaningful opportunities for reducing risk are fully considered , " Grumbles said .
Grumbles said the EPA expected to seek comment and take final action before the end of the year .
The draft document was first reported Monday by the Washington Post .
Perchlorate is particularly widespread in California and the Southwest , where it's been found in groundwater and in the Colorado River , a drinking - water source for 20 million people .
It 's also been found in lettuce and other foods .
In absence of federal action , states have acted on their own .
In 2007 , California adopted a drinking water standard of 6 parts per billion .
Massachusetts has set a drinking water standard of 2 parts per billion .

Someone is reading Lew Rockwell 's mail .
In the internet era , government actors , big banks and most importantly , the market almost instantaneously respond to the truth that is now available to all through LewRockwell.com , Mises.org and other brave truth - telling websites .
This is particularly evident in the stock market 's rapid assimilation of the truth regarding the bailout .
The market has immediately recognized that the $ 850 billion " emergency " bailout was not necessary , essential or even helpful in " rescuing " the US financial system .
This comes as no surprise to those who knew that this was not its intent .
Like all Bush Administration boondoggles , the bailout was a patent attempt to use a crisis to consolidate power and line the pockets of Bush cronies .
Just two weeks ago , callow politicians promised that the bailout would somehow miraculously save the economy and the market .
Today , the stock market has exposed these empty promises .
The market is screaming to the social planners that their actions can have no effect other than to worsen what is clearly a bear market .
While the planners continue to plan , the market laughs .
The truth is that the US economy is in recession and has been for some time .
Non-market - based government interventions , in whatever form , are as ineffective as pushing on a string .
In just two weeks , the government has scuttled $ 850 billion Bailout Plan A for $ 850 billion Bailout Plan B. Plan B , however , is even more dangerous and systemically corrosive than Plan A because , as intended by its advocates , the inflationary dollars injected into the system under Plan B are not traceable to any particular transaction but generally injected as capital into the nations largest banks .
A SHORT HISTORY
On October 2 , the day before Congress passed the bailout , LewRockwell.com detailed the bailout for what it was : inflationary crony capitalism designed to consolidate banking power in JP Morgan and Citibank .
A week before the bailout , the Bush Administration used the regulatory power of the federal government 's FDIC to foreclose on Washington Mutual and threaten foreclosure on Wachovia and tender their respective assets to JP Morgan and Citibank at fire sale prices .
The practical effect of bailout bill was to place JP Morgan and Citi first in line to receive $ 850 billion in new dollars in exchange for the unmarketable securities they acquired in the Washington Mutual and Wachovia muggings .
On October 3 , Wells Fargo , perhaps cynically recognizing the Austrian economics principle that the first pigs in line at the fiat money trough get the fattest , stated that it wanted to be in on the Wachovia deal , which was not set to close until December 31 .
Over the next six days , Citi , Wells and Wachovia fought , with the FDIC clearly taking Citi 's side .
On October 9 , LewRockwell.com showed the piggish motivations behind the Citi-Wells - Wachovia dispute and warned the participants to be careful what they wished for .
Although the " first pig " rule is generally true , it has no application where the fiat currency retains no marketable value .
Moreover , the " right " to sell to the government could quickly become a messy , inefficient and unprofitable " obligation . "
Notwithstanding a prearranged infusion of $ 11.5 billion of capital on September 26 , the plummeting share price of JP Morgan ( down 21 percent from October 2 to October 15 ) perhaps signaled that the future right to receive $ 850 billion in newly printed dollars could be as worthless as the securities sold in exchange .
On October 10 , Citi bowed out of the Wachovia deal which the FDIC had orchestrated on Citi 's behalf .
On October 11 , LewRockwell.com sang Citi's praises for taking the moral high road , at the same time preserving its legal strong claims against Wells and Wachovia , and predicted that the Wisdom of Crowds that is the market would reward Citibank and further noted that Wells was in the unenviable position of selling unmarketable securities in exchange for potentially worthless dollars and at the same time was exposed to Citi 's lawsuit that would require Wells to disgorge any profits it made from the bailout .
From October 10 to October 14 , the market did look kindly on Citi , with its share price rising from 12.93 to 18.62 , a 43 percent increase .
On October 14 , however , the Treasury announced that it would not allow Citi to escape the bailout .
The Treasury would hide its inflationary infusion by purchasing stock in all the big banks , including Citi .
Citi apparently relented and its stock promptly dropped 12 percent on October 15 .
From the October 2 to October 15 , the stock prices of these three big banks are as follows : JPM ( - 10.44 ; down 21 percent ) ; Citi ( - 6.56 ; down 28 percent ) ; Wells ( - 2.98 ; down 8.12 percent ) .
Even though these entities are first in line to receive as much as $ 850 billion dollars in new dollars in capital in some form or another , the market does not appear to care .
Indeed , because the new plan does a better job of hiding the inflationary infusion of new dollars  there is no purchase price of subprime securities to evaluate or audit  the market appears to like the Plan B even less than Plan A .
Unfortunately , if Wells , Citi or JP Morgan are in fact reading LewRockwell.com , they are not reading closely enough .
If they were they would recognize that the market is telling them to reject government intervention in the market and imploring them to use reason , the free market and all available legal , tax and accounting tools to achieve an expeditious liquidation of the non-performing real estate loans on their books .
History will remember the heroes who have the courage to take such action .
The market will also reward them .
PLAN B MORE DANGEROUS AND CORROSIVE THAN PLAN A
The government 's first bailout strategy ( cast aside after only one week ) was to incorporate a new " government sponsored entity " ( GSE ) that would use newly printed US dollars to purchase $ 850 billion in non-performing loans from JP Morgan , Citi , Wells and other banks .
This was the patently unsound entity in which taxpayers were " investing . "
Now the government has changed course .
It now says that it intends to initially purchase $ 250 billion in equity in the nation 's largest banks .
The idea is that the government will infuse " capital " directly into these banks and receive some sort of non-voting , preferred stock in exchange .
How the bad loans will be liquidated has not yet been disclosed .
So why is Plan B worse than Plan A ?
First , the purchase of bank share still represents a vast , inflationary expansion of the money supply  the Treasury will fund the purchase by selling bonds which the Fed will dutifully purchase using newly printed dollars  only this inflation is nearly undetectable and untraceable .
Because Plan
A contemplated a sale between the bank and new GSE , the taxpayer at least had the opportunity to see how much he had been cheated .
He could evaluate the sales price of a non-performing $ 100,000 mortgage against the amount realized ( price received at foreclosure less transaction costs ) from a similar , actual , mortgage foreclosure .
The difference between the two numbers would represent the amount stolen from the taxpayer .
Cynics would claim that this is why the politicians have adopted Plan B. Plan B , coincidentally proposed by Swedish Central Bank Honoree Paul Krugman , purposefully hides the inflation by laundering the new dollars through the big banks ' capital accounts .
The purpose of this infusion is to compel these lenders to make more loans to a public that it just starting to realize to folly of excess leverage .
In short , it is doubling down on a bad bet .
Second , the new plan is unsound because the government is doing something that the free market is unwilling to do .
If the capital markets saw value in investing in these entities , capital would naturally flow to them .
Wise capitalists like Warren Buffet and Jim Rogers are participating in the capital markets , if at all , intelligently , as mezzanine financiers or by short - selling the stocks of troubled banks .
In his latest investments , Warren Buffet has demanded a 10 percent preferred return with a right to acquire a large controlling common - stock interest if there is a default .
If the best of our free market capitalists are not doing it , then neither should the taxpayer .
The banks are not " too big " for this .
If there is profit in the sale of non-performing mortgages , which there is , then capital will find a way to finance it .
Furthermore , with an apparently unlimited federal lifeline of capital , what incentive do the banks have to efficiently liquidate their non-performing loans ?
Answer : none .
The new plan is an unequivocal moral hazard .
Banks that participate in Plan B will be party to the making ghost towns out of vast areas of urban America as over - encumbered property sits vacant and underutilized for the next several years .
Third , the strategy will in the short term harm the non-troubled community banks , regional banks and credit unions that have benefited from the flight of deposits from insolvent banks .
Over the course of the last year , many depositors have quietly and electronically withdrawn their funds from troubled big banks and deposited them with these well - run banks .
This is the free market telling the failed big banks that they are not providing a valuable service  providing a secure repository for money .
The well - run banks are solvent and have made good lending decisions .
The natural infusion of deposits and capital is their market reward for a job well done .
With the increased deposits , they have the capacity to make more sound loans .
In contrast , the infusion of artificial , non-market based new money " capital " into JP Morgan , Wells et al. disrupts the natural operation of the market .
The newly created inflationary dollars infused into these banks gives them an artificial capacity to make additional loans .
In short , they did not earn the capital infusion .
Flush with an infusion of this irrational capital , feeling federal pressure to expand the credit - based economy and in bed with a government led by the former lawyer for ACORN , one can expect these big banks to continue along the same self - destructive road : making bad , inefficient and unprofitable loans .
As these banks inject irrational money into the economy and make loans that the non-troubled banks would not , this distorts the market by placing pressure on the non-troubled banks .
The loan officers of the non-troubled banks will compete with the big boys only if they are willing to make similar irrational loans .
Fourth and finally , for the banks that agree to get in bed with the federal gorilla , it very well could be their death knell .
While all banks are already quasi - government institutions ( all banks must be federally licensed , insured and therefore regulated ) , none have federal bureaucrats on their boards , on their payroll or overseeing or directly influencing lending decisions .
The banks that accept federal " investment " can expect all of these things .
While these bank may see short - term riches in government promises to be preferred lenders in federally guaranteed programs to , for example , make low - income housing loans , they will inevitably see a capital flight as the market recognizes that they are no longer rational , capitalist institutions .
Today 's Bailout Banks could very well be tomorrow 's Fannie Maes and Freddie Macs .
All Bailout Banks should note that the Plan B/ " Krugman " plan copies the Swedish government takeover in 1991 and 1992 .
It is no surprise that the banks that best survived the Swedish intervention , like the Wallenberg family - owned SEB , were the ones that most resisted government interference .
JP MORGAN AT CENTER OF FUTURE STORM
In a case of with - friends - like - you - who - needs - enemies , JP Morgan may be questioning its close relationship with the Bush Administration .
Bush has been so ham - handed in passing the nation 's economic problems on to JP Morgan , even JP Morgan 's CEO Jamie Dimon has intimated that in 2009 he would rather be President Obama 's Treasury Secretary than CEO of JP Morgan .
Although this would be a typical post-election Rockefeller - Morgan alliance , it may also signal the lack of a future in Bailout Banks .
Plan B ties the hands of the Bailout Banks , limits executive pay and places other , non-market restrictions like limiting the payment of dividends .
On September 15 the capital markets told the planners and the Bailout Banks loud and clear that Plan B was not a good way to attract real capital .
Mr. Dimon , like the market , perhaps recognizes that Plan B may be the beginning of the end of these banks and wants to be the first rat off of the sinking ship .
Rational capital will necessarily flow to smaller , nimble , well - managed banks that are not under political pressure to extend credit to particular ethnic groups , congressional districts or " purple " ( half blue / half red and therefore politically in play ) regions .
Because the Bush Administration loathes trial lawyers , it is also a bit ironic that the coercive and unjust means that the Bush Administration employed to orchestrate the JP - Morgan Washington Mutual takeover may give rise to the largest collectible judgment in history and may end up costing the taxpayers and / or JP Morgan another $ 10 billion .
In the week before the FDIC took over Washington Mutual and paid $ 1.9 billion for its assets , the Wall Street Journal deal journal indicates that JP Morgan had arranged $ 11.5 billion to finance the purchase of Washington Mutual .
This is pretty good evidence that JP Morgan saw at least $ 11.5 billion in value in Washington Mutual yet , with the help of the FDIC paid 1/5th of this and got the FDIC 's help in wiping out the WaMu shareholders , including an investment group that had invested $ 7 billion just six months earlier .
Press reports at the time indicate that W himself was involved in the transaction .
Bush 's impulsive actions therefore may give rise to the biggest government taking case of all time and may implicate W himself in an action under 42 U.S.C. 1983 , which obligates the defendant to pay the prevailing plaintiff 's attorneys fees .
CONCLUSION
Like other Bush Administration power grabs , the bailout , in whatever form it ultimately takes , will necessarily fail and will cause much needless pain and suffering .
The Bush Administration appears to believe that it can invent reality and repeal or suspend the laws of gravity .
It cannot .
In an age before the internet , concealing the truth and delaying the effect of government theft was perhaps possible for a time .
In an earlier age , the true motivations behind the bailout and the predictable consequences would not be known for months , years or perhaps even decades .
When Hoover and FDR were destroying the US economy with federal intervention following the 1929 stock market crash , only a few obscure academics knew the truth .
Today , however , the truth travels fast .
Today , websites like LewRockwell.com and Mises.org have brought the truth to the masses , so much so that principles of Austrian economics are regularly discussed on public blogs like Google Finance and Yahoo Finance pages .
While the Bush Administration has taken drastic and unprecedented steps to avoid or delay the impact of 8 years of irresponsible leadership , the omniscient , eminently moral " invisible hand " of the market will not listen and will not obey .
As fiat dollars flow into the Bailout Banks , real capital will flow out .
The market is powerfully informing the Bush Administration and its fellow travelers who in fact is the Decider .

The Best of Bill Butler
PRINCETON , NJ --
There have been only 2 instances in the past 14 elections , from 1952 to 2004 , when the presidential candidate ahead in Gallup polling a week or so before the election did not win the national popular vote : in 2000 ( George W. Bush ) and 1980 ( Jimmy Carter ) .
And in only one of these , in 1980 , did the candidate who was behind ( Ronald Reagan ) pull ahead in both the popular vote and the Electoral College and thus win the election .
The 1980 example is not necessarily one that John McCain can hope is duplicated this year .
Reagan 's late - breaking surge that year is generally attributed to the only presidential debate between Carter and Reagan -- held one week before the election , on Oct. 28 -- which seemed to move voter preferences in Reagan 's direction , as well as the ongoing Iran hostage crisis , which reached its one - year anniversary on Election Day .
After trailing Carter by 8 points among registered voters ( and by 3 points among likely voters ) right before their debate , Reagan moved into a 3 - point lead among likely voters immediately afterward , and he won the Nov. 4 election by 10 points .
The 2000 example may have greater similarities to the kind of upset McCain hopes to achieve .
Despite Bush 's generally leading position for much of the last month prior to the 2000 election , the race narrowed in the final few days , and Gore squeaked out a popular - vote victory , 48.4 % to 47.9 % .
Of course , Gore failed to win the Electoral College vote and , thus , the election .
Races have tightened toward the end of the campaign in other years , although not to the point where the second - place candidate was able to win either the popular or the Electoral College vote .
In 1968 , the race between Richard Nixon and Hubert Humphrey narrowed over the last month of the campaign , from double - digit leads for Nixon in late September to only an 8 - point lead for him among registered voters in polling conducted Oct. 17 - 22 .
By Gallup 's final pre-election survey , conducted Oct. 29 - Nov. 2 , Nixon held only a 1 - point edge among likely voters , and ultimately won the election on Nov. 5 by less than 1 percentage point , 43.4 % to 42.7 % .
The 1960 presidential election between John F. Kennedy and Nixon was extremely close , with the lead switching back and forth between the two candidates throughout the campaign .
And although Kennedy won , it was by the narrowest of margins , rather than the 4 - point lead he held in a Gallup Poll just days before the election .
The late campaign polling trends in every other election year since 1952 were fairly stable , and the candidate leading in the Gallup Poll in the week or so prior to the election ultimately won , either by a solid margin or very similar to what the pre-election polls suggested .
This was the case in 2004 , 1996 , 1992 , 1988 , 1984 , 1976 , 1972 , 1964 , 1956 , and 1952 ( all but two of which involved an incumbent president seeking re-election ) .
Bottom Line
With only one week left in Campaign 2008 , history is on the side of Barack Obama .
It would be unusual -- although not unprecedented -- to see his recent 7 - to 9 - point leads among registered voters and 4 - to 7 - point leads among traditional likely voters shrink enough between now and the election to put the presidency within McCain 's reach .
It seems we 've seen the last of Wes Welker 's snow angel - making exploits on NFL Sundays .
The kid in him got the best of Wes Welker , who was flagged on Sunday , then fined on Wednesday for making a touchdown - inspired snow angel .
Robert E. Klein / Icon SMI
The New England Patriots wide receiver has been fined $ 10,000 by the NFL for exactly that .
" It was a spur of the moment deal , and you can be sure that it wo n't happen again , " Welker was quoted as saying on The Boston Globe 's Web site .
Welker was penalized for unsportsmanlike conduct Sunday for making a snow angel just beyond the end line after his touchdown in the first half of New England 's 47 - 7 rout of the Arizona Cardinals .
According to The Globe , Welker said he was n't certain if he 'd file an appeal .
League spokesman Corry Rush said Welker was fined for unsportsmanlike conduct for participation in an illegal demonstration by going to the ground .
Following Sunday 's victory , Welker said , " I just got a little bit too excited there .
I really did n't think it would be a penalty .
I would n't have done it if I thought it was . "

EVER since it was first spotted amid the factory smoke of western Europe 's industrialising nations , the middle class has borne the hopes for progress of politicians , economists and shopkeepers alike .
It remains hard to define , and attempts to do so often seem arbitrary .
But in Brazil , the middle class describes those with a job in the formal economy , access to credit and ownership of a car or motorbike .
According to the Fundação Getulio Vargas ( FGV ) , a research institute , this means households with a monthly income ranging from 1,064 reais ( $ 600 ) to 4,561 reais .
Since 2002 , according to FGV , the proportion of the population that fits this description has increased from 44 % to 52 % .
Brazil , previously notorious for its extremes , is now a middle - class country .
This social climbing is a feature mainly of the country 's cities , reversing two decades of stagnation that began at the start of the 1980s .
Marcelo Neri of FGV suggests two factors behind the change .
The first is education .
The quality of teaching in Brazil 's schools may still be poor , but those aged 15 - 21 now spend on average just over three more years studying than their counterparts did in the early 1990s .
The second is a migration of jobs from the informal “ black ” economy to the formal economy .
The rate of formal job creation is accelerating , with 40 % more created in the year to this July than in the previous 12 months , which itself set a record .
Together with cash transfers to poor families , this helps to explain why — in contrast with economic and social development in India or China — as Brazil 's middle class has grown , so the country 's income inequality has lessened ( see chart ) .
Entering the middle class brings a predictable taste for yogurt and other luxuries .
But when shopping , middle - class Brazilians are more conscious of status than middle - class North Americans or Europeans .
“ These are people who may ordinarily serve others , ” says Nicola Calicchio from McKinsey , a consultancy , “ so being attended to by someone is very important to them . ”
Middle - class Brazilians may avoid the glitzy stores that cater to the rich , but they do not want their surroundings to look cut - price either .
That may be true elsewhere , too , but a sensitivity to surroundings — not wanting to be made to feel cheap — is particularly marked in Brazil .
Awareness of fashions and brands is still largely shaped by the nightly soap operas broadcast on terrestrial television and watched by an audience of tens of millions .
Since these are for the most part produced in Rio de Janeiro and feature characters drawn from the upper - middle class , they tend to reflect a world where good - looking white people in expensively casual clothes flit around in a perpetual summer , attended by maids .
This may go some way to explaining Brazil 's demand for gyms and beauty products .
Some 600,000 cosmetic operations are performed in Brazil annually , the highest total of any country apart from the United States .
The market for cosmetic surgery extends surprisingly far down the income scale , thanks to readily - available credit ( nips and tucks can often be paid for in ten instalments ) .
Rapid growth in credit , which was non-existent until fairly recently because of sky - high interest rates , has helped to boost the purchasing power of the middle class .
Some 65 % of car - purchases are paid for in instalments , over an average of 42 months .
However , borrowing by individuals remains relatively low as a share of GDP , mainly because so few people have mortgages .
It has also been underpinned by low unemployment and rising wages .
But the growth has been so fast — credit grew by 20 % in the year to July — that some are worried .
“ I think if you asked all the banks individually they might say that they wish to scale back lending , ” says Ilan Goldfajn of Ciano Investments , “ but none of them wants to lose market - share . ”
In the meantime , riskier kinds of credit , such as overdrafts and credit cards , are growing faster than overall borrowing .
Mr Goldfajn thinks it may already be too late for Brazilians to avoid a painful hangover from the current exuberance .
To the ballot box
What impact will a larger middle class have on politics ?
Past polling suggests people in this income bracket would tend to favour the centre - left Party of Brazilian Social Democracy ( PSDB ) of former president Fernando Henrique Cardoso over Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva 's Workers ' Party ( PT ) .
Yet according to Mauro Paulino of Datafolha , a pollster , Lula 's personal popularity and his government 's social programmes have disturbed this equation .
“ Those who have moved up from class D to C and experienced help from the government along the way , are likely to stick with the PT , ” he says .
David Fleischer of the University of Brasilia has calculated that PT candidates , or those allied with the party , are at present ahead in 20 out of 26 mayoral races for state capitals in next month 's municipal elections .
The middle class has meanwhile reshaped the PT in its own image : the party 's wilder economic rhetoric is now muted .
It also has to pay attention to a group of voters that has risen into the middle class and brought with it socially - conservative attitudes towards abortion and gay marriage .
But it remains ironic that this great social transformation , which has been brought about in part by greater openness to trade with the rest of the world , may end up bolstering a party that , until fairly recently , favoured autarky .
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - Democrat Barack Obama and Republican John McCain faced the verdict of U.S. voters on Tuesday after a long and bitter struggle for the White House , with Obama holding a decisive edge in national opinion polls .
At least 130 million Americans were expected to vote on a successor to unpopular Republican President George W. Bush and set the country ’s course for the next four years to tackle the economic crisis , wars in Iraq and Afghanistan , an overhaul of health care and other issues .
Long lines of people waited to vote at some polls in battleground states , including Pennsylvania , Ohio and Virginia .
Polls close in parts of Indiana and Kentucky at 6 p.m. EST and over the following six hours in the other 48 states and the District of Columbia .
Obama , 47 , a first - term senator from Illinois , would be the first black U.S. president .
Opinion polls indicate he is running ahead of McCain in enough states to give him more than the 270 electoral votes he needs to win .
A victory for McCain , 72 , would make him the oldest president to begin a first term in the White House and make his running mate Sarah Palin the first female U.S. vice president .
World stocks rose to a two - week high and U.S. stocks rose on Wall Street with major indices up more than 3 percent .
Analysts have said market prices probably already reflected expectations of an Obama victory .
But if Democrats tighten their control of Congress , it may be easier for the new administration to deal with the financial crisis .
Opinion polls showed Obama ahead or even with McCain in at least eight states won by Bush in 2004 , including the big prizes of Ohio and Florida .
Obama led comfortably in all of the states won by Democrat John Kerry in 2004 .
Ian Edwards , 60 , said he voted for Obama .
“ Very simple , ” the chief executive of a small technology company said .
“ Bad war .
Bad economy .
Bad reputation overseas . ”
Tyler White , in Scottsdale , Arizona , distrusted Obama on taxes .
“ My parents are in the upper tier of the tax bracket and feel that Barack Obama is not the right fit , ” he said .
DAUGHTERS WATCH OBAMA VOTE
Obama and his wife , Michelle , avoided the line at his Chicago polling station as they were let in a side entrance with their two daughters to vote .
Poll workers and voters snapped pictures and cheered .
Slideshow ( 36 images )
“ Voting with my daughters , that was a big deal , ” Obama said afterward , on his way to Indiana for one last campaign event .
McCain , an Arizona senator , voted near his Phoenix apartment before final stops in Colorado and New Mexico .
Seeking the biggest upset in modern politics , McCain said he was gaining .
“ We ’re going to work hard until the polls close , ” he declared .
Slideshow ( 36 images )
His running mate , Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin , kept her ballot secret .
“ I do n’t have to tell anybody who I voted for , ” she told reporters in her hometown of Wasilla , Alaska .
The race was closely watched in Kenya , where in Obama ’s late father ’s village of Kogelo , residents held prayers for his presidential bid and for his maternal grandmother , who died in Hawaii this week .
CAMPAIGN THEMES
Both candidates hammered their campaign themes in the race ’s final hours , with Obama accusing McCain of representing a third term for Bush ’s policies and being dangerously out of touch on the economy .
McCain , whose campaign has attacked Obama as a socialist and accused him of being a “ pal ” with terrorists , portrayed him as a liberal who would raise taxes .
But he has struggled to separate himself from Bush in a difficult political environment for Republicans , who are trying to hold on to the presidency for a third consecutive term .
Victories in any of the traditionally Republican states where polls show Obama is competitive , including Virginia , Colorado , Indiana and North Carolina , would likely propel him to the White House .
Obama took command of the race in the last month as a deepening financial crisis reinforced his perceived strengths on the economy , and in three debates .
Democrats are also expected to expand majorities in both chambers of Congress .
They need to gain nine Senate seats to reach a 60 - seat majority that would give them the muscle to defeat Republican procedural hurdles .
That would increase pressure on Democrats to deliver on campaign promises to end the war in Iraq , eliminate Bush ’s tax cuts for the wealthy and overhaul health care .
NEW YORK ( Fortune ) --
The latest round of government help for Citi buys the troubled bank some time .
But the financial sector will need much stronger medicine before a recovery can get under way .
The feds agreed Sunday night to guarantee $ 306 billion worth of troubled assets for the troubled New York bank .
The Treasury also poured $ 20 billion into Citi via a purchase of preferred stock , adding to the $ 25 billion stake the government took in October via the Troubled Asset Recovery Program .
The capital infusion and asset guarantees reduce the threat of a sudden collapse at Citi ( C , Fortune 500 ) , the biggest U.S. bank by assets with more than $ 2 trillion on its balance sheet .
The moves also help the rest of the banks by showing that the government wo n't permit another disorderly failure along the lines of September 's collapse of broker - dealer Lehman Brothers , which set off a flight from risky assets that continues to this day .
Still , the fact that Citi needed a new lifebuoy from the government less than a month after getting an infusion via the TARP capital purchase program shows how the entire financial system is laboring under an unmanageable debt load .
The problem , analysts say , calls out for much larger infusions of taxpayer funds , in the name of stabilizing the financial system - as well as restructurings that give officials time to completely fix problems at troubled institutions .
" ' Over - levered ' is the purest description of the U.S. financial system today , " Friedman Billings Ramsey analyst Paul Miller wrote in a report last week .
" At eight of the largest financial institutions , tangible equity equals 3.4 % of assets , which implies 29 x leverage .
If this was n't bad enough , we expect that current tangible common equity will be essentially wiped out by losses from existing loan and security books . "
Indeed , with house prices falling after a decade - long run-up and unemployment last month hitting a 14 - year high , U.S. banks face increasing loan losses on mortgages , commercial real estate and credit cards .
FBR 's Miller writes that the eight biggest U.S. firms - Citi , Bank of America ( BAC , Fortune 500 ) , JPMorgan Chase ( JPM , Fortune 500 ) , Goldman Sachs ( GS , Fortune 500 ) , Morgan Stanley ( MS , Fortune 500 ) , Wells Fargo ( WFC , Fortune 500 ) , AIG ( AIG , Fortune 500 ) and General Electric 's ( GE , Fortune 500 ) financial services arm - need at least $ 1 trillion in new capital to weather the coming recession without the prospect of an institutional failure .
He says the most likely scenario is that these eight giants will face losses of around $ 400 billion over the life of their existing loan portfolios - but cautions that those losses could reach almost $ 600 billion .
" If our models are too conservative with respect to losses , " he writes , " more capital will be needed going forward . "
Investors have become accustomed to banks ' voracious need for capital at a time of global deleveraging .
Firms around the globe have raised hundreds of billions of dollars in new capital over the past year .
But the deepening problems at one of the biggest capital - raisers - Citi , which has brought in $ 50 billion from private investors in addition to the funds it has gotten from the government - suggest that merely raising more money is n't going to be enough to see many firms through the worst of the downturn .
" We estimate C's risky assets to be roughly $ 120 billion , " Oppenheimer analyst Meredith Whitney writes Monday , " but the company has almost $ 600 billion in consumer and card loans .
We are unclear exactly which assets were targeted in the $ 306 billion . "
Even with more capital in hand , the banks ' problems are n't just going to go away .
Indeed , the KBW Bank stock index was down 37 % this month heading into Monday , in a vicious selloff that started after Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson distributed the first round of TARP checks to the biggest banking companies .
One reason is that the piecemeal approach to government support - $ 25 billion here , $ 20 billion there - is n't going to persuade investors to pour new money into an institution such as Citi with a balance sheet measuring in the trillions , says Mark Sunshine , president of middle market lender First Capital .
He says that for truly troubled institutions such as Citi , with risky assets running into the tens of billions of dollars in a souring economy , the only answer is full government nationalization .
Once the government takes a bank over and wipes out its shareholders , he says , officials can wrap bad assets into a so - called bad bank to be run off over a period of years , then repackage the good bank and sell it off to private investors .
He rejects halfway measures such as loan guarantee programs and partial nationalizations such as the feds tried with AIG , Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac .
Until there 's clarity as to which banks are truly solvent and which are subject to a government takeover , Sunshine says , Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson 's hope of attracting private capital back into the finance sector will remain a pipe dream .
" The fastest way to attract capital is to seize the troubled banks , " says Sunshine .
" You 've got to serially take over every one of them . "
That said , Sunshine does n't believe many of the biggest institutions would need to be nationalized .
He says big banks other than Citi appear to be much less apt to be overwhelmed by souring loans , and believes the cost of dealing with the troubled banks could run much lower than the $ 1 trillion price tag projected by FBR's Miller .
The problems in the banking sector are made that much more pressing , Sunshine adds , by the fear of deflation now looming over the market in the wake of last week 's rare decline in the consumer price index .
Sunshine says that unless the government stops the deflationary worries through aggressive monetary policy and heavy fiscal stimulus , the banking problems will only get worse .
Government officials fear deflation because it increases the value of cash , which encourages hoarding that reduces economic activity , increasing the debt burden felt by firms and individuals .
" Having deflation is like pouring hydrochloric acid over your loan portfolio , " he says .
McCain - Palin Put ' Country Last '
Once Barack Obama emerged as a viable candidate for President – given the nation 's grim history of violence toward African - American political figures – the worries began about Obama ’s safety , and they have not gone away .

Printer friendly Now , with the McCain - Palin campaign ’s recent decision to go intensely negative on Obama , those risks appear to be growing , putting added pressure on the Secret Service detail assigned to protect Obama .
In particular , Sarah Palin ’s reckless talk about Obama “ palling around with terrorists ” has helped validate the anti-Obama hate that has long obsessed the American Right .
She also accused Obama of insulting American troops in Afghanistan , a twisting of Obama ’s words that was then reprised in a McCain - Palin attack ad .
Though avoiding some of Palin ’s most incendiary rhetoric , John McCain has played this dangerous game , too , asking ominously “ who is the real Barack Obama ? ” – suggesting that there are dark secrets in Obama ’s past that would make him a threat to the nation .
Warm - up speakers at Republican rallies have insisted on emphasizing Obama ’s middle name “ Hussein ” as another epithet .
Not surprisingly , McCain - Palin supporters have responded to this “ red meat ” by shouting words like “ treason , ” “ communist , ” “ kill him . ”
At a Palin event in Florida , some excited backers yelled ugly taunts at journalists , including an African - American working in a TV crew .
For her part , Palin appears oblivious to the dangerous political storm that she is stirring up .
Caught up in her new celebrity – and lost in her own ambition – she acts as if there are no consequences for putting ugly words together and spewing them into the fervid world of the angry American Right .
Many observers are more surprised about McCain , who vowed at the end of the GOP convention to become a President who would end “ partisan rancor ” – although his convention was filled with partisan rancor targeting Obama .
Now , facing slumping poll numbers , McCain has jettisoned what ’s left of his promise to run a respectful campaign as well as his prized slogan “ Country First , ” in exchange for a new goal of winning at all costs .
Like Palin , McCain seems not to care that he is feeding the anger of white racists and the paranoia of xenophobes who have long recycled false allegations about Obama ’s religion and his loyalty to the United States .
The Real McCain ?
This “ new ” McCain has startled many of his old fans in the U.S. press corps who bought into his image as a bipartisan reformer who was victimized by George W. Bush ’s dirty tactics in 2000 .
Some now shake their heads about an aging politician letting his ambition – or fear of defeat – overwhelm his larger sense of decency .
But other assessments hold that McCain is simply reverting to the real McCain , the spoiled son of one four - star admiral and the grandson of another , the brat who earned the nickname “ McNasty ” and who exploited his family influence to rise in military rank despite a poor record as a student and a pilot .
A new account of McCain ’s life by Tim Dickinson published in Rolling Stone describes not only McCain ’s playboy youth – his gambling , womanizing and tendency to crash planes – but debunks a central element of his personal narrative , that his ordeal as a Vietnam War POW transformed him into a person who puts “ country first . ”
The article opens with an anecdote from 1974 when former POW McCain encounters another ex-POW , Air Force Lt. Col.
John Dramesi , at the prestigious National War College , where McCain had pulled strings to get in .
Dramesi , who unlike McCain had refused to make an anti-American “ confession ” for the North Vietnamese , describes his plans to seek an assignment in the Middle East because he fears it will become a future danger zone for U.S. interests .
McCain is dismissive of Dramesi ’s plans , saying he was off to Rio de Janeiro .
" What the hell are you going to Rio for ? " Dramesi asked .
McCain , who was then a married father of three , responded , " I got a better chance of getting laid . "
Indeed , if one looks at McCain ’s life through a single prism of self - interest , all the twists and turns of his career – including his ventures into reform , bipartisanship and even his coziness with the mainstream press – make sense .
As Dickinson observes in his biographical article , “ the real John McCain … has been hiding in plain sight .
It is the story of a man who has consistently put his own advancement above all else , a man willing to say and do anything to achieve his ultimate ambition : to become commander in chief , ascending to the one position that would finally enable him to outrank his four - star father and grandfather . ”
In this view , McCain is like his erstwhile Republican rival , George W. Bush , a screw - up scion of a dynastic family who learned how to come across as an “ everyman ” and who became adept at playing the political game .
McCain , like Bush , also wanted to outdo his more accomplished father .
Country Last
So , it should n’t be too surprising that McCain – finding himself in a political hole – would do whatever it takes to climb out , even if that means smearing an opponent , further polarizing the country and inciting some extremists with violent tendencies .
This evidence of the “ real McCain ” should have been long apparent , certainly since he recruited to run his campaign many of the Bush veterans who threw mud at Al Gore , John Kerry and McCain himself – the likes of Karl Rove protégés Steve Schmidt to the top job and Tucker Eskew , who smeared McCain in the 2000 South Carolina primary .
Then , when McCain needed to solidify his Republican base and inject some excitement into his campaign , the 72 - year - old cancer survivor selected Sarah Palin , a first - term governor of Alaska with virtually no foreign policy experience , as his running mate .
For a while , the Palin pick worked politically giving McCain a boost at his convention and in the polls .
However , increasingly , American voters look at Palin as eminently unqualified to be a heartbeat away from the presidency .
But McCain is undaunted .
Despite concerns among medical experts that his melanoma could recur , he continues to defend his vice - presidential choice , now unleashing her as the lead attack dog against Obama .
McCain ’s ambition , which burns as brightly as Palin ’s , seems to have few limits .
Nor does his disdain for his Democratic rival , Barack Obama , whom McCain sneeringly referred to in Tuesday ’s debate as “ that one . ”
But the most worrisome question in these last four weeks of the campaign is whether McCain and Palin will continue with dangerous rhetoric that might encourage some unstable character to take matters into his own hands .
If something like that does happen – or even if McCain - Palin somehow manage to turn their ugly messaging into a tainted victory – the ultimate loser will be the United States , which will be left even more deeply divided than it is today .
Instead of putting “ Country First , ” the ugly tactics of McCain and Palin are putting “ Country Last . ”

Plus , the Oscar - winning actress reveals that she was date raped " a couple of times "
Helen Mirren makes some startling revelations – she was date raped more than once and has tried several illegal drugs – in a revealing new interview with the British edition of GQ .
“ I was , yes .
A couple of times , ” the Oscar - winning Queen actress says in the October issue , recalling her experiences being raped as a youth in London .
“ Not with excessive violence , or being hit , but rather being locked in a room and made to have sex against my will . ”
Get push notifications with news , features and more .
And while Mirren defended a woman ’s right to say “ no ” at any point , she ’s not always in favor of reporting such attacks .
“ I do n’t think [ a woman ] can have that man into court under those circumstances , ” she continued , “ It ’s such a tricky area , is n’t it ?
Especially if there is no violence .
I mean , look at Mike Tyson .
I do n’t think he was a rapist . ”
Mirren , 63 , also admits she took illegal drugs – including marijuana and LSD – as a teen .
“ I loved coke , ” she continues .
“ I never did a lot , just a little bit at parties . ”
( She also says she has n’t touched the drug in more than 20 years . )
“ Dope always made me feel miserable and paranoid and unhappy , ” she adds .
“ And I woke up one day and thought , ‘ No more of that , thank you . ’ ”
Mirren also , according to the Associated Press , used to steal during her “ very poor ” youth .
“ I needed to shoplift for food , ” she says and , even now that she ’s wealthy , still has frugal instincts , including cutting her own hair and wearing dollar - store glasses .
In less scandalous news , the actress also opens up about finally meeting Queen Elizabeth II , whom she depicted in her Oscar - winning performance .
“ She said , ‘ Hello , it ’s lovely to meet you , ” Mirren said of their encounter at the Royal Ascot horseracing event earlier this year .
“ And that was about it , other than horsey chat . ”
Osama Bin Laden is probably in north - west Pakistan , the CIA says
The CIA says Osama Bin Laden is isolated from the day - to - day operations of al - Qaeda , but that the organisation is still the greatest threat to the US .
CIA director Michael Hayden said the Saudi militant was probably hiding in the tribal area of north - west Pakistan .
Gen Hayden said that Bin Laden was " putting a lot of energy into his own survival " and that his capture remained the US government 's top priority .
But he warned that al - Qaeda continued to grow in Africa and the Middle East .
In a speech to the Atlantic Council on Thursday , Gen Hayden said : " [ Bin Laden ] is putting a lot of energy into his own survival , a lot of energy into his own security . "
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
" In fact , he appears to be largely isolated from the day - to - day operations of the organisation he nominally heads . "
However , Gen Hayden added : " If there is a major strike on this country , it will bear the fingerprints of al - Qaeda . "
The CIA believes progress has been made in curbing al - Qaeda 's activities in the Philippines , Indonesia , Saudi Arabia and Iraq .
However , Gen Hayden said other areas were showing an increase in activity , including : • East Africa : " Al - Qaeda is engaging Somali extremists to revitalise operations ... al - Qaeda could claim to be re-establishing its operations base in East Africa " • The Maghreb : Attacks have worsened since the merger in 2006 of al - Qaeda and the Algerian militant group , the Salafist Group for Preaching and Combat ( GSPC ) .
The GSPC has renamed itself al - Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb • Yemen : Saw an " unprecedented number of attacks " in 2008 , and could become a launch - pad for attacks in Saudi Arabia • Pakistan :
Safe haven has allowed al - Qaeda to train a " bench of skilled operatives " Nevertheless , the CIA chief said the hunt for Bin Laden remained the top priority of the US security forces .
" His death or capture clearly would have a significant impact on the confidence of his followers - both core al - Qaeda and unaffiliated extremists throughout the world , " he said .
Gen Hayden was appointed in May 2006 by President George W Bush but it remains to be seen whether he will retain his job when President - elect Barack Obama takes office in January .

Previous entry : Building Open Source BioHacking
For some in the world of free software , libraries are things that you call , rather than visit .
But the places where books are stored – especially those that make them freely available to the public – are important repositories of the world 's knowledge , of relevance to all .
So coders too should care about them alongside the other kind , and should be concerned that there is a threat to their ability to provide ready access to knowledge they have created themselves .
The good news is that open source can save them .
The story begins even before RMS had his idea about the benefits of hackers sharing code , back in 1967 , when the Online Computer Library Center ( OCLC ) was created :
OCLC was founded in 1967 by Fred Kilgour , a pioneering Ohio librarian , with a simple idea : Instead of having every library in the country separately catalog a book -- laboriously entering its title , author , and subjects in just the right format -- why not have one person enter the cataloging information , upload it to a central computer , and then let everyone else download a copy from there ?
The kinship with free software and many collaborative content projects like Wikipedia is evident .
But the OCLC 's WorldCat has not followed the same development path as Stallman 's GNU project :
Today [ WorldCat ] has around 50 million book records .
But OCLC , the group that owns and operates it , has been a different story .
It started small -- a little office in Ohio , a set of membership dues to share the cost of running the servers .
But OCLC 's control passed from librarians and academics to business people ( its senior executive comes from consulting firm Deloitte & Touche ) .
They realized they had a monopoly on their hands and as costs for running servers have gone down , their prices have gone up .
They charge you once to get your records added to WorldCat and charge you again to get them back out and charge you a third time for a whole series of additional fees and services .
And these prices are high .
A friend who runs a small public library with around 5000 cardholders was asked to pay $ 5400 to contribute his records and $ 700 to get records out , plus a whole series of " User Support " and " New Member Implementation " fees -- all far more than he could afford .
Clearly , the original kinship with GNU has long gone : now , users are expected to cough up not just to use WorldCat 's records , but even to contribute .
In other words , WorldCat has moved to the Microsoft model , where you have to pay for the program , and also for support in order to file bug reports to improve the program .
As the rest of the post quoted above explains , the situation looks like it is going to get even worse .
In particular , it seems that it is going to get harder to export bibliographic data without constraints to other catalogues , including free alternatives such as Open Library .
The open source community has been here before , when the communally - created CDDB database was bought and the terms governing its use were modified , essentially making it hard to export data to other , free alternatives – just as is happening in the world of libraries today :
Things changed dramatically when the open CDDB.com server was bought by a company that wanted to make money from the contributions that users had made .
The index file created by the Internet community could no longer be copied .
Patents were obtained and granted .
A large public outcry resulted , and led to the start of several projects to create an Open Source competitor for the commercial CDDB.com ( now Gracenote ) .
In other words , the open source community simply routed around the damage by not submitting data to the closed CDDB , and by supporting instead free alternatives like Freedb and MusicBrainz , both of which are thriving .
Against this background , an obvious solution to the libraries ' dependence on OCLC 's central repository of bibliographic information is to start up an open equivalent along the lines of Freedb and MusicBrainz : basic hosting costs are now small , and altruists willing to run mirrors would doubtless start popping up given that the benefit to the community as a whole is so great .
Users will rapidly switch their contributions to a truly free database that all can access , and this will soon surpass any legacy system , which will , in any case , find itself cut off from the community it has hitherto depended on ( and taken for granted ) .
Unfettered access wo n't be the only way that users benefit .
As has become evident in recent years , releasing large quantities of primary data for free allows all kinds of innovative secondary uses to be developed , some of which can be exploited commercially – but without needing to close off the primary materials , or charge for them .
As a rich and diverse ecosystem arises , users will gain new tools and capabilities that simply were not possible with a locked - down database , and companies will gain a host of new business opportunities .
What 's striking about the current discussions swirling around the OCLC saga is that they are being conducted in something of a vacuum , despite the fact that open source has a rich store of relevant experience that librarians could usefully refer to .
The only problem is that little of it is to be found in books .

REMEMBER Japan 's zero interest rates ?
America is almost there too .
Since October 29th , the target for the federal funds rate has been at 1 % , but the rate at which funds actually change hands , known as the “ effective rate ” , has averaged around 0.25 % ( see chart ) .
The Federal Reserve does not always hit its target on the nose but the size of the gap is extraordinary .
If it persists , any decision to lower the target further would be meaningless since it would not affect the rate banks actually pay .
Normally , the Fed keeps the funds rate on target by draining from or adding to the reserves that the banks hold with it .
But the Fed has extended huge loans to banks and others to loosen up the credit markets , creating more reserves than it can drain .
So to keep the fed funds rate up , it has , since November 6th , been paying interest on excess reserves at the full target rate of 1 % .
Even so , the effective rate remains stubbornly low .
One explanation is that the quasi - governmental home - loan banks and mortgage agencies have been lending to banks at rock - bottom rates .
Another is that there are so few transactions that the effective rate has become an imprecise gauge .
The irony is that , were the gap to disappear , there would be a de facto tightening of monetary policy .
On the other hand , if the effective rate remains near zero , the Fed will have to turn to more unconventional means of stimulating growth .

Chase proposes outright purchases of mortgage - backed securities — another faint echo of Japan .
When Björk yelled " Tibet ! Tibet ! " at a concert in Shanghai earlier this year , she might as well have been shouting " O Chinese government - crack down on foreign artists ! "
Though the state 's initial response was just to rebuke the Icelandic singer , they have now implemented new policies to guard against musicians who " threaten natural unity " .
China will not just be screening artists ' work visas - they will even be screening setlists .
" Any artistic group or individual who has ever engaged in activities that threaten our national sovereignty will not be allowed in , " the Ministry of Culture announced in a statement .
Artists from Hong Kong , Taiwan and overseas will be under particular scrutiny .
China has already banned pop festivals and restricted outdoor events in the lead - up to this summer 's Olympics , fearing protests or simply unruly crowds .
Björk seemed to have protesting in mind when she performed her song Declare Independence in March , throwing Tibet 's name into the mix .
China has occupied Tibet since the 1950s , calling it their own rightful territory .
The Tibetan independence movement - long active on the world stage - has received renewed attention in advance of the 2008 Beijing Olympics .
China has now promised to ban any performer who " threatens national unity " , " whips up ethnic hatred " , " violates religious policy or cultural norms " or " advocates obscenity or feudalism and superstition " .
These conditions are sufficiently vague that we suspect Ringo Starr could be banned , say , just for singing of a superstitious Octopus 's Garden .
The Ministry of Culture will also be reviewing setlists for hints of trouble - for example , any songs called Declare Independence .
Even encores will be subject to government scrutiny .
" Nothing that has not been approved will be allowed to be performed , " they have stated .
Björk is not the only recent musician to face Chinese hostility - she was simply the only famous one .
Several Asian artists have been rebuked by the government , notably the Taiwanese pop star Chang Hui-mei .
Banned from China for her support of an independent Taiwan , Hui-mei was later re-admitted to the country - possibly when Chinese authorities remembered how head - over - heels gobsmackingly popular she is .
Barring Björk 's reinvention as a safe , sappy Chang Hui - mei - style singer , it seems unlikely that she will ever again come within snowball - throwing distance of the Forbidden City .
Maybe she can plan a trip to Chechnya instead .
While the top management of Wall Street banks are being pressured to forego bonuses in light of the companies ’ acceptance of billions of dollars in TARP money , traders are being told they will still be getting millions in bonuses – albeit less than they got last year .
“ At a partner meeting last Wednesday , I breathed a sigh of relief we were told we would be getting bonuses , ” said one Goldman Sachs partner , who has been a trader for the firm for more than 20 years and has helped the firm score record profits and recruit blue - chip pension fund clients , like Calpers .
Despite being in line for a bonus , the trader , like hundreds of others on Wall Street , will be getting a lot less because of the overall poor performance of the firm compared to previous years .
Plus , like most traders on the Street , the frustration over the smaller bonuses is compounded because the stock - heavy , mega - bonuses of 2006 and 2007 are now a fraction of what they were .
That ’s because the stock of every Wall Street bank have tanked this year – sending the size of the bonuses down with them .
For example , this Goldman partner , who spoke on the condition of anonymity , took home roughly $ 40 million in bonuses in over the past two years – because he brought in record profits to the firm and shareholders – but has seen that well - earned payday shrink to less than $ 10 million .
He said he regrets not retiring last year .
Like many Wall Street bulge bank executives , Goldman ’s stock - paid bonuses vest over three years – meaning last year ’s multi-million dollar bonuses cannot be collected until 2010 .
As an employee of the firm they ca n’t hedge the stock through buying options on it while they wait for it to arrive .
So if it takes a dive like it did this last year failing from $ 234 to $ 53.39 on Friday , they have no chance to sell it or protect it ’s value by buying puts .
This year , the trader had a chance to leave and head a large asset management firm – thus giving him the chance to hedge his Goldman stock and lock in his bonus value .
But now even asset management firms are having their own problems so it would have meant the same pay level with even more stress trying to turn their bad investments into good ones .
So he ’s staying .
Many top - notch traders up and down Wall Street are in the same boat – not happy about seeing the earning power fade but unable to do anything about it except send pleading letters to their congressmen explaining why bonuses are really a form of regular compensation – and that they drive performance .
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - U.S. environmental groups see Barack Obama ’s presidential victory as a chance to undo the Bush legacy on global warming , and one idea they are discussing is the possibility of a White House “ climate czar ” .
Members of the environmental community in and around Washington say such a post could oversee various government agencies , including the Environmental Protection Agency and the Interior Department , to focus on tackling global warming and fostering clean energy to jump - start the flagging economy .
“ For the first time , candidates and voters are really connecting the dots between energy , the environment and the economy , ” said Cathy Duvall , Sierra Club ’s political director .
She said at a news briefing that Obama had made it clear that investing in cleaner energy would be a top priority in his plan for economic recovery .
One way to coordinate these interrelated issues would be to have one person in charge , based at the White House , according to sources in the environmental community familiar with the idea .
They said this could be part of a White House special council on energy and environment , analogous to the National Security Council .
This kind of organization could be more effective than the Environmental Protection Agency has been under President George W. Bush , one source said .
Obama made clear in his acceptance speech on Tuesday that he sees climate change as a critical problem , along with the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and the wilting economy .
“ For even as we celebrate tonight , we know the challenges that tomorrow will bring are the greatest of our lifetime -- two wars , a planet in peril , the worst financial crisis in a century , ” the Illinois Democratic senator said in Chicago .
Obama also has articulated that the economy , energy and climate change are inter-related problems .
The Bush administration has been accused by environmental groups of politicizing decision - making and failing to act on U.S. government scientists ’ recommendations to curb greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide .
Bush accepts that human activities spur climate change , but has rejected mandatory across - the - board limits on global warming emissions , maintaining that this would hurt the U.S. economy .
The United States is alone among major industrialized nations in staying out of the carbon - curbing Kyoto Protocol .
SOMEONE WITH THE PRESIDENT’S TRUST
There is now a White House Council on Environmental Quality that is the Bush administration ’s policy voice on climate change , but its staff is small and it might not have the resources to do the wide - ranging job some environmental experts see as necessary .
“ What Obama understands is that dealing with the transition to a new energy economy is the centerpiece for getting the economy moving again , ” said Alden Meyer , director of strategy and policy at the Union of Concerned Scientists .
Sen . Barack Obama speaks at a campaign rally at Bicentennial Park in Miami , Florida , October 21 , 2008 .

Meyer said this needs to be approached in a strategic and integrated way .
“ I think they need to make clear who ’s running the show on these issues , ” Meyer said by telephone .
“ It ’s got to be someone who has the trust and ear of the president , someone who ’s positioned in the White House and someone who has the authority to get the agencies to cooperate on running the agenda .
That ’s a heavy lift . ”
With such a wide - ranging position still in the discussion stage , speculation has centered on likely candidates for Environmental Protection Agency administrator .
These include Democratic Governors Janet Napolitano of Arizona and Kathleen Sibelius of Kansas , both of whom have pushed to limit greenhouse emissions .
Carol Browner , who is part of the Obama transition team , is a former EPA chief and could conceivably be offered an environment post in the new administration .
Mary Nichols , now head of California ’s Air Resources Board , has been active in opposing a state ballot proposition that she maintains would increase greenhouse emissions .
As a member of Republican Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger ’s administration , she is seen as having the ability to work across party lines .
Kathleen McGinty , Pennsylvania ’s former Environment Secretary , has also been mentioned as a possible EPA chief .
Jonathan Lash , president of the World Resources Institute , which does policy research on environment and sustainability , is also considered a potential candidate .
GERMAINE
Greer 's attack on Michelle Obama 's clothes sense has been criticised by several Melbourne fashion experts , who say the expat academic 's status as a fashionista is doubtful given that she has all the finesse of a couch potato with her " comfortable " and " sloppy " look .
Writing in British paper
The Guardian yesterday , Greer attacked the dress Mrs Obama wore on the occasion of her husband 's victory speech at the US presidential elections .
Greer described the dress as a " butcher 's apron " and a " geometrical hemorrhage " .

But Greer 's own wardrobe has not escaped criticism .
Her shoes were dismissed as clunky and her jersey - knit outfits demonstrated a lack of thought and effort , Nevenka designer Rosemary Masic said .
The controversial author 's wardrobe is not entirely dysfunctional , though .
The brown and grey tones matched with pearl earrings suit her silver hair , according to fashion designer Jenny Bannister .
Bannister also gave the metallic quilted jacket the thumbs up .

The New American Century lasted a decade .
Financial crisis and defeated objectives in Iraq , Afghanistan , and Georgia brought the neoconservative project for American world hegemony crashing to a close in the autumn of 2008 .
The American neoconservatives are the heirs of Leon Trotsky .
Their dream of American " Full Spectrum Dominance " -- US military and economic superiority over any possible combination of states -- is matched in ambition only by the early 20th century Trotskyite dream of world Communist revolution .
The neocons used September 11 , 2001 , as a " new Pearl Harbor " to give power precedence over law domestically and internationally .
The executive branch no longer had to obey federal statutes , such as the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act or honor international treaties , such as the Geneva Conventions .
An asserted " terrorist threat " to national security became the cloak which hid US imperial interests as the Bush Regime set about dismantling US civil liberties and the existing order of international law constructed by previous governments during the post - war era .
Perhaps the neoconservative project for world hegemony would have lasted a bit longer had the neocons possessed intellectual competence .
On the war front , the incompetent neocons predicted that the Iraq war would be a six - week cakewalk , whose $ 70 billion cost would be paid out of Iraqi oil revenues .
President Bush fired White House economist Larry Lindsey for estimating that the war would cost $ 200 billion .
The current estimate by experts is that the Iraq war has cost American taxpayers between two and three trillion dollars .
And the six - week war is now the six - year war .
In Iraq the neocons gave up their hegemonic military pretensions when they put 80,000 Sunni insurgents on the US Army 's payroll in order to scale down the fighting and reduce US casualties .
In Afghanistan the neocons gave up more military pretensions when they had to rely on NATO troops to fight the Taliban .
US military pretensions came to an end in Georgia when the Bush Regime sent Georgian troops to ethnically cleanse South Ossetia of Russian residents in order to end the secessionist movement in the province , thereby clearing the path for Georgia 's NATO membership .
It took Russian soldiers only a few hours to destroy the US and Israeli trained and equipped Georgian Army .
The ongoing financial crisis has put an end to the pretensions of American financial hegemony and free - market illusions that deregulation and offshoring had brought prosperity to America .
In a long article , " The End of Arrogance , " on September 30 , the German news magazine Der Spiegel observed :
This is no longer the muscular and arrogant United States the world knows , the superpower that sets the rules for everyone else and that considers its way of thinking and doing business to be the only road to success .
Also on display is the end of arrogance .
The Americans are now paying the price for their pride .
Gone are the days when the US could go into debt with abandon , without considering who would end up footing the bill .
And gone are the days when it could impose its economic rules of engagement on the rest of the world , rules that emphasized profit above all else -- without ever considering that such returns cannot be achieved by doing business in a respectable way .

NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
Stocks surged Monday in a broad rally as Citigroup 's massive rescue package and President - elect Obama 's picks for his economic team pushed investors off the sidelines .
The Dow Jones industrial average ( INDU ) gained 397 points , or 4.9 % , after having been up 552 points earlier in the afternoon .
The Standard & Poor 's 500 ( SPX ) index rose 6.4 % and the Nasdaq composite ( COMP ) gained 6.3 % .
The market also rallied Friday .
The two - session gain of 891.10 points was the biggest two - session gain ever , according to Dow Jones .
The percentage gain of 11.8 % was the biggest two - session percentage gain since Oct. 1987 .
The S&P 500 also saw its biggest two - session percentage gain since Oct. 1987 , rising 13.2 % .
Its point gain was not significant statistically .
" There is a massive amount of liquidity on the sidelines but it 's sitting behind a dam of fear , " said Stephen Leeb , president at Leeb Capital Management .
He said that there needs to be a major catalyst to really start it flowing , but Monday 's news had certainly caused some cracks in the dam .
In particular , the nomination of Timothy Geithner for secretary of the Treasury was helping Wall Street .
Stocks managed a last - hour rally Friday after reports surfaced that the New York Fed Bank president was Obama 's pick .
Geithner is currently the No. 2 man at the Federal Reserve after Chairman Ben Bernanke and was the Fed 's point person on the Bear Stearns rescue - and Citigroup this weekend .
" Geithner assures a smooth transition between the Bush Administration and that of Obama , because he 's already co-managing what 's happening now , " Leeb said .
Additionally , the combination of Citigroup 's rescue and Obama 's news shows that both the current and incoming administrations are being active in dealing with the economy .
This was a relief after worries last week that there was a lack of leadership in general .
However , the two - day advance was also in part a bounce after a brutal October and two weeks of declines .
Even when accounting for Friday 's rally , last week was wretched , with the Dow off 5.3 % , the Nasdaq off 8.5 % and the S&P off 8 % .
And the nearly 400 - point rally Monday was n't out of place for a market that has been moving in triple - digits regularly over the last year .
" You have to wonder if this was just a massive short - covering rally , because the fundamentals have n't really changed , " said Kim Caughey , senior equity analyst at Fort Pitt Capital Group .
Short - covering is when investors who have sold stocks short to take advantage of a falling market need to buy the stocks back as they start to rise .
Caughey said she does n't think this is the start of a new , sustained rally just yet .
" I understand that the stock market is forward - looking , but I do n't see a catalyst out there yet to turn the economy around . "
Tuesday brings the release of the third - quarter GDP and the November Consumer Confidence report .
After the close Monday , Hewlett - Packard reported better - than - expected sales and revenue and forecast upbeat fiscal 2009 profit , matching the company 's pre-announcement from Nov. 18 .
Citigroup : The U.S. government announced a rescue package for the ailing bank on Sunday .
The plan includes the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ( FDIC ) guaranteeing losses on more than $ 300 billion in bad assets .
Additionally , the Treasury will inject another $ 20 billion on top of the $ 25 billion it has already made available .
The government will receive preferred shares in exchange .
The rescue followed a scary week for the venerable Wall Street firm , in which shares lost nearly two - thirds of their value during the week , while the stock fell below $ 4 a share , a multi - decade low .
Citi shares jumped almost 58 % Monday , firing up the broader bank sector .
Merrill Lynch ( MER , Fortune 500 ) gained 38 % , Morgan Stanley ( MS , Fortune 500 ) gained 33 % , Bank of America ( BAC , Fortune 500 ) rallied 27 % , JPMorgan Chase ( JPM , Fortune 500 ) added 21 % , Wells Fargo ( WFC , Fortune 500 ) added 20 % and American Express ( AXP , Fortune 500 ) gained 13 % .
The ProShares Ultra Financials ( UYG ) ETF rallied 27 % .
It was the biggest one - day advance in the S&P financial - service sector 's history , since S&P began tracking the group in this form in 1989 .
Other movers :
But gains covered a variety of stock sectors , with 29 of 30 Dow components rising .
The lone decliner was Wall - Mart Stores , which lost a scant 0.3 % .
Commodities stocks rose in tune with a rise in commodity prices .
Dow components Exxon Mobil ( XOM , Fortune 500 ) and Chevron ( CVX , Fortune 500 ) followed oil prices higher .
Component Alcoa ( AA , Fortune 500 ) was among the metals and mining stocks on the rise .
Apple ( AAPL , Fortune 500 ) , Dell ( DELL , Fortune 500 ) , Microsoft ( MSFT , Fortune 500 ) and Cisco Systems ( CSCO , Fortune 500 ) were among the big tech stocks rising .
Market breadth was positive .
On the New York Stock Exchange , winners beat losers by seven to one on volume of 2.04 billion shares .
On the Nasdaq , advancers topped decliners by three to one on volume of 2.64 billion shares .
Obama economic team :
The President - elect held a press conference in the afternoon in which he formally nominated his economic team .
Obama announced that Geithner is his pick for Secretary of the Treasury and that former Harvard President Lawrence Summers is his pick to run the National Economic Council .
Over the weekend , Obama provided an outline of his recovery plan , including the creation of 2.5 million jobs over the next two years .
At the press conference Monday , Obama said that there is a consensus across the spectrum that a stimulus plan is needed to " jolt this economy back into shape . "
He acknowledged that no matter what , the U.S. is going to see a big deficit next year because of all the government initiatives undertaken this year .
He also said that financial markets have reflected at times confusion about what the government 's plan is to provide stability and that in the future there needs to be more transparency .
Economic news :
The housing market continued to weaken , with sales of existing homes declining more than expected in October .
The National Association of Realtors said sales fell to a 4.98 million unit annual pace in the month from a revised 5.14 million unit pace in September .
Economists thought sales would decline to a 5.05 million unit rate .
Other markets : Global markets were mixed , with Asian stocks ending lower and European markets ending higher .
U.S. light crude oil for January delivery rose $ 4.57 to settle at $ 54.50 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange .
The dollar fell versus the euro and gained against the yen .
COMEX gold for January delivery rallied $ 27.80 to settle at $ 819.90 an ounce .
Gasoline prices continued to slump to 3 - 1/ 2 year lows , with gas down 2.1 cents to a national average of $ 1.908 a gallon , according to a survey of credit - card activity released Monday by AAA .
Prices have been dropping for over two months .
In that time , prices have lost $ 1.95 a gallon , or over 50 % .
Bonds : Treasury prices plunged , raising the yield on the benchmark 10 - year note to 3.34 % from 3.19 % Friday .
Last week , the 2 - year , 10 - year and 30 - year government bonds all hit the lowest levels since the Federal Reserve started keeping records in 1962 .
The yield on the 3 - month Treasury bill slipped to 0.01 % from 0.02 % on Friday , not far from 68 - year lows of zero .
The 3 - month - seen as the safest place to put money in the short term - last hit these levels in September as investor panic peaked .
The low yield means nervous investors would rather preserve their money despite no interest rather than risk the stock market .
Lending rates rose a bit .
The 3 - month Libor rate rose to 2.17 % from 2.16 % Friday , while overnight Libor rose to 0.8 % from 0.7 % Friday , according to Bloomberg.com .
Libor is a key bank lending rate .
Anything and everything goes in the off - season , especially when you get spoiled having the resources to burn and the time to burn them .
In the off - season of 2003 , my college mentor offered me a chance to teach a seminar on urban transportation with him  in South Africa .
I had about a day to decide , after having just lost Game 7 of the National League Championship Series .
But I agreed to go and was in Cape Town little more than a week later .
Why not ?
The best way to tell who had way too much time on their hands : they ’ve bought something that they realized was absurd  a timeshare in a war zone , or an alpaca farm  but instead of admitting that , say , alpacas would n’t fare well in downtown Philadelphia , they try to sell you one , too .
The off - season would not be complete without creating the ultimate drill to fix your broken swing .
Hit with one eye .
Hit blindfolded .
Hit with your back to the pitcher .
Or maybe kneel on this hand while biting a piece of tree bark , and then swing .
The best part about these homemade drills is the special bats or strange machines players usually invent so the drills can be executed correctly .
Landfills near major league cities are full of ballplayers ’ discarded off - season mock - science contraptions .
When I was in the minor leagues , I had the brilliant idea to work for some extra spending change over the holidays .
So I took a job at a Barnes and Noble in North Jersey .
( Although I was a first - round bonus baby , we only made $ 850 a month my first pro season , which was quite a shock . )
I had an engineering degree from the University of Pennsylvania , so in many respects I was considered overqualified for my job as a cashier .
Still , I figured I was a ballplayer who was keeping busy and making some Christmas money .
That was until a guy walked into the store wearing a Penn Engineering hat .
He was young , maybe a sophomore , and when I told him that I had graduated from the engineering school , his face fell .
Then I pieced it together : I had shaken his hope for getting a job commensurate to his Ivy - league degree .
But I was only doing what ballplayers do in the off - season : something that makes no sense whatsoever .
So I have heard of teammates falling out of tree blinds , getting lost on mountains , flying fighter jets , dating supermodels , gaining 100 pounds of muscle , going back to some motherland , getting married while already married , or working out with Arnold Schwarzenegger ’s butler ’s personal trainer .
After a while , no tales I might hear that first day of spring training could surprise me .
In the next few months , read your papers , surf your favorite sites .
If you come across some crazy story about an athlete , it ’s probably a baseball player with an inordinate amount of time on his hands .
But forgive him  it ’s just the off - season .

I got the idea for this as I was surfing the 2008 US Presidential candidates websites late Monday night , looking for ideas for online ADHD advocacy from my last post .
As an Adult ADHD coach who has ADHD , I wanted examples to help raise awareness of Adult ADHD .
I wondered how many pages Barack Obama ’s website had in Google ’s index vs John McCain’s .
So I did a site search site: www.barackobama.com etc. to find out .
Wow .
Nearly 6,000 % more pages on Barack Obama ’s website than John McCain’s .
So being the curious type ( a major ADHD strength ) , and a political junkie ( I had the same major as Barack Obama , Political Science , concentration in International Relations )
I examined the differences between the 2 candidates web presences via different categories of search engine results and checking out their presence and popularity on some of the many popular social media websites as of November 4 , 2008 .
The chart above quantifying Barack Obama ’s domination of John McCain in social media websites and search engines is the result .
Barack Obama vs. John McCain – Social Media Presence
Facebook
3,032 % more hits for Barack Obama than John McCain , Barack Obama ’s Facebook page had nearly 4 times more followers and posts than John McCain ’s page and had 1,335 % more notes up .
Tech President reported Barack Obama ‘s added 400,000 new friends on facebook in the last 2 weeks , a 20 % surge .
MySpace
Both Candidates pages were fairly well designed compared to the usual chaotic look some favour .
Barack Obama had nearly 4 times the number of friends on MySpace as John McCain , and 269 % more search results for his name .
Strangely enough , I found 147K comments on Barack Obama ’s MySpace page but none at all on John McCain’s .
Not sure why he did n’t display any , which seems one of the main points of MySpace .
Possibly the fear of too many negative ones ?
Twitter
Here we have a case of severe internet cluelessness on the part of the John McCain Campaign .
Barack Obama cranked out 10 times more tweets than John McCain , had 2254 % more followers , and 1,029 % more search results .
John McCain ’s last tweet was October 24th !
So clueless that he did n’t send a vote today tweet on election day !.
Some power twitter users like Alltop Media mogul Guy Kawasaki have large numbers of followers , in Guy ’s case 24,726 followers .
Imagine having a few of those people on your list AND the fact that some of their followers will retweet and / or blog the message if they like it , and they have followers , etc , etc .
UPDATE : Thanks to Oliver and Faruk for pointing out I listed the wrong John McCain Twitter page , just corrected it .
I mistakenly linked to a McCain fan page , who had nearly half the followers as the official one but massively more tweets .
Maybe John McCain should have outsourced his twittering to him : )
Also updated , he has 29,202 YouTube subscribers .
Friend Feed
Barack Obama had 25 % more mentions than John McCain .
Youtube
Barack Obama had nearly twice as many search results for his name as John McCain , and more than 5 times as many videos posted .
Barack Obama had 117k subscribers and 25 k friends and strangely enough John McCain had no friends or subscribers .
Sorry , still has no friends but 29,202 subscribers .
Obama beat him by 300 % on this .
Obama beat him by 300 % on this .
Or at least none displayed .
Wonder why ?
Maybe ’s his campaign does n’t know how to use Youtube or maybe they ’re semi antisocial about social networking ?
Or there might be too many people posting negative videos and comments ?
Not sure .
Flickr
The photo sharing site that was created here in Vancouver BC Canada , had nearly 5 times more search results for Barack Obama than John McCain .
I found 50,000 photos on Barack Obama ’s flickr page and 7,000 contacts , I could not find a profile of John McCain on Flickr .

Search Engine Results for “ Barack Obama ” and “ John McCain ”
Google News , Google Images and Video
John McCain beats Barack Obama significantly in Google News though by 173 % .
There ’s almost 3 times as many results for Barack Obama in Google images and 51 % more hits in Google Video as there is for John McCain .
Blog Search Engines
Barack Obama has more search engine results than John McCain in both blog search engines , google , technorati and in WordPress.com a site with 4,592,973 blogs where users create blogs for free and host them there .
This blog uses WordPress , the free standalone version .
Keep in mind that more search engine results or user generated social media does not always mean that the results are positive of the candidate , many are negative of both .
The political blogosphere can be a brutal place .
But as a politician , being ignored is the worst thing .
Getting no attention wo n’t get you elected .
Plus bloggers are often creating content and commenting in other social media sites beyond their individual blog .
Bloggers will become even more important and courted in the future by political campaigns .
Internet Presence for Barack Obama ’s and John McCains Official Websites
As previously mentioned , Barack Obama had nearly 6,000 percent more pages on his main website than John McCain did on his , 1,820,000 vs 30,700 .
Barack Obama has more and deeper links , more hits for his name in Google .
Overall Metrics
Of the 27 29 metrics I chose , Barack Obama absolutely crushed John McCain .
Barack Obama led on 25 27 out of 27 29 , John McCain led on only 1 ( Google Blog Search ) and the Candidates were tied on one ( Google page rank ) .
In some cases the John McCain campaign did n’t even bother to show up .
The McCain campaign had no Youtube subscribers , Youtube friends , and Myspace comments , or at least none posted .
Was that a result of campaign malpractice ?
Or not wanting to show the hostile reactions of users to his messages ?
Or something else ?
Republican minds should start asking some pointed questions , Democrats should be thankful .
Maybe they need to find a republican version of James Carville , head strategist for Bill Clinton ’s winning presidential election who has ADHD .
I remember reading somewhere that the # 1 career for adults with ADHD was politics and # 2 was sports ( 27 % and 23 % I think ) .
We have understimulated brains ( or are brains are processing so fast we burn up dopamine ) so we do best in high stimulation , creative , challenging jobs .
Many ADDers in high tech , marketing , advertising , entrepreneurs etc .
In those areas , having ADHD can be a competitive edge .
Factory floors are death for us .
Boring repetitive paperwork is our kryptonite .
Choose Your Bias
Waxy ‘s Andy Biao created an excellent Greasemonkey script that I use called Memeorandum Colors for the US political aggregator site that ’s almost been my home page for the last few months , Memeorandum , the Techmeme of politics
Left - leaning blogs are blue and right - leaning blogs are red , with darker colors representing strong biases .
Check it out , it ’s based on who the blogs link to , and do n’t just view the blogs on your side of the political spectrum , view the rogue ones too : )
Conclusions
Overall Barack Obama ’s campaign has
a larger , more comprehensive presence
more followers or subscribers on the social media websites
more interaction with those followers
much greater results in search engines
This is in spite of John McCain being a big political celebrity FAR longer than Barack Obama was .
John McCain was first elected to congress in 1982 , and even before McCain ran in 2008 , other than George Bush , McCain was probably the best known , most interviewed , and most written about Republican politician .
That ’s why I laughed when I saw McCain ’s celebrity ad about Obama , look at how many mention ’s John McCain has in the Internet Movie Database , like Bill Clinton , he was jealous because he was no longer the biggest political celebrity in Washington .
Outside of Illinois , Barack Obama was largely unknown until he gave his famous keynote speech at the democratic convention in 2004 .
So 26 years of exposure vs 4 years and yet Obama still massively dominated the online landscape .
Candidates Websites
Obama ’s website one of the best designed websites I ’ve seen in 15 years online , far better designed then John McCain ’s , plus Obama ’s has more features , more option and more content and is far more sophisticated than John McCain’s .
Senator Obama hired Blue State Digital to run his online campaign , here ’s their case study on it .
Barack Obama ’s Website simply crushes McCains in :
quantity
design
features
sophistication
participation
usability
Social media features
Take a few moments and look at both sites and you ’ll see the huge gap .
Obama even created an online rapid response team to counter the lies thrown at him , called fight the smears .
Brilliant move , cheaper than responding with TV ads .
McCain ’s social network page has only 3 suggested sites , Obama ’s suggests 16 .
John McCain ’s Knowledge of the Internet
John McCain ’s unfamiliarity with the internet is well known ,
I am learning to get online myself , and I will have that down fairly soon , getting on myself
in fact the Obama campaign created an ad based on it .
Knowing the tubes does matter .
Check out the Design for Obama website , no similar site for the McCain campaign .
Barack Obama ’s Knowledge of the Internet
Barack Obama is younger and more computer and web savy .
Here ’s one quote from Marc Andreessen , coauthor of Mosaic , founder of netscape , and co founder of roll your own social network Ning who had a 90 minute one on one with Obama , early in 2007 .
In particular , the Senator was personally interested in the rise of social networking , Facebook , Youtube , and user - generated content , and casually but persistently grilled us on what we thought the next generation of social media would be and how social networking might affect politics — with no staff present , no prepared materials , no notes .
He already knew a fair amount about the topic but was very curious to actually learn more .
We also talked about a pretty wide range of other issues , including Silicon Valley and various political topics .
Politicans can always hire people to create their websites and do their online marketing , fundraising , organizing and voter outreach programs .
But if they do n’t “ get the net ” or do n’t know what questions to ask , they ’re at a severe disadvantage to those that do get it and do spend time on it .
Barack Obama won the presidency for many reasons , but one is that he really understood the force multiplier called the internet .
He knew who the internet users are , understood their needs and wants , how and why they use it , and how to connect with those people , and get them involved so they do most of the building and content creation themselves .
Fear can be effective in politics , but it does n’t create as much content as hope .
Republicans like Sarah Palin and Rudy Guiliani mocked Barack Obama for being a community organizer .
Barack Obama community organized on the net with devastating effects to the Republican campaign .
One reason Barack Obama won was because he open sourced his campaign especially the online aspect .
McCain ’s was command and control by multiple competing lobbyists .
Other politicians in the US , Canada , and other countries will either start learning more about the internet culture , blogging , other social media and getting involved the right ways ( the wrong ways will cause a massive backlash ) or risk getting their asses kicked in online fundraising , raising awareness , finding and engaging new volunteers , online and offline organization , and voter outreach by those who do understand and use the internet and social media .
Plus they have to change their beliefs , attitudes , policies and operating procedures to appeal too younger , digitally connected people , technology by itself ai n’t enough .
Social media consultants will be getting much busier .

GLib ensures that the all the functionality exposed by it remains consistent across platforms , so that you can rest assured that your code will work the way its supposed to work irrespective of the Operating System it ’s being used for ( Of course , this assumes that you have ensured about portability aspects of your non-GLib related source code ) .
Moreover , GLib is available for a vast array of contemporary Operating Systems including GNU / Linux , Microsoft Windows and Mac OS X .
** 2 . Security : ** Though you still need to be careful about things like freeing allocated memories properly , etc but GLib does ensure that all its functionality is secure .
Moreover , GLib has a policy of ensuring that all its functions are threadsafe .
This saves you from a lot of checks and balances and locks and scheduling considerations if you had written all this yourself .
3. Useful Data Types : GLib exposes a lot of data types .
Some are very basic that maintain portability across OS ’s and 32 - bit and 64 - bit systems .
e.g. you can rest assured that gint32 will always be 32 bit and gint64 will always be 64 bit data types .
Apart from this , it also provides a lot of derived data types e.g. singly linked lists , doubly linked lists , hash tables , stacks , queues , trees , and much more .
It ’d basically cover most of you data structure needs that you ’d have otherwise had to implement yourselves .
And it also provides helper functions that makes working with them so much more easier .
If you have ever used Perl , and have wished that C programming could be a bit faster like it , you will be pleasantly surprised .
** 4 . Utility Functions : ** GLib also provides various utility functions to ease out your manipulation of data .
Some of the functions are meant as more secure and portable replacements for those provided with standard C library , while rest are meant to provide other useful functionality which you earlier had to implement in your code .
Some of the major areas covered by GLib ’s utility functions are String manipulation , character set manipulation and conversion ( including unicode and base64 ) , using regular expressions , file manipulation , shell functions , config file parsing ( my favourite ) , etc .
End Note : I can understand that there would be a lot of people who believe that use of GLib is dumbing down programming in C .
After all , we take pride being in control of our code and this is why we love progrmming in C because we have options to do things in our own way .
Yes , that is all true but there comes a time where you ’d like to spend more time in developing the core functionality of your app , or focus more on giving a rapid shape to your new idea , rather than reinventing the wheel and fumbling around with writing the helper functions .
So , keeping that in mind I believe GLib is wonderful piece of code that has enabled me to churn out new apps that much faster .

Heroic Climate Scientist Saves Ice - Trapped Whales With Statistics - [ Cuffy Meigs ]
The sea was angry that day .
Lulled into a false sense of safety by global warming alarmists , over 200 narwhal whales were smugly lounging in the Jacuzzi - like waters of the remote Canadian Arctic .
Vanquished by the carbon habits of man , the Arctic ice made an unfortunately ill - timed return :
" A couple of weeks ago , when the ice was still moving , there were quite a few narwhal seen out there in the open water , " Jayko Allooloo , chairman of the Pond Inlet hunters and trappers organisation , told public broadcaster CBC .
" About a week later , they 're stuck . "
Community elders and officials feared the whales would die from a lack of oxygen as the ice grew thicker around them , Pelley explained .
As the narwhals gasped for oxygen like Vilos Cohaagen 's goldfish , NASA 's Dr. James E. Hansen swooped in with a new spreadsheet on Arctic ice thickness .
Copy - pasting cell E13 to E12 , Hansen replaced the current month 's ice thickness with last month 's --- and the narwhals swam to safety !
Or not :
But department spokesman Keith Pelley said : " It 's unlikely the animals are going to survive the winter , so the hunters have been given authorisation to cull them . "
The hunters have been on the ice slaughtering the whales since Thursday and are likely to accomplish their task over the coming days , he said .
Hansen was last seen frantically editing a zooligical classification spreadsheet , changing the narwhals ' genus and species from " Monodon monoceros " to " Yersinia pestis infected Rattus norvegicus " ...
Louisiana Catahoula Leopard
Dog once known as The Catahoula Cur is a medium to medium - large versatile , top rated
Theonce known as Theis a medium to medium - large versatile , top rated working dog breed .
It originated in a region of the Catahoula Lake in central Louisiana and is the official dog of Louisiana .
Catahoula Leopards are extremely agile and athletic , territorial , naturally protective of " their property " .
They are more primitive psychologically than most breeds and need consistent obedience reinforcement .
They are enthousiastic working dogs with a high energy level .
Louisiana Catahoula
Leopard Dog
( Catahoula Leopard Dog , Catahoula Cur )
Catahoula owners say it is nearly impossible to describe this dog , unless you own one yourself .
Some call them " Catdogs " because of their intuitive behavior and sixth sense , and ... their ability to climb trees .
The Catahoula Leopard dog's history begins in the year 1539 when a Spanish explorer named Hernando De Soto began his exploration for gold and treasure in what is now the southern United States .
The Catahoula Leopard dog is highly intelligent and very energetic .
They need a lot of mental and physical stimulation in order to be happy .
They are very enthusiastic about doing their job .
They make excellent working dogs , excelling in herding , hunting , and guarding , but are also used for police work , protection , search and rescue , agility , or as companions and family pets .
As a general rule , Catahoulas are not well - suited to novice owners .
Experience with Catahoulas or other large and / or assertive breeds is a plus for prospective Catahoula owners .
If the dog is kept outdoors , this is not a problem , but , if he is an indoor dog , he must get this exercise .
" The Catahoula will not let you forget that you own a dog .
If you do not have the time and energy it takes to train and exercise an active dog , then the Catahoula is not the dog for you . "
There are a lot of speculations among fanciers of this breed as to the origin of the word " Catahoula " .
Some say " Catahoula " is an indian word meaning " clear eyes " , because some dogs have blue eyes .
Also , there have been references to Catahoula Indians by many people , but the truth is no tribe of Catahoula Indians ever existed .
True is that after the onslaught of the Indians by the white man , four tribes of Indians settled together in an area know as the Catahoula Parish ( county ) .
These four tribes were the Avoyelle , Tunica , Ofo , and Choctaw .
Because these four tribes remained in close proximity of each other , they were dubbed as the Catahoula Indians .
The word " Catahoula " is actually a French misprounounciation of the
De Soto and his men were accompanied by " war dogs " believed to be Mastiffs and Greyhounds .
The Mastiffs were used during battles with the Indian tribes and dogs would be let loose to attack any Indian that resisted .
These Mastiffs had a reputation of being able to pull down very large game with ease .
DeSoto utilized their abilities to persuade the Indians to provide information on the whereabouts of Gold and Treasure .
GrShCh Crane 's Strike Two
Double Ott Catahoulas
Choctaw Indian word for their own tribe , " Couthaougoula " pronounced " Coot - ha - oo - goo - la " , meaning " Big , clear lake " ( Catahoula Lake , now located in La Salle Parish ) .
In 1700 , with almost 150 years of breeding , this odd looking dog with a mottled coat and mysterious glass eyes was discovered by French settlers .
Hearing the stories of Tonti of the abundance of game in Louisiana the French brought with them their Beauceron dog , a ferocious dog used for hunting wild boar and , it is the belief of some , that the Beauceron was bred to the " Indian wolf - dog "
The Catahoula is not an aggressive dog , but it is assertive .
If mistreated or attacked , it will defend itself to whatever means necessary .
The same goes for what it considers its territory and its family .
They are naturally protective and territorial , fiercely guarding their home and family .
For this reason , Catahoulas make excellent watch dogs .
and would explain why the Catahoula has a hound like appearance .
The Greyhound was used for the hunting of game which fed De Soto 's army .
Right up until 1542 when De Soto died and his men retreated after losing many battles , the Indian tribes took in and cared for the sick and wounded dogs .
At that time , the Red Wolf , which then roamed Louisiana , was used by the Indians to locate game , much in the same manner as hunters use their dogs today .
All these dogs bred and interbreed with each other along with the Red Wolf .
The offspring of the subsequent crosses between the Red Wolf and these " war dogs " became known as the " wolf - dog " .
The Wolf Dog , which is mentioned in Louisiana History , as well as most history books covering this era , was the name given to them by Henri Tonti during one of his visits to Louisiana .
They generally do not fare well in an urban setting , though .
As a new owner you must be ready to train and exercise a Catahoula .
If not , as one breeder states , " he will eat your house " .
Since this dog has the inherent nature to herd and track game , he needs sufficient exercise to release some of that built up energy .
A minimum of one hour of running exercise each day is necessary .

The Bible 's Buried Secrets
PBS Airdate : November 18 , 2008
NARRATOR : God is dead , or so it must have seemed to the ancestors of the Jews in 586 B.C. Jerusalem and the temple to their god are in flames ; the nation of Israel , founded by King David , is wiped out .
WILLIAM G. DEVER ( University of Arizona ) :
It would have seemed to have been the end , but it was , rather , the beginning .
NARRATOR : For out of the crucible of destruction emerges a sacred book , the Bible , and an idea that will change the world , the belief in one God .
THOMAS CAHILL ( Author , The Gifts of the Jews ) :
This is a new idea .
It was an idea that no one had ever had before .
LEE I. LEVINE ( The Hebrew University of Jerusalem ) : Monotheism is well - ensconced , so something major happened which is very hard to trace .
NARRATOR : Now , a provocative new story from discoveries deep within the Earth and the Bible .
EILAT MAZAR ( Shalem Center ) :
We wanted to examine the possibility that the remains of King David 's palace are here .
WILLIAM DEVER :
We can actually see vivid evidence here of a destruction .
AMNON BEN - TOR ( The Hebrew University of Jerusalem ) : Question number one : " Who did it ? "
NARRATOR : An archaeological detective story puzzles together clues to the mystery of who wrote the Bible , when and why .
GABRIEL BARKAY ( Bar - Ilan University ) :
And it was clear that it was a tiny scroll .
RON E. TAPPY ( Pittsburgh Theological Seminary ) : I immediately saw very clear , very distinct letters .
P. KYLE MCCARTER ( Johns Hopkins University ) :
This is the ancestor of the Hebrew script .
NARRATOR : And , from out of the Earth , emerge thousands of idols that suggest God had a wife .
AMIHAI MAZAR ( The Hebrew University of Jerusalem ) :
We just found this exceptional clay figurine showing a fertility goddess .
NARRATOR : Powerful evidence sheds new light on how one people , alone among ancient cultures , finally turn their back on idol worship to find their one god .
CAROL MEYERS ( Duke University ) :
This makes the god of ancient Israel the universal God of the world that resonates with people — at least in Jewish , Christian and Muslim tradition — to this very day .
NARRATOR : Now , science and scripture converge to create a powerful new story of an ancient people , God and the Bible .
Up next on NOVA , The Bible 's Buried Secrets .
NARRATOR : Near the banks of the Nile , in southern Egypt , in 1896 , British archaeologist Flinders Petrie , leads an excavation in Thebes , the ancient city of the dead .
Here , he unearths one of the most important discoveries in biblical archaeology .
From beneath the sand , appears the corner of a royal monument , carved in stone .
Dedicated in honor of Pharaoh Merneptah , son of Ramesses the Great , it became known as the Merneptah Stele .
Today it is in the Cairo Museum .
DONALD REDFORD ( Pennsylvania State University ) :
This stele is what the ancient Egyptians would have called a triumph stele , a victory stele , commemorating victory over foreign peoples .
NARRATOR : Most of the hieroglyphic inscription celebrates Merneptah 's triumph over Libya , his enemy to the West , but almost as an afterthought , he mentions his conquest of people to the East , in just two lines .
DONALD REDFORD :
The text reads , " Ashkelon has been brought captive .
Gezer has been taken captive .
Yanoam in the north Jordan Valley has been seized , Israel has been shorn .
Its seed no longer exists . "
NARRATOR : History proves the pharaoh 's confident boast to be wrong .
Rather than marking their annihilation , Merneptah 's Stele announces the entrance onto the world stage of a people named Israel .
DONALD REDFORD :
This is priceless evidence for the presence of an ethnical group called Israel in the central highlands of southern Canaan .
NARRATOR : The well - established Egyptian chronology gives the date as 1208 B.C. Merneptah 's Stele is powerful evidence that a people called the Israelites are living in Canaan , in what today includes Israel and Palestine , over 3,000 years ago .
The ancient Israelites are best known through familiar stories that chronicle their history : Abraham and Isaac , Moses and the Ten Commandments , David and Goliath .
It is the ancient Israelites who write the Bible .
Through writing the Hebrew Bible , the beliefs of the ancient Israelites survive to become Judaism , one of the world 's oldest continuously - practiced religions .
And it is the Jews who give the world an astounding legacy , the belief in one God .
This belief will become the foundation of two other great monotheistic religions , Christianity and Islam .
Often called the Old Testament , to distinguish it from the New Testament , which describes the events of early Christianity , today the Hebrew Bible and a belief in one God are woven into the very fabric of world culture .
But in ancient times , all people , from the Egyptians to the Greeks to the Babylonians , worshipped many gods , usually in the form of idols .
How did the Israelites , alone among ancient peoples , discover the concept of one god ?
How did they come up with an idea that so profoundly changed the world ?
Now , archaeologists and biblical scholars are arriving at a new synthesis that promises to reveal not only fresh historical insights but a deeper meaning of what the authors of the Bible wanted to convey .
They start by digging into the Earth and the Bible .
WILLIAM DEVER :
You cannot afford to ignore the biblical text , especially if you can isolate a kind of kernel of truth behind these stories and then you have the archaeological data .
Now what happens when text and artifact seem to point in the same direction ?
Then , I think , we are on a very sound ground , historically .
NARRATOR : Scholars search for intersections between science and scripture .
The earliest is the victory stele of the Egyptian pharaoh Merneptah , from 1208 B.C.
Both the stele and the Bible place a people called the Israelites in the hill country of Canaan , which includes modern - day Israel and Palestine .
It is here , between two of history 's greatest empires , that Israel 's story will unfold .
PETER MACHINIST ( Harvard University ) :
The way to understand Israel 's relationship to the super powers — Egypt and Mesopotamia on either side — is to understand its own sense of its fragility as a people .
The primary way in which the Bible looks at the origins of Israel is as a people coming to settle in the land of Israel .
It 's not indigenous ; it 's not a native state .
NARRATOR : The Hebrew Bible is full of stories of Israel 's origins .
The first is Abraham , who leaves Mesopotamia with his family and journeys to the " Promised Land , " Canaan .
VOICEOVER ( Reading from the Bible , " Revised Standard Version , " Genesis 12:1 and 2 ) : The Lord said to Abraham , " Go forth from your native land and from your father 's house to the land that I will show you .
I will make of you a great nation .
And I will bless you .
I will make your name great . "
NARRATOR : According to the Bible , this promise establishes the covenant , a sacred contract between God and Abraham .
To mark the covenant , Abraham and all males are circumcised ; his descendents will be God 's chosen people .
They will be fruitful , multiply and inhabit all the land between Egypt and Mesopotamia .
In return , Abraham and his people , who will become the Israelites , must worship a single god .
THOMAS CAHILL : This is a new idea .
It was an idea that no one had ever had before .
God , in our sense , does n't exist before Abraham .
NARRATOR : It is hard to appreciate today how radical an idea this must have been in a world dominated by polytheism , the worship of many gods and idols .
The Abraham narrative is part of the first book of the Bible , Genesis , along with Noah and the flood , and Adam and Eve .
Though they convey a powerful message , to date , there is no archaeology or text outside of the Bible to corroborate them .
DAVID ILAN ( Hebrew Union College - Jewish Institute of Religion ) :
The farther back you go in the biblical text , the more difficult it is to find historical material in it .
The patriarchs go back to Genesis .
Genesis is , for the most part , a compilation of myths , creation stories , things like that , and to find a historical core there is very difficult .
NARRATOR : This absence of historical evidence leads scholars to take a different approach to reading the biblical narrative .
They look beyond our modern notion of fact or fiction , to ask why the Bible was written in the first place .
WILLIAM DEVER :
There is no word for history in the Hebrew Bible .
The biblical writers were telling stories .
They were good historians and they could tell it the way it was when they wanted to , but their objective was always something far beyond that .
NARRATOR : So what was their objective ?
To find out , scholars must uncover who wrote the Bible and when .
VOICEOVER ( Reading from the Bible , " Revised Standard Version , " Exodus 34:27 )
And the Lord said to Moses , " Write down these words , for in accordance with these words I make a covenant with you and with Israel . "
NARRATOR : The traditional belief is that Moses wrote the first five books of the Bible : Genesis , the story of creation ; Exodus , deliverance from slavery to the Promised Land ; Leviticus ; Numbers ; and Deuteronomy , laws of morality and observance .
Still read , to this day , together they form the Torah , often called the " Five Books of Moses . "
MICHAEL COOGAN ( Stonehill College ) :
The view that Moses had personally written down the first five books of the Bible was virtually unchallenged until the 17th century .
There were a few questions raised about this , for example , the very end of the last book of the Torah , the Book of Deuteronomy , describes the death and burial of Moses .
And so , some rabbis said , " Well , Moses could n't have written those words himself , because he was dead and was being buried . "
NARRATOR : And digging deeper into the text , there are even more discrepancies .
MICHAEL COOGAN : For example , how many of each species of animals is Noah supposed to bring into the ark ?
One text says two , a pair of every kind of animal ; another text says seven pair of the clean animals and only two of the unclean animals .
NARRATOR : In one chapter , the Bible says the flood lasts for 40 days and 40 nights , but in the next it says 150 days .
To see if the floodwaters have subsided , Noah sends out a dove .
But in the previous sentence , he sends a raven .
There are two complete versions of the flood story interwoven on the same page .
Many similar discrepancies , throughout its pages , suggest that the Bible has more than one writer .
In fact , within the first five books of the Bible , scholars have identified the hand of at least four different groups of scribes , writing over several hundred years .
This theory is called the Documentary Hypothesis .
MICHAEL COOGAN : One way of thinking about it is as a kind of anthology that was made , over the course of many centuries , by different people adding to it , subtracting from it and so forth .
NARRATOR : But when did the process of writing the Bible begin ?
NARRATOR : Tel Zayit is a small site on the southwestern border of ancient Israel that dates back to biblical times .
Since 1999 , Ron Tappy has been excavating here .
It was the last day of what had been a typical dig season .
RON TAPPY : As I was taking aerial photographs from the cherry picker , a volunteer notified his square supervisor that he thought he had seen some interesting marks , scratches , possibly letters incised in a stone .
NARRATOR : Letters would be a rare find , so when he kneeled to look at the marks , Tappy got the surprise of a lifetime .
RON TAPPY : As I bent down over the stone , I immediately saw very clear , very distinct letters .
NARRATOR : Tappy excavated the rock and brought it back to his lab at the nearby kibbutz .
It was only then that he realized he had more than a simple inscription .
RON TAPPY : Aleph , bet , gimmel , dalet ... I realized that this inscription represented an abecedary , that is to say , not a text narrative but the letters of the Semitic alphabet written out in their correct order .
Nun , pe and ayin are difficult to read but they 're out here .
NARRATOR : This ancient script is an early form of the Hebrew alphabet .
KYLE MCCARTER :
What was found was not a random scratching of two or three letters , it was the full alphabet .
Everything about it says that this is the ancestor of the Hebrew script .
NARRATOR : The Tel Zayit abecedary is the earliest Hebrew alphabet ever discovered .
It dates to about 1000 B.C. , making it possible that writing the Hebrew Bible could have already started by this time .
To discover the most ancient text in the Bible , scholars examine the Hebrew spelling , grammar and vocabulary .
KYLE MCCARTER : The Hebrew Bible is a collection of literature written over about a thousand years , and , as with any other language , Hebrew , naturally , changed quite a bit over those thousand years .
The same would be true of English .
I 'm speaking English of the 21st century , and if I were living in Elizabethan times , the words I choose , the syntax I use would be quite different .
NARRATOR : Scholars examine the Bible in its original Hebrew in search of the most archaic language , and therefore the oldest passages .
They find it in Exodus , the second book of the Bible .
VOICEOVER ( Reading from the Bible , " Revised Standard Version , " Exodus 15:4 ) Pharaoh 's chariots and his army
He cast into the sea .
His picked officers are drowned in the Red Sea .
NARRATOR : This passage , known as the " Song of the Sea , " is the climactic scene of Exodus , the story of the Israelites enslavement in Egypt and how Moses leads them to freedom .
In all of the Bible , no single event is mentioned more times than the Exodus .
With the development of ancient Hebrew script , the " Song of the Sea " could have been written by 1000 B.C. , the time of Tappy 's alphabet .
But it was probably recited as a poem long before the beginning of Hebrew writing .
LAWRENCE STAGER ( Harvard University ) :
It 's very likely that it was a kind of story , told in poetic form , that you might tell around the campfire .
Just as our poems are easier to remember , generally , than prose accounts , so we generally think that the poetry is orally passed on from one to another , long before they commit things to writing .
NARRATOR : Because the poetry in Exodus is so ancient , is it possible the story has some historical core ?
Here , in the eastern Nile Delta of Egypt , in a surreal landscape of fallen monuments and tumbled masonry , archaeologists have uncovered a lost city .
Inscribed on monuments throughout the site is the name of Ramesses II , one of the most powerful Egyptian rulers .
It is Ramesses who is traditionally known as the pharaoh of the Exodus .
Ancient Egyptian texts call the city Pi-Ramesse , or House of Ramesses , a name that resonates with the biblical story of Exodus .
MICHAEL COOGAN :
The only specific item mentioned in the Exodus story that we can probably connect with non-biblical material is the cities that the Hebrews were ordered to build , and they are named Pithom and Ramesses .
NARRATOR : Scholars agree that the biblical city Ramesses is the ancient Egyptian city Pi-Ramesse .
Its ruins are here in present - day Tanis .
MANFRED BIETAK ( Austrian Academy of Sciences ) :
Most of the Egyptologists identified Pi-Ramesse , the Ramesses town , with Tanis , because here you have an abundance of Ramesside monuments .
NARRATOR : This convergence between archaeology and the Bible provides a timeframe for the Exodus .
It could not have happened before Ramesses became king , around 1275 B.C. , and it could not have happened after 1208 B.C. , when the stele of pharaoh Merneptah , Ramesses the Second 's son , specifically locates the Israelites in Canaan .
The Bible says the Israelites leave Egypt in a mass migration , 600,000 men and their families , and then wander in the desert for 40 years .
But even assuming the Bible is exaggerating , in a hundred years of searching , archaeologists have not yet found evidence of migration that can be linked to the Exodus .
WILLIAM DEVER :
No excavated site gives us any information about the route of the wandering through the wilderness .
And Exodus is simply not attested anywhere .
NARRATOR : Any historical or archaeological confirmation of the Exodus remains elusive .
Yet scholars have discovered that all four groups of biblical writers contributed to some part of the Exodus story .
Perhaps it is for the same reason its message remains powerful to this day : its inspiring theme of freedom .
CAROL MEYERS : Freedom is a compelling notion , and that is one of the ways that we can understand the story of the Exodus : from being controlled by others to controlling oneself , the idea of a change from domination to autonomy .
These are very powerful ideas that resonate in the human spirit , and the exodus gives narrative reality to those ideas .
NARRATOR : Following the Exodus , the Bible says God finally delivers the Israelites to the Promised Land , Canaan .
Archaeology and sources outside the Bible reveal that Canaan consisted of well - fortified city - states , each with its own king , who in turn served Egypt and its pharaoh .
The Canaanites , a thriving Near Eastern culture for thousands of years , worshipped many gods in the form of idols .
The Bible describes how a new leader , Joshua , takes the Israelites into Canaan in a blitzkrieg military campaign .
VOICEOVER ( Reading from the Bible " Revised Standard Version , " Joshua 6:20 ) :
So the people shouted , and the trumpets were blown .
As soon as the people heard the sound of the trumpets , they raised a great shout , and the wall fell down flat .
NARRATOR : But what does archaeology say ?
In the 1930s , British archaeologist John Garstang excavated at Jericho , the first Canaanite city in Joshua 's campaign .
Garstang uncovered dramatic evidence of destruction and declared he had found the very walls that Joshua had brought tumbling down .
And at what the Bible describes as the greatest of all Canaanite cities , Hazor , there is more evidence of destruction .
Today , Hazor is being excavated by one of the leading Israeli archaeologists , Amnon Ben-Tor , and his protégé and co-director , Sharon Zuckerman .
AMNON BEN - TOR : I 'm walking through a passage between two of the rooms of the Canaanite palace of the kings of Hazor .
Signs of the destruction you can still see almost everywhere .
You can see the dark stones here and , most important , you can see how they cracked into a million pieces .
It takes tremendous heat to cause such damage .
The fire here was , how should I say , the mother of all fires .
NARRATOR : Among the ashes , Ben - Tor discovered a desecrated statue , most likely the king or patron god of Hazor .
Its head and hands are cut off , apparently by the city 's conquerors .
This marked the end of Canaanite Hazor .
AMNON BEN - TOR : Question number one : Who did it ?
Who was around , who is a possible candidate ?
So , number one : the Egyptians .
They do n't mention having done anything at Hazor .
In any of the inscriptions at the time , we do n't see Hazor .
Another Canaanite city - state could have done it , maybe .
But who was strong enough to do it ?
Who are we left with ?
The Israelites .
The only ones about whom there is a tradition that they did it .
So , let 's say they should be considered guilty of destruction of Hazor until proven innocent .
NARRATOR : And there 's another Canaanite city - state that Joshua and his army of Israelites are credited with laying waste .
It 's called Ai , and has been discovered in what is now the Palestinian territory of the West Bank .
Here , archaeologist Hani Nur el - Din and his team are finding evidence of a rich Canaanite culture .
HANI NUR EL - DIN ( Al - Quds University ) :
The village first appears and developed into a city , and then there was a kind of fortification surrounding this settlement .
NARRATOR : These heaps of stones were once a magnificent palace and temples , which were eventually destroyed .
But when archaeologists date the destruction , they discover it occurred about 2200 B.C.
They date the destruction of Jericho to 1500 B.C. , and Hazor 's to about 1250 B.C. Clearly , these city - states were not destroyed at the same time ; they range over nearly a thousand years .
In fact , of the 31 sites the Bible says that Joshua conquered , few showed any signs of war .
WILLIAM DEVER :
There was no evidence of armed conflict in most of these sites .
At the same time , it was discovered that most of the large Canaanite towns that were supposed to have been destroyed by these Israelites were either not destroyed at all or destroyed by others .
NARRATOR : A single sweeping military invasion led by Joshua cannot account for how the Israelites arrived in Canaan .
But the destruction of Hazor does coincide with the time that the Merneptah Stele locates the Israelites in Canaan .
So who destroyed Hazor ?
Amnon Ben- Tor still believes it was the Israelites who destroyed the city .
But his co-director , Sharon Zuckerman , has a different idea .
SHARON ZUCKERMAN ( The Hebrew University of Jerusalem ) :
The final destruction itself consisted of the mutilation of statues of kings and gods .
It did not consist of signs of war or of any kind of fighting .
We do n't see weapons in the street like we see in other sites that were destroyed by foreigners .
NARRATOR : So if there was no invasion , what happened ?
Excavations reveal that Hazor had a lower city of commoners , serfs and slaves , and an upper city with a king and wealthy elites .
Zuckerman finds , within the grand palaces of elite Hazor , areas of disrepair and abandonment , to archaeologists , signs of a culture in decline and rebellion from within .
SHARON ZUCKERMAN : I would not rule out the possibility of an internal revolt of Canaanites living at Hazor and revolting against the elites that ruled the city .
NARRATOR : In fact , the entire Canaanite city - state system , including Hazor and Jericho , breaks down .
Archaeology and ancient texts clearly show that it is the result of a long period of decline and upheaval that sweeps through Mesopotamia , the Aegean region and the Egyptian empire around 1200 B.C .
PETER MACHINIST :
And when the dust , as it were , settles , when we can begin to see what takes the place of these ... of this great states system , we find a number of new peoples suddenly coming into focus in a kind of void that is created with the dissolution of the great state system .
NARRATOR : Can archaeologists find the Israelites among these new people ?
NARRATOR : In the 1970s , archaeologists started wide - ranging surveys throughout the central hill country of Canaan , today , primarily , the Palestinian territory of the West Bank .
ISRAEL FINKELSTEIN ( Tel Aviv University ) : I was teaching at that time .
We used to take students and go twice a week to the highlands , and every day we used to cover between two and three square kilometers .
And this accumulates , very slowly , into the coverage of the entire area .
NARRATOR : Israel Finkelstein and teams of archaeologists walked out grids over large areas , collecting every fragment of ancient pottery lying on the surface .
Over seven years he covered nearly 400 square miles , sorting pottery and marking the locations of where it was found , on a map .
ISRAEL FINKELSTEIN :
In the beginning , the spots were there on the map and they meant nothing to me .
But later , slowly , slowly , I started seeing sort of a phenomena and processes .
NARRATOR : By dating the pottery , Finkelstein discovered that before 1200 B.C. , there were approximately 25 settlements .
He estimated the total population of those settlements to be 3 , - to 5,000 inhabitants .
But just 200 years later , there 's a very sharp increase in settlements and people .
ISRAEL FINKELSTEIN :
Then you get this boom of population growing and growing .
Then we are speaking about 250 sites .
And the population grows , also , 10 times , from a few thousand to 45,000 or so .
Now this is very dramatic and cannot be explained as natural growth .
This rate is impossible in ancient times .
NARRATOR : If not natural growth , perhaps these are the waves of dispersed people settling down following the collapse of the great state systems .
Then , more evidence of a new culture is discovered , a new type of simple dwelling , never seen before .
And it's in the exact location where both the Merneptah Stele and the Bible place the Israelites .
AMNON BEN - TOR :
The sites in which this type of house appears , throughout the country , this is where Israelites lived .
And they are sometimes even called the Israelite house or Israelite - type house .
The people who lived in those villages seemed to be arranged , more or less , in a kind of egalitarian society because there are no major architectural installations .
If you look at the finds , the finds are relatively poor .
Pottery is more or less mundane — I do n't want to offend the early settlers or the early Israelites — very little art .
NARRATOR : Curiously , the mundane pottery found at these new Israelite villages is very similar to the everyday pottery found at the older Canaanite cities like Hazor .
In fact , the Israelite house is practically the only thing that is different .
This broad similarity is leading archaeologists to a startling new conclusion about the origins of the ancient Israelites .
WILLIAM DEVER :
The notion is that most of the early Israelites were originally Canaanites , displaced Canaanites .
PETER MACHINIST : The Israelites were always in the land of Israel .
They were natives , but they were different kinds of groups .
They were basically the have - nots .
WILLIAM DEVER :
So what we 're dealing with is a movement of peoples , but not an invasion of armed hordes from outside , but rather a social and economic revolution .
NARRATOR : Ancient texts describe how the Egyptian rulers and their Canaanite vassal kings burden the lower classes of Canaan with taxes and even slavery .
A radical new theory based on archaeology suggests what happens next .
As that oppressive social system declines , families and tribes of serfs , slaves and common Canaanites seize the opportunity .
In search of a better way of life , they abandon the old city - states , and head for the hills .
Free from the oppression of their past , they eventually emerge in a new place as a new people , the Israelites .
ISRAEL FINKELSTEIN :
In the text , you have the story of the Israelites coming from outside , and then besieging the Canaanite cities , destroying them and then becoming a nation in the land of Canaan , whereas archaeology tells us something which is the opposite .
According to archaeology , the rise of early Israel is an outcome of the collapse of Canaanite society , not the reason for that collapse .
NARRATOR : Archaeology reveals that the Israelites were themselves originally Canaanites .
So why does the Bible consistently cast the Israelites as outsiders in Canaan : Abraham 's wanderings from Mesopotamia ; Moses leading slaves out of Egypt and into the Promised Land ; and Joshua conquering Canaan from outside ?
The answer may lie in their desire to forge a distinctly new identity .
PETER MACHINIST : Identity is created , as psychologists tell us , by talking about what you are not , by talking about another .
In order to figure out who I am , I have to figure out who I am not .
NARRATOR : Conspicuously absent from Israelite villages are the grand palaces and the extravagant pottery associated with the kings and rich elites of Canaan .
AVRAHAM FAUST ( Archaeologist , Bar - Ilan University ) :
The Israelites did not like the Canaanite
system , and they defined themselves in contrast to that system .
By not using decorated pottery , by not using imported pottery , they developed an ideology of simplicity which marked the difference between them and the Egyptian Canaanite system .
NARRATOR : If the Israelites wanted to distinguish themselves from their Canaanite past , what better way than to create a story about destroying them ?
But the stories of Abraham , Exodus and the Conquest serve another purpose .
They celebrate the power of what the Bible says is the foremost distinction between the Israelites and all other people , their God .
In later Judaism , the name of God is considered so sacred it is never to be spoken .
MICHAEL COOGAN :
We do n't know exactly what it means and we do n't know how it was pronounced , but it seems to have been the personal name of the God of Israel , so his title , in a sense , was " God , " and his name was these four letters , which in English is " YHWH , " which we think were probably pronounced something like Yahweh .
NARRATOR : But Yahweh only appears in the Hebrew Bible .
His name is nowhere to be found in Canaanite texts or stories .
So where do the Israelites find their God ?
NARRATOR : The search for the origins of Yahweh leads scholars back to ancient Egypt .
Here in the royal city of Karnak , for over a thousand years , Pharaohs celebrated their power with statues , obelisks and carved murals on temple walls .
DONALD REDFORD :
Here on the north wall of Karnak , we have scenes depicting the victories and battles of Seti the First , the father of Ramesses the Great .
Seti , here , commemorates one of his greatest victories over the Shasu .
NARRATOR : The Shasu were a people who lived in the deserts of southern Canaan , now Jordan and northern Saudi Arabia , around the same time as the Israelites emerged .
Egyptian texts say one of the places where the Shasu lived is called " Y.H.W. , " probably pronounced Yahu , likely the name of their patron god .
That name
Yahu is strangely similar to Yahweh , the name of the Israelite god .
In the Bible , the place where the Shasu lived is referred to as Midian .
It is here , before the Exodus , the Bible tells us , Moses first encounters Yahweh , in the form of a burning bush .
VOICEOVER ( Reading from the Bible " Revised Standard Version , " Exodus 3:5 and 15 ) : Come no closer !
Remove the sandals from your feet , for the place on which you are standing is holy ground .
God also said to Moses , " Thus you shall say to the Israelites , YHWH the God of your ancestors ... has sent me to you :
This is My name forever , and this My title for all generations . "
MICHAEL COOGAN : So we have , in Egyptian sources , something that appears to be a name like Yahweh in the vicinity of Midian .
Here is Moses in Midian , and there a deity appears to him and reveals his name to Moses as Yahweh .
NARRATOR : These tantalizing connections are leading biblical scholars to re-examine the Exodus story .
While there is no evidence to support a mass migration , some now believe that a small group did escape from Egypt ; however , they were not Israelites but , rather , Canaanite slaves .
On their journey back to Canaan they pass through Midian , where they are inspired by stories of the Shasu 's god , Yahu .
AVRAHAM FAUST : There was probably a group of people who fled from Egypt and had some divine experience .
It was probably small , a small group demographically , but it was important at least in ideology .
NARRATOR : They find their way to the central hill country , where they encounter the tribes who had fled the Canaanite city - states .
Their story of deliverance resonates in this emerging egalitarian society .
The liberated slaves attribute their freedom to the god they met in Midian , who they now call Yahweh .
CAROL MEYERS :
They spread the word to the highlanders , who themselves , perhaps , had escaped from the tyranny of the Canaanite city - states .
They spread the idea of a god who represented freedom , freedom for people to keep the fruits of their own labor .
This was a message that was so powerful that it brought people together and gave them a new kind of identity .
NARRATOR : The identity of " Israelites . "
They are a combination of disenfranchised Canaanites , runaway slaves from Egypt and even nomads , settling down .
The Bible calls them a " mixed multitude . "
WILLIAM DEVER : According to the Hebrew Bible , early Israel is a motley crew .
And we know that 's the case , now .
But these people are bound together by a new vision , and I think the revolutionary spirit is probably there from the beginning .
NARRATOR : The chosen people may actually be people who chose to be free .
Their story of escape , first told by word of mouth and poetry , helps forge a collective identity among the tribes .
Later , when written down , it will become a central theme of the Bible : Exodus and divine deliverance , deliverance by a God who comes from Midian — exactly where the Bible says — adopted by the Israelites to represent their exodus from slavery to freedom .
So is this the birth of monotheism ?
MICHAEL COOGAN :
The common understanding of what differentiated the ancient Israelites from their neighbors was that their neighbors worshipped many different gods and goddesses , and the Israelites worshipped only the one true god .
But that is not the case .
NARRATOR : This bull figurine , likely representing El , the chief god of the Canaanite deities , is one of thousands of idols discovered in Israelite sites .
MICHAEL COOGAN : The Israelites frequently worshipped other gods .
Now , maybe they were n't supposed to , but they did .
So at least on a practical level , many , if not most , Israelites were not monotheists .
NARRATOR : The Bible 's ideal of the Israelite worship of one god will have to wait .
NARRATOR : About two centuries pass after the Merneptah Stele places the Israelites in Canaan .
Families grow into tribes ; their population increases .
Then about 1000 B.C. , one of the Bible 's larger than life figures emerges to unite the 12 tribes of Israel against a powerful new enemy .
VOICEOVER ( Reading from the Bible " Revised Standard Version , " First Samuel 17:49 ) : David put his hand into the bag ; he took out a stone and slung it .
It struck the Philistine in the forehead ; the stone sank into his forehead and he fell down on the ground .
NARRATOR : The Bible celebrates David as a shepherd boy who vanquishes the giant Goliath ; a lover who lusts after forbidden fruits ; and a poet who composes lyric psalms still recited today .
Of all the names in the Hebrew Bible , none appears more than David .
Scriptures say David creates a kingdom that stretches from Egypt to Mesopotamia .
He makes Jerusalem his royal capital .
And in a new covenant , Yahweh promises that he and his descendents will rule forever .
David 's son Solomon builds the Temple where Yahweh , now the national God of Israel , will dwell for eternity .
The Kingdom of David and Solomon : one nation , united under one god , according to the Bible .
WILLIAM DEVER : Now , some skeptics , today , have argued that there was no such thing as a united monarchy .
It 's a later biblical construct and , particularly , a construct of modern scholarship .
In short , there was no David .
As one of the biblical revisionists have said , " David is no more historical than King Arthur . "
NARRATOR : But then , in 1993 , an amazing discovery literally shed new light on what the Bible calls ancient Israel 's greatest king .
Gila Cook was finishing up some survey work with an assistant at Tel Dan , a biblical site in the far north of Israel , today .
The excavation was headed by the eminent Israeli archaeologist , Avraham Biran .
It was near the end of the day , and Cook was getting her last measurements , when she hears a yell from below .
GILA COOK ( Hebrew Union College - Jewish Institute of Religion , Jerusalem ) :
And it was Biran , in his booming voice , yelling " Gila , let 's go . "
And so I waved to him , " Hold it , " and continued working .
NARRATOR : After being summoned by Biran a second time , Cook had her assistant load her up , and she started down the hill .
GILA COOK : So I get there , and I just drop my bag and drop the board , and I set my stuff down .
NARRATOR : But something catches her eye : a stone with what appeared to be random scratches , but was actually an ancient inscription .
This time she yelled for Biran .
GILA COOK :
And he looks at it , and he looks at me , and he says , " Oh my god ! "
NARRATOR : Cook had found a fragment of a victory stele , written in Aramaic , an ancient language very similar to Hebrew .
Dedicated by the king of Damascus or one of his generals , it celebrates the conquest of Israel , boasting , " I slew mighty kings who harnessed thousands of chariots and thousands of horsemen .
I killed the king of the House of David . "
Those words , " the House of David , " make this a critical discovery .
They are strong evidence that David really lived .
Unlike Genesis , the stories of Israel 's kings move the biblical narrative out of the realm of legend and into the light of history .
WILLIAM DEVER :
The later we come in time , the firmer ground we stand on .
We have better sources , we have more written sources , we have more contemporary eyewitness sources .
NARRATOR : When the biblical chronology of Israel 's kings can be cross-referenced with historical inscriptions , like the Tel Dan Stele , they can provide scholars with fairly reliable dates .
King David is the earliest biblical figure confirmed by archaeology to be historical .
And most scholars agree he lived around 1000 B.C. , the 10th century .
Could any of the Bible have been written during David 's reign ?
The earliest Hebrew alphabet discovered by Ron Tappy carved on a stone at Tel Zayit provides an enticing clue .
RON TAPPY :
The stone was incised with this alphabet , the stone was then used to build the wall , and the structure itself suffered massive destruction by fire sometime near the end of the 10th century B.C.E .
NARRATOR : The find is even more significant because Tel Zayit was a biblical backwater , on the fringes of David 's kingdom .
KYLE MCCARTER : Surely , if there was a scribe that could write this alphabet that far away , way out in the boondocks , at the extreme western boundary of the kingdom , surely if there is a scribe that could do that out there , there were scribes , much more sophisticated scribes , back in the capital .
NARRATOR : Could these scribes have been in the court of King David and his son Solomon ?
Could they have been the earliest biblical writers ?
In the 18th century , German scholars uncovered a clue to who wrote the Bible , hidden in two different names for God .
MICHAEL COOGAN : According to one account , Abraham knew God by his intimate , personal name , conventionally pronounced Yahweh .
NARRATOR : Passages with the name Yahweh , which in German is spelled with a J , scholars refer to as J
MICHAEL COOGAN : But according to other accounts , Abraham knew God simply by the most common Hebrew word for God , which is Elohim .
NARRATOR : So the two different writers became known as E , for Elohim , and J , for Yahweh .
Most likely based on poetry and songs passed down for generations , they both write a version of Israel 's distant past , the stories of Abraham in the Promised Land , Moses and the Exodus .
MICHAEL COOGAN :
The earliest of these sources is the one that is known as J , which many scholars dated to the 10th century B.C. , the time of David and Solomon .
NARRATOR : And because the backdrop for J's version of events is the area around Jerusalem , it 's likely he lived there , perhaps in the royal courts of David and Solomon .
NARRATOR : For over a hundred years , archaeologists have searched Jerusalem for evidence of the Kingdom of David , but excavating here is contentious because Jerusalem is sacred to today 's three monotheistic religions .
JOAN R. BRANHAM ( Providence College ) : For Christians , Jesus comes in his final week to worship at the Jerusalem temple .
He 's crucified , he 's buried , he 's resurrected in the city of Jerusalem .
For Islam , it is the site where Mohammed comes in a sacred night journey ; and , today , the Dome of the Rock marks that spot .
In Judaism the stories of the Hebrew Bible , of Solomon , of David , of the temples of Jerusalem , all of these take place , of course , in Jerusalem .
So Jerusalem is a symbol of sacred space today , important for all three traditions .
NARRATOR : Despite the difficulties , Israeli archaeologist Eilat Mazar went digging in the most ancient part of Jerusalem , today called the City of David .
EILAT MAZAR : We started excavations here , because we wanted to check and to examine the possibility that the remains of King David 's palace are here .
NARRATOR : But because this area has been fought over , destroyed and rebuilt over thousands of years , it was a long shot that any biblical remains would survive .
But then ...
EILAT MAZAR : Large walls started to appear , three meter wide , five meter wide .
And then we saw that it goes all directions .
It goes from east , 30 meters to the west , and we do n't see the end of it yet .
NARRATOR : Such huge walls can only be part of a massive building , and Mazar believes her excavations , to date , represent only 20 percent of its total size .
EILAT MAZAR : Such a huge structure shows centralization and capability of construction .
It can be only royal structure .
NARRATOR : This huge complex may be evidence of a kingdom , but is it David 's kingdom ?
For these walls to be David 's palace , they would have to date to his lifetime , around 1000 B.C .
The problem is stone walls can never be dated on their own .
Biblical archaeologists date ruins based on the pottery they find associated with those ruins .
Pottery dating is based on two ideas : pottery styles evolve uniformly over time , and the further down you dig , the further back in time you go .
If pottery style A comes from the lowest stratum , then it is earlier than pottery style B that comes from the stratum above it .
By analyzing pottery from well - stratified sites , excavators are able to create what they call a relative chronology .
But this chronology is floating in time , without any fixed dates .
To anchor this chronology William Foxwell Albright , considered the father of biblical archaeology , used events mentioned in both the Bible and Egyptian and Mesopotamian texts to assign dates to pottery styles .
Albright 's chronology , slightly modified , is what Mazar uses to date her massive building and what most archaeologists use today .
EILAT MAZAR : What we found is a typical 10th century pottery , meaning bowls with hand burnish you can see from inside , together with an import , a beautiful black - on - red juglet .
What is so important is that this is a 10th century typical juglet .
NARRATOR : So has Mazar discovered the Palace of David ?
She adds up the evidence .
The building is huge , it is located in a prominent place in the oldest part of Jerusalem , and the pottery , according to Albright 's chronology , dates to the 10th century B.C. , the time of David .
Mazar believes she has indeed found the Palace of David .
But that evidence and , indeed , the kingdom itself rest on the dates associated with fragments of pottery , and some critics argue the system for dating that pottery relies too heavily on the Bible .
ISRAEL FINKELSTEIN : Archaeologists in the past did not rely too heavily on the Bible , they relied only on the Bible .
We have a problem in dating .
How do you date in archaeology ?
You need an anchor from outside .
NARRATOR : Today , there is a more scientific method to anchor pottery to firm dates , radiocarbon dating .
It is a specialty of Elisabetta Boaretto of the Weizmann Institute .
ELISABETTA BOARETTO ( Weizmann Institute of Science , Israel ) :
The first step is , of course , in the field , which relates this sample material like olive pits or seeds or charcoal to the archaeological context .
NARRATOR : If an olive seed is found at the same layer as a piece of pottery , the carbon in the seed can be used to date the pottery .
When the seed dies , its radioactive carbon - 14 decays at a consistent rate over time .
By measuring the ratio of carbon - 14 to carbon - 12 , Boaretto can determine the age of the olive seed , which , in turn , can be used to date the pottery .
Boaretto has meticulously collected and analyzed hundreds of samples from over 20 sites throughout Israel .
Her carbon samples date the pottery that Albright and most archaeologists associate with the time of David and Solomon to around 75 years later .
For events so long ago , this may seem like a trivial difference , but if Boaretto is right , Mazar 's Palace of David and Tappy 's ancient Hebrew alphabet have to be re-dated .
This places them in the time of the lesser - known kings Omri , Ahab , and his despised wife Jezebel , all worshippers of the Canaanite god Baal .
With no writing or monumental building , suddenly the Kingdom of David and Solomon is far less glorious than the Bible describes .
ISRAEL FINKELSTEIN : So David and Solomon did not rule over a big territory .
It was a small chiefdom , if you wish , with just a few settlements , very poor , the population was limited , there was no manpower for big conquest , and so on and so forth .
NARRATOR : This would make David a petty warlord ruling over a chiefdom , and his royal capital , Jerusalem , nothing more than a cow town .
ISRAEL FINKELSTEIN :
These are the results of the radiocarbon dating .
He or she who decides to ignore these results , I treat them as if arguing that the world is flat , that the Earth is flat .
And I can not argue anymore .
NARRATOR : But it 's not so simple .
Other teams collected radiocarbon samples following the same meticulous methodology .
According to their results , Mazar 's palace and Tappy 's alphabet can date to the 10th century , the time of David and Solomon .
How can this discrepancy be explained ?
The problem is that these radiocarbon dates have a margin of error of plus - or minus - 30 years , about the difference between the two sides .
NARRATOR : Pottery and radiocarbon dating alone cannot determine if the Kingdom of David and Solomon was as large and prosperous as described in the Bible .
Fortunately , the Bible offers clues of other places to dig for evidence of this kingdom .
The Bible credits David with conquering the kingdom , but it is Solomon , his son , who is the great builder .
VOICEOVER ( Reading from the Bible " Revised Standard Version , " First Kings 9:15 ) :
This was the purpose of the forced labor which Solomon imposed .
It was to build the House of YHWH ... and the wall of Jerusalem , Hazor , Megiddo and Gezer .
NARRATOR : Here in Hazor , Amnon Ben- Tor , director of excavations , believes this may be evidence of Solomon 's building campaign .
Archaeologists call it a six - chambered gate , a massive entryway , fortified with towers and guard rooms .
Ben - Tor 's predecessor , Yigal Yadin first uncovered this structure .
AMNON BEN - TOR :
It turned out to be a six - chambered gate , and Yadin immediately remembered that a very , very similar gate was excavated at Gezer , and then Chicago University excavated this gate , here at Megiddo .
NARRATOR : Stunned by the similarity of these three gates , Yadin recalled the passage in the Bible .
AMNON BEN - TOR :
Here we have a wonderful connection of the biblical passage as it shows up in archaeology .
NARRATOR : Three monumental gates , all based on the same plan , would seem to be powerful evidence not only of prosperity , but also of a central authority .
Throughout its history the Israelites had been divided into tribes , then into kingdoms , north and south .
The locations of these strikingly similar gates in both regions suggest a single governing authority throughout the land .
But how can we be sure this is the Kingdom of David and Solomon ?
The answer , once again , lies in Egypt .
DONALD REDFORD :
The head - smiting scene , which you see on this wall , commemorates a military campaign conducted by Pharaoh Shishak , or Sheshonk , the founder of Dynasty 22 , in Egypt .
NARRATOR : The Egyptian pharaoh Shishak invades Israel , an event the Bible reports and specifically dates to five years after Solomon 's death , during the reign of his son , Rehoboam .
VOICEOVER ( Reading from the Bible " Revised Standard Version , " First Kings 14:25 –26 ) :
In the fifth year of King Rehoboam , King Shishak of Egypt marched against Jerusalem and carried off the treasures of the House of YHWH and the treasures of the royal palace .
He carried off everything .
DONALD REDFORD :
The importance of this , in fixing one of the earliest dates , specific dates , in which Egyptian history coincides with biblical history is really startling and has to be taken note of .
NARRATOR : This stunning convergence between the Bible and Egyptian history gives a firm date for the death of Solomon .
Shishak 's campaign , according to the well - established Egyptian chronology , dates to 925 B.C.
And the Bible says Solomon dies five years earlier , which means 930 B.C.
This is further evidence that David and Solomon lived in the 10th century , but there 's even more hidden in these walls .
These ovals , with their depictions of bound captives and city walls , represent places Pharaoh Shishak conquered in Israel .
One of those places is Gezer , where archaeologists find the hallmark of Solomon 's building program , a six - chambered gate .
Bill Dever directed the excavations in the late 1960s .
WILLIAM DEVER :
We can actually see vivid evidence here of a destruction .
Down below , we have the original stones , pretty much in situ , but , if you look in here , you see the stones are badly cracked .
You can even see where they 're burned from the heat of a huge fire that has been built here .
And then , up in here , you see the fire had been so intense that the soft limestone has melted into lime , and it flows down like lava .
This is vivid evidence of a destruction , and we would connect that with this well - known raid of Pharaoh Shishak .
NARRATOR : And if the gate was destroyed by Shishak , in 925 B.C. , then it must have been built during the lifetime of Solomon , who died just five years earlier .
WILLIAM DEVER : Surely this kind of monumental architecture is evidence of state formation , and if it's in the 10th century , then ... Solomon .
NARRATOR : Although a minority of archaeologists continue to disagree , this convergence of the Bible , Egyptian chronology and Solomon 's gates is powerful evidence that a great kingdom existed at the time of David and Solomon , spanning all of Israel , north and south , with its capital in Jerusalem .
But Jerusalem is more than a political center , it is the center of worship .
SHAYE J. D. COHEN ( Harvard University ) :
The magic of Jerusalem is the magic of the Temple , one temple for the one god .
The result is that Jerusalem and the Temple emerge as powerful symbols , not just of the oneness of God , but also the oneness of the Jewish people .
NARRATOR : The worship of the ancient Israelites bears little resemblance to Judaism today .
It centered around the Temple , built by David 's son Solomon , and seen as Yahweh 's earthly dwelling .
To understand how the ancient Israelites worshipped their god , scholars must discover what the Temple looked like and how it functioned .
But , although archaeologists know where its remains should be , it is impossible to dig there .
It lies under the third holiest site in Islam , which includes the Dome of the Rock .
Not a stone of Solomon 's Temple has ever been excavated , but the Bible offers a remarkably detailed description .
VOICEOVER ( Reading from the Bible " Revised Standard Version , " First Kings 6:2 , 23 and 28 ) :
The house which King Solomon built for YHWH was 60 cubits long , 20 cubits wide and 30 cubits high .
In the inner sanctuary he made two cherubim ... each 10 cubits high .
He overlaid the cherubim with gold .
NARRATOR : The Bible 's description suggests a floor plan for Solomon 's Temple , and it is strikingly similar to temples built by neighboring peoples who worship many gods .
The closest in appearance is a temple hundreds of miles to the north of Jerusalem , at Ain Dara , in modern - day Syria .
They have similar dimensions and the same basic floor plan .
Guarding both temples are sphinxes or " cherubim , " as the Bible calls them .
Unique to the temple at Ain Dara are the enormous footprints of the god who lived here .
They mark his progress as he strode to his throne in the innermost sanctuary .
LAWRENCE STAGER :
If we take the details that we find of Solomon 's Temple in the Book of Kings and compare it with the Ain Dara temple , we can piece together a fairly good picture , I think , of what this temple might have looked like in the age of Solomon .
NARRATOR : Now it is possible to reconstruct , with some confidence , how Solomon 's Temple may have looked and how the ancient Israelites worshipped their god .
JOAN BRANHAM : Out front was an enormous altar .
Beyond that was a porch area that led into the inside of the Temple .
There was a room , the holy place , and then beyond that the most sacred room , the holy of holies where tradition says the Ark of the Covenant held the tablets of the law .
And this room was considered to be the most sacred site on Earth , because it is the room where God 's presence could be found .
NARRATOR : And the ancient Israelites believed their god demanded a very specific form of worship .
Evidence of this survives today , on Mount Gerizim , in Palestine .
The Samaritans , who live here , claim direct descent from the ancient tribes of Israel .
According to their tradition , for over 2,500 years , they have been practicing the ancient Israelite form of worship , animal sacrifice .
JOAN BRANHAM :
The primary function is to make a connection between our mundane world and the divine world , and the means , for the ancient Israelites , is embodied in blood .
Blood is the most sacred substance on the altar , and blood is the substance that embodies life .
So it is the most precious substance in the human world .
NARRATOR : But while the priests were offering sacrifice to Yahweh in the Temple , many Israelites were not as loyal .
At Tel Rehov , archaeologists are digging at an Israelite house that illuminates the religious practices of its ancient inhabitants .
AMIHAI MAZAR : Well , we just found this beautiful , exceptional clay figurine showing a goddess , a fertility goddess that was worshipped here in Israel .
Here , in this case , she is shown holding a baby .
NARRATOR : Who is this fertility goddess ?
And what is a pagan idol doing in an Israelite home ?
Dramatic evidence as to her possible identity first surfaced in 1968 .
Bill Dever was carrying out salvage excavations in tombs in southern Israel , when a local brought him an inscription that had been robbed from one of them .
WILLIAM DEVER :
When I got home and brushed it off , I thought I was going to have a heart attack .
Executed in clear eighth - century script , it 's a tomb inscription , and it gives the name of the deceased , and it says , " Blessed may X be by Yahweh " — that 's good biblical Hebrew , but it says — " by Yahweh and his Asherah . "
And Asherah is the name of the old Canaanite mother goddess .
NARRATOR : More inscriptions associating Yahweh and Asherah have been discovered and thousands of figurines unearthed , throughout Israel .
Many scholars believe this is the face of Asherah .
Dever concludes
God had a wife .
Even hundreds of years after the Israelites rise from their Canaanite pagan roots , monotheism has still not completely taken hold .
WILLIAM DEVER :
This is awkward for some people , the notion that Israelite religion was not exclusively monotheistic .
But we know , now , that it was n't .
NARRATOR : The Bible admits the Israelites continue to worship Asherah and other Canaanite gods , such as Baal .
In fact , the prophets , holy men speaking in the name of God , consistently rail against breaking the covenant made with Moses to worship only Yahweh .
VOICEOVER ( Reading from the Bible " Revised Standard Version , " Hosea 11:2 ) :
The more I called them , the more they went from me ; they kept sacrificing to the Baals and offering incense to idols .
MICHAEL COOGAN : The Israelites had made a contract with God .
If they kept it , God would reward them .
If they broke it , he would punish them .
He would punish them by using foreign powers as his instruments .
NARRATOR : Events seem to fulfill the prophets ' dire predictions .
Soon after Solomon 's death , the 10 northern tribes rebel and form the Northern Kingdom of Israel .
Then a powerful new enemy storms out of Mesopotamia to create the largest empire the Near East had ever known , the Assyrians .
PETER MACHINIST : The Assyrians were the overpowering military force , and Israel and Judah , the two states that the Bible talks about as the states making up the people Israel , fell under the sway of the Assyrian juggernaut .
NARRATOR : Numerous Assyrian texts and reliefs vividly document their domination of Israel and Judah .
NARRATOR : In 722 B.C. , the Assyrian army crushes the Northern Kingdom .
Those who escape death or exile to Assyria , flood south into Jerusalem , where the descendents of David and Solomon continue to reign .
One of them , Josiah , according to the Bible , finally heeds what the prophets prescribe .
MICHAEL COOGAN : We are told , in the Book of Kings , that King Josiah , in the late 7th century B.C. , was told that a scroll had been discovered in the Temple archives .
The scroll was brought to him , and as the scroll was being read , Josiah began to weep , because he realized that it was a sacred text containing divine commands which the people had been breaking .
NARRATOR : Scholars believe that the lost scroll is part of the fifth book of the Torah , Deuteronomy , a detailed code of laws and observance .
It inspires another group of scribes , in the seventh century B.C. , whom scholars call the D writers .
According to the Documentary Hypothesis , after J and E , D is the third group of scribes who write part of the Hebrew Bible .
D retells the Exodus story and reaffirms the covenant Moses made between God and the Israelite people .
MICHAEL COOGAN : " You should love the Lord , your God , because he has loved you .
He has loved you more than any other nation . "
So the divine love for Israel requires a corresponding loyalty to God , an exclusive loyalty to God .
And Deuteronomy , more than other parts of the Bible , is insistent that only the God of Israel is to be worshipped .
NARRATOR : To enforce the covenant , Josiah orders that idols and altars to all other deities be destroyed .
The book of Deuteronomy contains the clearest prohibition of the worship of other gods , the Ten Commandments .
VOICEOVER ( Reading from the Bible " Revised Standard Version , " Deuteronomy 5:6–9 ) : I am YHWH , your God , you shall have no other gods before me .
You shall not make for yourself an idol .
You shall not bow down to them or worship them .
NARRATOR : The Ten Commandments appears in two books of the Bible , in Deuteronomy and in Exodus .
It is not only a contract with Yahweh , it is also a code of conduct between people .
THOMAS CAHILL : The revelation of the Ten Commandments is an ethical revelation .
And that 's where the idea of justice comes in , because that 's the most important thing about the way in which we treat one another .
We will not kill him , we will not steal from him and we will not lie about him .
We will abide by the commandments .
The commandments , as God , himself , repeatedly says through the later prophets , are already written on the hearts of human beings .
NARRATOR : By associating the belief in one god with moral behavior , the Ten Commandments establishes a code of morality and justice for all , the ideal of Western civilization .
Despite Josiah 's reforms , the ancient Israelites continue to worship other gods .
Their acceptance of one god and the triumph of monotheism begins with a series of events vividly attested through archaeology , ancient texts and the Bible .
It starts with the destruction of Yahweh 's earthly dwelling , Jerusalem Temple .
In 586 B.C. , after defeating the Assyrians , a new Mesopotamian empire invades Israel : the Babylonians ransack the Temple and systematically burn the sacred city .
Before his eyes , the Babylonian victors slay the sons of Zedekiah , the last Davidic king , then blind him .
The covenant — the promise made by Yahweh to his chosen people and to David that his dynasty would rule eternally in Jerusalem — is broken .
After 400 years , Israel is wiped out .
ERIC M. MEYERS ( Duke University ) :
The destruction of Jerusalem created one of the most significant theological crises in the history of the Jewish people .
NARRATOR : The Babylonians round up the Israelite priests , prophets and scribes , and drag them in chains to Babylon .
Babylonian records confirm the presence of Israelites , including the king , in exile .
WILLIAM DEVER :
In every age of disbelief , one is inclined to think God is dead .
And surely those who survived the fall of Jerusalem must have thought so .
After all , how could God allow his temple , his house , the visible sign of his presence among his people to be destroyed ?
NARRATOR : Without temple , king or land , how can the Israelites survive ?
Their journey begins with the ancient scrolls , which , some scholars speculate , were rescued from the flames of the destruction .
MICHAEL COOGAN : Among the exiles from Jerusalem to Babylon were priests from the Temple , and they seem to have brought with them their sacred documents , their sacred traditions .
NARRATOR : According to the widely accepted Documentary Hypothesis , it is here in Babylon , far from their homes in Israel , that priests and scribes will produce much of the Hebrew Bible , as it is known today .
Scholars refer to these writers as P , or the priestly source .
MICHAEL COOGAN :
It was P who took all of these earlier traditions , the J source , the E source , the D source and other sources , as well , and combined them into what we know as the Torah , the first five books of the Bible .
NARRATOR : But more than just compiling , P edits and writes a version of Israel 's distant past — including the Abraham story — that provides a way for the Israelites to remain a people and maintain their covenant with God .
VOICEOVER ( Reading from the Bible " Revised Standard Version , " Genesis 17:11 ) :
You shall circumcise the flesh of your foreskins , and it shall be a sign of the covenant between Me and you .
SHAYE COHEN : When Genesis 17 attributes a covenantal value to circumcision , it 's not really talking about Abraham .
It is really talking about the exiles of the sixth century B.C.E. , who , far from their native home , were desperately trying to find a way to reaffirm their difference .
Therefore they began to look at circumcision as , not simply another practice , but rather as the marker of the covenant and they attributed this view back to Abraham .
NARRATOR : To the exiles , the Babylonians are the new Canaanites , the idol - worshipping , uncircumcised peoples , from whom they must remain apart .
But the Abraham story , with its harrowing tale of a father 's willingness to sacrifice his own son , is also about the power of faith .
It is no coincidence that the exiled P scribes place Abraham 's origins in Ur , just down the river from Babylon .
Perhaps with the same faith as Abraham had , so , too , will the exiles be returned to the Promised Land .
MICHAEL COOGAN : One of the pervasive themes in the Torah is the theme of exile and return : Abraham goes down to Egypt and comes out of Egypt ; the Israelites go to Egypt and get out .
For the exiles in Babylon in the sixth century B.C. , that theme must have resonated very powerfully .
God , who had acted on their behalf in the past , will presumably do so again .
NARRATOR : The Israelites still have a problem .
How , in a foreign land without the Temple and sacrifice , can they redeem themselves in the eyes of Yahweh ?
MICHAEL COOGAN : To assure that divine protection , the P tradition emphasizes observances , such as the Sabbath observance .
You do n't need to be in the land of Israel to keep the Sabbath .
ERIC MEYERS :
And we have allusions in the biblical writings and the prophets to the fact that the exiles also learned to pray in groups , in what was to become the forerunner of the synagogue .
SHAYE COHEN :
It is during this period , through the exile , that the exiles realized that , even far away from their homeland , without a temple , without the priesthood , without kings , they are still able to worship God , be loyal to God and to follow God 's commandments .
This is the foundation of Judaism .
NARRATOR : The experience of the exile transforms ancient Israelite cult into a modern religion .
By compiling the stories of their past — originally written by the scribes J , E and D — the exodus from slavery to freedom , Moses and the Ten Commandments , Abraham 's journey to the promised land , P creates what we know today as the first five books of the Bible .
Though this theory is widely accepted , physical evidence of any biblical text from the exile or earlier is hard to come by .
The most celebrated surviving biblical texts are the Dead Sea Scrolls .
First discovered by accident , in 1947 , the scrolls represent nearly all 39 books of the Hebrew Bible , at least in fragments .
They survived because they were deposited in the perfect environment for preservation , the hot , dry desert .
Archaeologists suspect there were at least hundreds more scrolls throughout Israel , but because they were written on papyrus or animal skins , they have long since decomposed .
JODI MAGNESS ( University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill ) :
Even though the earliest of the Dead Sea Scrolls date to the third and second centuries B.C. , that does n't mean that they 're the first copies or examples of this work that were ever written .
It means they already stand in a line of tradition that had been established by the time the scrolls were written .
NARRATOR : Still , the earliest of the Dead Sea Scrolls dates to at least 300 years after the Babylonian exile .
In the absence of proof of earlier text , some scholars claim the entire Bible is pious fiction and even doubt whether Israel and the Israelites ever existed .
WILLIAM DEVER :
For many of the revisionists , these extreme skeptics , there was no ancient Israel , Israel is an intellectual construct .
In other words , these people were not rethinking their past , they were inventing their past .
They had no past , so the Bible is a myth , a foundation myth , told to legitimate a people who had no legitimacy .
NARRATOR : The legitimacy of the Israelite past hinges on finding a piece of evidence to prove the ancient origins of the Bible .
What would be the discovery of a lifetime , starts outside the walls of Jerusalem , in an old cemetery .
GABRIEL BARKAY : We came here and excavated seven of these burial caves .
The burial caves date back to the seventh century B.C. , somewhere around the time of King Josiah .
But the caves were found looted , so we did n't anticipate too much .
NARRATOR : Gabriel Barkay instructed a 13 - year - old volunteer to clean up a tomb for photographs .
GABRIEL BARKAY : Instead of that , he was bored , he was alone , and he had a hammer , and he began banging on the floor .
NARRATOR : But the floor turned out to be a fallen ceiling , and beneath it were some artifacts that had escaped the looters .
Among the hundreds of grave goods , one artifact stood out .
GABRIEL BARKAY :
It looked like a cigarette butt .
It was cylindrical , about an inch in size , about half an inch in diameter , and it was very clear it is made of silver .
It was some kind of a tiny scroll .
NARRATOR : A second , slightly smaller scroll was also found and both were taken to the labs at the Israel Museum .
But unraveling the scrolls to see if they contain a readable inscription could risk destroying them completely .
Andy Vaughn was one of the epigraphers on the project .
ANDREW G. VAUGHN ( American Schools of Oriental Research ) : Archaeology is basically a destructive science .
In order to learn anything , you have to destroy what 's there .
Gabriel Barkay and his team had to make a decision : does one unroll these amulets or does one preserve them ?
They decided that it was worth the risk , and hindsight would tell us that they could not have been more correct .
NARRATOR : Through painstaking conservation , technicians devised a special method for unrolling the scrolls and revealing their contents .
GABRIEL BARKAY : I went over there , and I was amazed to see the whole thing full of very delicately scratched , very shallow characters .
The first word that I could decipher already , on the spot , was YHWH , which is the four - letter , unpronounceable name of God .
NARRATOR : Further investigation revealed more text and a surprisingly familiar prayer , still said in synagogues and churches to this day .
VOICEOVER ( Reading from the Bible " Revised Standard Version , " Numbers 6:24 –26 ) :
May the Lord bless you and keep you ; may the Lord make his face to shine upon you and be gracious to you ; may the Lord lift up his countenance upon you and give you peace .
ANDY VAUGHN : There is no doubt at all that these two amulets contain the Priestly Benediction found in Numbers , 6 .
These inscriptions are thus very important because they are the earliest references we have to the written biblical narratives .
GABRIEL BARKAY :
The archaeological context was very clear , because it was found together with pottery dating back to the seventh century B.C.
Also , the paleography , the shape of letters , points towards somewhere in the seventh century B.C. , beyond any doubt .
NARRATOR : The silver scrolls with the Priestly Benediction predate the earliest Dead Sea Scrolls by 400 years .
It is an amazing find , proving that at least some verses of the Bible were written in ancient times , during the reign of King David 's descendents .
By giving us text from before the Babylonian exile , the silver scrolls confirm that the Hebrew Bible is created from poetry , oral traditions and prayers that go back to the time of Josiah 's D writer and likely beyond , to writers E and J .
As modern scholars suspect , the Torah , the first five books of the Bible , takes its final form during the Babylonian exile .
But dwarfed by the mighty temples and giant statues of Babylonian gods , the Israelites must also confront the fundamental question : why did their God , Yahweh , forsake them ?
MICHAEL COOGAN :
In the ancient world , if your country was destroyed by another country , it meant that their gods were more powerful than your god .
And the natural thing to do is to worship the more powerful god , but the survivors continued to worship Yahweh and struggled to understand how this could have happened .
PETER MACHINIST :
They resort first to a standard form of explanation , which is found elsewhere in the ancient Near East : " We must have done something wrong to incur the wrath of our God . "
WILLIAM DEVER :
It 's out of this that comes the reflection that polytheism was our downfall ; there is , after all , only one God .
NARRATOR : The Israelites abandon the folly of polytheism , monotheism triumphs , and the archaeological evidence proves it .
EPHRAIM STERN ( The Hebrew University of Jerusalem ) :
Before the destruction of the First Temple , wherever we dig , in whatever part of the Judean country , we find sanctuaries , and , more often , we find hundreds and thousands of figurines , even in Jerusalem itself .
NARRATOR : But after the destruction there are none .
EPHRAIM STERN :
We are speaking about thousands before and nothing — completely nothing at all — after .
LEE LEVINE : Monotheism is well - ensconced , firmly ensconced , so something major happened which is very hard to trace .
But that was a searing experience , that time in the exile .
NARRATOR : Through the experience of the exile and writing the Bible , the concept of God , as it is known today , is born .
KYLE MCCARTER :
In a way , P created something that was much greater , because it was greater than any individual land or kingdom .
It was a kind of universal religion based on a creator god , not just a god of a single nation , but the God of the world , the God of the universe .
CAROL MEYERS : This moves
Yahweh into the realm of being a universal deity who has the power to affect what happens in the whole universe .
This makes the god of ancient Israel the universal God of the world that resonates with people — at least in Jewish , Christian and Muslim tradition — to this very day .
NARRATOR : In 539 B.C. , the Babylonian empire is toppled by the Persians .
As written in the Bible , Yahweh , in his new role as the one invisible God , orchestrates a new exodus .
Among one group of returning exiles is the prophet Ezra .
Back in Jerusalem , he gives a public reading of the newly written Torah to reestablish the covenant .
VOICEOVER ( Reading from the Bible " Revised Standard Version , " Nehemiah 8:1–3 ) :
All the people gathered together ... They told the scribe Ezra to bring the book of the law of Moses , which the Lord had given to Israel ... He read from it ... from early morning until midday ... and the ears of all the people were attentive to the book of the law .
ERIC MEYERS : To me , it 's one of the most moving moments in the whole Bible .
Ezra returns with the Bible in his hand , so we have the feeling that the process begun in the exile is finally finished , and Ezra has a copy .
NARRATOR : The scrolls that chronicle the Israelites ' relationship with their god is now the Hebrew Bible , the Old Testament , a sacred text for over three billion people .
Through its writing , an ancient cult becomes a modern religion , and the Israelite deity , Yahweh , transforms into the God of the three great monotheistic religions .
Through its teachings , the Bible established a code of morality and justice , aspirations that resonate through the ages .
More than fact or fiction , at the intersection of science and scriptures , is a story that began over 3,000 years ago and continues to this day .

After more than six months into the pandemic caused by the novel coronavirus , DeKalb Mayor Jerry Smith said the restrictions being placed on DeKalb , the county , and its entire health region is disappointing , but another challenge for bar and restaura …
The idea that the United States is the global hegemon , that we have first dibs on the title of world policemen  indeed , our entire post - WWII foreign policy  is nothing but a delusion .
That is one of the chief lessons of the recent economic downturn , one that , unfortunately , the incoming administration has yet to face up to  and the pundits ( ensconced as they are in the culture of hubris ) have yet to realize .
Delusions die hard .
This poor woman  faced with the dire prospect of having to sell the Palm Beach cottage , and , omigod , lay off Yolanda , the thrice weekly cleaning lady  is just beginning to wake up , albeit with great reluctance .
Along with these people , she will live in a world of reduced expectations .
Our rulers , however , show every sign of inflexibility in the face of the need to change .
For decades , we ’ve been living inside a bubble , here at the epicenter of the imperial metropolis , protected from the dire fate of the rest of the world ’s peoples  who live in poverty , tyranny , and worse  by the productive and political capital amassed by our intrepid ancestors , who built the world ’s most successful ( and freest ) constitutional republic , and , because of that were able to create an enormous amount of wealth .
Both are gone , now , and yet we are still acting as if they ’re intact , like an amputee who feels pain in an arm that no longer is attached to his shoulder .
For example , the New York Times reports that President - elect Barack Obama is already backpedaling on his pledge to get our troops out of Iraq in sixteen months  yet how does he imagine we ’ll have the means to keep them there even that long ?
The Times tells us that “ the officials made clear that the withdrawal of all combat forces under the generals ’ recommendations would not come until some time after May 2010 , Mr. Obama ’s target . ”
But by that time the Chinese will have long since stopped lending us the money to pay for it all .
President Obama is pledged to launch an Afghan “ surge ” that will dwarf our continuing efforts in Iraq  but how will we pay for it ?
He and his surrogates pontificate on the need to “ reconstruct ” Afghanistan , when he ’ll be hard - pressed to reconstruct the economy in the wake of a devastating deflation .
Our present military budget is more than all the other nations on earth combined , an inconceivable sum that drains the very lifeblood out of our economy .
Weapons are not capital assets .
The productive energy used to produce them is captured and frozen in time , until the weapon is either used , or junked as outdated : in either case it vanishes .
Ever since the end of the second great crusade on behalf of “ democracy , ” and the beginning of the cold war , we ’ve literally been incinerating a good percentage of the national income on the altar of the war god .
How long can we keep this up ?
America is like a formerly grand billionaire , living on a palatial estate that could be foreclosed any day now , blithely carrying on in the same old extravagant way in order to keep up appearances .
Foreclosure day is coming , however , and when our friends and former allies show up on the courthouse steps with their insultingly low bids , you can bet the smell of schadenfreude will be thick in the air .
Deflation is the great enemy of the moment , and “ reflation ” is the catchphrase of the day , the magical incantation that will set us on the path to recapturing our former glory .
Yet the words themselves contain key clues to unlocking the mystery of our predicament : inflation , after all , projects the image of something stretched almost beyond its natural limits , while deflation implies a return to normalcy .
Normalcy , however , is the last thing our leaders want : a crisis is so much more exciting .
As Rahm Emanuel , the new regime ’s chief enforcer put it : “ You never want a serious crisis to go to waste . ”
The bravado of the doomed makes for some good lines , to be sure , a rich source for a compendium of Famous Last Words .
The problem for Emanuel , and indeed for the American political class of whichever party , is that the rising economic crisis roiling world markets gives every indication of having the potential to waste them .
Blinded by hubris , however , our leaders are sleepwalking over a cliff , and the fall is likely to be long and terrifying .
How long after we hit bottom , in a decade or so , the country will begin to recover is anyone ’s guess , but I can tell you this : the delusions of this ruling class will endure to the very end .
The inhabitants of Washington , D.C. , are incapable of realizing that the bubble of Empire has really popped , or can ever pop .
They are like drug addicts who have imbibed so much of their poison of choice that their physiology has been permanently altered : they ’re always and forever high .
For sixty - some years we ’ve been high on the delusion of our God - given omnipotence and inherent goodness , convinced we can and should right every wrong , police every border ( but our own ) , and fulfill our alleged destiny as the Promethean light - bearer of the world .
This is mental and moral inflation , which was certainly encouraged by the monetary phenomenon : these absurdly inflated goals were financed by imaginary wealth , a good proportion of which has already disappeared .
The task of reflation , which the incoming government has set for itself , involves much more than merely printing lots of paper money , and spending it like crazy : it means maintaining the inflationary mindset , the inflated goals , the inflated rhetoric , and , most of all , the inflated military budget that supposedly ensures our role as the world ’s last and only superpower .
As the Obama crowd searches for ways in which to reflate the economy , the “ stimulus ” of military spending is bound to play a major role .
For a long time , people have been asking “ what does America make anymore ? ”
The old core industries  steel , cars , consumer goods  have long since decayed , and the vaunted “ service ” sector is undergoing a massive contraction .
What ’s left ?
Well , we do make one thing in large quantities , that no other country makes , and that is decisions about the fate of the rest of the world .
Due to our military power , our self - appointed role as the world ’s policeman has carved us out a specialized niche in the international division of labor .
The great problem with this evolutionary path is that it can only end in one of two ways : the international extension of the American nation - state until it covers the globe , or extinction .
Having preemptively taken up the responsibilities and costs of a world hegemon , yet without the authority to enjoy all the prerogatives of a real World State , including global taxation , this path can only end in bankruptcy .
As indeed it has .
NOTES IN THE MARGIN
I also want to mention a radio interview I recently did with our very own Scott Horton , the real star of Antiwar.com , which came out pretty good ( which means I managed to have at least two cups of coffee and lunch before opening up my mouth to speak ) .
The theme is globalism , regionalism , and the future of resistance to growing State power .
The discussion kind of takes off where this column leaves off , as Scott and I discuss recent proposals that seriously raise the issue of a world government .
Speaking of Scott , I highly recommend his recent interview with Katrina van den Heuvel , editor of The Nation , in which the latter opines that , far from resembling JFK , or Lincoln , our President - elect may turn into another LBJ .
Fascinating stuff , with both Scott and Katrina drawing each other out and creating an interesting left - right synthesis as they analyze recent events overseas .
I have a new article coming up in The American Conservative , on the Blagojevich scandal , and the return of Fitzmas .
That is hard on the heels of the last one , which was all about Garet Garrett and his astonishing relevance to our present economic predicament .
Do n’t you think it ’s time you subscribed ?
Tom Piatak has a very kind review of my recently reissued book , Reclaiming the American Right : The Lost Legacy of the Conservative Movement , in the current issue of Chronicles , which is illustrated by a wonderfully dated photo of the author : yes , I was rather good - looking , was n’t I ?
* Sigh *
Speaking of Chronicles , I ’ve got a piece in there on Obama as the New Lincoln , as well as a little polemic that raises the intriguing question : did McCain throw the election ?
To find out the answer to this , and more , check out the next issue , which I believe comes out in February , or , better yet , go here to subscribe .
This Week 's Theme : Trends That Will Stick Happiness Remains Possible ( November 20 , 2008 )
Today 's " trend that will stick " : happiness remains possible .
I know , I know , spare me the load of New Age crap spouted by wealthy gurus like Kapok Dopra .
OK , done .
But nonetheless happiness is possible for just about everyone not on their deathbed , or suffering from a severe untreated mental illness , or in the sharp terrible grip of grief ( loss of a loved one ) or in pain only morphine can ease .
That leaves most of us .
The word happiness , like the word love , is inadequate to the task assigned it .
These words encompass too much to describe much of anything .
Perhaps an analogy would be if we only had the one word " taste " and no words for salty , pungent , sour , bitter , sweet , savory , meaty , rancid , etc .
All questions about taste would be reduced to " yes " or " no " answers which essentially say nothing about the various flavors of food .
The word " happiness " carries the same limitations and the same reduction to nonsense .
One aspect of language which has always fascinated me is words which are unique to specific languages .
Ideally , a word is a symbol or " shorthand " representing an object or an idea which is at heart a complex of thought and / or emotion we grasp without much explanation .
Some languages contrived words to express complex emotions which are universal to humanity , while others find that linguistic cupboard bare .
For example , the Japanese word aware ( ah - wa- ray ) has no English analog - - not even close , though " nostalgia " is in the general direction .
Since I am not a native speaker of Japanese , I do n't fully trust my own sense of the word , which is something like a bittersweet awareness of the passage of time .
I think it a very Japanese word in the sense that this feeling , while universal to humanity , is keenly felt in Japanese culture .
In English , we are left groping for this special sense of the tinge of sadness inherent in the passage of time ; nostalgia veers too close to mauldin " ah , the good old days " smoothing of memory .
And so a complex of ideas and emotions which are captured in one single word in Japanese requires a paragraph of words in English .
Which brings us to schadenfreude , the happiness felt in the losses or defeat of one 's rivals or enemies .
It 's not a warm and fuzzy happiness ( as in , " happiness is a warm puppy " ) , but it is nonetheless an instinctual , universal slice of happiness .
Who says happiness is n't possible when rivals and enemies are suffering stupendous losses every day ?
( Take that , Kapok Dopra !
Yes indeed , happiness is not only possible , it 's enjoyable . )
I hope you detected that this is written with tongue firmly in cheek .
( Such a great phrase , and so entirely meaningless when literally translated . )
The point is that happiness comes in many flavors , however you slice and dice it : Psychologist Paul Ekman divides happiness into 16 emotions , including personality traits such as optimism and cheerfulness , the state of mania , moods of euphoria and contentment , sensory pleasures such as visual , gustatory and auditory ( his personal favorite ) and three states of mind with no English translation - schadenfreude ( German for feeling good about the pain of your enemies ) , nachas ( Yiddish for joy at an offspring 's accomplishments ) and fiero ( Italian for what you feel when you 've met a challenge ) .
" I believe we can understand life a lot better if we make distinctions , not by just saying , ' I 'm not happy , ' " he said .
" If it was up to me , I 'd abolish the term happiness and use these terms so we'd know what we 're talking about .
You could have organized the meeting so you 'd have a panel on each kind of happiness . "
We tend to think of happiness as some point - in - time sensation or celebration , but some sorts of happiness are more akin to well - being ; others are a priori shared with others : Dacher Keltner , a psychology professor at UC Berkeley who heads the university 's Greater Good Science Center , discusses evidence that compassion and kindness are traits biologically programmed into humans .
" I think we have a deep and rich legacy in Western thought that suggests we are competitive and aggressive and only out for No. 1 , " said Keltner .
" But all the research I do in my lab ( shows ) that we are designed to care and play and be concerned about the welfare of others . "
( From the S.F. Chronicle article Happiness and Its Causes :
It would be hard to find a better time to talk about happiness , something you can't buy even if you still have good credit . )
So let 's work Ekman 's insight a bit .
How many happinesses can you count ?
Just riffing off Ekman 's list : 1 . The happiness of fullness of belly .
2 . The happiness of listening to a favorite song once again .
3 . The happiness of overcoming sloth and / or procrastination .
4 . The happiness of mastering a new tune , skill , trick , etc. 5 . The happiness of removing a rock beneath your sleeping bag .
6 . The happiness of rigorous exercise completed .
7 . The happiness of coasting downhill on a bicycle .
8 . The happiness of helping a child or teen finish their homework , but without actually doing it for them .
9 . The happiness of a child or teen asking you to accompany them .
10 .
The happiness of not needlessly worrying your aged parents with your own difficulties .
11 . The happiness of changing the oil in your vehicle without losing the oil plug or skinning your knuckles .
12 . The happiness of finding you 're not too badly injured after a wipeout / accident .
13 .
The happiness of a new recipe turning out even better than expected .
14 .
The happiness of feeding hungry kids something healthy and tasty .
15 . The happiness of hopskotch .
16 .
The happiness of an improvisation that works / flows to your satisfaction .
17 .
The happiness of opening a book you 've wanted to read for some time .
18 .
The happiness of realizing the pain in your back is a little less today .
19 .
The happiness of new shoots rising from the seeds you planted .
20 .
The happiness of acquiring a new object of ownership .
I do not begrudge the happiness of # 20 , as it is the sole foundation of a consumer economy : the happiness of acquiring some new object or purchased " experience . "
But I also listed 19 other happinesses which required no acquisition of new material objects or shopping per se , though there needs to be healthy food in the house to feed the kids , and a bicycle to ride down hill , etc .
But used bicycles cost less than a month 's cable TV charges , and food is far less costly than it is in other countries .
And there 's food stamps if you 're in dire straits .
A reader ( Lari ) on sfgate.com ( S.F. Chronicle site ) left this message which should resonate with anyone pondering the various flavors and sources of " happiness " :
There 's a Carlos Castaneda quote I read once that has become my touchstone during bad times : " Death is the only wise adviser that we have .
Whenever you feel that everything is going wrong and you 're about to be annihilated , turn to your death and ask if that is so .
Your death will tell you that you 're wrong , that nothing really matters outside his touch .
Your death will tell you , ' I have n't touched you yet ' . "
I learned this lesson particularly after 9 - 11 .
As a native New Yorker , the twin towers represented so much to me - including the location of my first job .
Two friends died in those towers that day and two cousins barely escaped alive .
Not a day goes by that I do n't think about people who died that day - I could be standing in a long line , worried about bills , my job , but then I just stop and breathe in , so grateful that I can still do so .
One last small happiness : 21 .
Finding a phrase that makes a new kind of sense .
For instance :
Where there is ruin , there is hope for treasures .

The Wall Street ...
Two New Zealand men have been convicted of murdering a three - year old girl , after months of torturing the child .
Wiremu Curtis , 19 , and his brother Michael , 22 , face life sentences for the murder of Nia Glassie .
Nia died of brain injuries in hospital on 3 August 2007 , two weeks after suffering fatal kicks to her head .
The judge in the four - week trial , Judith Potter , wept as she delivered the sentence and thanked similarly shaken jurors for coping with the case .
That they did n't speak out in time is something family members and neighbours will have to live with
Cindy Kiro
Children 's commissioner Nia 's mother , Lisa Kuka , 35 , who was in a relationship with Wiremu Curtis , was found guilty of manslaughter for failing to protect her child .
Nia 's cousin Michael Pearson , 20 , and Michael Curtis 's partner Oriwa Kemp , 18 , were found not guilty of manslaughter but were found guilty of child cruelty charges in the complex case .
New Zealand 's Children 's Commissioner Cindy Kiro told local media that there had been some consolation for the toddler 's tragic death in the fact that justice had been served .
Catalogue of abuse
The court heard details of horrific abuse inflicted on the three - year old : • She had been kicked , beaten , slapped , jumped on and held over a burning fire •
She had been put into a clothes dryer spinning at top heat •
Wrestling moves copied from a computer game had been practised on her •
She had been folded into a sofa and sat on , shoved into piles of rubbish , dragged through a sandpit half naked , flung against a wall and dropped from a height onto the floor •
And she had been whirled rapidly on an outdoor rotary clothes line until she was thrown off .
At one point , she was left lying unconscious for 36 hours without medical attention .
' Wider guilt '
Neighbours who saw some of the abuse have told reporters they will live with the guilt of not having informed the authorities sooner .
Court officials said they had been shocked at how some witnesses found the level of violence in the home to be normal .
Prosecutor Fletcher Pilditch said investigators could find no obvious motive for the abuse other than bullying .
" She was bullied in the worst kind of way .
She was singled out , for what reason we do not know , " he said .
" Both family members and neighbours were aware of the neglect and abuse Nia was subject to , " Children 's Commissioner Ms Kiro said in a statement .
" That they did n't speak out in time is something they will have to live with . "

LOS ANGELES ( Reuters ) -
The sun ’s winds are less blustery than they used to be , NASA said on Tuesday , revealing data from a solar probe that promises new insights about Earth ’s local star but poses few if any consequences for humans -- unless you ’re an astronaut .
An illustration shows the heliosphere created by solar winds depicted as a bubble surrounding the solar system .
Measurements from the spacecraft Ulysses show the wind 's pressure has dropped 20 percent since the mid-1990s .
As the solar wind weakens , the heliosphere is expected to dwindle in size and strength as well , allowing more cosmic radiation -- super high - energy electrons and protons zipping through interstellar space -- to reach the inner solar system .

The data show the solar wind , a steady stream of charged sub-atomic particles emitted by the sun and blowing at 1 million mph ( 1.6 million kph ) , has dwindled to its lowest level in at least 50 years , reducing its strength as a shield against potentially harmful galactic cosmic radiation .
The solar wind inflates a massive protective bubble , called the heliosphere , around the solar system .
But measurements from the spacecraft Ulysses show the wind ’s pressure has dropped 20 percent since the mid-1990s .
At the same time , the electron temperature of the solar wind has declined 13 percent .
As the solar wind weakens , the heliosphere is expected to dwindle in size and strength as well , allowing more cosmic radiation -- super high - energy electrons and protons zipping through interstellar space -- to reach the inner solar system .
Scientists studying the phenomenon insist Earth ’s inhabitants have nothing to fear .
Humans remain protected from cosmic rays by virtue of the magnetic field that surrounds Earth , acting as an inner barrier to our exposure .
A diminished solar wind and corresponding rise in cosmic rays are of concern , however , to astronauts who venture beyond Earth orbit to the moon , Mars or beyond , and to engineers who design trans - orbital spacecraft .
The biggest implications , however , are scientific ones .
Researchers say the findings open the door to a greater understanding of the sun and heliosphere by altering solar conditions in a way that allows scientists to conduct new comparative studies .
“ The heliosphere is our laboratory , ” said Nancy Crooker , a research professor at Boston University , in a conference call with reporters .
“ We know the sun has been this cool , this inactive before , but that was prior to the space age .
So we did n’t have actual physical measurements until now of such periods . ”
Ed Smith , NASA ’s project scientist for Ulysses , said , “ It ’s an opportunity for us to study changes in the sun which will give us newer insights into the origin of the solar wind and its relation to the solar magnetic field . ”
The weakening solar wind differs from the 11 - year cycles of solar activity associated with such phenomena as sun spots and solar flares that can cause disruptions of electric power grids and radio transmissions on Earth , as well as auroral displays .
However , Dave McComas , a principal Ulysses investigator from the Southwest Research Institute in San Antonio , Texas , said continued diminishment of solar winds could dampen the impact of the next peak in other solar disturbances .
Ulysses , a joint project of NASA and the European Space Agency , was launched from the space shuttle Discovery in 1990 and became the first probe to fly around the sun ’s poles .
After more than 17 years , the spacecraft named for the hero of “ The Odyssey ” has exceeded its original mission lifetime nearly fourfold but is expected to finally wind down in a month or two , scientists said .

Fractal Basics
They 're odd - looking shapes you may never have heard of , but they 're everywhere around you — the jagged repeating forms called fractals .
If you know what to look for , you can find them in the clouds , in mountains , even inside the human body .

Last September , I was in a hotel room watching CNBC early one morning .
They were interviewing Bob Nardelli , the C.E.O. of Chrysler , and he was explaining why the auto industry , at that time , needed $ 25 billion in loan guarantees .
It was n’t a bailout , he said .
It was a way to enable the car companies to retool for innovation .
I could not help but shout back at the TV screen : “ We have to subsidize Detroit so that it will innovate ?
What business were you people in other than innovation ? ”
If we give you another $ 25 billion , will you also do accounting ?
How could these companies be so bad for so long ?
Clearly the combination of a very un-innovative business culture , visionless management and overly generous labor contracts explains a lot of it .
It led to a situation whereby General Motors could make money only by selling big , gas - guzzling S.U.V.’s and trucks .
Therefore , instead of focusing on making money by innovating around fuel efficiency , productivity and design , G.M. threw way too much energy into lobbying and maneuvering to protect its gas guzzlers .
This included striking special deals with Congress that allowed the Detroit automakers to count the mileage of gas guzzlers as being more than they really were  provided they made some cars flex - fuel capable for ethanol .
It included special offers of $ 1.99 - a - gallon gasoline for a year to any customer who purchased a gas guzzler .
And it included endless lobbying to block Congress from raising the miles - per - gallon requirements .
The result was an industry that became brain dead .
Nothing typified this more than statements like those of Bob Lutz , G.M. ’s vice chairman .
He has been quoted as saying that hybrids like the Toyota Prius “ make no economic sense . ”
And , in February , D Magazine of Dallas quoted him as saying that global warming “ is a total crock of [ expletive ] . ”
Strauss - Kahn said rich nations had so far failed to restore confidence
The world financial system is teetering on the " brink of systemic meltdown " , the head of the International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) has warned in Washington .
Dominique Strauss - Kahn said rich nations had so far failed to restore confidence , but he endorsed a new action plan by the G7 group .
He also said the IMF was ready to lend to countries in dire need of capital .
The 15 eurozone leaders will meet in Paris later to try to establish a common approach to the markets crisis .
French President Nicolas Sarkozy and German Chancellor Angela Merkel said they would present a number of proposals at the summit to ease the credit freeze that has caused the collapse of several leading international banks .
But after meeting in Paris on Saturday , the two leaders said the summit would not result in a joint financial rescue fund for Europe , in the model of a $ 700 bn rescue by the US government .
French Economy Minister Christine Lagarde said the eurozone leaders would discuss the possibility of guaranteeing interbank lending and put " meat " on the " skeleton " of a five - point plan by the G7 group of most industrialised nations to resolve the crisis .
Intensifying concerns Mr Strauss - Kahn was speaking in Washington after talks with US President George W Bush , G7 finance ministers and the World Bank .
Earlier , G7 ministers had released the five - point plan to free up the flow of credit , back efforts by banks to raise money and revive the mortgage market .

" Intensifying solvency concerns about a number of the largest US - based and European financial institutions have pushed the global financial system to the brink of systemic meltdown , " said Mr Strauss - Kahn .
He later told a news conference : " The first co-ordination between advanced countries and the rest of the world is now on track . "
The IMF chief 's strong words reflect a belief that the global financial crisis can be contained , says the BBC 's economics correspondent Andrew Walker in Washington .
Mr Strauss - Kahn was joined at the White House by finance ministers from the US , Canada , France , Germany , Britain , Italy and Japan , as well as World Bank President Robert Zoellick .
Following talks with the economic leaders , Mr Bush also pledged co-ordinated action , saying it was serious global crisis which demanded a serious global response .
Panic selling
The meeting came a day after Asian , European and US markets continued to panic sell despite rate cuts and cash injections by central banks , amid widespread fears of a global recession .
Late on Friday , US Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson said the US planned to invest directly in banks for the first since the 1930s , following a similar UK programme of partial bank nationalisation .

Timeline : Global credit crunch
The G7 had earlier not ruled out adopting another part of the British plan - to guarantee borrowing between banks - as they issued their plan in Washington .
The G7 also left the door open to further reductions in interest rates , which six central banks this week jointly cut by half a percentage point .
But our correspondent says there is some disappointment that the G7 plan lacks detail .
Ahead of the emergency summit of eurozone leaders , UK Prime Minister Gordon Brown will hold talks with Mr Sarkozy .
Chancellor Merkel said governments must " redirect the markets so they serve the people , and not ruin them " .
The heads of the EU 's four biggest economies - Britain , France , Germany and Italy - held a first crisis summit last week , but were split over the need for a common plan .
Analysts say another week of plunging stock markets has focused minds and the real test of this weekend 's scramble by world leaders to shore up the international financial system will come once markets reopen again on Monday .

When someone gains unauthorized access to your bank account , the act is a form of identity theft .
The Electronic Fund Transfer Act ( EFTA ) provides you with some protection from bank account fraud , but it 's limited .
If you believe that an identity thief has access to your debit card or checking information , you must take action immediately .﻿﻿
Your bank may call actions relating to account identity theft unauthorized withdrawals , account fraud , or even true - name fraud .
Whatever language is used , you need to know what to do and how you 're protected .
The Basics of the Electronic Fund Transfer Act
The EFTA provides banks with some guidelines on how to resolve disputes possibly related to identity theft .
However , the onus is on you , the account holder , to recognize unauthorized transactions on your account .
If you notice an error , report it immediately .
If you wait , you could be out of luck .
According to the EFTA , you have 60 days to report an unauthorized transaction to your financial institution .
If you report after that , than the bank is n't required to conduct an investigation . ﻿﻿
To catch bank account identity fraud sooner rather than later , make a habit of reconciling your bank account each month when you receive your bank statement .
If you have numerous deposit and debit transactions , reconciling your account twice a month could be a wise habit .
Information Your Bank Needs to Investigate the Crime
To begin investigating your claim , you must provide certain information to your bank .
The following details are helpful in determining the steps the bank needs to take to resolve your dispute , based on EFTA rules :
Your name and account number
Why you think there is an error
The amount of the error
The date for the error
Many banks request that you provide this information in writing no later than 10 days after you initiate a dispute .﻿﻿
If the account has been active for more than 30 days , the bank will do an investigation and get back to you within 10 days .
If a bank needs more time , it can take up to 45 days but will credit the funds back to your account while it investigates .
The bank should inform you if the investigation will take longer than normal .
If the account is less than 30 days old or you ’re disputing point - of - sale or foreign transactions , it may take up to 20 days to apply the temporary credit to your account .
It also may take up to 90 days to finish the investigation .﻿﻿
Authorized Users vs. Unauthorized Charges
If the bank 's investigation does n’t support your claims , it will notify you in writing and take the credits back from your account .
One reason it may not support your claim is excessive use by an authorized user .﻿﻿
For example , if you let your son use your card , and he spends more than you told him he could , the bank wo n't consider that an identity theft because you gave him permission to use the card .
Former foreign affairs minister Maxime Bernier frequently bad - mouthed Prime Minister Stephen Harper and once asked his girlfriend to dispose of confidential NATO briefing papers on trash day , Julie Couillard writes in her highly anticipated autobiography .
Julie Couillard and Maxime Bernier are seen arriving at Rideau Hall in Ottawa for the swearing - in of Prime Minister Stephen Harper 's cabinet in August 2007 .
(( Paul Chiasson / Canadian Press ) )
Couillard 's book , My Story , released to the CBC and other media organizations ahead of its arrival at bookstores on Monday , portrays Bernier as a narcissistic womanizer who expressed disgust at Harper 's eating habits and viewed Quebec 's independence as an acceptable inevitability .
" Of course , it [ independence ] does n't frighten me at all , that 's where we 're headed .
It 's obvious , " the book quotes Bernier as telling Couillard during a dinner at a downtown Montreal restaurant within hearing range of other patrons .
" And I have no problem with that .
I 'm ready .
I 'm expecting that . "
Couillard 's book has already sparked intense interest in Quebec and is bound to add fresh controversy for the Conservatives ahead of the Oct. 14 federal election on the day of the party leaders '
French - language debates in Ottawa .
In her book , Couillard writes that Bernier , a star candidate for the Conservatives in Quebec who was given the foreign affairs portfolio by Harper in 2007 , was personally opposed to sending Canadian troops to Afghanistan and often fought with the Prime Minister 's Office over Harper 's " dictator " style of leadership .
At one point , she writes , Bernier became convinced that Harper would not survive a first term as prime minister , and envisioned himself as winning a leadership convention before the next election was called .
When she agreed to be his girlfriend for at least a year , she writes , Bernier told her it would put to rest rumours circling around Parliament
Hill that he was gay because he had been single for two years and was friends with an openly gay cabinet minister .
Book describes past relationships with bikers
The book ranges from Couillard 's modest upbringing in Montreal to her careers in modelling and real estate before delving into her romantic life .
Julie Couillard poses with her book on Wednesday in Montreal .
She said in the book that Maxime Bernier had visions of replacing Stephen Harper as Conservative leader .
(( Paul Chiasson / Canadian Press ) )
Couillard details her past relationships with Gilles Giguère , a well - known Montreal crime figure who was gunned down in 1996 after becoming a police informer , as well as a turbulent two - year marriage to Stéphane Sirois , who admitted to being an enforcer for the Rockers , a Hells Angels puppet club .
She describes the " sheer hell " of hiding in her house for three days straight amid the media storm sparked when her past ties with the men came to light amid intense public scrutiny of her recently ended relationship with a cabinet member .
Couillard also contends that Bernier , an active runner , was constantly concerned about his own physical appearance , and frequently criticized the physical shape of his boss , complaining that Harper had a paunch , ate badly and constantly drank Pepsi .
" I remember saying to him , ' Is he your wife , or your boss ? ' " she writes .
Couillard also writes that Bernier showed a " surprising degree of intellectual laziness " for a politician in his position and also mocked his constituents in Quebec 's Beauce region .
She ' wants glory and visibility ' : Bernier
Bernier resigned from cabinet in May only hours before Couillard described in a television interview how he had left classified briefing documents for a NATO summit at her Montreal home .
The two had recently ended their relationship .
In an interview with a local radio station in his home riding on Wednesday , Bernier dismissed Couillard 's allegations as " gossipy delusions , " saying his former girlfriend was only interested in increasing book sales .
" That woman 's intention is to personally harm me personally in my campaign in the Beauce , and to harm my relationship with my leader , " he said .
Bernier said Couillard is " presently under RCMP investigation , " citing a recent report by the Globe and Mail that said the Mounties were continuing their probe surrounding Couillard and the documents , as well as allegations Couillard lobbied Conservative officials on a federal land deal .
He noted she has said in the past she believed someone had placed microphone listening devices under her bed .
" People have realized she 's a woman who is frustrated , who wants glory and visibility , " he said .
" I made the error of going out with her . "
He denied ever ridiculing his constituents and said he would not suspend campaign appearances in his riding or hesitate from lending a hand to his fellow Conservative candidates .
" People know me , I am very proud to be from the Beauce , " Bernier said .
" I 've said it everywhere I 've travelled internationally , whether it 's Saskatoon , in Canada , or in Paris , France .
I 've always defended Beauce values . "
In the book , Couillard writes that Bernier did not own a laptop computer , which led him to always have bundles of papers with him , including the documents she alleges he left at her home and asked her to throw in her garbage bin .
" I could have wallpapered my house in confidential documents , " she writes , while adding Bernier treated her home as a second office .
She also alleges Bernier offered to put her name forward to work as an Immigration and Refugee Board commissioner , and then gave her filled - out application form to Immigration Minister Diane Finley .
A few weeks later , she alleges , he told her he thought it would be best if they no longer saw each other in public because she was applying for a federal position and " people will talk . "

What if there were a run on a bank and no one knew ?
In recent days some U.S. media have focused on a “ silent run ” on the deposits of Wachovia bank , which is now being taken over , after a bailout plan stalled and its rival Washington Mutual was seized .
Customers withdraw money from ATMs inside a Wachovia branch in New York , October 6 , 2008 .
REUTERS / Lucas Jackson
Commentators including Nouriel Roubini , Professor of Economics at New York University ’s Stern School of Business , have highlighted the scope for quiet withdrawals by depositors whose assets exceed guaranteed levels .
But in Europe , another high - profile banking failure has drawn attention to a different 21st - century phenomenon : as homes and businesses increasingly manage their finances online , mass withdrawals may be invisible .
Fortis , focus of a cross - border rescue last week , was also in part the victim of a silent bank run , which along with a dramatic fall in its stock prompted Benelux governments to step in and inject cash into the banking and insurance group .
“ If Fortis were in trouble , I would transfer my money over the internet to my parents ’ account , ” student Frederique Schilte said outside an Amsterdam branch , where she had gone to drop off a bill payment .
In the Great Depression between 1929 and 1933 , much of the damage was caused by runs on banks that gained momentum as people saw lines of customers waiting to salvage cash .
In Fortis ’s case , much of the outflow came at the click of a mouse .
Fortis said it had lost about 3 percent of its deposits since the beginning of this year , both from consumer and business clients , or about 5 billion euros ( $ 7 billion ) .
Dutch Finance Minister Wouter Bos noted Fortis had trouble keeping corporate clients and was faced with “ increasing liquidity problems in the banking activities . ”
“ Big amounts were withdrawn by private and business clients , particularly in Belgium , ” said Tilburg University Professor Sylvester Eijffinger , who is also an economic policy adviser to the Dutch parliament .
“ The capital supplied ( by Benelux governments ) was gone and they had to act quickly . ”
The intervention seemed this week to have worked .
“ We were worried last week , but now that it is now part of the Dutch government , we are staying with Fortis , ” said a Dutch customer who declined to give her name but said she and her husband have been Fortis customers for 28 years .
SPEED AND VOLUME
Britain ’s Northern Rock , which last September suffered the first run on the deposits of a major British bank for more than 140 years , saw customers line up over three days at branches when confidence evaporated , creating scenes that one politician said made Britain looked like “ a banana republic . ”
But branch withdrawals slowed after the government guaranteed savings .
The major damage was done by withdrawals by internet , postal and telephone customers .
Almost 14 billion pounds ( $ 25 billion ) of savings were withdrawn from Northern Rock from the start of the panic until the end of 2007 , more than half its retail deposits .
About one - third of the cash pulled out was at branches , but the remaining two - thirds , or almost 10 billion pounds , was taken out by non -branch customers .
Whether visible or not , the psychology is the same : Barbara Williams , a retired customer of Northern Rock , was one of hundreds who stood in line outside its branches last year .
“ I did n’t initially panic but the more you watch the news and read you think maybe we ought to do it as well , ” she told Reuters at the time .
“ We thought we would do what everyone else is doing .
Rightly or wrongly it ’s a chance you ca n’t take . ”
The online run may spare banks the damage of customers flooding branches to pull out cash : but funds can be moved even quicker and in far larger quantities with the click of a mouse or a telephone call .
This is one of the concerns behind recent scrambles by governments in Europe to increase depositor sums under guarantee .
Ireland and Denmark have offered blanket guarantees to savers , and pressure is mounting on others to follow .
Ironically , it was another Dutch bank , ING , that pioneered the growth of online banking by launching ING Direct over a decade ago : amassing 192 billion euros in savings and current account deposits , it is now the world ’s 12th largest .
ING Direct operates without physical branches ; customers open and manage their accounts via the phone or Web .
It is not active in its home markets because of its existing retail network , and has instead built a business network in North America , Europe and Australia .
Banks have always lent more than their clients hold on deposit , leaving the risk that none would have enough cash to pay out if they all turned up at once .
Back in the 1930s , depositors faced losing all their money if a bank collapsed .
Attilio Vianello , now 98 , remembers how in the 1930s he had just started a job at Credito Veneto , a small bank based in Padoa , Italy , as the crisis spread beyond Wall Street to Europe .
“ Banks were going bust from one day to another and the vast majority of people did not manage to rescue their savings because once they knew , it was too late .
They would find the doors already shut , ” he recalled .
The electronic equivalent of this would be a server failure , or a Web site shutdown .
But executives point out that in any silent run -- made possible by electronic money transfer whether through the internet or wholesale networks -- the most damaging aspect is the speed at which business customers can move .
“ The so - called silent run on the bank -- it ’s real , ” Carlos Evans , Wachovia ’s wholesale banking executive , was quoted as saying in the Kansas City Star newspaper .
He said withdrawals started picking up on September 26 and over subsequent days .
“ You go from being weakened to in trouble in a matter of days .
I do n’t think people understand how quickly events unfolded , ” he said .
Confidence can return , but often only after dramatic state intervention .
Now state - owned , Northern Rock recently had to close to new savers after attracting about 6 billion pounds this year from customers drawn by government guarantees .
Imagine a magnetically - bound tube of hot gas , 12,000 - miles long and a hundred miles wide , moving at 30,000 miles per hour :
That 's what you 're looking at in the picture above , in the highest - resolution image to date of solar phenomena known as spicules .
Tens of thousands of spicules are active at any given moment , created through a complex interaction of sound waves and magnetic fields , shooting upwards and outwards before falling back into the sun minutes later .
They compose the chronosphere , an atmospheric layer that surrounds the sun and is as thick as the Earth 's diameter .
Most of our own atmosphere is compressed into a layer about seven miles deep .
It 's sometimes easy – for me , anyways – to forget that the sun is 93 million miles away , and that Earthly life exists through the coincidental good fortune of our planetary rock 's location , neither too far nor too close to that ball of gas .

DEA complicit in drug trade , says Morales Agence France - Presse
Published : Thursday November 6 , 2008
Print This Email This Morales says evidence will be presented to President Obama
Bolivian leader Evo Morales on Thursday accused the US government of encouraging drug - trafficking as he explained his decision to banish the US Drug Enforcement Administration ( DEA ) .
Morales , a staunch opponent of the Washington government , said the staff from the US agency had three months to prepare to leave the country , because " the DEA did not respect the police , or even the ( Bolivian ) armed forces . "
" The worst thing is , it did not fight drug trafficking ;
It encouraged it , " the Bolivian leader said , adding that he had " quite a bit of evidence " backing up his charges .
Presidential Minister Juan Ramon Quintana presented a series of documents and press clippings at a news conference , which he described as " object data " that had influenced Morales ' decision to suspend DEA activities last week .
Quintana said Morales was ready to present the evidence to incoming US president Barack Obama " to prove the illegality , abuse and arrogance of the DEA in Bolivia . "
Throughout the 1990s , the DEA in Bolivia " bribed police officers , violated human rights , covered up murders , destroyed bridges and roads , " said Quintana .
Morales earlier Thursday said that after a 1986 operation in Huanchaca National Park , it was determined that the largest cocaine processing plant " was under DEA protection . "
He also charged that the DEA had investigated political and union leaders opposed to neoliberal economic policies , which he said amounted to political persecution .
On Wednesday , he had accused the DEA of shooting and killing Bolivians during their anti-drug operations , including members of the coca farmers ' movement .
Morales , Bolivia 's first indigenous president , has served as the leader of the Bolivian coca - growers union .
The coca plant , from which cocaine is derived , has many uses in traditional Andean culture .
The Bolivian leader announced last Saturday he was suspending the work of the DEA in the impoverished Andean nation , and accused it of having encouraged political unrest that killed 19 people in September .
" From today all the activities of the US DEA are suspended indefinitely , " the Bolivian leader had said in the coca - growing region of Chimore , in the central province of Chapare , where he was evaluating efforts to combat drug trafficking .
The DEA has denied Morales ' accusations .
US President George W. Bush , in a finding released in September , added Bolivia to a list of countries that have " failed demonstrably " in anti-drugs cooperation .
Remember the guy in high school who drove the clapped - out rat rod that looked like hell but went like stink ?
Everyone made fun of his rust bucket , but only because they were jealous that he got to drive it while they could only look at it .
We imagine he's the guy who would buy the Galpin Auto Sports Scythe if he hit the lottery .
We 're sure Beau Boeckmann 's crew at GAS were specifically commissioned to build a vehicle with two steering wheels , 1,005 horsepower and a face like a cicada .
We can't imagine any other reason an ordinarily top - tier custom shop would create such so hideous a monster .
After all , these are the folks who bring you the custom - for - custom 's sake reinterpretations seen on Pimp My Ride .
" With Scythe , we set out to showcase all of our unique fabrication abilities here at GAS , " Boeckmann said in press release .
" From the handmade composite body and voice - activated on - board computer system to the twin - supercharged 1,005 horsepower engine , this car was built to make a statement . "
That statement is " We turned a 2008 Mustang GT convertible into a 1994 Hot Wheels reject . "
Boechmann unveiled the Scythe at a big charity event that featured more B- , C - and D - List celebs than an episode of I Love the 90's .
Heck , even Mark McGrath and Scott Baio were there .
We hope proceeds went to the AMC Gremlin Memorial Foundation for Terminally Unattractive Cars .
Beyond not having to look at the exterior of the car , the driver of the Scythe will find pleasantries like a voice - activated Shuttle XPC computer that , connected to a 3 - G network , provides real - time traffic , news and weather updates .
Flush - mounted exterior security cameras will capture the horrified stares of passersby and the howls of crying children losing control of their bodily functions .
It 's really a pity that GAS decided to pour so much effort into a car that makes the Elephant Man look like Brad Pitt because it 's got some amazing engineering under that ugly skin .
The twin Magnuson supercharged 5.0 - liter engine ?
Custom built by GAS .
The Air Ride Technologies suspension with computer - adjustable ride height ?
A GAS original .
With dual automatically - retracting steering wheels , the Scythe is even configurable for right - and left - hand drive should drivers want to terrify the British or use it to deliver mail .
While we would n't turn down the chance to drive the Scythe – 1,005 horsepower is , after all , 1,005 horsepower – we have to say it is seriously ugly .
All that technology does n't make up for the fact that looks like just the perfect child - terrifying cross between a Dirt Devil and an earwig .

Disputing Taste PDF )

​ Introduction
De gustibus non est disputandum , or so the old saying goes .
And yet we do dispute so - called matters of taste both often and passionately .
This being the case , what principles , if any , can we apply to these debates in order to reach a mutual understanding ?
Or are such matters better thought of as merely subjective and left alone ?
To answer these questions , what is needed is a means of knowing about aesthetic objects .
( For purposes of simplicity , this essay will concentrate specifically on art , as opposed to other possible objects of aesthetic appreciation . )
However , the exact means by which we build our epistemology of art will depend on the way that we conceive of the art of epistemology .
Indeed , many of the problems concerning subjectivity and objectivity that occur in the field of aesthetic evaluation also occur in the field of moral evaluation .
Hence , in refining our sense of the art of epistemology by means of the epistemology of art , we may be able to arrive at a more general epistemology of value that can be applied in a diverse array of philosophically interesting fields .
There are two chief questions concerning the epistemology of art that need to be tackled :
How do we tell if something is art , and once we know that it is art , how do we interpret it ?
Because of their difficulty , the available space only allows us to tackle the second question here , so the first will be held in abeyance ( or at least to as large a degree as is possible given the interrelated nature of the questions ) .
Arthur Danto suggests that interpreting art relies on the use of an “ is of artistic identification , ” but insufficiently clarifies the mechanism by which this “ is ” is used and understood .
To make it more clear we will take the theory of representation given by Richard Wollheim and expand its application to art in general .
In so doing , we will uncover the ways in which the understanding of art relies upon the existence of a communal ideal of a “ suitable spectator ” which is cultivated on the grounds of a prepossessed common sense of taste of the sort discussed by Ludwig Wittgenstein and Watsuji Tetsurō .
The existence of common taste for its part not only informs our understanding of art but also explains why art has the ability to open up new worlds to us through the presentation of new ways of structuring our interpretations of the world , as mentioned by Mikel Dufrenne .
Finally , some brief remarks can be made about the interplay of subjectivity and objectivity inherent in both art and morality .
​ Preliminary remarks on evaluating and interpreting art
One of the more ordinary sorts of aesthetic evaluations that can be made is “ this is beautiful . ”
What is interesting about this evaluation is what it leaves out .
Compare , “ this is beautiful to me . ”
Why do we ordinarily feel that we can omit the relativizing clause “ to me ” ?
One thing to note about the dropping of the relativizing clause is that if we did not do so , there would be no basis whatsoever for aesthetic disputes : “ This is beautiful to me .
Is it beautiful to you ?
No ?
Oh well . ”
In order for us to have a sustained dialogue about art or an aesthetic evaluation , we cannot merely make claims about our own dispositions , nor can we make claims that hold for everyone ( since the claim “ this is beautiful to everyone ” must be abandoned as soon as one philistine in the audience says , “ not to me ” ) , but rather we must instead make claims that somehow bring our personal reactions out of ourselves and into the realm of public discourse , and , preferably if we are to make any headway towards conclusions , rational discourse without making merely sociological observations about the state of public taste . †
​ The “ Artworld ”
Arthur Danto in “ The Appreciation and Interpretation of Works of Art ” remarks that taste is , “ the paradigm of what can not be rationally be disputed . ” †
Nevertheless , in “ The Artworld , ” he claims that it is a necessary condition of art that at least some of the physical aspects of an artwork be identified as representing something , which seems on the surface at least to be the sort of thing that can be rationally deliberated over .†
That is , in a painting , a white spot of paint might represent Icarus , or — in a particularly avant - garde piece — a white spot of paint .
The key is that the spot of paint is not only a spot of paint , but also a potential object of public interpretation , even if it is interpreted as standing for itself .
Hence , we can point at the spot and say ( correctly ) , “ This is Icarus , ” in spite of the fact that Icarus is a fictitious person , and not a spot of paint at all .
When evaluating a work of art , the meaning of the word “ is ” is temporarily relaxed , so that it means , “ represents , ” rather than “ is identical to ” or “ is an instance of . ”
Strictly speaking , there is nothing to see in the work itself that allows us to identify what it is that a painting represents , since a sufficiently idiosyncratic artist may represent anything with anything else ( whether or not it is a good idea to attempt to do so ) . †
Similarly , the painting has nothing on it that identifies it as an artwork .
The key is that one must master , “ the is of artistic identification and so constitute it a work of art , ” since without doing so one “ will never look upon artworks . ” †
Laying aside the question of whether this is in fact the sine qua non of art , we are left with the question of how this artistic identification is performed .
Danto points to a theory of art as the repository of meaning :
What in the end makes the difference between a Brillo box and a work of art consisting of a Brillo Box is a certain theory of art .
It is the theory that takes it up into the world of art , and keeps it from collapsing into the real object which it is [ … ] . [… ]
It is the role of artistic theories [ … ] to make the Artworld , and art , possible . †
Theories of art in turn are taken up by the “ Artworld ” — a term never precisely defined by Danto , but which one can take to be the community of artists and art critics that produce “ an atmosphere of artistic theory , a knowledge of the history of art ” † — in different ways at different times such that new and different physically observable predicates are made artistically relevant according to the fashion of the time and the contingent , historical evolution of art theories .
While Danto ’s theory of art seems initially plausible since it explains how aesthetic predicates can emerge as a matter of communal interest , it leaves much to be desired .
On the romantic side , it might be complained that his theory is little different from the cynical aphorism sometimes attributed to his artistic hero Andy Warhol : “ Art is what you can get away with . ”
Danto does hold out hope that art may serve as “ as a mirror held up to nature ” and “ catch the conscience of our kings , ” but he gives little explanation of how this is to occur . †
Presumably , Danto trusts that so long as the Artworld is functioning properly , the predicates it picks out as being aesthetically relevant will be ones that further this aim .
A more troubling complaint against Danto ’s theory stemming from this is that he does little to explain who the members of the Artworld are , and how they decide which predicates to make artistically relevant .
Several philosophers have attempted to trace the emergence of the Artworld historically or explain how “ being a work of art ” can be a meaningful predicate in the face of the changing nature of the Artworld , † but we should notice that Danto himself places theories in a position of priority over both art and the Artworld .
That is , the Artworld itself is constituted by theories about what the Artworld is .
The risk of circularity here seems to be high , though it is somewhat mitigated by the historicity of the object of investigation .
That is to say , for historically evolving entities , we can accept a higher degree of circularity than usual as being non-vicious , since it can be said that the relevant aspects of the entity emerged at first vaguely and only successively became refined over the years .
However , in the fields of interpreting and evaluating a work of art , there is a simpler means of escaping regress : we can say that a work means what its creator says it means .
This theory has the advantage of already being appealed to non-systematically in ordinary discussions of art by non-specialists .†
It is normal when considering a work to ask whether the artist intended for it to be taken in a certain way .
Furthermore , as an act of public expression , an artwork is a means for one human being or group of human beings to communicate , however obliquely , with others , and as such we are morally obliged to listen to what the authorial voice is trying to say unless some other consideration intervenes to nullify that obligation .†
Indeed , in “ Appreciation and Interpretation ” Danto seems to have modified his theory to make clearer the intrinsic link between the work and the artist .
He explains , “ As interpretation is inseparable from work , it is inseparable from the artist if it is the artist ’s work . ” †
Nevertheless , Danto resisted the move to considering the artist ’s intention as foundational .
The artist is , like the interpretation and the theory that makes the work a work , an irreducible part of the work , but still not the final arbiter of the work .
No doubt one motivation for not using the artist ’s intention to circumvent the circularity problem is that there are great dangers in availing ourselves of the author ’s intention : just using the criteria of the author may mean that no work is a failure , or it may strip the critic of her ability to judge a work independently .
In addition , since the intentions of the author may be unclear , it may make definitive judgment impossible , since it depends on the private thoughts of the artist .
Further , we are prohibited from creatively interpreting a work in ways that the author had not foreseen .
Indeed , this is no small loss for the evaluation of work , since one not infrequently finds meanings and resonances in an artwork that the original author may not have been consciously aware of .
Of course , the Artworld - theory itself is vulnerable to the criticism that it stymies the evaluative process , since Danto seems to accept the claim that any object — no matter how aesthetically inert† — can be taken up by the Artworld as an art object if the Artworld so chooses .
Since the only criterion of art is the Artworld ’s fickle interest , Danto ’s theory risks collapsing into the nothing more than the sociology of the art scene elite .
What is needed is a means of evaluation that skillfully melds the deference to the author of the intentionalist theory and the independence of the Artworld into a unified whole that still respects the work of art as a work .
​ The “ Suitable spectator ”
To settle this standoff between the objective but elusive and vague Artworld and the subjective but undemanding and unknowable author , Richard Wollheim introduces “ the suitable spectator ” as an intersubjective mediator .
In “ On Pictorial Representation , ” he explains that a work must be evaluated not as it would be by the uneducated — for whom a spot of paint is a spot of paint — nor as it might be by its creator — for whom the spot might contain an unknowable myriad of associations — but as it would be by the suitable spectator .
Wollheim defines the suitable spectator as , “ a spectator who is suitably sensitive , suitably informed , and , if necessary , suitably prompted . ” †
The relevance of the suitable spectator to the interpretation and evaluation of art is that if a picture represents something then such a spectator will , under the right conditions , have a visual experience which determines that the picture represents something .
( Wollheim ’s theory is concerned primarily with visual art , but can easily be expanded to encompass other forms of art as well . )
Wollheim goes on to emphasize that the experience of representational meaning is primarily a perceptual activity , not an interpretive one .
The experience of representational meaning is not a matter of applying rules to a surface which “ will take [ one ] , without any help from perception , to the thought of what is represented [… ] . ” †
Rather , it is in the experience of perception of meaning itself that we encounter meaning .
When suitably prepared , the viewer is able , by means of “ a special perceptual skill , called ‘ seeing - in ’ ” † to see the white spot as Icarus with complete ease .
Indeed , the conscious application of rules of interpretation proposed by some theories are actually a sign of the lack of ease of a novice interpreter .
In the field of hermeneutics , it is only the non-native speaker or the confused native who must consciously apply the rules of grammar in order to reach the meaning of the text .
When one understands a text natively , its meaning is what it says .
The text is perceived as meaning .
In this same way , the suitable spectator that Wollheim proposes can be thought of a kind of “ native speaker ” for whom the visual image transparently is what it represents .
Danto’s “ is of artistic identification ” becomes a core part of the perceptual apparatus of the well prepared viewer .
But how does the introduction of the suitable spectator help us to defuse the tension between the Artworld and the author ’s intention ?
Wollheim explains that the key is that what makes the spectator suitable is that the spectator has ,
the sensitivity , the information , the prompting , that are required if the spectator is to see the picture as the artist desires him to .
However , there has also been an advantage in putting the matter as I have had to : that is , in terms of what the suitable spectator sees rather than that of the artist ’s intentions .
For it has made it clear why , for some representations , there will be no appropriate experience .
Such an experience will elude even the suitable spectator because the artist failed to make a work that can be experienced in a way that tallies with the intentions that he undoubtedly had . [ …]
Representational meaning [ … ] is [ … ] dependent , not only on intention as such , but on fulfilled intention . †
By interpolating the figure of the suitable spectator , we are given a middle ground from which to judge a work and the criterion of that judgment .
The criterion is whether the work can induce an experience , and the middle ground is the consciousness of the spectator .
Works which succeed in producing the desired state in the proper observer are evaluated positively , and those that fail are evaluated negatively .
Furthermore , the observer has the space to draw out reactions to the work that the author did not consider , since it is the observer , not the author , whose viewpoint is privileged .
Thus , the viewpoint of the suitable spectator is clearly superior to that of the artist ’s intention alone as a theoretical standpoint for aesthetic evaluation .
Yet we must also consider how this differs from the Artworld - theory itself .
One difficulty with the Artworld - theory is that the Artworld is supposed to be a unified body of expert thought .
However , it is clear that even granting the otherwise difficult process of specifying the membership of that body and presupposing the unity of its judgments in an instant of time , if not over time , one is still left with the problem that different works clearly deserve different standards of appreciation .
If , as Danto says , an artwork is constituted in part by the theory that makes it an artwork at all , then one must suppose that the artwork travels with the entire Artworld on its back .
By proposing instead a theory of a suitable spectator , we can lighten the load of the work down to just the one sort of spectator envisioned by the artist without thereby ceding to the artist final say about the appraisal of the work .
The artist can tell us how to look at the work but cannot presume to tell us what we see .
At the same time , the nagging question of possible circularity in our definition is disposed of .
In Artworld theory , the theory makes the work and the Artworld , but the theory also depends on the Artworld for its existence .
On the other hand , the suitable spectator originates as a part of the work solely from the artist ’s intention to make a work suitable for someone else to experience .
One illustration of the concept of the judgment of the suitable spectator overruling that of the author can be seen in Records of Kyorai ( 去來抄 ) , a collection of poems and observations by a pupil of the haiku master Bashō ( 芭蕉 ) .
In one incident , dispute arises about the proper interpretation of Kyorai ’s poem , “ On the edge of this rock , / Here is one more / Moon- viewer ” :
Kyorai said , “ Shadō asserted that this must be a monkey , but what I intend is another person . ”
Bashō retorted , “ A monkey !
What does he mean ?
What were you thinking when you composed the poem ? ” Kyorai answered , “ As I was walking over the fields and mountains , singing under the light of the full moon , I found , on the edge of a rock , another man filled with poetical excitement . ”
Bashō said , “ In the phrase , ‘ There is one more person , ” you announce yourself ; in this there is poetry . [… ]
My poetical taste is below the highest , but in Bashō ’s interpretation , there is something fantastic , I think . †
About this incident , the translator R.H. Blyth remarks , “ we have here the entertaining picture of Bashō telling Kyorai , not what he ought to have said , but what he ought to have meant by what he said . ” †
Why is Bashō ’s interpretation preferred over Kyorai’s ?
Because as the master of Kyorai , Bashō is in a position to offer an authoritative interpretation of Kyorai ’s work .
Through a lifetime of training , Bashō has made himself able to instantly size up the merits of a haiku .
At the same time , one of the reasons that it is Bashō and not someone else who is in that position is that Kyorai as the author had always intended for the poem to be evaluated for someone with the degree of insight that he considered his master to have .
Thus , as an author , Kyorai has the authority to invest Bashō with a claim to the authoritative interpretation .
Still , there remain numerous grounds for disputing the suitable spectator theory .
Among other problems , it remains to be seen if we have not merely doubled the amount of work to be done as part of an evaluation .
Whereas before we needed only to interpret the work , now we must first suss out the suitable spectator and only then can we begin to examine our perceptions to see what meanings they see in the work .
It similarly doubles the grounds for conflict when we have conflicting evaluations .
Perhaps our opponent is perceiving something different in the work , or perhaps one of us has not fully taken up the mindset of a suitable spectator .
To construct a conception of the suitable spectator in an adequate way , we need to share with the artist an understanding of what a suitable spectator would look like .
Sharing a conception of the suitable spectator with the artist will in turn rely on our having a common understanding with the artist of what kind of thing art is and how it is to be evaluated .
Furthermore , in those cases where our sense of the relevant spectator diverges from our sense of ourselves , we must change ourselves in order to become more suitable to serve as evaluators .
Accordingly , to understand what sort of person a suitable spectator is we must first examine more closely the common ground that we already share with the artist , and then we must examine the means by which can cause our tastes to conform more closely to the ideal of suitability .
​ Common taste
When thinking about any philosophical problem , it is helpful to use a concrete case as the focal point for one ’s investigations .
In the field of taste , the early twentieth century Japanese philosopher Watsuji Tetsurō ( 和辻哲郎 ) is a very helpful example of this practice .
In his book Ethics , when considering the problem of commonly held values , he turns to the physical sense of the taste of food as an illustration of the ways an otherwise private sensation can nevertheless be the basis for a public dialogue :
[ W]e taste food by dividing it among us .
Its taste depends on each person ’s peculiar sense of taste .
In spite of this , is it true to say that tastes differ from one to another ?
Do we not enjoy the same sweetness when we taste sugar , dividing it among us ?
If one person tastes sugar and finds it bitter , we would lose no time in finding her a medical care on the assumption that she is sick .
We attempt to deal with her as a person who is normally able to taste the same sweetness , although she is temporarily deprived of this ability .
Based on the phenomenon that people experience the same taste , “ communal eating , ” has played an important role since ancient times . [… ]
If it were true that bodily feelings separate people from one another , then such instances could not have occurred . †
Although , the sensation of tasting food is private , there is nevertheless a degree to which the phenomenon of tasting can only be understood in relation to certain social assumptions about the nature of tasting food .
Though we may say that only I know what the food tastes like to me , nevertheless , what the food tastes like to me is intimately bound up with what the food tastes like to others .
The very language I use to describe my sensation is based on the assumption of a literally common taste shared between individuals .
The invisible object of my sense of taste is made visible through my interactions with others .
Certain baseline concerns are the ground of shared ways of life , and through sharing these concerns with others , we are able to communicate with them .
Ludwig Wittgenstein makes a similar argument in his Philosophical Investigations , where he says , “ If language is to be a means of communication there must be agreement not only in definitions but also ( queer as this may sound ) in judgments . ” †
Communication presupposes a common language , which of course necessitates the sharing of terms .
But since terms are not isolated in their meanings , the very use of a common language presupposes such judgments as “ sugar is sweet ” ; “ salt is salty ” ; etc. , since “ sweet ” is the name of the kind of taste that sugar has , and likewise for salty and salt .
In the aesthetic realm , we share a love for harmonious chords and sense of frisson from paintings with sharp lines and garish colors .
Moreover , even complex tastes such as the old Japanese love of wabi-sabi or the 1950s New York art scene ’s love of conceptuality can form the backbone of a sense of common taste shared by a collection of people .
To give another example of the phenomenon of common preferences explained by Watsuji and Wittgenstein , consider fashion .
Wittgenstein asks ,
How does fashion come about ?
Say , we wear lapels broader than last year .
Does this mean the tailors like them better broader ?
No , not necessarily .
He cuts it like this and this year he makes it broader . †
It is clear that what makes a fashion the fashion of the moment is not the taste of any individual , be it the taylor or the trendsetter .
Rather , what is in fashion is created through the decisions of many people each of whom influences others .
To state “ this style is in fashion ” is not to make a claim that “ I like this style , ” “ the tailors like this style , ” or even “ one should like the style . ”
It is a statement about the mass .
As Watsuji explains it is an illustration of the communal consciousness :
What makes this communal consciousness manifest in a particularly bold form , is the phenomenon of “ fashion . ”
Fashion makes its appearance within the modes of clothing , food , and housing already historically and nationally fixed as more detailed common favorites .
Even though individuals did not , to begin with , become conscious of a common favorite as their own , nevertheless , they do feel it to be their own favorite to the extent that they are inclined to view deviations from this favorite as either something funny or ugly . †
We all demonstrate our allegiance to the common taste of our cultures each morning when we put on our clothes for the day and choose something appropriate for contemporary Western culture rather than a comfortable kimono or a Roman tunic — and not because of any external compulsion but because of a personal preference .
Without any individual awareness of the process , the favorite of the group becomes the favorite of the individual as well .
This process does not subvert the fact of individual autonomy of fashion preferences , but does demonstrate the degree to which tastes occur within a social fabric .
The social fabric , in turn , demonstrates the wanderings of collective feeling .
The realm of the aesthetic is only possible to the degree that individuals in a society do in fact make up an “ Artworld . ”
This Artworld does not consist of isolated theorists who examine a work of art solely on the basis of the theory du jour as in Danto ’s description but of real people in a common culture with similar values and a shared way of life who examine a work of art with uncountably many invisible social pressures affecting their perception .
It because we are already in communication with the artist as fellow members of a society that we can understanding anything that they say , whether verbally or artistically .
Only once communication is established on the basis of what is shared between ourselves and the artist are we able to adequately understand the suitable spectators inherent in the work .
There are however two caveats that need to be made about the realm of common taste .
The first is that common taste is not an absolute monolith .
Rather , we are all members of a number of different overlapping communities and sub-communities which share some commitments but diverge in others .
One difficulty for contemporary art theorists is that the standard of taste has become so fragmented into different sub- categories that it is nearly impossible to approach a work and assume that one automatically shares with the author the cultural background necessary to evaluate it .
The other major difficulty is that situations also arise in which we are able to understand on the basis of our sense of common taste with the artist what the suitable spectator specific to a work would be , but we are nevertheless aware of our inadequacy as spectators .
If we find the sugar to be salty , or wabi-sabi to be merely dilapidated , or the Pop Art to be overly intellectual , then we will be unable to treat the artist ’s work with due respect .
In those situations , specific steps must be undertaken to improve our suitability , which will be considered next .
​ The artist ’s life as a key to common taste
Since common taste varies from community to community , more needs to be said about how we can know what the suitable spectator is like for a given work .
One key consideration is that , where possible , we need to look at the life of the artist as a clue to the work .
Maurice Merleau - Ponty does just this in “ Cézanne ’s Doubt . ”
There , Merleau - Ponty gives a deep explanation of Cézanne ’s work on the basis of Cézanne ’s life .
This is possible because , as Merleau - Ponty writes ,
If Cézanne ’s life seems to us to carry the seeds of his work within it , it is because we get to know his work first and see the circumstances of his life through it , charging them with a meaning borrowed from that work . [… ]
Although it is certain that a person ’s life does not explain his work , it is equally certain that the two are connected .
The truth is that that work to be done called for that life . †
The work of the artist and the life of the artist are products of the same hands , as such by understanding the one , we refine our understanding of the other , since what we perceive in it will be affected by what we have already perceived in the other .
From the work we get clues as to the styles , genres , and traditions that interested the artist , and from the life we see how the artist responded to those traditions in a lived fashion .
The two avenues of understanding complement one another without either one being fully dominant , though the portion of influence among the two may vary from genre to genre . †
Since we are able to share a way of life with the artist , we can by means of a way of life as form of common taste begin to see things from the perspective , not of the artist , but of the spectator for whom the artist had been crafting her work all along .
Even in the case of the joint work or the work whose authorship is unclear , the way of life shared by the community that produces the art is going to be a key to our understanding of the work .
Even if we cannot point to a genius like Cézanne as the guide to understanding a work , nevertheless , we can look at the culture in which the work emerged and use the life of that culture as a clue to what kind of spectator would be suitable for the work . †
​ Becoming a suitable spectator
Kant in The Critique of Judgment gives an extended explanation of the means by which the judgment of a neophyte artist is trained .
Although it concerns the training of an artist rather than an observer , it is worth excerpting at length here in order to make several points about the means by which we arrive at common tastes without thereby losing our individual perspectives :
So in fine arts there is only manner , not method : the master must show by his example what the student is to produce , and how .
He may in the end bring his procedure under universal rules , but these are more likely to be useful to the student as occasional reminders of what the main features of the procedure are , than as prescriptions of these features .
And yet the artist must bear in mind a certain ideal ; art must keep this ideal in view even though in practice it never achieves it in full .
The master must stimulate the student ’s imagination until it becomes commensurate with a given concept ; [… ]
For only in this way can the master keep the student from immediately treating the examples offered him as if they were archetypes , models that he should imitate as if they were not subject to a still higher standard and to his own judgment [… ] .†
Education in the fine arts can teach only the manner of an artist , because there is no rigid method to be followed .
The student does not merely imitate the teacher but learns the underlying universal rules through the particular works .
In these cases , it is important for the teacher to emphasize that since the underlying rules are “ ideals ” ( in the high Kantian sense ) , they are not ( and cannot be ) actually found in the copying of the work .
If not well instructed , the student may copy the originals without seeing why they are important at all .
Thus , the propaedeutic goal of fine art education is the production of mental powers suitable for understanding the humanities , in order to feel sympathy and communicate in the social spirit of humankind , and this goal is common for the observer as well as the artist .
What allows communication between the two is that they are able to listen to the same artistic language .
The author is obliged to craft the work with consideration for the attention of the spectator , and if this is done , then the spectator is obliged to return this consideration .
To return to the example of Bashō , it was his lifetime of experience with Japanese and Chinese literature , art , and religion which made him able to serve both as an author and as a suitable spectator .
Bashō lived a life that revolved around literature to such a degree that after he wrote in The Narrow Road to Oku , “ Many of the men of old died on the road , and I too for years past have been stirred by the sight of a solitary cloud drifting with the wind to ceaseless thoughts of roaming , ” † he too joined his forebears by passing away in Ōsaka in the midst of a journey and writing , “ Sick on a journey , / my dreams wander / the withered fields . ” †
When one is as properly trained as Bashō then “ There is nothing you can see that is not a flower ;
There is nothing you can think that is not the moon . ” †
Yet , as Bashō said the key skill for one in possession of this background is to “ seek not after the ancients ; seek what they sought ! ” †
The suitable spectator cultivates an understanding of the rules by studying the classics of a genre , but the spectator never becomes a slave to the canon or the rules , but to the organic impulse that animated the life .
As Bashō said elsewhere , “ Abide by the rules , then throw them overboard , and for the first time you will achieve freedom . ” †
Achieving suitability as a spectator means not only becoming familiar with the works of the past , but inhabiting the theoretical and lived structures that animated past Artworlds .
The works of the past are not taken as objects to be blindly copied , but as the means by which one may become aware of the mindset and lifestyle of the suitable spectator and artist : the common taste of another world .
The suitable spectator is not suitable because that spectator blindly agrees with the judgments of the artist , but because the spectator is willing to undertake the living work necessary to prepare her faculties of judgment so as to receive the work in its fullest as something more than could be imagined in advance by the artist or the spectator .
​ Exploring new worlds
What is fascinating about art at its best is that in observing the work and entering into the position of the suitable spectator , we find that we also enter into a “ new world . ”
Mikel Dufrenne in “ The World of the Aesthetic Object ” illustrates the sense of world which the suitable spectator can encounter in a piece by explaining that ,
In the presence of the Winged Victory , we are at first aware of an animated atmosphere of wind and of upward movement , creating a space which is that of taking flight and which has the dimensions of an ethereal world . †
The reason it is possible for an object like the Winged Victory of Samothrace to so transport us is that by its presence , it draws us into the world of its creators , and it allows us to attempt to perceive the work not only as they perceived it but also as the kind of spectators that have inherited the culture they established .
Of course , the consideration of art objects created for reasons other than art is a particularly fraught area of evaluation .
Nevertheless , a full appreciation of such works must consider what sort of spectator would have been deemed suitable by the original creators of the work in addition to what sort of spectator is currently deemed suitable by the art criticism community if one ’s evaluation of the work is to be properly deferential to the original creators of the work .
Thus , while we may not need to treat the Winged Victory as a religious totem in order to partially appreciate it , a full appreciation of the work needs to take into account the religious feelings and lived actions of its creators .
While we need not hail goddess
Niké , we must understand the ways in which her embodiment is meant to transport us into another , ethereal , even divine world .
To be sure , we must resist the temptation to put too much emphasis on the powers of the object alone to invoke an experience .
Dufrenne himself seems to fall into this temptation , when he writes , “ It is the work which expresses . ” †
Properly speaking , it is the author who expresses herself in the work and not the work itself which speaks , but this attribution of agency to the work is not without its reasons .
Human beings as aesthetic creatures are naturally drawn to sympathetically interpret the works they encounter , and when one suitably views a work , the work itself becomes transparent , which allows one to overlook the contributions made as a viewer to the experience of the work .
Accordingly , as Dufrenne states ,
Expression thus establishes a singular world .
It is not the unity of a perceivable space , of an addable sum ; it is not a unity which can be grasped from the outside , surveyed , and defined .
It proceeds from an internal cohesion which is amenable only to the logic of feeling . †
When we engage with a great work , it is as though we were able to enter into a world where sugar is salty and salt is sweet , and not arbitrarily so but as a natural , organic whole .
There is a coherence to the logic of the judgments that underlie the world in spite of the difference of those judgments from those that underlie the ordinary world to which we are accustomed .
The coherence of this world is not the result of a rationally definable calculation , but something that we perceive in the work as a result of becoming a suitable spectator for that work .
As Dufrenne also notes , this world gains its cogency in part from the degree to which the work itself suggests rather than reveals .
Since not everything about the world of the work is disclosed by the work , the spectator is able to play inside of a space with “ potentiality which no actualization can exhaust . ” †
​ Moral imaginative resistance to becoming a suitable spectator
Thinking about the work as a means of exploring worlds also helps explain the problem of “ imaginative resistance ” to morally repellent artworks .
While we freely allow ourselves to engage with fictional works in which the rules of physics are altered or improbable events happen with great frequency , we have a certain distaste for engaging with works that require us to see them from a different moral standpoint .
As David Hume notes in “ Of the Standard of Taste , ”
Must we throw aside the pictures of our ancestors because of their ruffs and farthingales ? [ No . ]
But where the ideas of morality and decency alter from one age to another , and where vicious manners are described , without being marked with the proper characters of blame and disapprobation , this must be allowed to disfigure the poem , and to be a real deformity . †
That is , we allow for the world of the work to be archaic or fantastical , but we cannot praise a work that fully embraces a repugnant point of view . †
Why should a moral defect count as an aesthetic defect as well ?
Because in order to engage with a work , we must take on the standards of its suitable spectator , but the suitable spectator for certain works is the kind of person we must not allow ourselves to become , even in play , since accustoming oneself to evil in certain ways has a deleterious effect on one ’s character .
We can temporarily allow ourselves to think of ruffs and farthingales as sartorially appropriate without damaging our moral faculties ( although an over - familiarity with paintings of the past may give one a greater taste for outmoded fashions ) , but to think of genocide as appropriate , for example , even temporarily is a danger to the integrity of our future moral judgments .
Indeed , to fully become “ suitable ” for such viewpoint , we may even need to change our way of life as a way of changing our common taste — an action many of us would , I hope , resist .
Thus , when the artist invites us to explore the world of the work , they are making a demand of the audience that cannot be reasonably fulfilled .
When the audience ( naturally and commendably ) resists the work more than the artist intended , the artist ’s intention is foiled and the work cannot be considered a complete success , since the artist failed to account for the imaginative resistance of the audience .
Of course , in the opposite vein , we can imagine an artist who creates a work that she intends for her spectator to resist and reject as evil .†
In that case , the work would be judged a successful fulfillment of the artist ’s intentions .
In both cases though , we see that our moral evaluation of a work may have bearing on our ability to make an aesthetic evaluation of the work .
What is interesting about this is that in the case of both aesthetic evaluations and moral evaluations what must be done is the bridging of the subjective sense of how I or the other feels and the objective facts about the work or action into a synthetic inter-subjective sense of what kinds of values inhere in the worldview that one must take on in relation to another person in order to understand the world from a suitable viewpoint .
​ Disputing taste and objections
To return to our motivating impulse , how are disputes about taste to be resolved ?
I propose a method roughly similar to the following : First , on the basis of knowledge about the circumstances of the production of the work to be evaluated , infer what sort of spectator would be suitable to view the work in question .
Second , do what is necessary to become such a spectator .
( This may involve developing one ’s senses , becoming familiar with a canon , engaging with many similar works , prompting oneself in a certain way , or , in extreme cases , changing one ’s style of life or values , etc . )
Third , experience the work from the vantage point of the suitable spectator and see what sort of aesthetic experiences can be produced by the work .
Fourth , evaluate the work on the basis of its achievement of the artist ’s aims and on the basis of the aesthetic reward it offers in its propensity to open a world .
Finally , it may be necessary on the basis of what is revealed by the prior evaluation of the work to revise one ’s view of suitable spectator for the work by returning to the first step , reevaluating the life of the artist , reengaging in the cultivation of suitability as spectator , and iteratively continuing the process of evaluation indefinitely .
Hence the declaration , “ this is beautiful , ” can be taken to mean something like , “ this will be seen as beautiful should one approach it in a suitable manner . ”
To fill out this outline some clarifications must be made about the nature of the suitable spectator .
While I am appropriating the term “ spectator ” from Wollheim and occasionally use the word “ see ” to describe how the spectator ’s experiences the work , do not think that the spectator must always be passive or disengaged from a work .
For some works , it may be vital that the “ spectator ” participate in the creation of the work in order to suitably understand it .
Think for instance of tea ceremony , in which the spectator must literally participate in the ceremony along with the tea master .
( This case in particular also points out that a difficult process may be involved in training one ’s suitability as a spectator , since even participating in a tea ceremony requires extensive training . )
Similarly , many kinds of improvisational musical performance require the audience ’s participation in order to decide the direction the music will take .
It may also be objected that in some cases there is no single clear position for a spectator to take in regards to a work .
Think for instance of the writer who does not particularly care if his work is published and does not write with any particular audience in mind .
Nevertheless , I will argue in this case that so long as the writer employs existing languages for the work , the writer will have some idea of what sort of person would be suitable to read the work : one literate in the relevant languages and able to grasp the appropriate connections between the work written and other works alluded to or otherwise relevant to its appreciation .
If the writer is only writing for herself , then to become suitable , we must understand what kind of person the writer herself is .
It should also be understood by now that the selection of the suitable spectator for a work by the artist is not a means of “ critic - proofing ” † the work .
First , it is possible for a work to fail to cause the spectator to experience what the artist intended that she experience .
Second , great works are those that lend themselves to the experience of a rich and deep world .
A Hollywood action blockbuster movie may set out to be viewed as no more than an amusing diversion .
In that case , it is to be viewed from the perspective of the shallow spectacle - seeker .
However , even if the movie succeeds from the point of view of its suitable spectator , this does not mean that the movie therefore becomes great art .
At this point in our evaluation , we can only say that it is well - crafted .
To be great , the work must not only reach the expectations of its spectators , but it must open up a rich and deep world that rewards those spectators aesthetically for their effort .
Accordingly , it is wrong for the critic to complain that , say , Independence Day does not explore the human condition with the gravity of , say , Citizen Kane .
However , it is proper for the critic to state that while crafted well enough for the concerns of its audience , Independence Day offers no real substance and dissolves into air should one attempt a serious analysis of the world it supposedly creates .
As such , it is an inferior work .
To further clarify , suitability is not a binary concept , and for better works , there will not be just a single perspective which is suitable for understanding the work .
Rather , a good work can be suitably understood from different perspectives in both a horizontal and vertical dimension .
Horizontally speaking , a work like Plato ’s Republic† has been well understood by persons from a variety of cultures from its origin in classical Greece to the modern day .
In each of the cultures it has been taken up in , its interpretation has been subtly different and engaged with different concerns .
Today , it is difficult to read the Republic without a sense for the tragedy of the totalitarian state , whereas Byzantine interpretations tended to be more concerned with relating the form of the good to the Christian God .
No matter the exact concerns that motive the spectator taking up the work , however , the importance of the work is the way in which it causes its reader to engage its basic questions for herself .
In this we see the vertical dimension of the Republic .
As we read and reread it , new ironies and resonances are revealed to us .
The language of the arguments becomes more clear , and we are better able to appreciate their stakes .
Hence , Plato offers aesthetic and intellectual rewards to the tyro and the scholar alike .
Indeed , one of the great qualities of the Republic is that it spurs tyros into scholarship and helps to create readers more suitable for it .
( This is why the method listed above is iterative rather than linear . )
The most suitable spectator for the Republic in all probability has not been born yet , and may not be born until the zenith of civilization should it ever occur .
There are problems with the Romantic concept of genius , but what that concept gets right is that a great work can bring into being a new way of looking at art .
Kant writes that genius allows us ,
first , to discover ideas for a given concept , and , second , to hit upon the way of expressing these ideas that enables us to communicate to others , as accompanying a concept , the mental attunement that those ideas produce . †
At its best , what the great work of art does is both to create a new way of seeing the world and to seduce us into seeing the world from this new perspective through the rewards it offers .
On the other hand , the difficulty for a Hollywood action blockbuster is that its suitable spectator has a narrower vision of what will concern the audience rather than a wider one .
The audience will only be concerned with the craft of the special effects , the intensity of the drama , and the spectacle of film .
The audience will not be concerned by the believability of the motivations of the characters , the meaning of the film , its broader implications , etc .
On the other side , an attempt to define great art as purely cerebral and unrelated to the virtuosity of the practice of craft will also fail , because that too is a diminution of what Danto called the “ aesthetic predicates ” of the work .
In that case , the fact of the work ’s being sloppily made or deliberately ugly is not to be subject to evaluation either .
However , the very best works are those which are able to be meaningfully engaged in as many ways as the audience is willing to become suitable to view .
​ Conclusion
In this paper , I have attempted to present a means of bridging the divide between subjective and objective means of evaluating an artwork by means of cultivating one ’s capacities as the suitable spectator for a particular work and in so doing entering the world that is created by means of the work .
The problem with just postulating an Artworld as the means of interpreting art is that the characteristics of the Artworld are ill - defined , and it leaves little ground for critical evaluation .
At the same time , we cannot fall back blindly on the artist ’s own intentions .
Rather , we find that each work calls for a certain suitable spectator to view a work , at which point the evaluation of the work is to be made on the basis of the perceptions of that viewer .
Becoming a “ suitable spectator ” for a work begins on the ground of common taste but concludes through a deep familiarity with the artistic milieu and even lifestyle of the artist .
Only by understanding both the theoretical and practical underpinnings of an artists life can we have full understanding of that artist and begin to enter into a world that is truly different from our own .
At the same time , however , while entering into other worlds is deeply rewarding , we must also be quite mindful of the dangers involved for our moral sense .
This does not come about simply because we see bad things and copy them , but because in order to view the work properly , we have to change who we ourselves in some sense are .
Disputing taste is not a simple process , and there are many points in its practice that can become contested if not handled with extreme care .
However , when it is well practiced , we can finally see why Danto held out the hope that art could act “ as a mirror held up to nature ” and “ catch the conscience of our kings ” : through great art , we can make ourselves suitable to see a new world and understand more clearly deficiencies about which we had theretofore been complacent in our own .

Arterton described her character as “ not as frolicsome or femme - fatale as other Bond girls ” but instead “ fresh and young . ”
This is by far Arterton ’s biggest role , but her stock is on the rise , as you will next see her in Prince of Persia : The Sands of Time in 2010 .
Yep , a movie based on a video game .
It worked for Angelina , so why not ?
While Gemma is n’t all over the internet in her underwear like Olga , I think you will still enjoy the gallery .
And finally , here is an interview with Gemma Arterton at the premier :
We get lectures about civility and the need to welcome everyone , even those we disagree with , and Rick Warren wo n’t even welcome us in his church .
This is from the Saddleback Church ’s own Web site .
You know things are bad when the church goes out of its way to explicitly say that you ’re not welcome as a member in their Web site FAQ .
But we ’re supposed to welcome him to our inauguration .
( Hat tip to reader Ken . )
Oh good , so there ’s still hope for a cure .
Phew !
Friday ’s auction of public land oil and gas leases by BLM Utah was thrown into chaos by local activist Tim DeChristopher , who bid the prices up on parcels of land he has no intention of paying for .
[ social_buttons ]
“ I thought I could be effective by making bids , driving up prices for others and winning some bids myself . ”
- DeChristopher
Bidding was halted for a time , and now buyers will have 10 days to reconsider and withdraw their bids .
Kent Hoffman , deputy state director , BLM Utah , said , “ He ’s tainted the entire auction . ”
According to the Deseret News , the FBI is questioning Tim DeChristopher of Salt Lake City , who drew complaints from other bidders as being unfamiliar and bidding in an unconventional manner .
He has been released but is awaiting charges from the US Attorney ’s office .
DeChristopher , a 27 year - old University of Utah economics student , won the bidding for 13 parcels , including 22,500 acres around Arches and Canyonlands National Parks , and succeeded in driving up the price of several other parcels .
He now owes $ 1.7 million for all of his leases .
An attorney for Southern Utah Wilderness Alliance , Stephen Bloch , said the incident was a disservice to , and a huge distraction from , the peaceful protest that took place outside the building .
116 parcels out of the 131 originally offered were sold .
Some parcels were pulled from the sale after complaints from the National Park Service and environmental groups .
Only about half of the 359,000 acres first proposed for auction were actually up for sale on Friday .

Ann E. Dunwoody First Female Four - Star General ( VIDEO , PHOTOS )
was honored today at a Pentagon promotion ceremony , where she was awarded the highest rank of any U.S. female in military history .
The first woman to become a Four - Star General , Dunwoody 's appointment was confirmed by the U.S. Senate in July and the promotion was effective November 14 , 2008 .
Dunwoody joined the Army in 1975 and has had an illustrious 33 year career .
Her unit is the U.S. Army Materiel Command and she participated in Desert Storm .
The daughter of a career Army officer , she lived in Germany and Belgium growing up .
She has been married to Retired Colonel Craig Brotchie of the USAF for the past 18 years .
The General had this to say about her career :
" I grew up in the Army and came from a family who , since 1862 , has defended our nation .
While I joined the Army right out of college , I planned to only stay in the Army to complete my two year commitment , but it was n't too long before I realized that there are no other shoes ( boots ) I would rather fill than the ones I 'm wearing right now .
As a soldier you can continually serve .
It is a calling to be a soldier and there is a great sense of pride and camaraderie in serving the greatest Army in the world . "
Check out the video of General Dunwoody 's Pentagon ceremony below .

The phenomenon we are witnessing is a savage bear market .
This is a market in which asset prices tumble by very large amounts .
Vast amounts of wealth disappear .
The mildest bear markets reduce prices by 20 % .
The worst ones take prices down by 80 — 90 % .
The absolute worst case is when the stock markets disappear altogether .
The wealth destruction is bad for a great many people .
Anyone who is nearing retirement and suffers a big loss has fewer years to make it back .
The declines forecast recessions and depressions .
Hard times for many .
Young adults find it hard going and move back with their parents .
How bad is this one ?
Very bad .
Not very long ago , there was a mountain of stock market wealth .
That mountain has collapsed to almost half its size in the U.S.
In Japan , the already low Nikkei Index has fallen to a 26 - year low near 7,000 .
It once was 40,000 .
This is a decline of 82.5 % .
If the Dow - Jones Industrial Average declines this much , it will reach 2,450 .
No stock market has been spared .
The Chinese stock market in Shanghai is down to 1,700 from 6,000 in one year , a drop of 72 % .
The collapses came in stages , with pauses before and after each stage .
It has been like a three - act play .
It is becoming a five - act play .
The bright side is that these declines open up investment opportunities .
Experience helps one to overcome the shock of seeing prices decline so far , so fast .
Experience helps one to profit after crashes and bear markets .
For this purpose , I recommend Lowell Miller ’s book The Perfect Investment .
Mr. Miller provides guidance on how to locate and invest in stocks that have crashed .
Although the book is straightforward , you will not benefit from his expertise and methods without a good deal of study , patience , and experience .
Mr. Miller does not recommend buying crashed stocks unless they have already made a " bottom . "
While he explains that in some detail , I also strongly recommend Stan Weinstein ’s book Secrets for Profiting in Bull and Bear Markets .
If you had followed Mr. Weinstein ’s methods in this book , you would have preserved most of your stock market wealth .
You would have become very concerned about the stock market as of August of 2007 or earlier and been out of it no later than January 16 , 2008 when the Dow - Jones Industrial Average was 12,500 .
On January 14 , 2008 , an LRC article of mine that examined the incipient recession happened to remark : " The stock market is already in a bear market . "
I say " happened " because I do not make a habit of giving out investment advice to the public .
A year earlier , I observed : " The overall level of the stock market is still richly valued , and until that condition is corrected the risk of stock market investing remains relatively high . "
The Dow was 12,500 .
It is easier to figure out when to sell stocks and when to buy them back at crashed prices , which is what Weinstein ’s and Miller ’s books explain , than it is to understand why stock prices behave the way they do , which they do not explain .
Their methods do not rely on predicting , but on observing .
In fact , Weinstein explains how the market ’s actual behavior often conflicts with nave theories about how it should be behaving .
For example , between 1980 and 2001 , gold fluctuated in a trading range while consumer prices rose and rose .
One might have thought that gold would be rising too , but it did not .
It is nice to have theories , explanations , and understanding .
It makes us feel good .
But quite often these theories are inadequate and misleading when it comes to timing and predicting security markets .
It pays to observe markets .
The most important thing to determine is the main trend .
A trend in motion stays in motion .
Do n’t fight the trend .
In any choice between relying on statistical data , which is past data , and relying on the observed trend , choose the trend .
The stock market is forward - looking .
Its price changes start to reflect future events before they occur and can be seen in statistics .
Yet we are all curious .
We wonder how things work .
We wonder " Why does this happen ? "
About these declines , a student of mine asked me " Where does the money go ? "
Crude oil , which was $ 140 a barrel in July , is $ 63 in October .
Silver , which was $ 20 an ounce in March , is now $ 9 .
A recent inquiry read " Why have crude oil prices … dropped so drastically in such a short and seemingly random period of time ? "
What was once wealth is no longer wealth .
Where did the wealth go ?
Why does it disappear so quickly ?
Why does it disappear when it disappears ?
General answers are available .
Precise answers are not .
Specific explanations are bound to be controversial .
What is wealth ?
Aristotle taught : " And we call wealth all things whose value can be measured in money . "
Wealth is anything that can be exchanged to purchase something else .
The air that anyone can breathe is not wealth .
No one will pay for it who can get it free .
Air that is compressed and can be sold is wealth .
Oxygen that is separated from air and can be sold is wealth .
The value placed upon that wealth , or what it will purchase in exchange , is not fixed and absolute .
A house that sold for $ 300,000 a year ago may now have a value of $ 225,000 .
The U.S. government was filling vast caverns with oil bought at prices above $ 100 a barrel .
Those inventories now have vastly lower value .
Wealth has declined in value .
The general answer to these questions is " supply and demand . "
This is not very illuminating .
For stocks , the supplies are fixed .
IBM has virtually the same number of shares outstanding in October , 2008 as it did two months earlier , which is 1.35 billion , but the price no longer is $ 130 a share .
It is $ 82 .
A drop of $ 48 a share on 1.35 billion shares is a tidy sum : $ 64.8 billion , to be exact .
What became of the wealth ?
For every share sold , one was bought .
But they were bought and sold at declining prices .
The house that was bought at $ 350,000 that cannot now be sold at $ 275,000 is still there .
It is just that the price has fallen .
Stock market wealth has fallen because stock prices have fallen .
Why have stock prices fallen ?
They have not fallen because there has been a shift in supply .
There are still the same number of shares of IBM as there were before .
There are the same number of houses .
The houses do not even have to change hands for their prices to fall .
The fact is that sellers could not find anyone willing to buy IBM shares at $ 130 .
The sellers could have refused to sell at any price less than $ 130 , but they did not .
Their urgency to sell exceeded the urgency of buyers to buy , so that the sellers gave in and sold at a lower price .
And this happened all the way down .
Why ?
Why have buyers only been willing to take stocks at lower prices and why have sellers been more willing to sell them at lower prices ?
It is this process that is recording or reflecting the wealth losses .
And it is these transactions " at the margin " that determine total market values and wealth .
Those who are not trading could have traded , but they did not .
Their inaction ratifies the transaction prices of those that do choose to trade .
The economists ’ supply and demand model is not useful for understanding specific stock prices .
The supply curve is vertical because the supply is fixed .
The demand curve is nearly horizontal .
But at what price ?
A far more useful model is the finance model that uses arbitrage pricing to price securities .
The price of a security cannot fall below or exceed the value of its future cash flows .
If the price falls below the value of the cash flows , then there can be a " free lunch " or arbitrage profit available in the market .
One can buy the stock and sell the cash flows .
If the price rises above the value of the cash flows , then there is an arbitrage profit by selling the stock and buying the cash flows .
Since free lunches ( arbitrage profits ) disappear in equilibrium , the price of a security tends to equal the value of its future cash flows .
The roots of this model reach back to the 1800s when actuaries began to understand present value .
Irving Fisher in his 1906 work The Nature of Capital and Income used the model for risky bonds .
John Burr Williams applied it to stocks in 1938 in his book The Theory of Investment Value .
A stock price today is the cost of buying a future income stream .
It prices out all the future cash flows that the security may provide .
The cash flows that a stock provides are its dividends and its future price at which it can be sold .
In some simplified versions of this model , the key determinants of stock prices are the rate of growth of dividends and the rates of return at which these are discounted so as to find their present value .
Higher growth rates make for higher stock prices .
Higher required rates of return lower stock prices .
Rather modest changes in either of these variables can cause rather large stock price changes .
Suppose a stock with a dividend of $ 1 .
If its growth rate is 6 % forever and the discount rate is 8 % , that stock is worth $ 50 .
( A growing perpetuity with dividend D has the value D/( r — g ) , where r is the required return and g is the growth rate . )
If its growth rate falls to 5 % and the discount rate increases to 9 % , that stock is worth $ 25 .
If growth disappeared completely , and the required rate of return stayed at 8 % , the stock is worth $ 12.50 .
A dividend - paying stock can fall from $ 50 to $ 12.50 or 75 % when growth expectations vanish .
Stocks are risky .
What has happened to stocks worldwide is that growth expectations have declined and discount rates have risen .
The growth rates have fallen because business conditions have turned poor .
This would not suffice to bring stock prices down so sharply if it were not for the fact that business conditions , good and bad , tend to persist .
Discount rates have risen because the risk of stock investing has risen .
There are more uncertainties now about what is happening to profits and what will happen to profits than a year ago .
The wealth has disappeared because the future cash flows are thought to have diminished considerably .
Hence , people are paying a lower price for those cash flows .
At the same time , they value them at lower prices because their assessments of risk are higher .
Why have oil and other commodity prices fallen ?
In a recession , certain businesses find that they cannot sell their products at the prices and quantities they anticipated when they produced them .
This causes their inventories to accumulate .
They begin to run sales to move the inventory .
They curtail their orders for more goods until they foresee business picking up again .
This causes demand for basic raw materials that go into many products to decline .
It is quite surprising how sharply commodity prices can rise and fall .
These items are costly to store as inventories , so that when demand shifts the price can be sharply affected .
And demand can shift suddenly because the commodities enter into the production of many items .
Anything that causes shifts in inventory accumulation or decumulation can influence prices .
On the other hand , production can often be geared up reasonably quickly , and the prices then fall back .
Certain foodstuffs are heavily influenced by weather .
Oil prices today are about where they were in October of 2006 and into 2007 .
Oil doubled in price from October of 2007 until July of 2008 .
That entire move has been reversed .
The reason for the price rise was that the world economy was booming ( as in China ) and that a number of supply restrictions were in force .
But in August of 2008 , reports surfaced about oil demand dropping , such as China ’s 7 % drop .
The supply picture is less clear .
I expressed a view about oil prices in January of 2008 because I thought that $ 200 expectations were exaggerated and that the talk of peak oil failed to take into account the known dynamics of oil prices : " I do not expect $ 200 oil any time soon .
I expect $ 85 oil first , and $ 70 oil first , and $ 50 oil first . "
Oil was then $ 100 .
It went to $ 140 and reversed .
It is now $ 63 .
I would not advise anyone to speculate in commodities who has not carefully studied the historical records of how these prices move and gone some distance in understanding why they moved when they did .
Where has the wealth gone ?
If Las Vegas or Shanghai build too many hotels , more rooms than travelers can use , the cash flows of these hotels will decline .
Their prices will decline .
The wealth that was thought to be there will diminish .
Hotel rooms do not have an absolute value .
The value can fall below what it cost to build that hotel .
The world has been on an inflationary spree .
This was obvious from newspaper reports in early 2007 that reported that China was targeting a growth rate in its M2 money supply of 16 % .
Are you kidding ?
That ’s the target ?
Other countries were doing the same .
India was running 15 — 20 % .
Today ’s news headlines tell us that Hungary ’s currency ( the florint ) has recently been hard - hit .
Is this any wonder ?
The growth rate of Hungary ’s M3 money was 110 % in 2006 !
The U.S. ran rates that were 10 — 13 percent in the 1970s .
When these were reduced , the economy ran into recessions .
Could China keep up such rates indefinitely ?
Not without creating serious inflation and economic distortions .
A serious worldwide recession was in the cards .
Where has the wealth gone ?
Into mal - investments whose value now is a great deal less than what was anticipated when they were undertaken and financed by liberal credit engineered by the world ’s inflationary central banks .

Last year I stumbled across a simple representation for partial information about values , and wrote about it in two posts , A type for partial values and Implementing a type for partial values .
Of particular interest is the ability to combine two partial values into one , combining the information present in each one .
More recently , I played with unambiguous choice , described in the previous post .
This post combines these two ideas .
It describes how to work with partial values in Haskell natively , i.e. , without using any special representation and without the use restrictions of unambiguous choice .
I got inspired to try removing those restrictions during stimulating discussions with Thomas Davie , Russell O’Connor others in the #haskell gang .
You can download and play with the library shown described here .
There are links and a bit more info on the lub wiki page .

2008 - 11 - 22 : Fixed link : Implementing a type for partial values
2008 - 11 - 22 : Tidied introduction
Information , more or less
The meanings of programming languages are often defined via a technique called “ denotational semantics ” .
In this style , one specifies a mathematical model , or semantic domain , for the meanings of utterances in the and then writes what looks like a recursive functional program that maps from syntax to semantic domain .
That “ program ” defines the semantic function .
Really , there ’s one domain and one semantic function each syntactic category .
In typed languages like Haskell , every type has an associated semantic domain .
One of the clever ideas of the theory of semantic domains ( “ domain theory ” ) is to place a partial ordering on values ( domain members ) , based on information content .
Values can not only be equal and unequal , they can also have more or less information content than each other .
The value with the least information is at the bottom of this ordering , and so is called “ bottom ” , often written as “ ⊥ ” .
In Haskell , ⊥ is the meaning of “ undefined “ .
For succinctness below , I ’ll write “ ⊥ ” instead of “ undefined ” in Haskell code .
Many types have corresponding flat domains , meaning that the only values are either completely undefined completely defined .
For instance , the Haskell type Integer is ( semantically ) flat .
Its values are all either ⊥ or integers .
Structured types are not flat .
For instance , the meaning of ( i.e. , the domain corresponding to ) the Haskell type ( Bool , Integer ) contains five different kinds of values , as shown in the figure .
Each arrow leads from a less - defined ( less informative ) value to a more - defined value .
To handle the diversity of Haskell types , define a class of types for which we know how to compute lubs .
class HasLub a where ( ⊔ ) :: a -> a -> a
The actual lub library , uses “ lub ” instead of “ ( ⊔ ) “ .
The arguments must be consistent , i.e. , must have a common upper bound .
This precondition is not checked statically or dynamically , so the programmer must take care .
Flat types
For flat types , ( ⊔ ) is equivalent to unamb ( see Functional concurrency with unambiguous choice ) , so
-- Flat types : instance HasLub ( ) where ( ⊔ ) = unamb instance HasLub Bool where ( ⊔ ) = unamb instance HasLub Char where ( ⊔ ) = unamb instance HasLub Integer where ( ⊔ ) = unamb instance HasLub Float where ( ⊔ ) = unamb ...
Pairs
Too strict
We can handle pairs easily enough :
instance ( HasLub a , HasLub b ) => HasLub ( a , b ) where ( a , b ) ⊔ ( a ' , b ' ) = ( a ⊔ a ' , b ⊔ b ' )
but we ’d be wrong !
This definition is too strict , e.g. ,
( 1,2 ) ⊔ ⊥ == ⊥
when we ’d want ( 1,2 ) .
Too lazy
No problem .
Just make the patterns lazy :
instance ( HasLub a , HasLub b ) => HasLub ( a , b ) where ~ ( a , b ) ⊔ ~ ( a ' , b ' ) = ( a ⊔ a ' , b ⊔ b ' )
Oops — wrong again .
This definition is too lazy :
⊥ ⊔ ⊥ == ( ⊥ , ⊥ )
when we ’d want ⊥ .
Almost
We can fix the too - lazy version by checking that one of the arguments is non-bottom , which is what seq does .
Which one to we check ?
The one that is n’t ⊥ , or either one if they ’re both defined .
Our friend unamb can manage this task :
instance ( HasLub a , HasLub b ) => HasLub ( a , b ) where ~ p@( a , b ) ⊔ ~ p'@ ( a ' , b' ) = ( p `unamb` p ' ) `seq` ( a ⊔ a ' , b ⊔ b ' )
But there ’s a catch ( which I realized only now ) : p and p ' may not satisfy the precondition on unamb .
( If they did , we could use ( ⊔ ) = unamb . )
Just right
To fix this last problem , check whether each pair is defined .
We ca n’t know which to check first , so test concurrently , using unamb .
instance ( HasLub a , HasLub b ) => HasLub ( a , b ) where ~ p@( a , b ) ⊔ ~ p'@ ( a ' , b' ) = ( definedP p `unamb` definedP p ' ) `seq` ( a ⊔ a ' , b ⊔ b ' )
where
definedP :: ( a , b ) ->
Bool definedP ( _ , _ ) = True
The implicit second case in that definition is definedP ⊥ = ⊥ .
Some examples :
* Data .Lub > ( ⊥ , False ) ⊔ ( True , ⊥ ) ( True , False ) * Data . Lub > ( ⊥ , (⊥ , False ) ) ⊔ ( ( ) , ( ⊥ , ⊥ ) ) ⊔ ( ⊥ , ( True , ⊥ ) ) ( ( ) , ( True , False ) )
Sums
For sums , we ’ll discriminate between lefts and rights , with the following assistants :
isL :: Either a b ->
Bool isL = either ( const True ) ( const False ) outL :: Either a b -> a outL = either id ( error " outL on Right " ) outR :: Either a b -> b outR = either ( error " outR on Left " ) id
The ( ⊔ ) method for sums unwraps its arguments as a Left or as a Right , after checking which kind of arguments it gets .
We ca n’t know which one to check first , so check concurrently :
instance ( HasLub a , HasLub b ) => HasLub ( Either a b ) where s ⊔ s' = if isL s `unamb` isL s' then Left ( outL s ⊔ outL s ' ) else Right ( outR s ⊔ outR s ' )
Exercise :
Why is the use of unamb here legal ?
Functions
A function f is said to be less ( or equally ) defined than a function g when f is less ( or equally ) defined g for every argument value .
Consequently ,
instance HasLub b => HasLub ( a -> b ) where f ⊔ g = a -> f a ⊔ g a
More succinctly :
instance HasLub b => HasLub ( a -> b ) where ( ⊔ ) = lift A2 ( ⊔)
Other types
We ’ve already handled the unit type ( ) , other flat types , pairs , sums , and functions .
Algebraic data types can be modeled via this standard set , with a technique from generic programming .
Define methods that map to and from a type in the standard set .
class HasRepr t r | t -> r where -- Required : unrepr .
repr == id repr :: t -> r -- to repr unrepr :: r -> t -- from repr
We can implement ( ⊔ ) on a type by performing a ( ⊔ ) on that type ’s standard representation , as follows :
repLub :: ( HasRepr a v , HasLub v ) => a -> a -> a a `repLub` a' = unrepr ( repr a ⊔ repr a ' ) instance ( HasRepr t v , HasLub v ) => HasLub t where ( ⊔ ) = repLub
However , this rule would overlap with all other HasLub instances , because Haskell instance selection is based only on the head of an instance definition , i.e. , the part after the “ => “ .
Instead , we ’ll define a HasLub instance per HasRepr instance .
For instance , here are encodings for Maybe and for lists :
instance HasRepr ( Maybe a ) ( Either ( ) a ) where repr Nothing = ( Left ( ) ) repr ( Just a ) = ( Right a ) unrepr ( Left ( ) ) =
Nothing unrepr ( Right a ) = ( Just a ) instance HasRepr [ a ] ( Either ( ) ( a , [ a ] ) ) where repr [ ] = ( Left ( ) ) repr ( a: as ) = ( Right ( a , as ) ) unrepr ( Left ( ) ) = [ ] unrepr ( Right ( a , as ) ) = ( a:as )
And corresponding HasLub instances :
instance HasLub a => HasLub ( Maybe a ) where ( ⊔ ) = repLub instance HasLub a => HasLub [ a ] where ( ⊔ ) = repLub
Testing :
* Data.Lub > [ 1 , ⊥,2 ] ⊔ [ ⊥ , 3,2 ] [ 1,3,2 ]

Windfarms ' unlikely ' to threaten birds
Wind turbines do not drive birds from surrounding areas , say British researchers , in findings which could make it easier to build more wind farms .
Conservation groups have raised fears that large birds could get caught in the turbines and that the structures could disturb other species .
But scientists found only one of the 23 species studied , the pheasant , was affected during their survey of two wind farms in eastern England .
The findings published in the Journal of Applied Ecology could help government and business efforts to boost the number of wind farms as a way to increase production of renewable energy .
Previous studies have concentrated on the impact of wind turbines on waterbirds and birds of prey .
" ' Much terrestrial research into the effects of wind turbines on birds has focused on geese , waders and raptors , whose populations are highest in upland and coastal areas , " says Dr Mark Whittingham , whose team from Newcastle University carried out the research .
" This is the first evidence suggesting that the present and future location of large numbers of wind turbines on European farmland is unlikely to have detrimental effects on farmland birds . "
" This should be welcome news for nature conservationists , wind energy companies and policy makers . "
Important finding
The survey studied the impact of two wind farms on about 3000 birds in the area , including five species of conservation concern - the yellowhammer , the Eurasian tree sparrow , the corn bunting , the Eurasian skylark and the common reed bunting .
The researchers recorded the density of birds at different distances from the turbines and found that aside from the pheasant , the structures posed no problems .
The new findings are important because the European Union is committed to generating 20 % of its energy from renewable resources by 2020 , at the same time it is seeking to boost biodiversity .
The study did not look at the danger of the birds colliding with the turbines , which has been a worry of conservationists , says Whittingham .
" With large numbers of wind farms needing to be built on lowland areas , the cumulative impacts on farmland bird species has the potential to be a significant constraint to development . "
The researchers also point out that their study was conducted during winter and that further studies are needed to assess the impact of wind turbines on farmland birds during the breeding season .
McCain camp demands L.A.
Times release video
John McCain 's campaign is demanding that the Los Angeles Times release a video of a party for a prominent Palestinian activist that Barack Obama attended in 2003 .
The Times described the going - away party for former University of Chicago professor , and Obama friend , Rashid Khalidi , in a story in April .
The story reported that Palestinians thought they might have a friend in Obama because of his friendships in that community , despite the fact that his positions have never been particularly pro-Palestinian .
" A major news organization is intentionally suppressing information that could provide a clearer link between Barack Obama and Rashid Khalidi , " said McCain spokesman Michael Goldfarb , citing Obama 's friendship with Khalidi , who is now a professor at Columbia University .
He said the video could , among other things , show how Obama responded to a poem recited at the party accusing Israel of " terrorism " and warning of consequences for U.S. support for Israel , which Goldfarb described as " hate speech . "
" The election is one week away , and it 's unfortunate that the press so obviously favors Barack Obama that this campaign must publicly request that the Los Angeles Times do its job — make information public , " he said .
The campaign had n't previously demanded the video , though conservative bloggers have , and neither other reporters nor McCain 's researchers have been able to dig up a copy .
Khalidi is a controversial figure , reviled by pro-Israel activists , though not a marginal one .
A former professor at the University of Chicago , he 's now Edward Said Professor of Arab Studies at Columbia , and respected by many in academia .
He 's been criticized most for saying that Palestinians have a right to resist Israeli occupation and has been described as a former P.L.O. spokesman , a label he has denied .
The paper has n't explained its unwillingness to release the video , and Peter Wallsten , who found the tape and wrote about it , declined to discuss it with me last night .
He forwarded an e-mail that the paper has sent readers who have complained as conservative blogs raise the issue .
" Over six months ago the Los Angeles Times published a detailed account of the events shown on the videotape .
The Times is not suppressing anything .
Just the opposite — the L.A. Times brought the matter to light , " wrote the readers ' representative , Jamie Gold .
L.A. Times spokeswoman Nancy Sullivan would n't discuss the decision not to release the tape in detail .
" When we reported on the tape six months ago , that was our full report , " she said , and asked , " Does Politico release unpublished information ? "
The answer to that question is yes —
Politico and most news outlets constantly make available videos and documents , after describing them in part , which is why the Times ' decision not to release the video is puzzling .
My instinct , and many reporters ' , is to share as much source material as possible .
Critics have suggested that the Times is witholding the video for political reasons , but there are other possibilities : competitive reasons , or simply out of tradition .
In the mechanics of reporting , there 's another possibility as well .
The video may have been given to the paper on the condition it not be released , or releasing it could compromise its source .

“ We define the abstract machine as the aspect or moment at which nothing but functions and matters remain .
A diagram has neither substance nor form , neither content nor expression .
Substance is a formed matter , and matter is a substance that is unformed either physically or semiotically .
Whereas expression and content have distinct forms , are really distinct from each other , function has only ‘ traits ’ of content and expression between which it establishes a connection : it is no longer even possible to tell whether it is a particle or a sign .
A matter - content having only degrees of intensity , resistance , conductivity , heating , stretching , speed or tardiness ; and a function expression having only ‘ tensors , ’ as in a system of mathematical , or musical , writing .
Writing now functions on the same level as the real , and the real materially writes .
The diagram retains the most deterritorialized content and the most deterritorialized expression , in order to conjugate them .
Maximum deterritorialization sometimes starts from a trait of content and sometimes from a trait of expression ; that trait is said to be ‘ deterritorializing ’ in relation to the other precisely because it diagrams it , carries it off , raises it to its own power .
The most deterritorialized element causes the other element to cross a threshold enabling a conjunction of their respective deterritorializations , a shared acceleration .
This is the abstract machine ’s absolute , positive deterritorialization …
“ Defined diagrammatically in this way , an abstract machine is neither an infrastructure that is determining in the last instance nor a transcendental Idea that is determining in the supreme instance .
Rather , it plays a piloting role .
The diagrammatic or abstract machine does not function to represent , even something real , but rather constructs a real that is yet to come , a new type of reality .
Thus when it constitutes points of creation or potentiality it does not stand outside history but is instead always ‘ prior to ’ history .
Everything escapes , everything creates — never alone , but through an abstract machine that produces continuums of intensity , effects conjunctions of deterritorialization , and extracts expressions and contents .
This Real - Abstract is totally different from the fictitious abstract of a supposedly pure machine of expression .
It is an Absolute , but one that is neither undifferentiated nor transcendent .
Abstract machines thus have proper names ( as well as dates ) which of course designate not persons or subjects , but matters and functions .
The name of a musician or scientist is used in the same way as a painter ’s name designates a color , nuance , tone , or intensity : it is always a question of a conjunction of a Matter and Function .
The double deterritorialization of the voice and the instrument is marked by a Wagner abstract machine , a Webern abstract machine , etc .
In physics and mathematics , we may speak of a Riemann abstract machine , and in algebra of a Galois abstract machine …
There is a diagram whenever a singular abstract machine functions directly in a matter . ”

My fellow Americans .
Regardless of how you voted this past Tuesday , the timely exit of President Bush should be something we can all agree on .
And for such a momentous occasion , a celebration is in order .
So to commemorate our new found freedom from the last eight years , the Mominatrix is encouraging you to unite together and “ Shave the Date ” — Inauguration Day , January 20 , 2009 , when we will leave no bush behind .
We , the people with pubic hair , should come together and celebrate this historic election .
Show your love for your country , and as you watch our new president take his oath and feel your satin undies against your smooth nether region , you can take pride in knowing you ’ve rid your world of bush once and for all .
Now before you run off hog wild and stockpile bottles of Nair , here are a few helpful hints to consider as you prepare to rid yourself from the shackles of your pubes .
1. Shaving can be a convenient option for moms , but it will require more attention than you might be able to spare on any given day .
Schedule a babysitter , grab your Dustbuster , and lock the bathroom door .
Definitely invest in a good razor and shaving cream , and if you have n’t shaved before , make sure to trim before going at it .
And for god sakes find a decent mirror .
2 . Some women swear by the electric clippers , and while they can make short work of your pubes , be careful .
Confidence can lead to cuts .
You ’ve already had enough trauma down there ; no need to do more damage .
3 . A bikini wax is always a great excuse to get a little alone time away from the kids .
Make sure to ask for an aesthetician recommendation before stopping at some random strip mall just because it ’s on the way home .
And consider doing a trial run ; the more waxes you have , the less painful it can be .
Either way , definitely pop a few Advil before your appointment .
4 . If you ’re feeling creative , then snag a Hair Care Down
There kit .
Not only does it provide you with all the necessary DIY pubic hair couture tools , but you can even do fancy designs .
Stars and stripes , anyone ?

The Chinese dairy scandal has reportedly spread to candy .
Dairy manufacturers had added melamine to watered - down milk to boost protein levels ; melamine , an industrial chemical , produces kidney stones and has killed a number of babies and left tens of thousands of others with kidney issues .
It 's also the chemical in the tainted pet food last year .
The Singapore Straits - Times reports that melamine has been found in White Rabbit candies , which are popular across Asia and also found in Asian grocery stores in the U.S. ( sometimes they are treats at Asian restaurants ) .
And today , the Chinese agriculture minister admitted the country 's dairy system was " out of control " sayiing " milk stations began only in recent years , the country now has no specific method of supervising them . "

Fish farmed in these ponds help keep the children of Zomba West healthy
This seems an unlikely place to go fishing for your dinner .
The dusty scrublands of Zomba
West have been brittle dry since April , when the rainy season ended .
The place is spookily deserted today - the funeral of the local chief .
In the marketplace , we find only one stall open , run by children .
And all they are selling is fish .
" When we first started fish farming - people thought it was mad - they told us it will never work here , " says Esther Fikira .
She leads me to a series of dirty green ponds , dug into the baked clay soil .
The water is murky , almost stagnant , but Esther assures me there is a big haul of tasty " chambo " ( a local delicacy ) lurking just below the surface .
" If you had only seen the benefits this community has had from eating these fish , " says the 50 - year - old , wading in , " then you will know why I will never give my pond away . "
Esther Fikira weeds out one of her fish ponds , in West Zomba Dry county
There are now 700 fish farmers like Esther here in the bushland settlements to the west of Malawi 's former colonial capital , Zomba .
You may have heard of the fiction novel Salmon Fishing in the Yemen .
Well , this is the real thing - an ambitious food security project developed by the WorldFish Centre , a member of the Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research ( CGIAR ) .
They are introducing small - scale aquaculture to ensure families in Malawi have enough food and income to buy maize - even in years when droughts affect their crops .
The project assists farmers by digging small , rain - fed ponds of about 10x15 m on their land , or anywhere the soil is suitable for retaining water .
Families like Esther 's use the ponds to rear common fish species - which in Malawi means chambo ( a species of tilapia ) and mlamba ( catfish ) .
At World Fish 's local headquarters , just along the road , Dr Daniel Jamu and his team of scientists are breeding new varieties of chambo - selected to grow fast , fat , and feed happily on whatever waste is left over from households .
Esther uses manure from her goats and chickens to keep the pond high in nutrients which allow plankton to thrive .
The fish eat the plankton , and when they grow to full size , they are harvested , usually every six months .
Fish are now a source of income for families in West Zomba Trading up
She sells most of her fish - raising enough money to buy maize when the harvest is poor , and to help feed and clothe the orphaned children she takes in .
" Before we had the ponds , this area suffered from a lot of poverty , " she explains .
" We did n't eat meat , and we lacked any source of income .
" But with the coming of the fish ponds , we had so much leftover to sell , I had enough money left over to buy fertiliser , with the government subsidy . "
When the ponds are emptied , a rich layer of silt can be dug from the base - to use as fertiliser .
Esther uses hers to grow maize , which in turn ensures that her goats and chickens keep popping out manure for the pond .
It 's a perfect circle .
" Or what we call an integrated agriculture - aquaculture ( IAA ) system , " says Joseph Nagoli , of World Fish .
" This is n't high input fish farming .
This is simple and sustainable . "
Previous attempts to introduce aquaculture in Malawi have failed , he says , " because people who took up fish farming thought there was no longer any need to grow maize .
The message was wrong .
Now we see fish is just one part of a family 's agriculture " .
Their latest research project aims to quantify the nutritional value of different species of tilapia .
Silt from the fish ponds is used to keep soils fertile for crop planting Healthy harvest
The fish supply essential protein , calcium , and vitamin A - essential for children and the elderly , and those with HIV / Aids .
Almost one - fifth of Malawians aged 15 - 49 are infected , and each year tens of thousands die of the disease .
But good nourishment can prolong the life of HIV / Aids patients by up to eight years , according to research by the World Health Organisation .
World Fish has introduced aquaculture to 1,200 HIV affected families in Malawi - doubling their average annual income and increasing their intake of fish by 150 % .
Esther has already seen the impacts first hand .
" The nutritional impact of the fish was very obvious - on the children , the elderly , and most especially on those with HIV / Aids , " she says .
" I have a neighbour who was very sick .
Now she is able to work in the fields - to make a living . "
The challenge now , says Nagoli , is to expand aquaculture from " a sector to an industry " .
World Fish has a target of 8,000 households in Malawi - equivalent to 40,000 people .
Daniel Jamu oversees tilapia breeding at the World Fish research centre Fortunately , there is already a healthy appetite for fish among the country 's 11 million population .
Malawi may be landlocked , but it has had a thriving fishing industry , based largely in Lake Malawi and Lake Chilwa .
" It may surprise you to know , that the biggest source of protein for Malawians is not chicken or beef , but fish , " says Dr Jeffrey Luhanga , technical controller of Malawi's Ministry of Agriculture .
" We have a policy - a fish every day . "
But just as staple crops are under threat from climate change and over - intensive farming practices , so too is Malawi 's fishing industry .
Out of stock Lake Chilwa provides around 20 % of the country 's catch - 17,000 tonnes - but at a depth of just 7 m , it is highly vulnerable to drought - having completely dried up as recently as 1995 .
" Nobody knows what will happen with climate change , " concedes Mr Nagoli .
Meanwhile , the lake 's fish stocks are already suffering from over - fishing and environmental degradation .
FEEDING FEARS
Malawi's struggle for food security
The lake 's resident population of fishermen - who live in floating reed huts , on the marshy shorelines of Chisi island - are watching their livelihoods evaporate .
As dusk falls , I cross to the island by motor boat , weaving through the reeds , until we find a fire alight in one of the floating huts .
" The catch is not good , " says Mr Irons - an elderly veteran , who uses traps to catch his tilapia .
" The other fishermen use nets , and they are taking all the catch .
I get bigger fish , but I do n't get as many . "
He worries for his family .
They live miles away and he sees them very rarely .
If the stocks dry up , he wo n't have any income to support them .
World Fish are working to introduce sustainable fishing practices - to ensure the survival of both the fish and the fishermen .
" Urban " fish farming could be the key to their success in the longterm - by easing the burden on Lake Chilwa 's precious natural resources .
" You know the old saying , " says Dr Luhanga .
" Give a man a fish and you feed him for a day .
" Teach him how to fish and you feed him for a lifetime . "

Washington DC , November 14 , 2008 - Forty - six years ago , a month before the Cuban Missile crisis , Soviet leaders put their strategic forces on their “ highest readiness stage since the beginning of the Cold War , ” according to a newly declassified internal history of the National Security Agency published today for the first time by the National Security Archive .
Possibly responding to President Kennedy ’s call for reserves , perhaps worried that the White House had discovered Moscow ’s plans to deploy missiles on Cuba , the Kremlin kept forces on alert for 10 days , beginning on September 11 , 1962 .

The Navy wanted to see if this ship was seaworthy , so it not carrying NSA officers on board .
Used in patrols of the Caribbean and Latin America , the Oxford was in Cuban waters during the Cuban Missile Crisis .

The NSA ’s signals intelligence ( SIGINT ) history also discloses that , a month later , on October 15th , the Soviets initiated a “ precautionary , preliminary ” alert , perhaps because Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev feared that U.S. intelligence had discovered the missiles .
After President Kennedy ’s speech on October 22nd 1962 , announcing the “ quarantine ” ( blockade ) of Cuba , the Kremlin put military forces , especially air defense forces , on an “ extraordinarily high state of alert . ”
Significantly , “ offensive forces avoided assuming the highest readiness stage , as if to insure that Kennedy understood that the USSR would not launch first . ”
In response to a declassification request by the National Security Archive , the secretive National Security Agency has declassified large portions of a four - part “ top- secret Umbra ” study , American Cryptology during the Cold War .
Despite major redactions , this history discloses much new information about the agency ’s history and the role of SIGINT and communications intelligence ( COMINT ) during the Cold War .
Researched and written by NSA historian Thomas Johnson , the three parts released so far provide a frank assessment of the history of the Agency and its forerunners , warts - and - all .
According to National Security Archive visiting fellow Matthew Aid ( author of the forthcoming history The Secret Sentry : The Top Secret History of the National Security Agency ) , Johnson ’s study shows “ refreshing openness and honesty , acknowledging both the NSA ’s impressive successes and abject failures during the Cold War . ”
Another striking feature of Johnson ’s study is the candor with which it discusses the fractious and damaging relationships between the agencies which make up the U.S. government ’s intelligence establishment .
Among the successes and failures disclosed by Johnson ’s history are : After the end of World War II , with Soviet codes still unbreakable , the U.S. Army and Navy SIGINT organizations had relatively little to listen to .
Johnson ’s history reveals that as of mid-1946 , the most productive source available to the U.S. Army SIGINT organization was French communications , which accounted for half of the finished reporting going to intelligence consumers in Washington .
SIGINT coverage of the Soviet Union and the Peoples Republic of China by the Air Force Security Agency ( an NSA predecessor ) during the early 1950s was so bad that a senior CIA official referred to this period as “ the dark ages for communications intelligence . ”
The discovery of high - level Soviet spies operating inside the Australian government in 1947 led the U.S. to cut off Australian access to classified U.S. government information , which was not resumed until two years later in 1949 .
Full SIGINT cooperation with Australia did not resume until 1953 ; according to Johnson , the Australian - American intelligence rift “ had a deleterious affect on early U.S. SIGINT efforts against the Peoples Republic of China . "
During the 1950s , relations between senior officials at the CIA and NSA were at times so bad that they impeded cooperation between the two agencies .
The CIA deliberately cut NSA out of the famous Berlin Tunnel operation ( 1954 - 1956 ) , with NSA ’s director , General Ralph Canine , finding out about the operation from the New York Times after the Soviets discovered the Tunnel in April 1956 .
By the early 1960s , the NSA was beginning to encounter information overload as more and more intercepted messages were stored in huge warehouses of magnetic tapes .
According to Johnson , “ the volume of unprocessed … tape was becoming difficult to manage technically and was embarrassing politically . ”
The Cuban Missile Crisis of 1962 was a major strategic intelligence failure for NSA .
SIGINT provided no warning of the presence of Soviet nuclear - armed intermediate and medium - range ballistic missiles in Cuba prior to their discovery by U - 2 reconnaissance aircraft ; according to Johnson , this “ marked the most significant failure of SIGINT to warn national leaders since World War II . ”
In April 1975 , as the North Vietnamese military prepared for the final offensive to capture the beleaguered South Vietnamese capital of Saigon , ambassador Graham Martin refused to believe SIGINT reporting which clearly indicated that the offensive was about to commence , arguing that the intercepts were a “ deception . ”
He believed that North Vietnamese wanted a coalition government , not military victory .
The offensive began on April 26 , 1975 .
Three days later , Saigon fell .
Even though the 1970s was a period of lower budgets and dramatic personnel reductions for NSA , it regained some degree of access to Soviet encrypted communications during the late 1970s .
A sentence that the Agency did not delete hints at this and other major cryptanalytic successes “ Even with decreased money , cryptology was yielding the best information that it had produced since World War II . ”
Ten days before the Soviet Union invaded Afghanistan on 28 December 1979 , U.S. intelligence agencies provided “ specific warning ” of the invasion .
The post - mortems evaluating intelligence estimates of the Soviet invasion “ were unanimous in describing [ them ] as an intelligence success . ”
During the 1960s and early 1970s , the NSA officials who ran the Agency ’s domestic watch - list / eavesdropping program ( Minaret ) disguised the origin of their reports because they “ seemed to understand that the operation was disreputable if not outright illegal . ”
The NSA released the first three parts of American Cryptology during the Cold War in response to a mandatory review request filed by the National Security Archive .
The excisions are currently under appeal , both at the NSA as well as the Interagency Security Classification Appeals Panel .
With book four of the history recently completed , the Archive has also requested its declassification .
The National Security Agency during the Cold War
Commentary by Matthew M. Aid
The NSA ’s SIGINT station in Sinop ( circa 1964 ) was one of several sites in Turkey that monitored Soviet missile tests at Kapustin Yar ( photo from collection of Matthew Aid ) ..
Dr. Thomas R. Johnson ’s four - part top secret codeword history of the National Security Agency , American Cryptology during the Cold War , 1945 - 1989 ) , three parts of which have been released to date , is a unique and invaluable study for readers interested in the history of U.S. intelligence during the Cold War or for those who are simply interested in the role of the secretive National Security Agency in the U.S. government .
U.S. intelligence agencies have produced numerous single - volume histories , usually published at the unclassified level and meant for public distribution .
In all but a few cases , these histories tend to be tendentious and emphasize all positive aspects of their agency ’s accomplishments while ignoring all of the mistakes and miscues endemic to U.S. intelligence history .
For example , most unclassified histories produced by the Central Intelligence Agency ’s Center for the Study of Intelligence ( CSI ) have focused on those historical episodes or intelligence collection systems , which were unqualified successes , such as the histories of the U - 2 reconnaissance aircraft and the recently declassified internal history of the 1954 - 1956 Berlin Tunnel Project .
( Note 1 ) But the CIA has consistently refused to declassified any of its histories on the less successful episodes in the Agency ’s history , such as the CIA ’s spectacular failures attempting to conduct clandestine intelligence gathering ( or human intelligence , HUMINT ) and covert action operations inside the USSR and Eastern Europe during the 1940s and 1950s , or within the Peoples Republic of China during the 1950s and 1960s .
( Note 2 ) Sadly , the Agency ’s reluctance to release these and other critical internal histories was reinforced by the negative publicity that the Agency garnered when it released in 2007 the so - called “ Family Jewels ” documents concerning CIA improper or illegal activities prior to 1973 .
One of the things that make Dr. Johnson ’s history unique among official histories is its refreshing openness and honesty , acknowledging both the NSA ’s impressive successes ( Johnson states that “ No other intelligence source had the revolutionary impact of SIGINT ” ( Book I , p. 1 ) and abject failures during the Cold War .
For example , the Johnson history frankly acknowledges that one of the single greatest impediments to an effective U.S. national signals intelligence ( SIGINT ) effort during the Cold was a lack of cooperation and unity of effort within the U.S. intelligence community .
This fractious relationship dates back to before the beginning of World War II , when the U.S. Army and Navy SIGINT organizations refused to cooperate with one another ( see Book I , pp. 3 - 7 ) .
Internecine warfare amongst the three military services stalled the creation in May 1949 of America ’s first unified SIGINT agency , the Armed Forces Security Agency ( AFSA ) , then left it bereft of any meaningful power or influence .
Not surprisingly , AFSA was an abject failure as an institution , and was disbanded three and one - half years late in October 1952 in favor of a new and truly unified SIGINT organization , the National Security Agency ( NSA ) ( Book I , pp. 23-35 ) .
Early Cold War Johnson ’s history provides some tantalizing glimpses , for example , into NSA ’s cryptologic successes and failures against the Soviet Union during the Cold War ( Book I , pp. 157-194 ) .
The report describes the genesis of NSA ’s attack on Soviet codes and ciphers during World War II , including details about the Anglo - American solution of the Venona one - time pad ciphers used by the KGB during World War II .
Unfortunately , so far NSA has refused to declassify the portion of Dr. Johnson ’s history pertaining to “ Black Friday , ” when Army intelligence discovered the across - the - board change of Soviet codes and ciphers in October 1948 .
This effectively wiped out all Anglo - American cryptanalytic access to Moscow ’s high - level communications .
The history is also silent about the fact that it took NSA almost thirty years before it was able to solve Soviet high - level cipher systems again .
Nevertheless , NSA has released some discussion , albeit in a highly redacted form , of its successes in monitoring Soviet missile tests , finding Soviet ICBM launch sites , tracking Soviet submarines , and the critical SIGINT support that NSA provided to the CIA ’s U - 2 overflights of the Soviet Union between 1956 and 1960 .
While U.S. Army and Navy SIGINT specialists were trying to crack Soviet codes after the end of World War II , they had relatively little to listen to .
Johnson ’s history reveals that as of mid-1946 , the most productive source available to the U.S. Army SIGINT organization was French communications , which accounted for half of the finished reporting going to intelligence consumers in Washington .
( Book I , p. 10 ) The history shows that AFSA ’s performance during the Korean War ( 1950 - 1953 ) was marked by occasional successes and a series of shocking failures ( Book I , pp. 43 - 56 ) .
The Agency provided no warning that North Korea intended to invade South Korea in June 1950 because it was paying no attention to Korea .
AFSA provided vitally important intelligence during the Battle of the Pusan Perimeter ( August - September 1950 ) , but the intelligence it generated in October - November 1950 indicating that Communist China intended to intervene militarily in the Korea was ignored or badly misinterpreted by senior U.S. government officials and military officials , including General Douglas MacArthur .
The report shows that for the first year of the war , AFSA experienced considerable success breaking North Korean ciphers , but curiously NSA refused to declassify the fact that throughout the entire Korean War AFSA ’s cryptanalysts were unable to break any significant Chinese military cipher systems .
The situation changed dramatically in the summer of 1951 when AFSA lost its access to North Korean traffic ; the enemy changed all its codes and ciphers to unbreakable one - time pad cipher systems .
This meant that for the remaining two years of the Korean War AFSA was forced to depend on low - level voice intercept and traffic analysis for virtually everything that it knew about the Chinese and North Korean militaries .
And finally , the Johnson history reveals ( but the reader has to read between the lines ) that the U.S. refused to assist the South Korean military in forming its own SIGINT service because of security concerns .
Chinese communications systems , as well as Soviet , remained a tough problem for the AFSA .
The AFSA ’s SIGINT coverage of the Soviet Union and the Peoples Republic of China during the early 1950s was so bad that a senior CIA official referred to this period as “ the dark ages for communications intelligence . ”
( Book I , p. 61 ) In any event , NSA was not doing well with the information that it had .
According to Johnson ’s account , the Agency ’s early SIGINT reporting to consumers left much to be desired , with a 1953 report stating that NSA intelligence product was “ generally so cluttered with qualifying expressions as to virtually preclude their use by a consumer . ” ( Book I , p. 70 ) As NSA became more and more technically proficient , it created a problem that was even more serious than anodyne reporting .
By the early 1960s , the Agency was experiencing an information overload as it stored more and more intercepted messages in huge warehouses of magnetic tapes .
According to Johnson , “ the volume of unprocessed … tape was becoming difficult to manage technically and was embarrassing politically . ”
( Book II , p. 373 ) This was a problem that would bedevil the NSA for decades .
Cuban Missile Crisis NSA ’s performance during the Cuban Missile Crisis ( Book II , pp. 317-332 ) was superior , especially in the important area of tracking the movements of Soviet merchant ships carrying Soviet troops , weapons and equipment to Cuba .
Nevertheless , the Johnson history reveals that SIGINT picked up no indication that the Soviets had placed offensive ballistic missiles in Cuba prior to their being discovered by a CIA U - 2 reconnaissance aircraft in October 1962 .
This failure had significant implications because since the first days of the Eisenhower administration , the U.S. intelligence community had depended on NSA for 90 percent of their intelligence information warning of a Soviet strategic threat to the U.S. Dr. Johnson concludes that “ SIGINT warning , so highly touted during the Eisenhower administration , failed in Cuba . ”
Despite the NSA ’s failure , it kept the White House and the Pentagon informed of Soviet military activities .
Disclosed for the first time in the NSA account is that U.S. intelligence tracked the readiness condition of Soviet air defense and strategic forces during the Crisis .
What has remained secret for years is that Soviet forces went on high alert three times during September and October 1962 .
The first was on 11 September 1962 , when for ten days “ Soviet forces went into their highest readiness stage since the beginning of the Cold War , ” perhaps because the Soviets believed that U.S. intelligence had learned about the missile deployments .
Especially telling is that also on 11 September , the Kremlin publicized its apprehension that President Kennedy ’s request to Congress for stand - by authority to call up reservists foreshadowed an attack on Cuba , which the Soviets said was grounds for war .
( Note 3 ) Another alert of a more “ precautionary , preliminary ” nature began on 15 October , perhaps also because Khrushchev supposed that the missiles had been discovered .
Finally , after Kennedy ’s speech , Soviet forces went on an “ extraordinarily high state of alert , ” with the emphasis on air defense forces .
Significantly , “ offensive forces avoided assuming the highest readiness stage , as if to insure that Kennedy understood that the USSR would not launch first . ” ( Book II , p. 331 ) Johnson ’s account of the Missile Crisis illuminates a failure of intelligence cooperation , which is a major theme in his study .
On October 23 , 1962 , with the Cuban Missile Crisis at its height , the Director of Naval Intelligence failed to inform the White House or Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara that new High - Frequency Direction Finding ( HFDF ) data showed that many of the Soviet merchant ships bound for Cuba had already stopped dead in the water or had turned back for Russia .
The Secretary of Defense discovered this huge mistake the next day , with Johnson noting that “ McNamara was furious , and he subjected Admiral Anderson , the Chief of Naval Operations , to an abusive tirade .
So many years have passed that it is impossible to determine why the Navy held up information that seemed critical to the president ’s decisions . ” ( Book II , p. 329 ) SIGINT at the White House An important development that began during the 1960s was the growing use of SIGINT at the White House .
Over the objections of the CIA and State Department , President Lyndon Johnson insisted that NSA transmit SIGINT directly to the White House Situation Room .
Johnson may have been the “ most avid consumer of intelligence ever to occupy the White House ” and he read SIGINT constantly to support his decisions during the Vietnam War .
SIGINT would continue to be available to White House officials in the years that followed , although they would use it in different ways .
For example , Richard Nixon was not interested in reading intelligence reporting and his security assistant Henry Kissinger was not as “ experienced ” with SIGINT as his predecessor Walt Rostow had been .
The Johnson history is critical of the way that Kissinger handled SIGINT : his reports to Nixon would “ subsume [ SIGINT ] into a mishmash of sources ” and not highlight it as Johnson ’s advisers had .
( Book II , pp. 353-354 and 486 )
In spite of a declining ability to generate high - level intelligence about what was going on inside the USSR and China , codebreaking efforts against targets in the Third World improved dramatically ( Book II , pp. 425-475 ) .
For example , SIGINT provided important intelligence information prior to and during the 1967 Middle East War .
Moreover , SIGINT helped U.S. intelligence monitor developments in the Warsaw Pact .
During the summer of 1968 , SIGINT reporting coming out of NSA clearly showed that growing numbers of Soviet and Warsaw Pact troops were being deployed along the borders of Czechoslovakia .
The invasion did not take the White House by surprise ( it had “ strategic warning ” ) , but the CIA did not provide advance warning because CIA analysts refused to accept the possibility that the Soviets would invade the country ( although a minority believed otherwise ( Note 4 ) ) .
( Book II , pp. 454-461 ) .
Interestingly , SIGINT also picked up what some U.S. analysts saw as possible Soviet move against Romania , which led President Johnson to make a public warning to Moscow .
( Book II , p. 462 )
The growing NSA presence greatly increased the vulnerability of its operators to physical harm .
In June 1967 , Israeli aircraft and torpedo boats attacked the NSA spy ship USS Liberty , killing 34 crewmembers , including 25 military and civilian cryptologists .
Dr. Johnson concludes that based on the available SIGINT that the Israelis did not know that the ship they were attacking was a U.S. Navy ship .
In January 1968 , the North Koreans seized the U.S. Navy spy ship USS Pueblo , which Johnson correctly describes as an intelligence disaster of unparalleled proportions .
Then in January 1969 , a North Korean MiG - 21 fighter shot down a U.S. Navy EC - 121 SIGINT aircraft , killing all 31 crewmembers , including nine military cryptologists .
Johnson devotes a significant amount of space to NSA ’s involvement in the Vietnam War , beginning with the arrival of the first American SIGINT personnel in 1961 and concluding with the fall of Saigon in 1975 ( Book II , pp. 495-584 ) .
One of the major revelations stemming from Dr. Johnson ’s review is that SIGINT was the principal driver of the U.S. military ’s counterinsurgency operations in South Vietnam throughout the war , with most of the Army ’s major search - and - destroy missions being predicated on intelligence derived from SIGINT .
( Book II , pp. 534-538 ) .
On the controversial August 1964 Tonkin Gulf incidents , which served as the predicate for America ’s entry into the Vietnam War , Dr. Johnson concludes that : “ The White House had started a war on the basis of unconfirmed ( and later - to - be - determined probably invalid ) information . ” ( Book II , p. 522 ) ( Note 5 ) NSA ’s ability to locate North Vietnamese and Viet Cong troop concentrations in South Vietnam and Laos and track their movements via SIGINT is discussed in detail , which led to a number of major battlefield successes during the war .
Dr. Johnson reveals that SIGINT was able to provide significant advance warning of virtually all NVA / VC offensives from 1966 until the end of the war in 1975 ( p. 539 ) ; SIGINT was the only reliable source of intelligence concerning the number of North Vietnamese troops coming down the Ho Chi Minh Trail from the fall of 1967 onwards ( Book II , pp. 539-540 ) ; and NSA provided 55 % of all targeting information for U.S. bombers during the Vietnam War ( p. 583 ) .
The history also confirms that NSA provided advanced warning of the North Vietnamese Tet Offensive in January 1968 , but President Johnson and the CIA in Washington , along with General William Westmoreland in Saigon , appear to have discounted NSA reporting that the NVA and VC were about to launch a nationwide offensive .
Instead , they held that the upcoming offensive would focus on U.S. forces further north .
( pp. 562-563 ) .
The Johnson history also reveals that U.S. military SIGINT units in Vietnam were heavily dependent on South Vietnamese translators to intercept and process enemy radio traffic , but , as in the Korean War , the U.S. government , at NSA ’s urging , forbade giving SIGINT - derived intelligence to the South Vietnamese government or military ( pp. 509-510 ) .
Another intelligence failure occurred at the end of the Vietnam conflict .
In April 1975 , as the North Vietnamese military prepared for the final offensive to capture the beleaguered South Vietnamese capital of Saigon , the U.S. ambassador in Saigon , Graham Martin , refused to believe NSA SIGINT reporting indicating that the North Vietnamese offensive was about to begin .
Believing that the North Vietnamese wanted a coalition government , not a military victory , Martin argued that the intercepts were a “ NVA deception . ”
The NVA offensive began on April 26 , 1975 .
Three days later , Saigon fell .
( Book III , p. 9 ) The 1970s
The NSA ’s declassification staff heavily redacted Book III covering the turbulent decade of the 1970s .
Nevertheless , one can find a number of interesting tidbits sandwiched among the deletions .
For example , the brief but interesting section on NSA ’s domestic eavesdropping programs ( Shamrock and Minaret ) , includes a telling quote on p. 85 : “ Years later the NSA lawyer who first looked at the procedural aspects stated that the people involved [ in Minaret ] seemed to understand that the operation was disreputable if not outright illegal . ”
Dr. Johnson also details NSA ’s fractious relations with the various congressional committees established during the mid-1970s to investigate abuses by the U.S. intelligence community , which involved unprecedented public testimony by NSA officials before the Church Committee ( although the Committee gave them two days of rehearsal ! ) .
Johnson also covers the effort to bring domestic intercepts more squarely under the rule of law , with the passing of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act ( FISA ) in 1978 ( Book III , pp. 94 , 106-107 ) .
Despite the fact that the 1970s was a period of lower budgets and dramatic personnel reductions at Fort Meade , the Agency finally regained some degree of access to Soviet encrypted communications during the Carter administration in the late 1970s .
This and a number of other major cryptanalytic successes are hinted at in a sentence that NSA did not delete from Dr. Johnson ’s text , which stated : “ Even with decreased money , cryptology was yielding the best information that it had produced since World War II . ” ( Book III , p. vii ) .
Also surviving the security review is some of the discussion of the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan .
According to Johnson , “ Generalized warnings [ of an invasion ] had begun in September , and specific warnings preceded the operation by at least ten days . ”
Thus , intelligence post - mortems “ were unanimous in describing it as intelligence success . ” ( p. 254 ) ( Note 6 ) Inter - Agency Rivalries
The NSA ’s facility in Teufelsberg , Berlin , 1990 .
Built on the rubble of bombed - out buildings from World War II in then - occupied West Berlin , Teufelsberg gave U.S. intelligence access to communications of the former German Democratic Republic ( GDR ) and its alliance relations with the former Soviet Union ( photo from collection of Matthew Aid ) .
As indicated earlier , the Johnson history shows in stark detail that NSA ’s relations with the U.S. military and the U.S. intelligence community was often troubled .
For example , the coverage of the NSA ’s relationship with the U.S. Air Force during the early 1950s provides a history of nearly constant internecine warfare over whether NSA had the authority to control the USAF ’s SIGINT activities ( Book I , pp. 80 - 83 ) .
The Johnson study also shows how the National Reconnaissance Office ( NRO ) , along with the CIA , marginalized the NSA when it sent up SIGINT satellites .
Despite NSA ’s responsibilities , it had very little management or tasking responsibility for the first generation of SIGINT satellites sent into orbit by the NRO in the early 1960s .
According to Johnson , “ NSA was still a minor player .
It had very few cleared people , and its only responsibility was to process and report ELINT data . ” ( Book II , p. 405 ) Most revealing are details ( hidden amidst a blizzard of deletions by the CIA ) concerning NSA ’s series of no-holds barred bureaucratic turf battles with the CIA and its predecessors that began immediately after the end of World War II and continued without interruption right up until the 9/11 terrorist attacks in September 2001 ( Book I , pp. 86-107 ; Book II , pp. 341-343 ) .
The Berlin Tunnel episode provides a starting example .
The CIA deliberately cut NSA out of the famous Berlin Tunnel operation ( 1954 - 1956 ) , with NSA ’s director , General Ralph Canine , finding out about the operation from the New York Times after the Soviets discovered the Tunnel in April 1956 .
This episode only served to further upset the already rancorous CIA - NSA relationship , with the Johnson history noting that General Canine “ was understandably upset when he found out that he had been bypassed and left in the dark . ”
( Book I , p. 106 ) Even a NSA - CIA “ peace treaty ” signed in 1977 , details of which are deleted from the history , failed to put an end to the seemingly never - ending battles between the two agencies ( Book III , pp. 224-231 ) .
This lack of unity of effort plagued NSA ’s SIGINT collection and analytic efforts throughout and after the Cold War , to the ultimate detriment of U.S. national security .
On one of Washington ’s most important intelligence relationships , the Anglo - American connection , the history includes a brief but revealing discussion of the interactions of NSA ’s predecessors with some of its English - speaking SIGINT partners , and the difficulties they experienced in fashioning a postwar SIGINT alliance that focused on a new target – the USSR .
( Book I , pp. 13 -19 )
The late 1945 Gouzenko spy scandal delayed U.S. acceptance of Canada as a full - fledged cryptologic partner until Ottawa signed a separate SIGINT - sharing agreement ( the CANUSA Agreement ) in the fall of 1949 .
The discovery of high - level Soviet spies operating inside the Australian government in 1947 led the U.S. to cut off Australian access to classified U.S. government information for two years .
Full U.S. - Australia SIGINT cooperation did not resume until 1953 , with Johnson noting that the rift “ had a deleterious affect on early U.S. SIGINT efforts against the Peoples Republic of China . ” ( Book I , pp. 16-19 ) Unlike the CIA , where the Agency ’s censors religiously delete all information concerning the size of the Agency ’s staff and budget , considerable detail concerning the organization and manpower strength of NSA are revealed for the first time in Dr. Johnson ’s history , confirming that the Agency for most of the Cold War was the single largest and most expensive component of the U.S. intelligence community ( Book I , pp. 63-67 ; Book II , pp. 293-294 ) .
NSA reached its historic peak strength in 1969 , with 93,067 military and civilian cryptologists working for the Agency and the three military service cryptologic agencies that were subordinate to NSA .
( Book II , p. 293 ) .
While NSA ’s decision to release the Johnson history is commendable , the many and frequently lengthy excisions gives pause for thought .
No doubt , much about the NSA ’s history necessarily remains secret , but the copious excisions make one suspect that the security reviewers have gone too far .
For example , after 60 years , NSA should be able to release something about “ Black Friday . ”
Moreover , excisions about the Berlin Tunnel project ( Book I , 104 - 105 ) fly in the face of the CIA ’s declassification of its internal history of that well - known operation .
( Note 7 ) Another futile excision concerns verification problems raised by the SALT ( Strategic Arms Limitation Talks ) II Agreement .
( Book III , pp. 202-206 , and pp. 219 ff )
No doubt , much of the deleted information concerns the impact of the 1979 Iranian revolution and the loss of SIGINT facilities which played a major role in tracking Soviet ICBM tests , especially intercepting missile telemetry .
Given that the memoirs of President Jimmy Carter and former Secretary of State Cyrus Vance included frank discussions of the Iranian listening posts , it should be relatively easy for the NSA to declassify some information on SALT II verification .
Not all of the excisions , however , are NSA ’s responsibility .
The many “ OGA ” [ Other Government Agency ] excisions are evidence of the CIA ’s security review .
The first three parts of American Cryptology during the Cold War were released to the National Security Archive through a mandatory review request .
To challenge the significant excisions , the Archive filed appeals , which led NSA to release more information from book II and III .
The Archive has appealed the many excisions that remain with the Interagency Security Classification Appeals Panel .
NSA has not yet complete work on the Archive ’s appeal of book I , apparently because of delays at the Central Intelligence Agency .
With book 4 recently completed , the Archive has requested the NSA to release it as well .
Matthew Aid , a visiting scholar at the National Security Archive , has written extensively on the history of the National Security Agency and U.S. SIGINT programs for Intelligence and National Security , among other scholarly journals .
His book , The Secret Sentry : The Top Secret History of the National Security Agency will be published by Bloomsbury in early 2009 .
He thanks John Prados and Jeff Richelson for their comments .

1 . A significant exception is Harold Ford ’s CIA and the Vietnam Policymakers : Three Episodes , 1962 - 1968 ( CIA History Staff : Center for the Study of Intelligence , 1998 ) which reviews the intelligence controversies , warts and all , even the role of DCI John McCone in “ distort[ing ] ” the findings of a National Intelligence Estimate so that it had a less pessimistic take on the degree of progress in South Vietnam .
2 . For example , so far the CIA has refused to declassify most of the contents of a major history , " Office of Policy Coordination , 1948 - 1952 , " although a pending appeal before the Interagency Security Classification Appeals Panel could lead to a reversal .

5 . It is worth noting that there are interesting differences between Johnson ’s account of the Gulf of Tonkin incident ( as well as the Tet offensive ) and that offered by NSA historian Robert Hanyok in “ Skunks , Bogies , Silent Hounds , and the Flying Fish : The Gulf of Tonkin Mystery , 2 - 4 August 1964 , ” at http://www.nsa.gov/vietnam/releases/relea00012.pdf, and in Spartans in Darkness : American SIGINT and the Indochina War , 1945 - 1975 ( National Security Agency : Center for Cryptological History . 2002 ) , at http://www.fas.org/irp/nsa/spartans/index.html.
For example , while Hanyok argues that NSA officials manipulated intelligence on the August 4 events in the Tonkin Gulf , Johnson suggests that the analysts misinterpreted North Vietnamese messages .
6 . According to a CIA study by Douglas MacEachin ’s study , Afghanistan was a collection success but an analytical failure ; see Predicting the Soviet Invasion of Afghanistan : The Intelligence Community 's Record ( Central Intelligence Agency : Center for the Study of Intelligence , 2002 ) .

NAIROBI , Kenya  On Tuesday morning , Jerome R. Corsi was all set to bash Senator Barack Obama on his ancestral soil .
Mr. Corsi , a right - wing author who specializes in attack books , came to Kenya to publicize his newest work , “ The Obama Nation , ” which raises pointed questions about Mr. Obama ’s history of drug use , his “ extensive connections ” to Islam and his relationships with Kenyan politicians , among other things  allegations that Mr. Obama ’s campaign and others have widely disputed .
The chairs and microphone were all set up in one of the biggest hotels in Nairobi , the capital .
Many journalists had crowded in to hear what Mr. Corsi would say about Mr. Obama , the Democratic presidential candidate whose father was Kenyan and who is adored here like a native son .
But it was not to be .
A few minutes before Mr. Corsi was to speak , more than 20 Kenyan immigration agents swooped into the hotel and arrested him .
He was whisked off to the immigration office , where officials said he had misled them on his entry papers .
By the end of the day , Mr. Corsi ’s aides said that he was being booted from the country .
Dear Sheikh Muhammad al - Habadan
BBC reports that you have recently called on women in Saudi Arabia to “ wear a full veil , or niqab , that reveals only one eye . ”
You say that “ showing both eyes encourage [s ] women to use eye make - up to look seductive . ”
I believe , sir , that showing only one eye will make matters worse .
You see , whenever a woman and a man are together and the woman blinks , the man might think that she is winking .
Is the hidden eye open or closed ?
If it is assumed to be normally open , then a momentary closing of the visible eye could be assumed to be a wink .
If it is assumed to be normally closed , then the woman may be considered to be perpetually winking , which is equally problematic .
I have an alternative solution to your problem .
I suggest that you introduce veils for men that cover both their eyes .
That way it will make no difference if the women are winking , blinking or , heaven forbid , naked .
Good idea , no ?
You ’re welcome .
Regards
Amit Varma

Developing Design Oftentimes , the word “ design ” is seen as being synonymous with “ appearance . ”
It is with this mentality that many companies run their businesses – separating design ( or appearance ) from development ( functionality ) .
However , in the world of interactive and web design , functionality plays an equally significant role in the design process .
Looking out from the top of the office block , the commander surveyed the troop placements on the street below and on the map pinned to the table in front of him .
Two days ago they had got word of the disease outbreak and scattered reports of increased violence .
Although no one was officially correlating the two together , Blake knew how to count .
With the full effect of martial law in place , he had issued a city wide curfew , with movement strictly limited to emergencies only while the med teams began to sweep the buildings .
The radio crackled to life “ Sir contact on 48th street , residents breaking curfew , they look to be pretty badly injured .
Apparently they got attacked by some crack head sir , he bit and lashed out at them , orders on how to proceed ? ”
Blake waved at the radio op guy who issued a med-evac unit out to the area , as he finished the orders a second squad reported in “ Sir , 18th street , I have civilians running down the street toward me , several wounded , others following behind them at a slower click . ”
The radio lapsed into silence , after a few seconds the soldier came back on the air “ WE ARE UNDER ATTACK , THEY AR … ” the radio clicked off abruptly .
Looking out over the building he could hear the sound of small arms fire drifting up from the 18th street barricades and could see the muzzle flashes lighting up the street in the early evening dusk .
Blake did n’t need to issue orders , the radio ops guy was trying to reach the combat crew , while a second dispatched a combat patrol to the area for additional intel and fire support .
Blake swore softly and pulled his binoculars clear of their pouch as the med-evac chopper roared overhead .
Who had they engaged ?
And what had caused the squad to open fire so rapidly on their fellow citizens ?
Looking at the magnified scene he could see the darkened figures fighting hand to hand now .
As he watched the dispatched patrol humvee came skidding up , as it did so the radio crackled to life as the driver came on the air “ Jesus , targets sighted , this is bad , the barricade is smashed , got maybe ten targets in hand to hand with the squad , should we engage ? ”
Before Blake could answer the driver came back on the air “ More coming from the building !
Hit ‘em with the 50 Cal ”
The roar of the humvee ’s gun drowned out the rest of the radio and from his vantage point Blake could see the tracers ripping across the street .
Over the roar of the gun Blake could hear the driver yelling something over and over .
“ What ’s he saying ? ” he asked the radio op .
The op paused “ I think he said it ’s not working Sir ” .
As the gun stopped firing , Blake could clearly hear the driver screaming “ IT’S NOT WORKING !
OH GOD , there ’s more coming , send more troops , SEND MORE TROOPS ! ”
Looking back at the scene
Blake could clearly see more people pouring out of the barricades , surrounding buildings , the shapes all moving toward the Humvee which was now firing wildly at the advancing crowd of people .
Worried Blake barked an order to send more reinforcements , as he did so he looked out across the deserted streets and with a sickening feeling saw more people slowly moving out of the buildings and onto the street , , all heading toward the sound of gunfire .
As he watched the crowds growing larger and shouted more orders for additional troops , Blake saw the Med Evac chopper head away from the city , he hoped that wherever they were going would be a better place than this one was turning out to be .

These last weeks have been very difficult for GM , as they have skidded impossibly close to bankruptcy .
Aside from VOLT and Cruze , most future planning has had to come to a halt , and even the Volt 's engine factory construction has shut down .
President Bush is soon to make an announcement about whether GM will get government loans or possibly have to endure a pre-packaged bankruptcy .
Regardless of the timing there is a rumor brewing .
Sources have told GM - Volt.com that GM has a brand new E - Flex extended - range electric vehicle ( E - REV ) under wraps and have been hoping to unveil it in January at the Detroit Auto Show .
We have known previously that other E - Flex cars were being designed .
The last time I spoke to E - Flex Design Chief Bob Boniface he acknowledged that was true .
Although he did n't say exactly what it would be he did say it would n't be a " four door Chevy " Since about four GM brands are on the chopping block , and we 've heard rumors of such in the past , Ill go out on a line and predict the car will be a Cadillac .
Indeed previous reports have stated the next E - Flex car would be a Cadillac , and vice - chairman Bob Lutz has gone on record stating " there 's going to have to be some kind of dramatic environmental statement from Cadillac .
" Sources indicate that the new car will illustrate just how far one can go technologically in advancing the driver machine interface under the unique circumstance of the car being electrically driven .
Considering how costly such an interface might be , it would logically have to be a luxury car .
Furthermore , GM unveiled a Cadillac Provoq crossover concept with an E - Flex drivetrain and fuel cell last year .
This same design is to be launched as the Cadillac SRX crossover .
It is unknown whether this new car will be an E - Flex SRX with a gas generator , or whether GM has a totally new design .
Thus it looks like we have yet another reason for being excited about GM 's survival and success , one more route away from oil dependence , and one more reason for the Bush administration to give them another chance .
Stay tuned .

The authors of the IMF ’s World Economic Outlook have a difficult job .
They have to forecast the trajectory of the global economy -- itself not an easy task .
Their forecast will be judged and evaluated in real time .
But the work according to a schedule set by the need to consult the IMF board and the demands of physical rather than virtual publication .
In practice , that means that the forecast never fully reflects the most recent data .
" IMF Board " time , " internet " time and " market " time are all very different things .
Sometimes that does n’t matter .
But right now is one of the times when it does .
A lot happened this September .
And I suspect that much of what has happened is n’t reflected in the IMF ’s forecasts .
Specifically , I now expect a larger fall in US output and a larger fall in the US current account deficit -- and for that matter , the combined current account deficit of the US and the EU -- than the IMF currently forecasts ( see the WEO ’s data tables ) .
In the past I have argued that the IMF has had a tendency to forecast problems like the US current account deficit away , and in effect assume that the US current account deficit would tend to shrink even if neither China nor the US adjusted their policies .
The IMF has also tended to downplay the role the official sector has played in financing the US .
Now I suspect that there will be more adjustment than the IMF expects .
Specifically , the IMF now forecasts that the 2009 US current account deficit will fall to $ 485 b in 2009 ( around 3 % of US GDP ) -- well below its 2006 peak of $ 790 b , and down from an estimated $ 665 b in 2008 .
The deficit has been running at around $ 700 b , so the IMF is forecasting a fall in the deficit in the second half of the year ( see Table A10 ) .
That fall seems reasonable .
Indeed , the fall in the United States external deficit could be much bigger :
-- the IMF forecast is based on a $ 100 a barrel average oil price .
If oil stays around $ 90 a barrel , the US deficit would be about $ 50 b smaller ( and the surplus of the oil exporters would be reduced by around $ 150 b ) .
--
The credit crunch could cut into investment , reducing demand for imports
-- Households seem to have , at least temporarily , stopped spending , pushing savings rates up and cutting into imports .
A rise in the fiscal deficit could help offset the slowdown in consumption and fall in investment -- and the pace of US export growth will almost certainly slow as the world slows ( the dollar ’s recent rebound does n’t help either ) .
But all in all , it would seem to me that the US deficit could fall by more than the IMF forecast -- in a rather abrupt adjustment triggered by a sudden fall in US household consumption .
The IMF forecasts that the EU ’s 2009 deficit to be about $ 220 billion , roughly the same as the $ 230 b deficit forecast in 2008 .
That implies the IMF now expects the combined deficit of the US and Europe would fall , and the combined surplus of the emerging world would shrink .
That is important .
The US deficit actually peaked in 2006 at just under $ 800 b .
It has been falling since .
But the $ 125 b improvement in the US current account deficit has been offset , in a global sense , by a $ 170 b deterioration in the EU ’s deficit ( it went from $ 60 b in 2006 to a forecast $ 230b in 2008 ) .
Yes , Virginia , exchange rates do matter : this deterioration in the EU ’s overall balance followed the appreciation of most European currencies
The combined deficit of the US and EU consequently rose over the past two years even as the US deficit fell , allowing -- in a broad global sense -- Asia ’s surplus to rise even as the oil exporters surplus rose .
Indeed , in aggregate , Europe ( not the US ) has been the driver of global demand growth over the last four years .
From 2004 to 2008 , the US current account deficit rose from $ 625 b to $ 665 b while Europe swung from a $ 65 b surplus to a $ 230 b deficit .
That is close to $ 300 b swing in the current account balance of the EU ( the swing in the eurozone ’s balance is far smaller ) .
From say 2002 to 2005 the US did drive global demand growth , but starting in 2005 the EU picked up and from 2006 through 2008 it carried the baton .
In 2008 , the IMF forecasts a combined US and EU external deficit of around $ 900 b -- up from $ 450 b in 2002 ( see Table A10 ) .
What about the other side of the ledger ?
Well from 2002 to 2008 , the Middle East ’s surplus increased from $ 30 b to $ 440 b -- and emerging Asia ’s surplus increased from $ 65 billion to an estimated $ 380 billion .
The simultaneous increase in the Gulf ’s surplus and China ’s surplus explains why the combined deficit of the US and Europe became so large -- it was the only way the global economy could balance .
The IMF ’s data also leaves no doubt that the surplus in both the Gulf and emerging Asia reflects an savings glut not an investment drought .
In both regions investment is well above its levels in the 1990s .
Savings just increased more ( see Table A16 ) .
Looking forward , the IMF does n’t expect much adjustment in Asia .
Its surplus is expected to remain roughly constant in nominal terms -- in large part because China ’s surplus is expected to remain constant .
I agree .
Export growth will slow , but so will import growth -- and import prices .
On balance emerging Asia ’s surplus might end up falling by a bit more than the IMF forecasts as the US and Europe slow dramatically .
The Middle East ’s surplus is expected to fall from $ 440 b to $ 365 b .
That is a meaningful fall -- but it still leaves the Middle East ’s surplus well above its 2005 and 2006 level of around $ 250 b .
Personally , I would expect a bigger fall -- in part because I do not current expect oil prices to average around $ 100 and in part because I expect domestic spending and investment and thus imports have increased by more than the IMF assumes .
Forecasts for the Middle East are particularly challenging because the region generally does n’t release timely balance of payments data !
The IMF ’s data tables also are loaded with information about the composition of capital flows to and from the emerging world : Table A13 ) shows clearly that net capital outflow from the emerging world that corresponds with the emerging world ’s estimated $ 870 b current account surplus in 2008 is entirely an official flow .
The IMF expects $ 1270 b in outflows from the growth in the emerging world ’s reserves and another $ 160 b in " official " outflows ( largely the Gulf ’s sovereign wealth funds ) .
That implies that the governments of the emerging world are on track to about $ 1.4 trillion in US , European and Australian assets -- along with a few Japanese assets .*
The detailed data tables includes estimate of for the oil money that has been channeled through the Gulf sovereign funds ( an estimated $ 150b in 2008 ) as Asia ’s 2008 reserve growth ( $ 750 b ) .
In 2009 , the IMF expects the Gulf funds to get another $ 115 b -- and Asia to add about $ 550 b to its reserves .
Net official flows from the emerging world to the US and Europe would remain over a trillion dollars -- though they would fall back from the 2007 and 2008 levels .
For once I even think there is a risk that the IMF may have over - estimated official asset growth .
The IMF assumed large net private flows would combine with the emerging world ’s current account surplus to drive the enormous growth in the emerging world ’s reserves and official assets .
Net private capital inflows to the emerging world were forecast to top $ 500 b in 2008 -- just off the record $ 630 b in inflows in 2007 .
However , over the last several months -- and particularly over the last few weeks -- much of the private money that flowed into the emerging world in 2007 and the first part of 2008 started to flow out .
That will cut into official asset growth .
As a result , the US almost certainly will rely less on central banks and sovereign funds for financing in 2009 than it did in 2007 or the first half of 2008 .
That will be true even as the US dramatically scales up Treasury issuance , and the size of the US budget deficit rises .
For the first time in a long time , private American households seem to have decided that they need to save a bit of money rather than spend all they take in -- and for the first time in a long time private US savers seem to want to hold low yielding US treasury bonds .
And I increasingly suspect that one consequence of United States and Europe ’s recent financial crisis will be a smaller deficit in both regions , and a smaller surplus in the emerging world .

Oct. 24 , 2008  --
The traditional media are playing a very , very dangerous game -- with their readers , with the Constitution and with their own fates .
The sheer bias in the print and television coverage of this election campaign is not just bewildering , but appalling .
And over the last few months I 've found myself slowly moving from shaking my head at the obvious one - sided reporting , to actually shouting at the screen of my television and my laptop computer .
But worst of all , for the last couple weeks , I 've begun -- for the first time in my adult life -- to be embarrassed to admit what I do for a living .
A few days ago , when asked by a new acquaintance what I did for a living , I replied that I was " a writer , " because I could n't bring myself to admit to a stranger that I 'm a journalist .
You need to understand how painful this is for me .
I am one of those people who truly bleeds ink when I 'm cut .
I am a fourth - generation newspaperman .
As family history tells it , my great - grandfather was a newspaper editor in Abilene , Kan. , during the last of the cowboy days , then moved to Oregon to help start the Oregon Journal ( now the Oregonian ) .
My hard - living -- and when I knew her , scary -- grandmother was one of the first women reporters for the Los Angeles Times .
And my father , though profoundly dyslexic , followed a long career in intelligence to finish his life ( thanks to word processors and spellcheckers ) as a very successful freelance writer .
I 've spent 30 years in every part of journalism , from beat reporter to magazine editor .
And my oldest son , following in the family business , so to speak , earned his first national byline before he earned his drivers license .
So , when I say I 'm deeply ashamed right now to be called a " journalist , " you can imagine just how deep that cuts into my soul .
Now , of course , there 's always been bias in the media .
Human beings are biased , so the work they do , including reporting , is inevitably colored .
Hell , I can show you 10 different ways to color variations of the word " said " -- muttered , shouted , announced , reluctantly replied , responded , etc. -- to influence the way a reader will comprehend exactly the same quote .
We all learn that in Reporting 101 , or at least in the first few weeks working in a newsroom .
But what we are also supposed to learn during that same apprenticeship is to recognize the dangerous power of that technique , and many others , and develop built - in alarms against them .
But even more important , we are also supposed to be taught that even though there is no such thing as pure , Platonic objectivity in reporting , we are to spend our careers struggling to approach that ideal as closely as possible .
That means constantly challenging our own prejudices , systematically presenting opposing views and never , ever burying stories that contradict our own world views or challenge people or institutions we admire .
If we can't achieve Olympian detachment , than at least we can recognize human frailty -- especially in ourselves .
Reporting Bias
For many years , spotting bias in reporting was a little parlor game of mine , watching TV news or reading a newspaper article and spotting how the reporter had inserted , often unconsciously , his or her own preconceptions .
But I always wrote it off as bad judgment and lack of professionalism , rather than bad faith and conscious advocacy .
Sure , being a child of the '60s I saw a lot of subjective " New " Journalism , and did a fair amount of it myself , but that kind of writing , like columns and editorials , was supposed to be segregated from " real " reporting , and , at least in mainstream media , usually was .
The same was true for the emerging blogosphere , which by its very nature was opinionated and biased .
But my complacent faith in my peers first began to be shaken when some of the most admired journalists in the country were exposed as plagiarists , or worse , accused of making up stories from whole cloth .
I 'd spent my entire professional career scrupulously pounding out endless dreary footnotes and double - checking sources to make sure that I never got accused of lying or stealing someone else 's work -- not out of any native honesty , but out of fear : I 'd always been told to fake or steal a story was a firing offense … indeed , it meant being blackballed out of the profession .
And yet , few of those worthies ever seemed to get fired for their crimes -- and if they did they were soon rehired into even more prestigious jobs .
It seemed as if there were two sets of rules : one for us workaday journalists toiling out in the sticks , and another for folks who'd managed , through talent or deceit , to make it to the national level .
Meanwhile , I watched with disbelief as the nation 's leading newspapers , many of whom I 'd written for in the past , slowly let opinion pieces creep into the news section , and from there onto the front page .
Personal opinions and comments that , had they appeared in my stories in 1979 , would have gotten my butt kicked by the nearest copy editor , were now standard operating procedure at the New York Times , the Washington Post , and soon after in almost every small town paper in the U.S .
But what really shattered my faith -- and I know the day and place where it happened -- was the war in Lebanon three summers ago .
The hotel I was staying at in Windhoek , Namibia , only carried CNN , a network I 'd already learned to approach with skepticism .
But this was CNN International , which is even worse .
I sat there , first with my jaw hanging down , then actually shouting at the TV , as one field reporter after another reported the carnage of the Israeli attacks on Beirut , with almost no corresponding coverage of the Hezbollah missiles raining down on northern Israel .
The reporting was so utterly and shamelessly biased that I sat there for hours watching , assuming that eventually CNNi would get around to telling the rest of the story … but it never happened .
The Presidential Campaign
But nothing , nothing I 've seen has matched the media bias on display in the current presidential campaign .
Republicans are justifiably foaming at the mouth over the sheer one - sidedness of the press coverage of the two candidates and their running mates .
But in the last few days , even Democrats , who have been gloating over the pass -- no , make that shameless support -- they 've gotten from the press , are starting to get uncomfortable as they realize that no one wins in the long run when we do n't have a free and fair press .
I was one of the first people in the traditional media to call for the firing of Dan Rather -- not because of his phony story , but because he refused to admit his mistake -- but , bless him , even Gunga Dan thinks the media is one - sided in this election .
Now , do n't get me wrong .
I 'm not one of those people who think the media has been too hard on , say , Republican vice presidential nominee Gov. Sarah Palin , by rushing reportorial SWAT teams to her home state of Alaska to rifle through her garbage .
This is the big leagues , and if she wants to suit up and take the field , then Gov. Palin better be ready to play .
The few instances where I think the press has gone too far -- such as the Times reporter talking to prospective first lady Cindy McCain 's daughter 's MySpace friends -- can easily be solved with a few newsroom smackdowns and temporary repostings to the Omaha bureau .
No , what I object to ( and I think most other Americans do as well ) is the lack of equivalent hardball coverage of the other side -- or worse , actively serving as attack dogs for the presidential ticket of Sens.
Barack Obama , D - Ill. , and Joe Biden , D - Del .
If the current polls are correct , we are about to elect as president of the United States a man who is essentially a cipher , who has left almost no paper trail , seems to have few friends ( that at least will talk ) and has entire years missing out of his biography .
That is n't Sen .
Obama 's fault :
His job is to put his best face forward .
No , it is the traditional media 's fault , for it alone ( unlike the alternative media ) has had the resources to cover this story properly , and has systematically refused to do so .
Why , for example to quote the lawyer for Republican presidential nominee Sen. John McCain , R - Ariz . , have n't we seen an interview with Sen .
Obama 's grad school drug dealer -- when we know all about Mrs. McCain 's addiction ?
Are Bill Ayers and Tony Rezko that hard to interview ?
All those phony voter registrations that hard to scrutinize ?
And why are Sen .
Biden 's endless gaffes almost always covered up , or rationalized , by the traditional media ?
Joe the Plumber
The absolute nadir ( though I hate to commit to that , as we still have two weeks before the election ) came with Joe the Plumber .
Middle America , even when they did n't agree with Joe , looked on in horror as the press took apart the private life of an average person who had the temerity to ask a tough question of a presidential candidate .
So much for the standing up for the little man .
So much for speaking truth to power .
So much for comforting the afflicted and afflicting the comfortable , and all of those other catchphrases we journalists used to believe we lived by .
I learned a long time ago that when people or institutions begin to behave in a matter that seems to be entirely against their own interests , it 's because we do n't understand what their motives really are .
It would seem that by so exposing their biases and betting everything on one candidate over another , the traditional media is trying to commit suicide -- especially when , given our currently volatile world and economy , the chances of a successful Obama presidency , indeed any presidency , is probably less than 50/50 .
Furthermore , I also happen to believe that most reporters , whatever their political bias , are human torpedoes … and , had they been unleashed , would have raced in and roughed up the Obama campaign as much as they did McCain's .
That 's what reporters do .
I was proud to have been one , and I 'm still drawn to a good story , any good story , like a shark to blood in the water .
So why were n't those legions of hungry reporters set loose on the Obama campaign ?
Who are the real villains in this story of mainstream media betrayal ?
The editors .
The men and women you do n't see ; the people who not only decide what goes in the paper , but what does n't ; the managers who give the reporters their assignments and lay out the editorial pages .
They are the real culprits .
Bad Editors
Why ?
I think I know , because had my life taken a different path , I could have been one : Picture yourself in your 50s in a job where you 've spent 30 years working your way to the top , to the cockpit of power … only to discover that you 're presiding over a dying industry .
The Internet and alternative media are stealing your readers , your advertisers and your top young talent .
Many of your peers shrewdly took golden parachutes and disappeared .
Your job does n't have anywhere near the power and influence it did when your started your climb .
The Newspaper Guild is too weak to protect you any more , and there is a very good chance you 'll lose your job before you cross that finish line , 10 years hence , of retirement and a pension .
In other words , you are facing career catastrophe -- and desperate times call for desperate measures .
Even if you have to risk everything on a single Hail Mary play .
Even if you have to compromise the principles that got you here .
After all , newspapers and network news are doomed anyway -- all that counts is keeping them on life support until you can retire .
And then the opportunity presents itself -- an attractive young candidate whose politics likely matches yours , but more important , he offers the prospect of a transformed Washington with the power to fix everything that has gone wrong in your career .
With luck , this monolithic , single - party government will crush the alternative media via a revived fairness doctrine , re-invigorate unions by getting rid of secret votes , and just maybe be beholden to people like you in the traditional media for getting it there .
And besides , you tell yourself , it 's all for the good of the country …
This is the opinion of the columnist and in no way reflects the opinion of ABC News .
Michael S. Malone is one of the nation 's best - known technology writers .
He has covered Silicon Valley and high - tech for more than 25 years , beginning with the San Jose Mercury News as the nation 's first daily high - tech reporter .
His articles and editorials have appeared in such publications as The Wall Street Journal , the Economist and Fortune , and for two years he was a columnist for The New York Times .
He was editor of Forbes ASAP , the world 's largest - circulation business - tech magazine , at the height of the dot - com boom .
Malone is the author or co-author of a dozen books , notably the best - selling " Virtual Corporation . "
Malone has also hosted three public television interview series , and most recently co-produced the celebrated PBS miniseries on social entrepreneurs , " The New Heroes . "
He has been the ABCNews.com " Silicon Insider " columnist since 2000 .
UPDATE : I ’m also hearing that Transformers and Transformers 2 writers Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman ( also , Mission : Impossible III , Eagle Eye , Star Trek ) may hang with DreamWorks .
DreamWorks has started making its post - Paramount moves regarding executives , staff and producers .
Here ’s what I can tell you so far : the word I have is that Adam Goodman will be staying at Viacom ( but not to replace Brad Weston at Paramount , as I ’ve already reported ) , with one or two executives following him .
Some people tell me Goodman ’s title will be president of production .
Holly Bario and Mark Sourian will end up as co-presidents of production at Dreamworks 2.0 with about four execs following them .
No surprises there .
( And I ’ve already told you that DreamWorks COO Jeff Small will follow studio chief Stacey Snider . )
In all , DreamWorks will be downsizing its 150 staff by about 15 % , I ’m told .
Yesterday was especially tense .
As an insider descibed it , “ Staff were getting called into rooms to let them know if they were staying or going .
One room , with Holly and Mark in it , meant you were staying .
The other , with the CFO in it , meant you were going . ”
Still , I ’m assured that anyone not moving over will continue to be paid until their Paramount contract ends .
But that ’s cold comfort .
As far as producers , Ivan Reitman / Tom Pollock ’s Montecito Picture Company will not be moving to DreamWorks 2.0 .
Of course , Walter Parkes and Laurie MacDonald will be staying with DreamWorks .
Nina Jacobson moves as does Sam Mendes .
Ben Stiller ’s Red Hour Films is also about to confirm it ’s following DreamWorks .
The producers are learning which projects are going where as DreamWorks and Paramount separate .
The paper is edited by Abdel al - Bari Atwan , who is said to be the last journalist to interview Osama bin Laden in 1996 .
According to the report , bin Laden is himself closely following preparations for an attack against the US and aims to " change the face of world politics and economics " .
The operative is quoted as saying that " this will be shown by the fact that we now control a major part of the south of Somalia " .
The ex-operative says he remains in contact with current chiefs of the organisation in Yemen and that only six months ago bin Laden had sent a message to all jihad cells in the Arab world which asked them not to interact with their governments or local political parties and to deny any request for mediation or formal talks .
The source also said that during the next few days the terrorist organisation may send a sign of its violent intentions .
The warning has emerged at the same time as publication of a report leaked to The Telegraph newspaper which reveals that a document drawn up by the intelligence branch of the Ministry of Defence says that thousands of extremists are active in the UK .
Public Health Insurance Plan Option " Non-Negotiable "
Earlier today , we at Institute for America 's Future hosted a media conference call to release the new report from Prof. Jacob Hacker , " The Case for Public Plan Choice in National Health Reform . "
( Audio of the session is here )
And ABC picked up on the big news :
Advocates of a government alternative to private health insurance fired the first shot of the new battle to reform the nation ’s health - care system on Wednesday , saying that efforts to water down this key component of Barack Obama ’s health - care plan should be rejected by members of Congress .
“ In the absence of a public plan you would have to so strictly regulate [ private ] health plans that they would all have to become public plans , ” said Rep. Pete Stark , D - Calif. , chairman of the House Ways and Means Health sub-committee .
Stark spoke out on Wednesday because he is concerned that any effort to reform the private health - insurance market will prove ineffective if Americans are not offered the kind of Medicare - style government option contained in Obama ’s 2008 campaign proposal .
Stark ’s concerns were echoed by Health Care Now , a liberal advocacy group .
“ We agree with Congressman Stark that a health care solution that does not include a public plan would be a non-starter , ” said Richard Kirsch , the national campaign manager for Health Care for America Now .
“ President - elect Obama ran on the promise of giving consumers a choice of keeping the private insurance they have or opting in to a newly - created public insurance plan , and it is the second part of this hybrid reform that ensures we are no longer at the mercy of the private insurance industry which keeps charging us more , giving us less , and lining its own pockets with profits . ”
That red line is being drawn for a reason .
Insisting upon a public plan option is not ideology for ideology 's sake .
It 's critical to achieve quality , affordable health care for all .
As Hacker 's report explains :
A health care system that contains costs and drives value must include a good public plan if the broad goals of reform — universal insurance and improved value — are to be achieved .
Private insurance and public insurance have distinct strengths and weaknesses , and thus should be encouraged to compete side by side to attract enrollees on a level playing field that rewards plans that deliver better value and health to their enrollees .
Public insurance has a better track record at reining in costs , while preserving access ; it has pioneered key quality and payment innovations that have often set the standard for private plans ; it is essential to set a standard against which private plans must compete to drive value and can be a source of stability for people .
Of course , the private insurance lobby is fervently against having to compete with public plans ( see Ezra Klein 's interview with the lobby 's chief spokesperson ) , so this issue will likely be the key flashpoint in the months to come .
Which is why it is critical to understand why the public plan option is so important , so we can all defend it against the inevitable attacks .
Read the report and listen to the conference call .
The one I go to is predictably on the list .
I rarely go there , but I do check it out from time to time for good deals .
They have so few customers per week that sometimes they knock off video games or movies to stupidly low prices ( < $ 5 ) and they 're still on the shelf weeks later .
On October 18 , 2008 , an OpEdNews article titled , " 8 House Members View Draft Bill on Independent Science / Tech Probe of WTC 1 , 2 , 7 Collapses , " was published by four members of the group Scholars for 9/11 Truth & Justice ( STJ911.org ) .
The authors of the article and draft bill are not spokespersons for Scholars for 9/11 Truth & Justice , and therefore are individually responsible for it .
Scholars for 9/11 Truth & Justice does not endorse the draft bill due to the inclusion of numerous unscientific claims and misrepresentations , and condemns in the strongest of terms any associations between the organization and the claims presented by the authors of this bill .
As stated at the front page of their website , Scholars for 9 - 11 Truth and Justice " take [s ] care to present the strongest , most credible research available ... "
While in agreement with the authors of this bill that a new investigation into the tragic events of September 11 , 2001 is warranted , representatives of the Scholars group note that the draft bill and article lack basic scientific rigor and credibility , with statements such as , " the entire WTC [ complex ] was destroyed by directed energy weaponry ( DEW ) , " and the ideas that " nuclear materials , missiles or DEW weapons were used . "
The sister publication of the Scholars group , The Journal of 9/11 Studies ( www.JournalOf911Studies.com), has numerous peer - reviewed scientific articles refuting such claims .
Scholars for 9/11 Truth & Justice believes that a much better bill can be crafted using the strong analysis in articles by its members , several of which are recently published in scientific journals , including The Open Civil Engineering Journal , The Environmentalist , and the Journal of Engineering Mechanics .
Kevin Ryan , a former Underwriters Laboratories ( UL ) manager who was fired in 2004 for publicly questioning the NIST report , and a committee member of the Scholars ' group , says the bill is harmful to the cause of exposing the truth .
" Basically , " he said , " asking Congress to investigate many poorly defined , and highly implausible hypotheses minimizes the chances that Congress would be willing or able to investigate the actual evidence for the demolition of three WTC buildings . "
In fact , the bill also omits any mention of the 9/11 Family Steering Committee , which provided hundreds of questions left unanswered by the 9/11 Commission .
Scholars ' member Dr. Steven E. Jones , a Professor of Physics , also notes that statements attributed to him in the bill are " errors . . . misrepresenting my published statements . "
Dr. Jones goes on to say , " It is unacceptable to misrepresent my views , as is done in this document by Ellis et al. , and to ignore my published technical papers in established journals . "
Scholars for 9/11 Truth and Justice is a non-partisan organization of over 500 independent researchers analyzing the September 11 , 2001 attacks with a strong emphasis on the scientific method .

Since the $ 700 billion bailout plan went down in the House of Representatives by a 228-205 margin , talking heads and politicos have been looking for ways to circumvent Congress and give the executive branch the authority to perform a bailout without their consent .
Republican presidential nominee Sen. John McCain , R - Ariz. , first made the suggestion to NBC News correspondent Kelly O’Donnell .
His senior economic adviser , Douglas Holtz - Eakin , later confirmed to MSNBC that McCain said Congress has already given the Treasury Department authority to bail out Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to the tune of a trillion dollars .
“ This past summer , Congress passed and the President signed a housing relief bill that had a variety of things in it , ” Holtz - Eakin said in an interview with NBC Washington correspondent Andrea Mitchell on MSNBC Sept. 30 .
( Article continues below )
“ Among them , ” Holtz - Eakin said , “ in addition to appointing a new regulator for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac , that legislation contained the authority for purchases of mortgage - backed securities and other housing - related instruments .
It simultaneously increased the debt limit of the United States by a trillion dollars .
So in effect , the government could borrow up to – nearly a trillion more dollars and use those funds to purchase these housing - related securities . ”
Holtz - Eakin explained this would n’t be the first choice of action but said it is an option that is available to the Treasury .
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
“ So this looks like something that ’s on the books .
Obviously everyone thinks it would be better for Congress to take proactive action , provide the necessary tools for the Treasury to broadly deal with the problems in our financial markets , ” he said .
“ But in the interim , there ’s something that looks to be on the books that could be done and the senator just thinks we ought to take every option that is available to us and start to act to protect the American family and the business community against the fallout from this awful credit crunch . ”
But CNBC “ Street Signs ” host Erin Burnett explained this was n’t something that was likely under the current rules .
Burnett told viewers of her Sept. 30 program the toxic mortgages distressing many of the beleaguered banks hoping for a Congressional bailout are n’t the same mortgages the Treasury Dept. has the authority to buy .
“ We ’ve been looking into this , ” Burnett said .
“ And there is room for Treasury to maneuver in many ways .
The best sense of this that we have gotten , though , is that money – even if it is all available and not all of it still is – would have to be used to buy Fannie and Freddie - backed mortgages and as we know , those are not really the toxic mortgages that are the problem here . ”
Burnett said one possible solution would be for the Treasury Dept. to have Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae purchase these mortgages from the banks to get them on their books .
However , Burnett said that would be unlikely under the current rules that govern the two former government - sponsored enterprises .
“ Now some might say the Treasury could tell Fannie and Freddie to go out and buy some of the bad stuff , but keep in mind – Fannie and Freddie are right now owned by the government in a conservatorship , ” Burnett added .
“ They would have to take some insurance out to do that is our understanding .
That would cost quite a bit of money – likely not be a business decision which would be approved by the conservator .
So it does n’t seem that that plan in its simplistic sense make sense .
Bottom line , though , is that there might be some ways for Treasury to maneuver . ”
Melissa Etheridge wrote an interesting piece for the Daily Beast concerning Proposition 8 .
“ Okay .
So Prop 8 passed .
Alright , I get it .
51 % of you think that I am a second class citizen .
Alright then .
So my wife , uh I mean , roommate ?
Girlfriend ?
Special lady friend ?
You are gonna have to help me here because I am not sure what to call her now .
Anyways , she and I are not allowed the same right under the state constitution as any other citizen .
Okay , so I am taking that to mean I do not have to pay my state taxes because I am not a full citizen .
I mean that would just be wrong , to make someone pay taxes and not give them the same rights , sounds sort of like that taxation without representation thing from the history books . ”
While I appreciate Etheridge ’s sentiment , I have mixed feelings about her approach .
The state did n’t take away our right to marry , the people of California did ( with the Mormon and Catholic churches aiding and abetting ) .
Twice the California legislature passed a same - sex marriage bill and twice Arnold Schwarzenegger vetoed it .
But to the Governor ’s credit he was against Proposition 8 and voted against it .
I think our time is better spent shining a spotlight on the Mormon and Catholic church ’s involvement and putting their tax exemption status on the table .
Hitt ’em in the pocket book where it hurts .

The Gateless Gate 無門關
Wu -wen kuan ( Mumonkan )
Mumon's Preface
佛語心爲宗、無門爲法門。
Buddhism makes mind its foundation and no - gate its gate .
既是無門、且作麼生透 。
Now , how do you pass through this no -gate ?
豈不見道、從門入者不是家珍、從縁得者始終成壞。
It is said that things coming in through the gate can never be your own treasures .
What is gained from external circumstances will perish in the end .
恁麼説話、大似無風起浪好肉抉瘡。
However , such a saying is already raising waves when there is no wind .
It is cutting unblemished skin .
何況滯言句覓解會。 掉棒打月、隔靴爬痒、有甚交渉 。
As for those who try to understand through other people 's words , they are striking at the moon with a stick ; scratching a shoe , whereas it is the foot that itches .
What concern have they with the truth ?
慧開、紹定戊子夏、首衆于東嘉龍翔。因納子請益、遂將古人公案作敲門瓦子、隨機引導學者。
In the summer of the first year of Jõtei , Ekai was in Ryûsh õ Temple and as head monk worked with the monks , using the cases of the ancient masters as brickbats to batter the gate and lead them on according to their respective capacities .
竟爾抄録、不覺成集。初不以前後敍列、共成四十八則。
The text was written down not according to any scheme , but just to make a collection of forty - eight cases .
通曰無門關 。
It is called Mumonkan , " The Gateless Gate . "
若是箇漢、不顧危亡單刀直入。
A man of determination will unflinchingly push his way straight forward , regardless of all dangers .
八臂那咤、擱他不在 。
Then even the eight - armed Nata cannot hinder him .
縦使西天四七、東土二三、只得望風乞命。
Even the four sevens of the West and the two threes of the East would beg for their lives .
設或躊躇、也似隔窓看馬騎、貶得眼來、早已蹉過。
If one has no determination , then it will be like catching a glimpse of a horse galloping past the window : in the twinkling of an eye it will be gone .
Verse 頌曰
大道無門 The Great Way is gateless ,
千差有路 Approached in a thousand ways .
透得此 關
Once past this checkpoint
乾坤獨歩
You stride through the universe .
Case 1 Jõshû's " Mu " 一 趙州狗子
趙州和尚、因僧問、狗子還有佛性也無。州云、無。
A monk asked Jõshû , " Has a dog the Buddha Nature ? "
Jõshû answered , " Mu . "
Mumon's Comment
無門曰、參禪須透祖師關、妙悟要窮心路絶。
In order to master Zen , you must pass the barrier of the patriarchs .
To attain this subtle realization , you must completely cut off the way of thinking .
祖關不透心路不絶、盡是依草附木精靈。
If you do not pass the barrier , and do not cut off the way of thinking , then you will be like a ghost clinging to the bushes and weeds .
且道、如何是祖師關 。
Now , I want to ask you , what is the barrier of the patriarchs ?
只者一箇無字、乃宗門一關也 。
Why , it is this single word " Mu . "
That is the front gate to Zen .
遂目之曰禪宗無門關 。
Therefore it is called the " Mumonkan of Zen . "
透得過者、非但親見趙州、便可與歴代祖師把手共行、眉毛厮結同一眼見、同一耳聞。
If you pass through it , you will not only see Jõshû face to face , but you will also go hand in hand with the successive patriarchs , entangling your eyebrows with theirs , seeing with the same eyes , hearing with the same ears .
豈不慶快 。
Is n't that a delightful prospect ?
莫有要透關底麼 。
Would n't you like to pass this barrier ?
將三百六十骨節、八萬四千毫竅、通身起箇疑團參箇無字。
Arouse your entire body with its three hundred and sixty bones and joints and its eighty - four thousand pores of the skin ; summon up a spirit of great doubt and concentrate on this word " Mu . "
晝夜提撕、莫作虚無會、莫作有無會。
Carry it continuously day and night .
Do not form a nihilistic conception of vacancy , or a relative conception of " has " or " has not . "
如呑了箇熱鐵丸相似、吐又吐不出。
It will be just as if you swallow a red - hot iron ball , which you can not spit out even if you try .
蕩盡從 前惡知惡覚、久久純熟自然内外打成 — 片、如唖子得夢、只許自知。
All the illusory ideas and delusive thoughts accumulated up to the present will be exterminated , and when the time comes , internal and external will be spontaneously united .
You will know this , but for yourself only , like a dumb man who has had a dream .
驀然打發、驚天 動地 。
Then all of a sudden an explosive conversion will occur , and you will astonish the heavens and shake the earth .
如奪得關將軍大刀入手、逢佛殺佛、逢祖殺祖、於生死岸頭得大自在、向六道四生中遊戲三昧。
It will be as if you snatch away the great sword of the valiant general Kan'u and hold it in your hand .
When you meet the Buddha , you kill him ; when you meet the patriarchs , you kill them .
On the brink of life and death , you command perfect freedom ; among the sixfold worlds and four modes of existence , you enjoy a merry and playful samadhi .
且作麼生提撕 。
Now , I want to ask you again , " How will you carry it out ? "
盡平生氣力擧箇無字 。
Employ every ounce of your energy to work on this " Mu . "
若不間斷、好似法燭一點便著 。
If you hold on without interruption , behold : a single spark , and the holy candle is lit !
Mumon's Verse 頌曰
狗子佛 性
The dog , the Buddha Nature ,
全提正 令
The pronouncement , perfect and final .
纔渉有無 Before you say it has or has not ,
喪身失 命
You are a dead man on the spot .
Case 2 Hyakujõ 's
Fox 二 百丈野 狐
百丈和尚、凡參次、有一老人常隨衆聽法。
When Hyakujõ Oshõ delivered a certain series of sermons , an old man always followed the monks to the main hall and listened to him .
衆人退、老人亦退 。
When the monks left the hall , the old man would also leave .
忽一日不退。師遂問、面前立者復是何人。
One day , however , he remained behind , and Hyakujõ asked him , " Who are you , standing here before me ? "
老人云、諾 。
The old man replied .
某甲非人也 。
" I am not a human being .
於過去迦葉佛時曾住此山。
In the old days of Kashyapa Buddha , I was a head monk , living here on this mountain .
因學人問、大修行底人還落因果也無。
One day a student asked me , ' Does a man of enlightenment fall under the yoke of causation or not ? '
某甲對云、不落因果 。
I answered , ' No , he does not . '
五百生墮野狐身 。
Since then I have been doomed to undergo five hundred rebirths as a fox .
今請、和尚代一轉語貴脱野狐 。
I beg you now to give the turning word to release me from my life as a fox .
遂問、大修行底人、還落因果也無。
Tell me , does a man of enlightenment fall under the yoke of causation or not ? "
師云、不昧因果 。
Hyakujõ answered , " He does not ignore causation . "
老人於言下大悟 。
No sooner had the old man heard these words than he was enlightened .
作禮云、某甲、已脱野狐身住在山後。
Making his bows , he said , " I am emancipated from my life as a fox .
I shall remain on this mountain .
敢告和尚。 乞、依亡僧事例 。
I have a favor to ask of you : would you please bury my body as that of a dead monk . "
師、令維那白槌告衆、食後送亡僧。
Hyakujõ had the director of the monks strike with the gavel and inform everyone that after the midday meal there would be a funeral service for a dead monk .
大衆言議、一衆皆安、涅槃堂又無人病。何故如是。
The monks wondered at this , saying , " Everyone is in good health ; nobody is in the sick ward .
What does this mean ? "
食後只見師領衆至山後嵒下、以杖挑出一死野狐、乃依火葬。
After the meal Hyakujõ led the monks to the foot of a rock on the far side of the mountain and with his staff poked out the dead body of a fox and performed the ceremony of cremation .
師、至晩上堂、擧前因縁。
That evening he ascended the rostrum and told the monks the whole story .
黄蘗便問、古人錯祗對一轉語、墮五百生野狐身、轉轉不錯合作箇甚麼。
Õbaku thereupon asked him , " The old man gave the wrong answer and was doomed to be a fox for five hundred rebirths .
Now , suppose he had given the right answer , what would have happened then ? "
師云、近前來與伊道 。
Hyakujõ said , " You come here to me , and I will tell you . "
黄蘗遂近前、與師一掌 。
Õbaku went up to Hyakujõ and boxed his ears .
師拍手笑云、將謂、胡鬚赤。 更有赤鬚胡 。
Hyakujõ clapped his hands with a laugh and exclaimed , " I was thinking that the barbarian had a red beard , but now I see before me the red- bearded barbarian himself . "
Mumon's Comment
無門曰、不落因果、爲甚墮野狐。
Not falling under causation : how could this make the monk a fox ?
不昧因果、爲甚脱野狐 。
Not ignoring causation : how could this make the old man emancipated ?
若向者裏著得一隻眼、便知得前百丈贏得風流五百生。
If you come to understand this , you will realize how old Hyakujõ would have enjoyed five hundred rebirths as a fox .
Mumon's Verse 頌曰
不落不 昧
Not falling , not ignoring :
兩采一賽
Two faces of one die .
不昧不 落
Not ignoring , not falling :
千錯萬錯 A thousand errors , a million mistakes .
Case 3 Gutei Raises a Finger 三 倶胝堅 指
倶胝和尚、凡有詰問、唯擧一指。
Whenever Gutei Oshõ was asked about Zen , he simply raised his finger .
後有童子。因外人問、和尚説何法要。
Once a visitor asked Gutei's boy attendant , " What does your master teach ? "
童子亦堅指頭 。
The boy too raised his finger .
胝聞遂以刃斷其指 。
Hearing of this , Gutei cut off the boy 's finger with a knife .
童子、負痛號哭而去 。
The boy , screaming with pain , began to run away .
胝復召之。 童子廻首。 胝却 堅起指 。
Gutei called to him , and when he turned around , Gutei raised his finger .
童子忽然領悟 。
The boy suddenly became enlightened .
胝將順世、謂衆曰、吾得天龍一指頭禪、一生受用不盡。
When Gutei was about to pass away , he said to his assembled monks , " I obtained one - finger Zen from Tenry û and used it all my life but still did not exhaust it . "
言訖示滅 。
When he had finished saying this , he entered into eternal Nirvana .
Mumon's Comment
無門曰、倶胝並童子悟處、不在指頭上。
The enlightenment of Gutei and of the boy does not depend on the finger .
若向者裏見得、天龍同倶胝並童子興自己一串穿却。
If you understand this , Tenryû , Gutei , the boy , and you yourself are all run through with one skewer .
Mumon's Verse 頌曰
倶胝鈍置老天龍 Gutei made a fool of old Tenryû ,
利刃單提勘小 童 Emancipating the boy with a single slice ,
巨靈擡手 無多子 Just as Kyorei cleaved Mount Kasan
分破華山千万 重
To let the Yellow River run through .
Case 4 The Western Barbarian with No Beard 四 胡子無 髭
或庵曰、西天胡子、因甚無髭。
Wakuan said , " Why has the Western Barbarian no beard ? "
Mumon's Comment
無門曰、參須實參、悟須實悟。
Study should be real study , enlightenment should be real enlightenment .
者箇胡子、直須親見一回始得 。
You should once meet this barbarian directly to be really intimate with him .
説親見、早成兩箇 。
But saying you are really intimate with him already divides you into two .
Mumon's Verse 頌曰
癡人面前 Do n't discuss your dream
不可説夢 Before a fool .
胡子髭無 Barbarian with no beard
惺惺添□ Obscures the clarity .
Case 5 Kyõgen 's " Man up in a Tree " 五 香嚴上 樹
香嚴和尚云、如人上樹、口啣樹枝、手不攀枝、脚不踏樹。
Kyõgen
Oshõ said , " It is like a man up in a tree hanging from a branch with his mouth ; his hands grasp no bough , his feet rest on no limb .
樹下有人問西來意、不對即違他所問、若對又喪身失命。
Someone appears under the tree and asks him , ' What is the meaning of Bodhidharma 's coming from the West ? '
If he does not answer , he fails to respond to the question .
If he does answer , he will lose his life .
正恁麼時、作麼生對 。
What would you do in such a situation ? "
Mumon's Comment
無門曰、縱有懸河之辨、惣用不著。
Even if your eloquence flows like a river , it is of no avail .
説得一大藏教、亦用不著 。
Though you can expound the whole of Buddhist literature , it is of no use .
若向者裏對得著、活却從前死路頭、死却從前活路頭。
If you solve this problem , you will give life to the way that has been dead until this moment and destroy the way that has been alive up to now .
其或未然、直待當來問彌勒。
Otherwise you must wait for Maitreya Buddha and ask him .
Mumon's Verse 頌曰
香嚴眞杜撰 Kyõgen is truly thoughtless ;
惡毒無盡 限
His vice and poison are endless .
唖却納僧口
He stops up the mouths of the monks ,
通身迸鬼 眼
And devil 's eyes sprout from their bodies .
Case 6 The Buddha Holds Out a Flower 六 世尊拈 花
世尊、昔、在靈山會上拈花示衆。
When Shakyamuni Buddha was at Mount Grdhrakuta , he held out a flower to his listeners .
是時、衆皆默然 。
Everyone was silent .
惟迦葉者破顔微笑 。
Only Mahakashyapa broke into a broad smile .
世尊云、吾有正方眼藏、涅槃妙心、實相無相、微妙法門、不立文字、教外別傳、付囑摩訶迦葉。
The Buddha said , " I have the True Dharma Eye , the Marvelous Mind of Nirvana , the True Form of the Formless , and the Subtle Dharma Gate , independent of words and transmitted beyond doctrine .
This I have entrusted to Mahakashyapa . "
Mumon's Comment
無門曰、黄面瞿曇、傍若無人。
Golden - faced Gautama really disregarded his listeners .
壓良爲賤、縣羊頭賣狗肉。
He made the good look bad and sold dog 's meat labeled as mutton .
將謂、多少奇特 。
He himself thought it was wonderful .
只如當時大衆都笑、正方眼藏、作麼生傳。
If , however , everyone in the audience had laughed , how could he have transmitted his True Eye ?
設使迦葉不笑、正方眼藏又作麼生傳。
And again , if Mahakashyapa had not smiled , how could the Buddha have transmitted it ?
若道正方眼藏有傳授、黄面老子、誑□閭閻。
If you say the True Dharma Eye can be transmitted , then the golden - faced old man would be a city slicker who cheats the country bumpkin .
若道無傳授、爲甚麼獨許迦葉 。
If you say it cannot be transmitted , then why did the Buddha approve of Mahakashyapa ?
Mumon's Verse 頌曰
拈起花來 Holding out a flower ,
尾巴已露 The Buddha betrayed his curly tail .
迦葉破顔 Heaven and earth were bewildered ,
人天罔措 At Mahakashyapa 's smile .
Case 7 Jõshû's " Wash Your Bowl " 七 趙州洗 鉢
趙州、因僧問、其甲乍入叢林。
A monk said to Jõshû , " I have just entered this monastery .
乞師指示 。
Please teach me . "
州云、喫粥了也未 。
" Have you eaten your rice porridge ? " asked Jõshû .
僧云、喫粥了也 。
" Yes , I have , " replied the monk .
州云、洗鉢盂去 。
" Then you had better wash your bowl , " said Jõshû .
其僧有省 。
With this the monk gained insight .
Mumon's Comment
無門曰、趙州開口見膽、露出心肝。
When he opens his mouth , Jõshû shows his gallbladder .
He displays his heart and liver .
者僧聽事不眞、喚鐘作甕。
I wonder if this monk really did hear the truth .
I hope he did not mistake the bell for a jar .
Mumon's Verse 頌曰
只爲分明極 Endeavoring to interpret clearly ,
翻令所得 遲
You retard your attainment .
早知燈是 火
Do n't you know that flame is fire ?
飯熟已多 時
Your rice has long been cooked .
Case 8 Keichû the Wheelmaker 八 奚仲造 車
月庵和尚問僧、奚仲造車一百輻 。
Gettan Oshõ said , " Keichû , the first wheelmaker , made a cart whose wheels had a hundred spokes .
拈却兩頭、去却輻、明甚麼邊事。
Now , suppose you took a cart and removed both the wheels and the axle .
What would you have ? "

A monk asked Kõyõ Seijõ , " Daits û Chish õ Buddha sat in zazen for ten kalpas and could not attain Buddhahood .
He did not become a Buddha .
How could this be ? "
讓曰、其問甚諦當 。
Seijõ said , " Your question is quite self - explanatory . "
僧云、既是坐道場、爲甚麼不得成佛道。
The monk asked , " He meditated so long ; why could he not attain Buddhahood ? "
讓曰、爲伊不成佛 。
Seijõ said , " Because he did not become a Buddha . "
Mumon's Comment
無門曰、只許老胡知、不許老胡會。
I allow the barbarian 's realization , but I do not allow his understanding .
凡夫若知、既是聖人 。
When an ignorant man realizes it , he is a sage .
聖人若會、既是凡夫 。
When a sage understands it , he is ignorant .
Mumon's Verse 頌曰
了身何似了心 休 Better emancipate your mind than your body ;
了得心□身不 愁
When the mind is emancipated , the body is free ,
若也身心倶了 了
When both body and mind are emancipated ,
神仙何必更封 候
Even gods and spirits ignore worldly power .

乞、師賑濟 。
Will you give him support ? "
山云、税闍梨 。
Sõzan called out , " Seizei ! "
税、應諾 。
Seizei responded , " Yes , sir ! "
山曰、青原白家酒、三盞喫了、猶道未沾唇。
Sõzan said , " You have finished three cups of the finest wine in China , and still you say you have not yet moistened your lips ! "
Mumon's Comment
無門曰、清税輸機、是何心行。
Seizei pretended to retreat .
What was his scheme ?
曹山具眼、深辨來機 。
Sõzan had the eye of Buddha and saw through his opponent 's motive .
然雖如是、且道、那裏是税闍梨、喫酒處。
However , I want to ask you , at what point did Seizei drink wine ?
Mumon's Verse 頌曰
貧似范丹 Poverty like Hantan's ,
氣如項羽 Mind like Kõu's ;
活計雖 無
With no means of livelihood ,
敢與鬪 富
He dares to rival the richest .
Case 11 Jõsh û Sees the Hermits 十一 州勘庵 主
趙州、到一庵主處問、有麼有麼。
Jõshû went to a hermit 's cottage and asked , " Is the master in ?
Is the master in ? "
主、堅起拳頭 。
The hermit raised his fist .
州云、水淺不是泊舡處。 便行。
Jõshû said , " The water is too shallow to anchor here , " and he went away .
又到一庵主處云、有麼有麼 。
Coming to another hermit 's cottage , he asked again , " Is the master in ?
Is the master in ? "
主亦堅起拳頭 。
This hermit , too , raised his fist .
州云、能縱能奪、能殺能活。便作禮。
Jõshû said , " Free to give , free to take , free to kill , free to save , " and he made a deep bow .
Mumon's Comment
無門曰、一般堅起拳頭、爲甚麼肯一箇、不肯一箇。
Both raised their fists ; why was the one accepted and the other rejected ?
且道、□訛在甚處 。
Tell me , what is the difficulty here ?
若向者裏下得一轉語、便見趙州舌頭無骨、扶起放倒、得大自在。
If you can give a turning word to clarify this problem , you will realize that Jõshû 's tongue has no bone in it , now helping others up , now knocking them down , with perfect freedom .
雖然如是爭奈、趙州却被二庵主勘破。
However , I must remind you : the two hermits could also see through Jõshû .
若道二庵主有優劣、未具參學眼。
If you say there is anything to choose between the two hermits , you have no eye of realization .
若道無優劣、亦未具參 學眼。
If you say there is no choice between the two , you have no eye of realization .
Mumon's Verse 頌曰
眼流星
The eye like a shooting star ,
機掣電
The spirit like a lighting ;
殺人刀 A death - dealing blade ,
活人劍 A life - giving sword .

The bell has not rung , and the drum has not sounded . "
Tokusan turned and went back to his room .
峰擧似巖頭。 頭云、大小徳山未會末後句 。

山乃休去。明日陞座、果與尋常不同。
Tokusan said nothing at the time , but the next day he ascended the rostrum , and behold !
he was very different from usual !
巖頭至僧堂前、拊掌大笑云、且喜得老漢會末後句。
Gantõ , going toward the front of the hall , clapped his hands and laughed loudly , saying , " Congratulations !
Our old man has got hold of the last word !
他後天下人、不奈伊何。
From now on , nobody in this whole country can outdo him ! "
Mumon's Comment
無門曰、若是未後句、巖頭徳山倶未夢見在。
As for the last word , neither Gantõ nor Tokusan has ever dreamed of it !
撿點將來、好似一棚傀儡 。
When you look into the matter , you find they are like puppets on the shelf !
Mumon's Verse 頌曰
識得最初 句
If you realize the first ,
便會末後 句
You master the last .
末後與最 初
The first and the last
不是者一句
Are not one word .
Case 14 Nansen Cuts the Cat in Two 十四 南泉斬 猫
南泉和尚因東西堂爭猫兒。
Nansen Oshõ saw monks of the Eastern and Western halls quarreling over a cat .
泉乃提起云、大衆道得即救、道不得即斬却也。
He held up the cat and said , " If you can give an answer , you will save the cat .
If not , I will kill it . "
衆無對。泉遂斬之 。
No one could answer , and Nansen cut the cat in two .
晩趙州外歸。 泉擧似州 。
That evening Jõshû returned , and Nansen told him of the incident .
州乃脱履安頭上而出 。
Jõsh û took off his sandal , placed it on his head , and walked out .
泉云、子若在即救得猫兒 。
" If you had been there , you would have saved the cat , " Nansen remarked .
Mumon's Comment
無門曰、且道、趙州頂草鞋意作麼生。
Tell me , what did Jõshû mean when he put the sandal on his head ?
若向者裏下得一轉語、便見南泉令不虚行。
If you can give a turning word on this , you will see that Nansen 's decree was carried out with good reason .
其或未然險 。
If not , " Danger ! "
Mumon's Verse 頌曰
趙州若在 Had Jõshû been there ,
倒行此 令
He would have done the opposite ;
奪却刀子
When the sword is snatched away ,
南泉乞命 Even Nansen begs for his life .
Case 15 Tõzan 's Sixty Blows 十五 洞山三 頓
雲門、因洞山參次、門問曰、近離甚處。
Tõzan came to study with Unmon .
Unmon asked , " Where are you from ? "
山云、査渡 。
" From Sato , " Tõzan replied .
門曰、夏在甚處 。
" Where were you during the summer ? "
山云、湖南報慈 。
" Well , I was at the monastery of Hõzu , south of the lake . "
門曰、幾時離彼 。
" When did you leave there , " Unmon asked .
山云、八月二十五 。
" On August 25 " was Tõzan 's reply .
門曰、放汝三頓棒 。
" I spare you sixty blows , " Unmon said .
山至明日却上問訊 。
昨日蒙和尚放三頓棒 。
The next day Tõzan came to Unmon and said , " Yesterday you said you spared me sixty blows .
不知過在甚麼處 。
I beg to ask you , where was I at fault ? "
門曰、飯袋子、江西湖南便恁麼去。
" Oh , you rice bag ! " shouted Unmon .
" What makes you wander about , now west of the river , now south of the lake ? "
山於此大悟 。
Tõzan thereupon came to a mighty enlightenment experience .
Mumon's Comment
無門曰、雲門、當時便與本分草料、使洞山別有生機一路、家門不致寂寥。
If Unmon had given Tõzan the true food of Zen and encouraged him to develop an active Zen spirit , his school would not have declined as it did .
一夜在是非海裏著到、直待天明再來、又與他注破 。
Tõzan had an agonizing struggle through the whole night , lost in the sea of right and wrong .
He reached a complete impasse .
After waiting for the dawn , he again went to Unmon , and Unmon again made him a picture book of Zen .
洞山直下悟去、未是性燥。
Even though he was directly enlightened , Tõzan could not be called brilliant .
且問諸人、洞山三頓棒、合喫不合喫。
Now , I want to ask you , should Tõzan have been given sixty blows or not ?
若道合喫、草木叢林皆合喫棒。
If you say yes , you admit that all the universe should be beaten .
若道不合喫、雲門又成誑語。
If you say no , then you accuse Unmon of telling a lie .
向者裏明得、方與洞山出一口氣。
If you really understand the secret , you will be able to breathe out Zen spirit with the very mouth of Tõzan .
Mumon's Verse 頌曰
獅子教兒迷子 訣
The lion had a secret to puzzle his cub ;
擬前跳躑早翻 身
The cub crouched , leaped , and dashed forward .
無端再敍當頭 著
The second time , a casual move led to checkmate .
前箭猶輕後箭 深
The first arrow was light , but the second went deep .
Case 16 When the Bell Sounds 十六 鐘聲七 條
雲門曰、世界恁麼廣闊 。
Unmon said , " The world is vast and wide .
因甚向鐘聲裏披七條 。
Why do you put on your seven - piece robe at the sound of the bell ? "
Mumon's Comment
無門曰、大凡參禪學道、切忌、隨聲遂色。
In studying Zen , you should not be swayed by sounds and forms .
縱使聞聲悟道、見色明心也是尋常。
Even though you attain insight when hearing a voice or seeing a form , this is simply the ordinary way of things .
殊不知、納僧家、騎聲蓋色、頭頭上明、著著上妙。
Do n't you know that the real Zen student commands sounds , controls forms , is clear - sighted at every event and free on every occasion ?
然雖如是。 且道、聲來耳畔、耳往聲邊 。
Granted you are free , just tell me :
Does the sound come to the ear or does the ear go to the sound ?
直饒響寂雙忘、到此如何話會。
If both sound and silence die away , at such a juncture how could you talk of Zen ?
若將耳聽應難會、眼處聞聲方始親。
While listening with you ear , you can not tell .
When hearing with your eye , you are truly intimate .
Mumon's Verse 頌曰
會則事同一家
With realization , things make one family ;
不會萬別千 差
Without realization , things are separated in a thousand ways .
不會事同一家
Without realization , things make one family ;
會則萬別千 差
With realization , things are separated in a thousand ways .
Case 17 Chû the National Teacher Gives Three Calls 十七 國師三 喚
國師三喚侍者。侍者三應。
The National Teacher called his attendant three times , and three times the attendant responded .
國師云、將謂吾辜負汝、元來却是汝辜負吾。
The National Teacher said , " I long feared that I was betraying you , but really it was you who were betraying me . "
Mumon's Comment
無門曰、國師三喚、舌頭墮地。
The National Teacher called three times , and his tongue fell to the ground .
侍者三應、和光吐出 。
The attendant responded three times , and he gave his answer with brilliance .
國師年老心孤、按牛頭喫草。
The National Teacher was old and lonely ; he held the cow 's head and forced it to eat grass .
侍者未肯承當 。
The attendant would have none of it ;
美食不中飽人□、且道、那裏是他辜負處。
delicious food has little attraction for a man who is satiated .
Tell me , at what point was the betrayal ?
國淨才子貴、家富小兒嬌 。
When the country is flourishing , talent is prized .
When the home is wealthy , the children are proud .
Mumon's Verse 頌曰
鉄枷無孔要人 擔
He carried and iron yoke with no hole
累及兒孫不等 閑
And left a curse to trouble his descendants .
欲得□門并□ 戸
If you want to hold up the gate and the doors ,
更須赤脚上刀 山
You must climb a mountain of swords with bare feet .
Case 18 Tõzan 's " Masagin " 十八 洞山三 斤
洞山和尚、因僧問、如何是佛。
A monk asked Tõzan , " What is Buddha ? "
山云、麻三斤 。
Tõzan replied , " Masagin ! " [ three pounds of flax ] .
Mumon's Comment
無門曰、洞山老人、參得些蚌蛤禪、纔開兩片露出肝腸。
Old Tõzan attained the poor Zen of a clam .
He opened the two halves of the shell a little and exposed all the liver and intestines inside .
然雖如是、且道、向甚處見洞山。
But tell me , how do you see Tõzan ?
Mumon's Verse 頌曰
突出麻三 斤 " Three pounds of flax " came sweeping along ;
言親意更 親
Close were the words , but closer was the meaning .
來説是非 者
Those who argue about right and wrong
便是是非 人
Are those enslaved by right and wrong .
Case 19 Nansen 's " Ordinary Mind Is the Way " 十九 平常是 道
南泉、因趙州問、如何是道。
Jõshû asked Nansen , " What is the Way ? "
泉云、平常心是道 。
" Ordinary mind is the Way , " Nansen replied .
州云、還可趣向否 。
" Shall I try to seek after it ? " Jõshû asked .
泉云、擬向即乖 。
" If you try for it , you will become separated from it , " responded Nansen .
州云、不擬爭知是道 。
" How can I know the Way unless I try for it ? " persisted Jõshû .
泉云、道不屬知、不屬不知。
Nansen said , " The Way is not a matter of knowing or not knowing .
知是妄覺、不知是無記 。
Knowing is delusion ; not knowing is confusion .
若眞達不擬之道、猶如太虚廓然洞豁。
When you have really reached the true Way beyond doubt , you will find it as vast and boundless as outer space .
豈可強是非也 。
How can it be talked about on the level of right and wrong ? "
州於言下頓悟 。
With these words , Jõshû came to a sudden realization .
Mumon's Comment
無門曰、南泉被趙州發問、直得瓦解氷消、分疎不下。
Nansen dissolved and melted away before Jõshû 's question , and could not offer a plausible explanation .
趙州縱饒悟去、更參三十年始得。
Even though Jõshû comes to a realization , he must delve into it for another thirty years before he can fully understand it .
Mumon's Verse 頌曰
春有百花秋有 月
The spring flowers , the autumn moon ;
夏有涼風冬有雪 Summer breezes , winter snow .
若無閑事挂心 頭
If useless things do not clutter your mind ,
更是人間好時 節
You have the best days of your life .
Case 20 The Man of Great Strength 二十 大力量 人
松源和尚云、大力量人、因甚擡脚不起。
Shõgen Oshõ asked , " Why is it that a man of great strength does not lift his legs ? "
又云、開口不在舌頭上。
And he also said , " It is not the tongue he speaks with . "
Mumon's Comment
無門曰、松源可謂、傾腸倒腹。
It must be said that Shõgen shows us all his stomach and intestines .
只是欠人承當 。
But alas , no one can appreciate him !
縱饒直下承當、正好來無門處喫痛棒。
And even if someone could appreciate him , let him come to me , and I 'll beat him severely .
何故。
Why ?
□。要識眞金、火裏看 。
If you want to find pure gold , you must see it through fire .
Mumon's Verse 頌曰
擡脚踏翻香水 海 Lifting his leg , he kicks up the Scented Ocean ;
低頭俯視四禪 天 Lowering his head , he looks down on the fourth Dhyana heaven .
一箇渾身無處著 請
There is no space vast enough for his body —
續一句 Now , somebody write the last line here .
Case 21 Unmon's " Kanshiketsu " 二十一 雲門屎 橛
雲門、因僧問、如何是佛。
A monk asked Unmon , " What is Buddha ? "
門云、乾屎橛 。
Unmon replied , " Kanshiketsu ! " [ A dry shit - stick . ]
Mumon's Comment
無門曰、雲門可謂、家貧難辨素食、事忙不及草書。
Unmon was too poor to prepare plain food , too busy to speak from notes .
動便將屎橛來、□門挂戸。
He hurriedly took up shiketsu to support the Way .
佛法興衰可見 。
The decline of Buddhism was thus foreshadowed .
Mumon's Verse 頌曰
閃電光 Lightning flashing ,
撃石化 Sparks shooting ;
貶得眼 A moment 's blinking ,
巳蹉過 Missed forever .
Case 22 Kashyapa's " Knock Down the Flagpole " 二十二 迦葉刹 竿
迦葉、因阿難問云、世尊傳金襴袈裟外、別傳何物。
Ananda asked Kashyapa , " The World - honored One gave you the golden robe ; did he give you anything else ? "
葉喚云、阿難。
" Ananda ! " cried Kashyapa .
難、應諾 。
" Yes , sir ! " answered Ananda .
葉云、倒却門前刹竿著。
" Knock down the flagpole at the gate , " said Kashyapa .
Mumon's Comment
無門曰、若向者裏下得一轉語親切、便見靈山一會儼然未散。
If you can give a turning word at this point , you will see that the meeting at Mount Grdhrakuta is still solemnly continuing .
其或未然、毘婆尸佛、早留心、直至而今不得妙。
If not , then this is what Vipasyin Buddha worried about from remote ages ; up to now he has still not acquired the essence .
Mumon's Verse 頌曰
問處何如答處 親
Tell me — question or answer — which was more intimate ?
幾人於此眼生 筋
Many have knit their brows over this ;
兄呼弟鷹揚家 醜
Elder brother calls , younger brother answers , and they betray the family secret .
不屬陰陽別是 春
They had a special spring , not one of yin and yang .
Case 23 Think Neither Good Nor Evil 二十三 不思善 惡
六祖、因明上座、趁至大庾嶺。
The Sixth Patriarch was pursued by the monk Myõ as far as Taiyu Mountain .
祖見明至、即擲衣鉢於石上云、此衣表信。 可力爭耶、任君將去。
The patriarch , seeing Myõ coming , laid the robe and bowl on a rock and said , " This robe represents the faith ; it should not be fought over .
If you want to take it away , take it now . "
明遂擧之如山不動、踟□悚慄。 明白、我來 求法、非爲衣也 。
Myõ tried to move it , but it was as heavy as a mountain and would not budge .
Faltering and trembling , he cried out , " I came for the Dharma , not for the robe .
願行者開示 。
I beg you , please give me your instruction . "
祖云、不思善、不思惡、正與麼時、那箇是明上座本來面目。
The patriarch said , " Think neither good nor evil .
At this very moment , what is the original self of the monk Myõ ? "
明當下大悟、遍體汗流 。
At these words , Myõ was directly illuminated .
His whole body was covered with sweat .
泣涙作禮、問曰、上來密語密意外、還更 有意旨否。
He wept and bowed , saying , " Besides the secret words and the secret meaning you have just now revealed to me , is there anything else , deeper still ? "
祖曰、我今爲汝説者、即非密也。
The patriarch said , " What I have told you is no secret at all .
汝若返照自己面目、密却在汝邊。
When you look into your own true self , whatever is deeper is found right there . "
明云、其申雖在黄梅隨衆、實未省自己面目。
Myõ said , " I was with the monks under Õbai for many years but I could not realize my true self .
今蒙指授入處、如人飲水冷暖自知。
But now , receiving your instruction , I know it is like a man drinking water and knowing whether it is cold or warm .
今行者即是某甲師也 。
My lay brother , you are now my teacher . "
祖云、汝若如是則吾與汝同師黄梅。
The patriarch said , " If you say so , but let us both call Õbai our teacher .
善自護持 。
Be mindful to treasure and hold fast to what you have attained . "
Mumon's Comment
無問曰、六祖可謂、是事出急家老婆心切。
The Sixth Patriarch was , so to speak , hurried into helping a man in an emergency , and he displayed a grandmotherly kindness .
譬如新茘支剥了殻去了核、送在你口裏、只要你嚥一嚥。
It is as though he peeled a fresh lichi , removed the seed , put it in your mouth , and asked you to swallow it down .
Mumon's Verse 頌曰
描不成兮畫不 就
You cannot describe it ; you cannot picture it ;
贊不及兮休生 受
You cannot admire it ; do n't try to eat it raw .
本來面目没處 藏
Your true self has nowhere to hide ;
世界壞時渠不 朽
When the world is destroyed , it is not destroyed .
Case 24 Fuketsu's Speech and Silence 二十四 離却語 言
風穴和尚、因僧問、語默渉離微、如何通不犯。
A monk asked Fuketsu , " Both speech and silence are faulty in being ri [ 離 inward action of mind ] or bi [ 微 outward action of mind ] .
How can we escape these faults ? "
穴云、長憶江南三月裏、鷓鴣啼處百花香。
Fuketsu said ,
" I always remember the spring in Kõnan ,
Where the partridges sing ;
How fragrant the countless flowers ! "
Mumon's Comment
無門曰、風穴機如掣電得路便行。
Fuketsu's Zen spirit was like lightning and opened a clear passage .
爭 奈坐前人舌頭不斷 。
However , he was entangled in the monk 's words and could not cut them off .
若向者裏見得親切、自有出身之路。
If you can really grasp the problem , you can readily find the way out .
且離却語言三昧、道將一句來 。
Now , putting language samadhi aside , say it in your own words .
Mumon's Verse 頌曰
不露風骨 句
He does not use a refined phrase ;
未語先分 付 Before speaking , he has already handed it over .
進歩口喃 喃
If you chatter on and on ,
知君大罔 措
You will find you have lost your way .
Case 25 Kyõzan 's Dream 二十五 三座説 法
仰山和尚、夢見往彌勒所、安第三座。
In a dream Kyõzan Oshõ went to Maitreya 's place and was led in to sit in the third seat .
有一尊者、白槌云、今日當第三座説法。
A senior monk struck with a gavel and said , " Today the one in the third seat will speak . "
山乃起白槌云、摩訶衍法離四句、絶百非。
Kyõzan rose and , striking with the gavel , said , " The truth of Mahayana is beyond the four propositions and transcends the hundred negations .
諦聽、諦聽 。
Taichõ!
Taichõ ! "
[ Hear the truth ! ]
Mumon's Comment
無門曰、且道、是説法不説法、開口即失、閉口又喪。
Now tell me , did Kyõzan preach or did he not not ?
If he opens his mouth , he is lost ; if he seals his mouth , he is lost .
不開不閉、十万八千 。
Even if he neither opens nor shuts his mouth , he is a hundred and eight thousand [ miles away from the truth ] .
Mumon's Verse 頌曰
白日晴 天
In broad daylight , under the blue sky ,
夢中説 夢
He forges a dream in a dream ;
捏怪捏 怪
He makes up a monstrous story
誑□一衆
And tries to deceive the whole crowd .
Case 26 Two Monks Roll Up the Blinds 二十六 二僧卷 簾
清涼大法眼、因僧齋前上參。 眼以手指簾 。
When the monks assembled before the midday meal to listen to his lecture , the great Hõgen of Seiry õ pointed at the bamboo blinds .
時有二僧、同去卷簾 。
Two monks simultaneously went and rolled them up .
眼曰、一得一失 。
Hõgen said , " One gain , one loss . "
Mumon's Comment
無門曰、且道、是誰得誰失。
Tell me , who gained and who lost ?
若向者裏著得一隻眼、便知清涼國師敗闕處。
If you have an eye to penetrate the secret , you will see where Seiry õ Kokushi failed .
然雖如是、切忌向得失裏商量。
However , I warn you strongly against discussing gain and loss .
Mumon's Verse 頌曰
卷起明明徹太 空 Rolling up the blinds , the great sky is open ,
太空猶末合吾 宗
But the great sky does not come up to Zen .
爭似從空都放 下
Why do n't you throw them all down from the sky ,
綿綿密密不通 風
And keep your practice so close that no air can escape ?
Case 27 Nansen 's " Not Mind , Not Buddha , Not Things " 二十七 不是心 佛
南泉和尚、因僧問云、還有不與人説底法麼。
A monk asked Nansen , " Is there any Dharma that has not been preached to the people ? "
泉云、有 。
Nansen answered , " There is . "
僧云、如何是不與人説底法。
" What is the truth that has not been taught ? " asked the monk .
泉云、不是心、不是佛、不是物。
Nansen said , " It is not mind ; it is not Buddha ; it is not things . "
Mumon's Comment
無門曰、南泉被者一問、直得揣盡家私、郎當不少。
At this question , Nansen used up all his treasure and was not a little confused .
Mumon's Verse 頌曰
叮嚀損君 徳
Talking too much spoils your virtue ;
無言眞有功 Silence is truly unequaled .
任從滄海 變
Let the mountains become the sea ;
終不爲君 通 I 'll give you no comment .
Case 28 Ryûtan Blows
Out the Candle 二十八 久嚮龍 潭
龍潭、因徳山請益抵夜 。
Tokusan asked Ryûtan about Zen far into the night .
潭云、夜深 。
At last Ryûtan said , " The night is late .
子何不下去 。
Why do n't you retire ? "
山遂珍重掲簾而出。 見外面黒却回云、外面黒 。
Tokusan made his bows and lifted the blinds to withdraw , but he was met by darkness .
Turning back to Ryûtan , he said , " It is dark outside . "
潭乃點紙燭度與 。
Ryûtan lit a paper candle and handed it to him .
山擬接。潭便吹滅 。
Tokusan was about to take it when Ryûtan blew it out .
山於此忽然有省。 便作禮 。
At this , all of a sudden , Tokusan went through a deep experience and made bows .
潭云、子見箇甚麼道理 。
Ryûtan said , " What sort of realization do you have ? "
山云、某甲從今日去不疑天下老和尚舌頭也。
" From now on , " said Tokusan , " I will not doubt the words of an old oshõ who is renowned everywhere under the sun . "
至明日、龍潭陞堂云、可中有箇漢、牙如劍樹、口似血盆。
The next day Ryûtan ascended the rostrum and said , " I see a fellow among you .
His fangs are like the sword tree .
His mouth is like a blood bowl .
一棒打不回頭 。
Strike him with a stick , and he wo n't turn his head to look at you .
他時異日、向孤峰頂上立君道在。
Someday or other , he will climb the highest of the peaks and establish our Way there . "
山遂取疏抄於法堂前、將一炬火提起云、窮諸玄辨、若一毫致於太虚、竭世樞機似一滴投於巨壑。
Tokusan brought his notes on the Diamond Sutra to the front of the hall , pointed to them with a torch , and said , " Even though you have exhausted the abtruse doctrines , it is like placing a hair in a vast space .
Even though you have learned all the secrets of the world , it is like a drop of water dripped on the great ocean . "
將疏抄便燒 。
And he burned all his notes .
於是禮辭 。
Then , making bows , he took his leave of his teacher .
Mumon's Comment
無門曰、徳山未出關時、心憤憤、口□□、得得來南方要滅却教外別傳之旨。
Before Tokusan crossed the barrier from his native place , his mind burned and his mouth uttered bitterness .
He went soutward , intending to stamp out the doctrines of special transmission outside the sutras .
及到澧州路上問婆子買點心。
When he reached the road to Reishû , he asked an old woman to let him have lunch to " refresh the mind . "
婆云、大徳車子内是甚麼文字。
" Your worship , what sort of literature do you carry in your pack ? " the old woman asked .
山云、金剛經疏抄 。
" Commentaries on the Diamond Sutra , " replied Tokusan .
婆云、只如經中道、過去心不可得、見在心不可得、未來心不可得。
The old woman said , " I hear it is said in that sutra , ' The past mind can not be held , the present mind cannot be held , the future mind can not be held . '
大徳、要點那箇心 。
Now , I would like to ask you , what mind are you going to have refreshed ? "
徳山被者一問、直得口似□檐。
At this question Tokusan was dumbfounded .
然雖如是、未肯向婆子句下死却。遂問婆子、近處有甚麼宗師。
However , he did not remain inert under her words but asked , " Do you know of any good teacher around here ? "
婆云、五里外有龍潭和尚。
The old woman said , " Five miles from here you will find Ryûtan Oshõ . "
及到龍潭納盡敗闕 。
Coming to Ryûtan , Tokusan got the worst of it .
可謂是前言不應後語 。
His former words were inconsistent with his later ones .
龍潭大似憐兒不覺醜 。
As for Ryûtan , he seemed to have lost all sense of shame in his compassion toward his son .
見他有些子火種、郎忙將惡水驀頭一澆澆殺。
Finding a bit of live coal in the other , enough to start a fire , he hurriedly poured on muddy water to annihilate everything at once .
冷地看來、一場好笑 。
A little cool reflection tells us it was all a farce .
Mumon's Verse 頌曰
聞名不如見 面
Hearing the name cannot surpass seeing the face ;
見面不如聞 名 Seeing the face cannot surpass hearing the name .
雖然救得鼻 孔
He may have saved his nose ,
爭 奈瞎却眼 晴
But alas !
he lost his eyes .
Case 29 The Sixth Patriarch 's " Your Mind Moves " 二十九 非風非 幡
六祖、因風颺刹幡。有二僧、對論。
The wind was flapping a temple flag , and two monks started an argument .
一云、幡動。一云、風動 。
One said the flag moved , the other said the wind moved ;
往復曾未契理 。
they argued back and forth but could not reach a conclusion .
祖云、不是風動、不是幡動、仁者心動。
The Sixth Patriarch said , " It is not the wind that moves , it is not the flag that moves ; it is your mind that moves . "
二僧悚然 。
The two monks were awe - struck .
Mumon's Comment
無門曰、不是風動、不是幡動、不是心動、甚處見祖師。
It is not the wind that moves ; it is not the flag that moves ; it is not the mind that moves .
How do you see the patriarch ?
若向者裏見得親切、方知二僧買鐵得金。
If you come to understand this matter deeply , you will see that the two monks got gold when buying iron .
祖師忍俊不禁、一場漏逗 。
The patriarch could not withhold his compassion and courted disgrace .
Mumon's Verse 頌曰
風幡心動 Wind , flag , mind , moving ,
一状領 過
All equally to blame .
只知開口
Only knowing how to open his mouth ,
不覺話墮 Unaware of his fault in talking .
Case 30 Baso's " This Very Mind Is the Buddha " 三十 即心即 佛
馬祖、因大梅問、如何是佛。
Daibai asked Baso , " What is the Buddha ? "
祖云、即心是佛 。
Baso answered , " This very mind is the Buddha . "
Mumon's Comment
無門曰、若能直下領略得去、著佛衣、喫佛飯、説佛話、行佛行、即是佛也。
If you directly grasp Baso 's meaning , you wear the Buddha 's clothes , eat the Buddha 's food , speak the Buddha 's words , do the Buddha 's deeds — that is , you are a Buddha himself .
然雖如是、大梅引多少人、錯認定盤星。
However , alas !
Daibai misled not a few people into taking the mark on the balance for the weight itself .
爭知道説箇佛字、三日漱口 。
How could he realize that even mentioning the word " Buddha " should make us rinse out our mouths for three days ?
若是箇漢、見説即心是佛、掩耳便走。
If a man of understanding hears anyone say , " This very mind is the Buddha , " he will cover his ears and rush away .
Mumon's Verse 頌曰
青天白 日
The blue sky and bright day ,
切忌尋 覓
No more searching around !
更問如何 " What is the Buddha ? " you ask :
抱贓叫屈
With loot in your pocket , you declare yourself innocent .
Case 31 Jõshû Investigates an Old Woman 三十一 趙州勘 婆
趙州、因僧問婆子、臺山路向甚處去。
A monk asked an old woman , " What is the way to Taisan ? "
婆云、驀直去 。
The old woman said , " Go straight on . "
僧纔行三五歩。 婆云、好箇師僧、又恁麼去 。
When the monk had proceeded a few steps , she said , " A good , respectable monk , but he too goes that way . "
後有僧擧似州 。
Afterward someone told Jõshû about this .
州云、待我去與你勘過這婆子。
Jõshû said , " Wait a bit , I will go and investigate the old woman for you . "
明日便去亦如是問。 婆亦如是答 。
The next day he went and asked the same question , and the old woman gave the same answer .
州歸謂衆曰、臺山婆子、我與□勘破了也。
On returning , Jõshû said to his disciples , " I have investigated the old woman of Taisan for you . "
Mumon's Comment
無門曰、婆子只解坐籌帷幄、要且著賊不知。
The old woman only knew how to sit still in her tent and plan the campaign ; she did not know when she was shadowed by a spy .
趙州老人、善用偸營劫塞乃機、又且無大人相。
Though old Jõshû showed himself clever enough to take a camp and overwhelm a fortress , he displayed no trace of being a great commander .
撿點將來、二倶有過 。
If we look at them , they both have their faults .
且道、那裏是趙州、勘破婆子處 。
But tell me , what did Jõshû see in the old woman ?
Mumon's Verse 頌曰
問既一般
The question was like the others ,
答亦相 似
The answer was the same .
飯裏有砂 Sand in the rice ,
泥中有刺 Thorns in the mud .
Case 32 A Non-Buddhist Philosopher Questions the Buddha 三十二 外道問 佛
世尊、因外道問、不問有言、不問無言。
A non-Buddhist philosopher said to the Buddha , " I do not ask for words ; I don not ask for non-words . "
世尊據座 。
The Buddha just sat there .
外道贊歎云、世尊大慈大悲、開我迷雲令我得入。
The philosopher said admiringly , " The World - honored One , with his great mercy , has blown away the clouds of my illusion and enabled me to enter the Way . "
乃具禮而去 。
And after making bows , he took his leave .
阿難尋問佛、外道有何所證贊歎而去。
Then Ananda asked the Buddha , " What did he realize , to admire you so much ? "
世尊云、如世良馬見鞭影而行。
The World - honored One replied , " A fine horse runs even at the shadow of the whip . "
Mumon's Comment
無門曰、阿難乃佛弟子、宛不如外道見解、且道、外道與佛弟子相去多少。
Ananda was the Buddha 's disciple , but his understanding was not equal to that of the non-Buddhist .
I want to ask you , what difference is there between the Buddha 's disciple and the non-Buddhist ?
Mumon's Verse 頌曰
劍刃上 行
On the edge of a sword ,
氷綾上 走
Over the ridge of an iceberg ,
不渉階 梯
With no steps , no ladders ,
懸崖撒手 Climbing the cliffs without hands .
Case 33 Baso 's " No Mind , No Buddha " 三十三 非心非 佛
馬祖、因僧問、如何是佛。

祖曰、非心非佛 。
Baso answered , " No mind , no Buddha . "
Mumon's Comment
無門曰、若向者裏見得、參學事畢。
If you understand this , you have finished studying Zen .
Mumon's Verse 頌曰
路逢劍客須呈 Present a sword if you meet a swordsman ;
不遇詩人莫 獻
Do n't offer a poem unless you meet a poet .
逢人且説三 分
When talking , tell one - third of it ;
未可全施一片
Do n't divulge the whole at once .
Case 34 Nansen 's " Reason Is Not the Way " 三十四 智不是 道
南泉云、心不是佛、智不是道。
Nansen said , " Mind is not the Buddha , reason is not the Way . "
Mumon's Comment
無門曰、南泉可謂、老不識羞。
Nansen , growing old , had no shame .
纔開臭口、家醜外揚。
Just opening his stinking mouth , he let slip the family secrets .
然雖如是、知恩者少 。
Yet there are very few who are grateful for his kindness .
Mumon's Verse 頌曰
天晴日頭 出
The sky clears , the sun shines bright ,
雨下地上 濕
The rain comes , the earth gets wet .
盡情都説 了
He opens his heart and expounds the whole secret ,
只恐信不 及
But I fear he is little appreciated .
Case 35 Seijõ 's Soul Separated 三十五 倩女離 魂
五祖問僧云、倩女離魂、那箇是眞底。
Goso said to his monks , " Seijõ 's soul separated from her being .
Which was the real Seijõ ? "
Mumon's Comment
無門曰、若向者裏悟得眞底、便知出殻入殻如宿旅舎。
When you realize what the real is , you will see that we pass from one husk to another like travelers stopping for a night 's lodging .
其或未然、切莫亂走 。
But if you do not realize it yet , I earnestly advise you not to rush about wildly .
驀然地水火風一散、如落湯螃蟹七手八脚。
When earth , water , fire , and air suddenly separate , you will be like a crab struggling in boiling water with its seven or eight arms and legs .
那時莫言、不道 。
When that happens , do n't say I did n't warn you !
Mumon's Verse 頌曰
雲月是 同
The moon above the clouds is ever the same ;
渓山各異 Valleys and mountains are separate from each other .
萬福萬 福
All are blessed , all are blessed ;
是一是 二
Are they one or are they two ?
Case 36 When You Meet a Man of the Way 三十六 路逢達 道
五祖曰、路逢達道人、不將語默對、且道、將甚麼對。
Goso said , " When you meet a man of the Way on the path , do not meet him with words or in silence .
Tell me , how will you meet him ? "
Mumon's Comment
無門曰、若向者裏對得親切、不妨慶快。
In such a case , if you can manage an intimate meeting with him it will certainly be gratifying .
其或未然、也須一切處著眼 。
But if you cannot , you must be watchful in every way .
Mumon's Verse 頌曰
路逢達道人 Meeting a man of the Way on the road ,
不將語默 對
Meet him with neither words nor silence .
攔腮劈面 拳 A punch on the jaw :
直下會便會 Understand , if you can directly understand .
Case 37 Jõshû's Oak Tree 三十七 庭前栢 樹
趙州、因僧問、如何是祖師西來意。
A monk asked Jõshû , " What is the meaning of Bodhidharma 's coming to China ? "
州云、庭前栢樹子。
Jõshû said , " The oak tree in the garden . "
Mumon's Comment
無門曰、若向趙州答處見得親切、前無釋迦後無彌勒。
If you understand Jõshû 's answer intimately , there is no Shakya before you , no Maitreya to come .
Mumon's Verse 頌曰
言無展事 Words cannot express things ;
語不投機 Speech does not convey the spirit .
承言者喪 Swayed by words , one is lost ;
滯句者迷 Blocked by phrases , one is belwildered .
Case 38 A Buffalo Passes the Window 三十八 牛過窓 櫺
五祖曰、譬如水牯牛過窓櫺、頭角四蹄都過了、因甚麼尾巴過不得。
Goso said , " A buffalo passes by the window .
His head , horns , and four legs all go past .
But why can't the tail pass too ? "
Mumon's Comment
無門曰、若 向者裏顛倒、著得一隻眼、下得一轉語、可以上報四恩下資三有。
If you make a complete about - face , open your eye , and give a turning word on this point , you will be able to repay the four kinds of love that have favored you and help the sentient beings in the three realms who follow you .
其或未然、更須照顧尾巴始得。
If you are still unable to do this , return to this tail and reflect upon it , and then for the first time you will realize something .
Mumon's Verse 頌曰
過去墮抗 塹 Passing by , it falls into a ditch ;
回來却被 壞 Coming back , all the worse , it is lost .
者些尾巴子
This tiny little tail ,
直是甚奇 怪
What a strange thing it is !
Case 39 A Mistake in Speaking 三十九 雲門話 墮
雲門、因僧問、光明寂照遍河沙。
A monk said to Unmon , " The brilliance of the Buddha silently illuminates the whole universe . . . "
一句未絶、門遽曰、豈不是張拙秀才語 。
But before the could finish the verse , Unmon said , " Are n't those the words of Chõetsu the Genius ? "
僧云、是 。
" Yes , they are , " answered the monk .
門云、話墮也 。
" You have slipped up in your speaking , " Unmon said .
後來、死心拈云、且道、那裏是者僧話墮處。
Afterward , Shishin Zenji brought up the matter and said , " Tell me , at what point did the monk err in his speaking ? "
Mumon's Comment
無門曰、若向者裏見得雲門用處孤危、者僧因甚話墮、堪與人天爲師。
If you clearly understand this and realize how exacting Unmon was in his method , and what made the monk err in his speaking , you are qualified to be a teacher of heaven and earth .
若也未明、自救不了 。
If you are not yet clear about it , you are far from saving yourself .
Mumon's Verse 頌曰
急流垂釣 A line cast in the rapids ,
貪餌者 著
The greedy will be caught .
口縫纔開 Before you start to open your mouth ,
性命喪却
Your life is already lost !
Case 40 Tipping Over a Water Bottle 四十 □倒淨 瓶
溈山和尚、始在百丈會中充典座。
When Isan Oshõ was with Hyakujõ , he was tenzo [ 典座 head cook ] of the monastery .
百丈、將選大溈主人。 乃請同 首座對衆下語、出格者可往 。
Hyakujõ wanted to choose a master for Mount Tai-i , so he called together all the monks and told them that anyone who could answer his question in an outstanding manner would be chosen .
百丈遂拈淨瓶、置地上設問云、不得喚作淨瓶、汝喚作甚麼。
Then he took a water bottle and stood it on the floor , and said , " You may not call this a water bottle .
What do you call it ? "
首座乃云、不可喚作木□也。
The head monk said , " It can not be called a stump . "
百丈却問於山 。
Hyakujõ asked Isan his opinion .
山乃□倒淨瓶而去 。
Isan tipped over the water bottle with his feet and went out .
百丈笑云、第一座 輸却山子也 。
Hyakujõ laughed and said , " The head monk loses . "
因命之爲山 。
And Isan was named as the founder of the new monastery .
Mumon's Comment
無門曰、溈山一期之勇、 爭
奈跳百丈圈圚不出、撿點將來、便重不便輕。
Isan displayed great spirit in his action , but he could not cut himself free from Hyakujõ 's apron strings .
He preferred the heavier task to lighter one .
何故。□ 。
Why was he like that , eh ?
脱得盤頭、擔起鐵枷 。
He took off his headband to bear the iron yoke .
Mumon's Verse 頌曰
颺下笊籬并木 杓 Tossing bamboo baskets and ladles away ,
當陽一突絶周 遮
He made a glorious dash and swept all before him .
百丈重關欄不住 Hyakujõ 's barrier cannot stop his advance ;
脚尖□出佛如麻 Thousands of Buddhas come forth from the tips of his feet .

" Bring your mind here and I will pacify it for you , " replied Bodhidharma .
祖云、覓心了不可得 。
" I have searched for my mind , and I cannot take hold of it , " said the Second Patriarch .
磨云、爲汝安心竟 。
" Now your mind is pacified , " said Bodhidharma .
Mumon's Comment
無門曰、□齒老胡、十万里航海特特而來。
The broken - toothed old Hindu came so importantly , thousands of miles over the sea .
可謂是無風起浪 。
This was raising waves where there was no wind .
末後接得一箇門人、又却六根不具。
In his last years he induced enlightenment in his disciple , who , to make matters worse , was defective in the six roots .
□。謝三郎不識四字 。
Why , Shasanro did not know for ideographs .
Mumon's Verse 頌曰
西來直指 Coming east , directly pointing ,

You entrusted the Dharma , and trouble arose ;
撓聒叢 林
The clamor of the monasteries
元來是 □
Is all because of you .
Case 42 The Girl Comes out of Samadhi 四十二 女子出 定
世尊、昔、因文殊、至諸佛集處値諸佛各還本處。
Once , in the old days , in the time of the World - honored One , Manjusri went to the assembly of the Buddhas and found that everyone had departed to his original dwelling place .
惟有一女人近彼佛坐入於三昧 。
Only a girl remained , sitting in samadhi close to the Buddha 's throne .
文殊乃白佛、云何女人得近佛坐而我不得。
Manjusri asked Shakyamuni Buddha , " Why can the girl get near the Buddha 's throne , while I cannot ? "
佛告文殊、汝但覺此女、令從三昧起、汝自問之。
Shakyamuni Buddha said , " Bring her out of her samadhi and ask her yourself . "
文殊遶女人三□、鳴指一下、乃托至梵天盡其神力而不能出。
Manjusri walked around the girl three times , snapped his fingers once , took her to the Brahma heaven , and exerted all his miraculous powers to bring her out of her meditation , but in vain .
世尊云、假使百千文殊亦出此女人定不得。
The World - honored One said , " Even a hundred thousand Manjusris can not make her wake up .
下方過一十二億河沙國土有罔明菩薩。
But down below , past twelve hundred million lands as innumerable as the sands of Ganges , there is a Bodhisattva Mõmy õ .
能出此女人定 。
He will be able to rouse her from her samadhi . "
須臾罔明大士、從地湧出禮拜世尊。世尊敕罔明。
Instantly the Bodhisattva Mõmy õ emerged from the earth and made a bow to the World - honored One , who gave him his imperial order .
却至女人前鳴指一下 。
The Bodhisattva went over to the girl and snapped his fingers once .
女人於是從定而出 。
At this she came out of her samadhi .
Mumon's Comment
無門曰、釋迦老子、做者一場雜劇、不通小小。
Old Shakyamuni put a petty drama on the stage and failed to enlighten the masses .
且道、文殊是七佛之師、因甚出 女人定不得 。
I want to ask you : Manjusri is the teacher of the Seven Buddhas ; why could n't he arouse the girl from her samadhi ?
罔明初地菩薩、爲甚却出得。
How was it that Mõmyõ , a Bodhisattva at the beginner 's stage , could do it ?
若向者裏見得親切、業識忙忙那伽大定。
If you understand this intimately , you will enjoy Nagya 's grand samadhi in the busiest activity of consciousness .
Mumon's Verse 頌曰
出得出不 得
One was successful , the other was not ;
渠儂得自 由 Both secured freedom of mind .
神頭并鬼 面
One in a god-mask , the other in a devil - mask ;
敗闕當風 流 Even in defeat , a beautiful performance .
Case 43 Shuzan 's Shippei 四十三 首山竹 篦
首山和尚、拈竹篦示衆云、汝等諸人、若喚作竹篦則觸。
Shuzan Oshõ held up his shippei [ staff of office ] before his disciples and said , " You monks !
If you call this a shippei , you oppose its reality .
不喚作竹篦則背 。
If you do not call it a shippei , you ignore the fact .
汝諸人、且道、喚作甚麼。
Tell me , you monks , what will you call it ? "
Mumon's Comment
無門曰、喚作竹篦則觸 。
If you call it a shippei , you oppose its reality .
不喚作竹篦則背 。
If you do not call it a shippei , you ignore the fact .

Now , tell me quickly , what is it ?
Mumon's Verse 頌曰

If you have no staff , I will take it from you . "
Mumon's Comment

It helps me wade across a river when the bridge is down .
It accompanies me to the village on a moonless night .

Hõen of Tõzan said , " Even Shakya and Maitreya are servants of another .
且道、他是阿誰 。
I want to ask you , who is he ? "
Mumon's Comment
無門曰、若也見得他分曉、譬如十字街頭撞見親爺相似、更不須問別人道是與不是。
If you can really see this " another " with perfect clarity , it is like encountering your own father at a crossroads .
Why should you ask whether you recognize him or not ?
Mumon's Verse 頌曰
他弓莫挽
Don't draw another 's bow ,
他馬莫騎
Do n't ride another 's horse ,
他非莫辨
Do n't discuss another 's faults ,
他事莫知 Do n't explore another 's affairs .
Case 46 Proceed
On from the Top of the Pole 四十六 竿頭進 歩
石霜和尚云、百尺竿頭、如何進歩。
Sekisõ Oshõ asked , " How can you proceed on further from the top of a hundred - foot pole ? "
又古徳云、百尺竿頭坐底人、雖然得入未爲眞。
Another eminent teacher of old said , " You , who sit on the top of a hundred - foot pole , although you have entered the Way you are not yet genuine .
百尺竿頭、須進歩十方世界現全身。
Proceed on from the top of the pole , and you will show your whole body in the ten directions . "
Mumon's Comment
無門曰、進得歩、翻得身、更嫌何處不稱尊。
If you go on further and turn your body about , no place is left where you are not the master .
然雖如是、且道、百尺竿頭、如何進歩。嗄。
But even so , tell me , how will you go on further from the top of a hundred - foot pole ?
Eh ? "
Mumon's Verse 頌曰
瞎却頂門 眼
He darkens the third eye of insight
錯認定盤 星
And clings to the first mark on the scale .
拌身能捨 命
Even though he may sacrifice his life ,
一盲引衆 盲
He is only a blind man leading the blind .
Case 47 Tosotsu's Three Barriers 四十七 兜率三 關
兜率悦和尚、設三關問學者、
Tosotsu Etsu
Osh õ set up three barriers for his disciples :
撥草參玄只圖見性 。
1 . You leave no stone unturned to explore profundity , simply to see into your true nature .
即今上人性在甚處 。
Now , I want to ask you , just at this moment , where is your true nature ?
識得自性方脱生死 。
2 . If you realize your true nature , you are free from life and death .
眼光落時、作麼生脱 。
Tell me , when your eyesight deserts you at the last moment , how can you be free from life and death ?
脱得生死便知去處、四大分離向甚處去。
3 . When you set yourself free from life and death , you should know your ultimate destination .
So when the four elements separate , where will you go ?
Mumon's Comment
無門曰、若能下得此三轉語、便可以隨處作主遇縁即宗。
If you can put turning words to these three questions , you are the master wherever you may stand and command Zen whatever circumstances you may be in .
其或未然、麁□易飽、細嚼難飢。
If otherwise , listen : gulping down your meal will fill you easily , but chewing it well can sustain you .
Mumon's Verse 頌曰
一念普觀無量 劫
This moment 's thoughts sees through eternal time ;
無量劫事即如今 Eternal time is just this moment .
如今□破箇一 念
If you see through this moment 's thought ,
□破如今□底 人
You see through the man who sees through this moment .
Case 48 Kempõ's One Road 四十八 乾峰一路
乾峰和尚、因僧問、十方薄伽梵、一路涅槃門。
A monk asked Kempõ Oshõ , " It is written , ' Bhagavats in the ten directions .
One straight road to Nirvana .'
未審路頭在甚麼處 。
I still wonder where the road can be . "
峰拈起拄杖、劃一劃云、在者裏 。
Kempõ lifted his staff , drew a line , and said , " Here it is . "
後僧請益雲門 。
Later the monks asked the same question to Unmon ,
門拈起扇子云、扇子□跳上三 十三天、築著帝釋鼻孔 。
who held up his fan and said , " This fan jumps up to the thirty - third heaven and hits the nose of the deity Sakra Devanam Indra .
東海鯉魚、打一棒雨似盆傾 。
When you strike the carp of the eastern sea , the rain comes down in torrents . "
Mumon's Comment
無門曰、一人向深深海底行、□土揚塵、一人於高高山頂、白浪滔天。
One , going to the bottom of the sea , lifts up clouds of dust ; the other , on the top of the highest mountain , rises towering waves to wash the sky .
把定放行、各出一隻手扶竪宗乗 。
One holding fast , the other letting go , each stretches out his hand to support the profound teaching .
大似兩箇馳子相撞著 。
They are just like two riders starting from opposite ends of the course and meeting in the middle .
世上應無直底人 。
But none on earth can be absolutely direct .
正眼觀來二大老惣未識路頭在。
When examined with a true eye , neither of these two great masters knows the road .
Mumon's Verse 頌曰
未擧歩時先已 到
Before a step is taken , the goal is reached ;
未動舌時先説 了
Before the tongue is moved , the speech is finished .
直饒著著在機 先
Though each move is ahead of the next ,
更須知有向上 竅
There is still a transcendent secret .
Mumon's Postscript 後序
從上佛祖垂示機縁、據款結案、初無剰語。
The sayings and doings of the Buddha and the patriarchs have been set down in their original form .
掲翻腦蓋、露出眼睛 。
Nothing superfluous has been added by the author , who has taken the lid off his head and exposed his eyeballs .
肯要諸人直下承當、不從佗覓。
Your direct realization is demanded ; it should not be sought through others .
若是通方上士。 纔聞擧著、便知落處 。
If you are a man of realization , you will immediately grasp the point at the slightest mention of it .
了無門戸可入、亦無階級可升。
There is no gate for you to go through ; there are no stairs for you to ascend .
掉臂度關不問關吏 。
You pass the checkpoint , squaring your shoulders , without asking permission of the keeper .
豈不見玄沙道、無門解脱之門、無意道人之意。
Remember Gensha 's saying , " No - gate is the gate of emancipation ; no -meaning is the meaning of the man of the Way . "
又白雲道、明明知道只是者箇、爲甚麼透不過。
And Hakuun says , " Clearly you know how to talk of it , but why can't you pass this simple , specific thing ? "
恁麼説話、也是赤土搽牛嬭。
However , all this kind of talk is like making a mud pie with milk and butter .
若透得無門關、早是鈍置無門。
If you have passed the Mumonkan , you can make a fool of Mumon .
若透不得無門關、亦之辜負自己。
If not , you are betraying yourself .
所謂、涅槃心易曉、差別智難明。
It is easy to know the Nirvana mind but difficult to attain the wisdom of differentiation .
明得差別智、家國自安寧。
When you have realized this wisdom , peace and order will reign over your land .

Wittgenstein's ' private language ' argument
DB1
The following consists of comments upon selected passages from Wittgenstein's ' Philosophical Investigations ' relevant to the ' private language argument ' .
For the benefit of those who do not possess a copy of the Investigations I have quoted in full the sections I am commenting upon .
The original text is shown in red .
I have only been able to deal with a fraction of the relevant material but there should be enough to serve as a basis for discussion .
Wittgenstein numbers his paragraphs , and so have I .
The following tables indicate the topics of each of the paragraphs .
Wittgenstein's Paragraphs para topic 243 ... could we also imagine a language in which a person could write down or give expression to his inner experiences ... for his private use ?
... 244 How do words refer to sensations ?
... 245 For how can I ... try to use language to get between pain and its expression ?
246 In what sense are my sensations private ? ...
256 Now what about the language which describes my inner experiences and which only I myself can understand ? ... 257 " What would it be like if human beings showed no outward signs of pain ... ? ... 258 I want to keep a diary about the recurrence of a certain sensation .
... 259 Are the rules of the private language impressions of rules ?
260 " Well , I believe that this is the sensation S again . " ... 261 What reason have we for calling " S " the sign for a sensation ?
... 262 ... you must inwardly undertake to use the word in such - and - such a way ... 263 ... A queer question .
264 " Once you know what the word stands for , you understand it , you know its whole use . "
My Paragraphs para topic DB1 Introduction DB2 243 DB3 243 , a language private in the sense of being capable of referring to private objects ( or what have you 's ) , need not also be private in the sense of being understood by only one person DB4 244 , 245 , 246 DB5 246 , making sense .

As I predicted John McCain wasted his time and money in Pennsylvania , as it was called for Obama about a minute after the polls closed , but the big flip was Ohio , which Obama is projected to win .
This means that with only the West Coast , Barack Obama will be the next president of the United States .
Without even seeing any exit polling data , I can tell you that George W. Bush and the economy killed John McCain ’s hopes in Ohio and Pennsylvania .
Obama is putting a stunning beating on McCain in Pennsylvania .
He is leading McCain , 63 % - 35 % .
These numbers will tighten as most of the results that have not come in yet are from the conservative T .
No one should be surprised if the final margin for Obama in Pennsylvania is double digits .
In Ohio , Obama might win by double digits , as he currently leads 54 % - 44 % .
Obama will likely win California , Oregon , Washington and Hawaii .
He will probably also pick up Iowa , Nevada , and Colorado .
I am not even including the pending results from Indiana , North Carolina , and Florida .
The only question now is how big Obama ’s margin of victory will be .
I think he will probably get over 300 electoral votes , and will have the biggest Democratic win since Clinton in 1996 .
It is possible if things break his way , Obama could have the second largest Democratic victory only behind LBJ in 1964 .

One other point is that it seems the polls were correct .
The polls have been telling us for weeks that the potential existed for an Obama rout , and that is what we are on pace to have happen .
Some were telling us that the polls were wrong in Ohio and Pennsylvania , but the polls have been consistent in pointing to Obama , and he was never challenged in Ohio and Pennsylvania .
At the end of the day , John McCain sealed his fate in each state by running a character driven campaign in two states that were desperate for economic change .
The Thought Screen Helmet is a new gadget to defend against Aliens .
Are you afraid of being abducted by aliens ?
Have you been a part of Alien Sightings ?
If you said Yes , then you ’re not alone .
Many people believe that we are n’t the only ones in this universe and that extra-terrestrial life forms are smarter than us .
Having said that , many fear that when aliens capture humans , they will want to study our ‘ primitive ’ culture .
Hence , there is a new gadget out there that can prevent you from being a subject of alien studies , and it ’s called the Thought Screen Helmet .
The Helmet costs about $ 30 to make and Stopabductions ( who , by the way are also terrified of abductions ) , have developed a ( DIY ) method to make these hi-tech anti-abduction shields .
By using Velostat , which is an electric shielding material as opposed to regular tin foil , the makers of this wonder hat are able to halt alien telepathic transmission .
Apparently , it takes eight of these Velostat shields to come up with required stuff to stop telepathic signals from entering your brain .
Yap !
This is definitely another foolish Alien Gadget to acquire for those of you have a crafty streak in you this Christmas season .
Inventor Michael Menkin explains that these thought screen devices fit nicely inside any hat or helmet .
If you feel that alien signals are too strong , you have the option of adding yet another layer of Velostat – definitely scary stuff .
Menkin also warns that you need to make the shield quickly and put it on as fast as you can .
This is so that you can effectively block out alien signals prompting you to stop messing around with the Velostat and start doing some real work .

OMG !
One of them is moving .
Police dash cam , video recently released .
Little Rock , Ark. LITTLE ROCK , Ark .
City and state police have closed their investigations into last summer 's shooting of Arkansas ' Democratic Party chairman without offering an explanation of why the attack occurred .
Bill Gwatney died Aug. 13 after being shot three times by a man who had been fired from his job at a Target store that morning .
The shooter , Timothy Dale Johnson , was chased into Grant County , where he was shot and killed after threatening officers .
A police report said Johnson was on an antidepressant and that the drug may have played a part in his " irrational and violent behavior .
" Autopsy results said Gwatney died from a shot to the head .
Johnson was shot six times .
" I wish there was a conclusion , but there was n't , " said Lt. Terry Hastings , a police spokesman .
Authorities discovered a note with a telephone number and the word " Gwatney " on it in Johnson 's home , but the report found that it was a telephone number for Gwatney Towing Company in Jacksonville , which is no longer in business .
The FBI also reviewed the history on Johnson 's computer , and found that he visited Wikipedia , Yahoo and news sites the day before the shooting .
Johnson also visited the Web site of the Bureau of Alcohol , Tobacco and Firearms that day , the report said .
The 986 - page report says police searched through electronic and paper files at Gwatney 's businesses for Johnson 's name , but that it never turned up .
Gwatney owned three General Motors car dealerships and was a state senator for 10 years before becoming the state 's Democratic chairman last year .
A separate report released Thursday by Arkansas State Police found that the officers who fatally shot Johnson acted properly .
Prosecutor Eddy Easley said no criminal charges would be filed in connection with Johnson 's death .
When officers stopped Johnson in Grant County - after a 30 - mile chase from Little Rock - they ordered him to get down , the report said .
Instead he pulled from his vehicle a rifle case that he tried to open even as officers shot him .
Weapons in Johnson 's possession when he was stopped included the Ruger .357 Magnum used to kill Gwatney , the report said .
According to the report , Johnson 's sister , Janice Peacock , told troopers that Johnson had begun taking classes at Arkansas State University at Beebe and asked her to help him pay for his tuition .
She said that her brother had also pawned some of the firearms from his gun collection to help pay for tuition .
Peacock said her brother was " always interested in politics , but never to the point of threatening to kill anyone , " the report said .
" I really thought he would commit suicide , " Peacock told investigators .
" I never thought he would hurt anybody . "
Memory Killers
Page 1 of 2
Memory is a marvel of human biology — essential to mankind 's way of life and survival , but so complex that it is not yet fully understood .
As a physiological process , the storing and retrieval of information is imperfect and thus vulnerable to certain destructive forces ( or memory killers ) .
These forces can be both internal and external , and can effect any area of the memory : sensory , short - term or long - term .
The following are just a few memory killers to avoid if you want to help your brain function at its best .
Smoking
Although most are unaware of the fact , smoking cigarettes is a memory killer .
Several studies have indicated that smokers , particularly middle - aged and elderly , show increased decline in both memory and general cognitive ability in comparison to non-smokers .
Though it ’s sometimes difficult to count out other factors of a smoker 's lifestyle that may be meddling with the mind , such as a lack of physical activity , the evidence against smoking still looks pretty convincing .
Bottom line : Butt out !
And lay off the marijuana too ( if you value your short - term memory , that is ) .
You might be thinking right now : “ But wait , does n't nicotine actually improve memory ? ”
OK , while it 's true that the acute effects of nicotine actually improve certain areas of short - term memory ( albeit only temporarily ) , the long - term effects of smoking over time are what cause mental decline .
Malnutrition
Herpes
Like any finely tuned motor , your brain needs fuel , specifically glucose .
If you 're short on fuel , you 'll be short on brain power .
However , to most , this comes as no surprise ; we 've all felt that dense and foggy feeling when we 're overtired or overly hungry .
Aside from general malnutrition , however , a more serious disorder results in those individuals short on thiamine ( vitamin B1 ) : Korsakoff 's syndrome .
Caused most often by chronic alcoholism or malnutrition , Korsakoff 's syndrome can lead to severe retrogade and anterograde amnesia including confabulation ( a fabulous word that describes a situation where invented memories are regarded as true due to gaps in memory from blackouts ) .
Herpes is just one of several health conditions or disorders ( such as Alzheimer 's disease , stroke or depression ) that can be real memory killers .
While most cases of herpes wo n't make you forget the name of your coworker or where you left your keys , a more serious form of infection known as herpes simplex encephalitis can cause severe memory loss , sometimes as a first warning sign followed by a host of other deadly symptoms .
Herpes encephalitis refers to an inflammation of the brain , and it's one of the most severe infections of the human central nervous system .
Thankfully , this scare is rather rare , arising only if and when the herpes virus finds its way to the human brain through nerves of the face .
There are a few more memory killers you should be aware of ...
" If you thought all those gag - inducing ads for Kath & Kim that NBC ran during the Olympics were awful , wait until you check out the actual show , " he wrote .
" Better yet , do n't bother .
" It is based on a comedy that originated in Australia and it might be just cause to immediately cease trade relations with that country . "
Meanwhile , Rob Owen of the Pittsburgh Post - Gazette calls it a " dumb dud " and " an unpleasant way to spend a half - hour " .
In an earlier interview , the US show 's executive producer Michelle Nader , whose past works include Spin City and King Of Queens , said she had jumped at adapting the Australian version for an American audience .
" We wanted to really sort of get the emotional core of the show more than they did in the Australian version .
The Australian version is very funny , and we 're absolutely going to be hopefully as funny as them , " Nader said .
" But they do eight episodes and we do 22 . "
The American version would " dish out the level of reality in a different way " , she said .
The original ABC series about the Fountain Lakes foxy morons created by Gina Riley and Jane Turner was a hit with Australian audiences , but there were questions about whether its uniquely Australian humour would translate to foreign viewers .
Australians will get the chance to check out the US version when the Seven Network , which now has rights to the show , screens it on Sunday night at 7 pm .

You 've heard about Petty God , you 've contemplated long and hard about Vengeful Angry Pissed - Off God , you 've read in disbelief about that psycho Abraham and his willingness to murder his own son , and you 've more than likely heard something about that Mohammed guy and his child bride .
But what about Pedophile God , have you ever really considered Pedophile God ?
Most historians agree that Mary , that defined - solely - by - her - virginity Mother of God woman , was almost certainly just a 12 or 13 - year old kid when she was impregnated , supposedly by the Big Guy up in the sky .
You say " Yeah , but that was the norm back then " , but , really , think about it , if an Almighty , All - Seeing , All - Knowing Eternal God can go around poking 12 - year - old girls , then , regardless of the cultural setting , it must be an ok thing to do , right ?
Or else , perhaps , God is just a bit of a perv .
I mean , it was socially acceptable for Greek men to take young boys to the baths with them in Plato and Aristotle 's time , right ?
So does that mean that if God were to have taken some little boy to pleasure himself with back in Ancient Greece it would 've been ok ?
But what a silly question .
Because whatever God supposedly did is always justifiable and explainable to those who want to justify and explain such things .
But who the hell knows if this Mary kid was a virgin anyway ?
Just because some guys , intent on showing that their guru was divine and above all others , wrote it down as fact 60 to 70 years after it had supposedly happened , just does n't make it true .
I mean , none of them were even around to witness the deed .
It was all hearsay .
It would never stand up in court .
You do n't think there 's any chance this Mary girl might have been a victim of rape or incest like so many other girls and women throughout human history , do you ?
And , considering that the pathetic nature of patriarchical human society has always been to blame the female victim for any horrors she may have suffered , you do n't think there 's any chance that this young girl , hoping to avoid some barbaric punishment , might have been inclined to claim that she was still a virgin , somehow hoping she might be believed , even if she happened to be pregnant ( they had terrible Sex Ed in the schools back then , you know ) .
Or maybe she was just messing around with Joe and , you know , they forgot to use one of those sheep intestines or whatever ... or maybe it sprung a leak ?
Or , even more likely , she was probably just having a bit of fun with Joe 's buddy Gab , who then got all defensive when Mary 's belly started to swell , and was like " Hey , man , she 's definitely still a virgin , do n't go looking at me .
Maybe like , you know , it was God or something ?
That 's it .
It was God " .
Either way , good thing Joe stepped up to the plate or else Mary would have been stoned to death , along with her unborn baby , as an evil slut .
Having consensual sex , of course , being one of the most vile , disgusting and sickening acts a women could be accused of engaging in back then ... or today , for that matter , in many countries around the world .
Whatever the case , I do n't really think she was a virgin , of course , but lots of people do , so it 's them , not me , who are calling their God a pedophile .
And I do n't think that 's a very nice - or smart - thing to do .
He 's been known to get pissed off and kill babies , flood whole planets and slime people with frogs , when not turning them into salt .
He also enjoys damning people to eternal suffering supposedly .
So , if I were a follower , I sure as hell would n't want to go accusing him of knocking up some young girl .
But if that 's what people really want to do then I can't stop them now , can I ?
And , on a similar note , do n't even get me started about that big prophet guy ( let 's call him The Big M ) who , at age 54 , married a 6 - year - old girl ( though he sensibly waited until she was 9 to consummate the union ) .
Yes , you read that right .
Nine .
Read up on it , if you do n't believe it .
And you should n't .
But , sadly , it 's true .
But , whatever you do , do n't talk about it too much .
Certain pedophile defenders will literally have your head over any condemnation of this or any other behavior by The Big M .
You 've really got to wonder how people are supposed to live a good decent life when they 've got role models like Ab , The Big M and Pedophile God to look up to ?
I mean , it makes Kobe Bryant , Maradona and Mike Tyson seem like outstanding role models in comparison .
Really now , do n't you think God could 've chosen to impregnate an older woman , say a widow ?
But , no , that 'd mean she would n't be a virgin and thus " pure " , would n't it ?
I forgot about that .
Consider this :
The pathetic sex haters who run the Catholic , Eastern and Oriental Orthodox churches , as well as that whole religion of Islam , want everyone to actually believe that Mary was not just a virgin - no no no , that would n't be pure enough - she was , in fact , wait for it , a Perpetual Virgin .
Yes , a Perpetual Virgin .
Or , as they sometimes call her , an " Ever - Virgin " .
That 's right , she was so good and so pure ( i.e. asexual ) , and she so fully embraced her virginity , that she said " Heck , why not ? " and remained a virgin till the day she died .
Even after getting married .
Sounds like a great marriage she had there with Joe .
And to think he stepped up and saved her from a nasty life - ending stoning and all he gets is stonewalled in bed for the next 30 years ?
Does n't sound like a very fair deal to me .
But I could go on and on about the Church celebrating a woman simply for her virginity , never mind their insistence on making both Mary and Jesus out to be completely asexual , but that 'd be a whole other rant .
By the way , did you know that besides never committing a sin , being spectacularly great at the whole virginity thing and being pure and good like only a virgin could , Mary also never burped or farted ?
Yes , it 's true , she was THAT pure !
And , so , as John Lennon , if he were here , would most certainly join me in singing to all those in the Church and elsewhere who are so repulsed by sex that they can only think of a woman as truly pure and good if she happens to be a virgin :
Everybody 's talkin ' ' bout virginity , divinity , original sin and some apple tree
But all we are saaaaying is give sex a chance
Yes all we are saaaaying is give sex a chance
But not with children , for God 's sakes , God , get it together will you ?!

Republic Windows Workers Stand Their Ground
By Kari Lydersen and James Tracy
This is a web - only article from the website of Dollars & Sense : The Magazine of Economic Justice available at http://www.dollarsandsense.org
The 2008 holiday season is one of high hopes and high anxiety .
Barack Obama ’s November victory has raised expectations of meaningful change , while the Department of Labor estimates over a half million jobs lost in November alone .
Workers at Chicago ’s Republic Windows and Doors were n’t waiting for the White House when they learned that they were losing their jobs due to a plant closing .
They occupied their workplace , insisted on receiving their full vacation and sick days pay — and won .
Whether it be the shape of things to come or just a fleeting moment remains to be seen .
Their action forced the mainstream media to show the faces behind the statistics — ones filled with pride and defiance , not pity and powerlessness .
Last fall , workers at Republic noticed that important pieces of equipment had disappeared from their Goose Island warehouse .
Alarmed , they notified their union , United Electrical Radio and Machine Workers of America , Local 1110 ( otherwise known as UE ) , an independent union with a tradition of direct action .
Republic ’s management assured the union that no plant closure was afoot ; and that the equipment would be replaced with modernized pieces .
Not willing to take the company ’s word for it , the union covertly monitored the plant , and watched as trucks removed the very machinery needed to produce windows and doors .
Meanwhile as the foreclosure crisis unfolded , Republic lost most of its contracts for new home construction .
Then on Tuesday , December 2 , employees were told what they feared had been coming for a long - time .
Friday , the plant would be shuttered .
They were to come pick up their checks and file for unemployment .
Company officials blamed the closing on the economic crisis , and on Bank of America , who they said clamped down on their credit despite a federal bailout package of $ 25 billion in taxpayer money .
“ When we arrived to pick up our checks , we were told that we would not be getting paid for our accrued sick days , ” said Melvin Maclin , Local 1110 ’s Vice President and Republic employee of seven years .
Their health insurance was also cut off on Friday , December 5 , despite an earlier promise it would extend until December 15 .
“ At that point we had been told so many lies , we did n’t know what to believe . ”
At look at Republic shows the faces of both organized labor past and present .
A warehouse that produces actual products , instead of simply distributing them , is a rarity in de-industrialized America .
The workers — largely Latino , many black , and a few white — reflect the shifts in Chicago ’s population and the composition of the blue - collar sections of the working - class .
Plant closures are a common part of the Midwest experience .
What makes this saga uncommon is what the workers decided to do about it .
They voted to occupy the factory in order to force the company to pay their accrued vacation time as well as comply with the federal WARN Act of 1988 , which mandates that companies give 60 days notice when plants are closed or mass lay - offs are planned , or pay each employee 60 days severance .
Illinois law had actually extended the required notice time to 75 days .
The workers took turns sitting on the shop floor , rotating roughly in the shifts they would have normally worked .
Members of local labor and community organizations continuously visited , offering words of support and freshly cooked food .
Victor Emeric , a driver with Teamsters Local 705 , delivered several boxes of food and underscored what he felt as the importance of the Republic action .
“ Support is very important ; so is solidarity .
We ’re hoping that the outcome of this is positive for the workers , ” he said .
“ I hope that elected officials do the right thing , I try to remain optimistic , but past experience teaches me to know better than that . ”
The union and company officials had reached an agreement that the workers would not be forcefully removed from the plant as long as they kept it safe and secure and only workers and union staff were allowed on the shop floor .
( Supporters congregated in the small lobby and outside on the sidewalk , even in freezing rain and snow . )
Nonetheless , during the first few days of the sit - in rumors flew via text message and email that police would be ordered to evict workers from the plant .
But officers keeping watch at the site seemed sympathetic to workers , perhaps another sign of how the economic crisis has affected such a wide swath of Americans and created alliances and empathy among those who would n’t have felt it before .
One police officer , dispatched to observe the occupation from across the Republic parking lot , refused to speak on the record about his feelings , or the position of the Chicago Police Department .
But from his patrol car , he then eloquently explained how the economy was destroying the futures of everyday people “ just trying to survive , ” as plants close and pensions plans disappear .
On day four of the occupation , the union began negotiations with company and Bank of America officials , as workers and supporters waited eagerly for word of the outcome .
Monday evening crowds waving picket signs and chanting “ Si se puede ” crowded around a bonfire in a trash can and formed a line to deliver donated food hand to hand into the factory .
Donte Watson , 30 , said he was furious at company officials because he was proud of all the effort he had put into this job for eight years and had assumed he would work there for decades more and then retire .
He was also angry that the company would close with orders still to fill because he did n’t want customers to be let down .
“ People put their blood , sweat , and tears into this company ; it was our company too , not just the owners , ” he said .
“ They knew this was coming and they did n’t say a word to us .
They owed us more respect than that .
We do n’t want anything extra , we just want what we are owed . ”
The negotiations were continued to Tuesday , and then to Wednesday .
Meanwhile during the day on Wednesday JPMorgan Chase bank offered a $ 400,000 line of credit to help pay the workers .
Finally , on late Wednesday evening workers voted to accept a proposal from Bank of America creating $ 1.75 million in credit to pay health benefits for two months , severance and accrued vacation time .
It was a huge victory , a group of 260 - some determined workers and their supporters convincing a major financial institution to reverse its position .
But the bank did n’t agree to the union ’s larger demand , that it finance the company to allow it to remain open .
This was a tough question to tackle from political , legal and ethical standpoints : if a company is failing financially , to what extent if any is a bank — a private institution — required to subsidize them ?
And how does the equation change when that private institution has just received an infusion of $ 25 billion in public money ?
The Republic Windows and Doors situation is complicated by insinuations that the owners were trying to move the plant to Iowa , perhaps to avoid having union workers .
The owner had incorporated a similar business in Iowa , according to a trade journal cited in the New York Times , and that might explain the moving of equipment .
As this went to press , the workers were thrilled with their victory and the results of their direct action .
But they also were n’t satisfied with taking the money — enough to survive for several months — and still having to find new jobs in this cut - throat economy .
Yet they clearly demonstrated that in a shifting economic and political context , collective action can bring real results .
Protests in support of Republic workers at Bank of America branches Philadelphia , San Francisco and Reno resulted in arrests of activists and added to national attention of the occupation .
The tactic of a takeover evoked memories of the Flint Sit-Down Strike of 1936 that established the United Auto Workers ’ presence in the auto industry .
Chicago has a long history of labor militancy and events there have often set the tone and tempo of the labor movement as a whole .
In 1886 , the Haymarket demonstrations , and subsequent massacres and trials of anarchist activists became a hallmark of the battle for the eight - hour day .
Turn of the century strike of clothing workers against Hart , Shaffner and Marx in Chicago led by Sidney Hillman , which later led to the founding of the Amalgamated Clothing Workers .
“ With this economic crisis and unemployment , there are no other jobs , ” said Dagoberto Cervantes , 41 , as his five - year - old son danced around with a picket sign on Monday evening .
This example has boosted the spirits of other workers facing what might be the dawn of the next depression .
Across town , at the Congress Plaza Hotel , workers have been on strike for five years .
Augustina Bahena , a Congress worker remarked , “ Republic workers have given us all a lot of hope , and maybe some new ideas .
The bailout needs to help workers .
A corporation ca n’t receive millions of dollars just to finance layoffs . ”
Back at Republic , the workers are talking about starting a co-op to run the factory , reminiscent by labor movements of the past and the factory take - overs by Argentine workers following the financial meltdown of the late 1990s .
Such a move would be a challenging undertaking , especially in this desperate financial climate .
But the economic crisis has given people the sense they can no longer simply survive by laying low and not making waves .
The status quo is no longer safe .
As the workers realized when faced with the plant ’s closing and denial of their wages , people have no choice but to take matters into their own hands .

NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
State unemployment insurance trust funds are rapidly running out of money amid soaring job losses .
This is prompting state officials to consider raising employer taxes or curtailing benefits , while forcing them to borrow from the federal government to cover claims .
" Some states did n't have adequate reserves built up , " said Andrew Stettner , deputy director of the National Employment Law Project .
" They are having significant problems paying out the increased number of benefits . "
The number of people collecting state unemployment benefits hit a 25 - year high of 3.84 million , on a seasonally adjusted basis , the Labor Department said Thursday .
The following day , the department announced that 240,000 jobs were lost in October , pushing the unemployment rate up to 6.5 % , up from 6.1 % .
It 's the highest rate since March 1994 .
Nearly 1.2 million jobs have been lost this year .
With companies unveiling mass layoffs almost daily , states are likely to see further strains on their trust funds .
This comes at a time when the weakening economy is already putting great stress on governments and employers alike .
The trust funds are financed through unemployment insurance taxes levied on businesses .
States must pay out the claims promised under the law , even if they have to borrow the funds from the feds .
The trust funds of five states are insolvent - meaning they have reserves of three months or less - while another eight state funds are nearly insolvent with reserves of four to six months , according to the National Employment Law Project .
Six other states do n't have enough money to cover a year of payments .
Michigan is hurting
Michigan , hit hard by the collapse of the auto industry , has essentially nothing left in its trust fund , said Norman Isotalo , spokesman for state 's Department of Labor & Economic Growth .
New initial claims are up 21 % over a year ago , while the unemployment rate hit 8.7 % in September , up from 7.3 % a year earlier .
Though it has borrowed money from the feds to cover claims since 2006 , Michigan has avoided paying interest on the loan by repaying it quickly .
The state , however , no longer has the funds to repay the loan , which currently totals nearly $ 473 million .
The debt will starting accruing interest in January , and the state will pass along the additional fees to employers .
Businesses already shell out between .06 % and 10.3 % on the first $ 9,000 of earnings of each worker , depending on how many of their former employees are drawing benefits .
About 20 % of companies soon will start paying up to $ 67.50 in an additional solvency tax , levied on employers who have paid less in unemployment taxes than their former employees have received in benefits .
The state realizes the additional tax will impose yet another burden on struggling companies , but the law does not allow exceptions , said Stephen Geskey , director of Michigan 's Unemployment Insurance Agency .
" It is not an optimal time for the solvency tax to kick in , " Geskey said .
" But there 's really no wiggle room . "
The Michigan fund is being squeezed , in part , because of changes lawmakers made over the past 12 years , Geskey said .
When times were good -- the fund had a $ 3 billion balance in 2001 -- officials lowered the tax rate .
This resulted in a loss of $ 1.1 billion in contributions , he said .
Spurred by the looming interest payments , legislators are only now planning to address the matter .
Discussions should begin soon , said Democratic state Sen. Michael Switalski .
" Now it has our attention , " Switalski said .
" We 're going to have to deal with it . "
Ohio contemplates benefit freeze
In Ohio , claims are running 40 % above last year 's levels .
The state 's trust fund is running an uncomfortably low balance of $ 305.6 million .
Its own calculations show it needs $ 2.3 billion to withstand a moderate recession , said Sara Hall Phillips , labor policy analyst with the state 's Department of Job and Family Services .
Ohio lawmakers failed to act on recommendations by a state advisory council to replenish the fund .
The council had proposed raising taxes paid by employers and freezing workers ' benefits for three years , Hall Phillips said .
Employers in Ohio pay between 0.5 % and 9.2 % on the first $ 9,000 of earnings of each worker .
The maximum weekly benefit is $ 365 for a worker with no dependents .
Even though the fund will likely run out of money by early January , lawmakers likely wo n't address the issue before the middle of next year .
The rising number of claims is not the only reason the fund is running out of money , Hall Phillips said .
The law calls for benefits to increase annually , though there 's no provision for taxes to do the same .
When Ohio faced a similar fiscal crunch in the 1980s , forcing it to borrow from the feds from 1980 through 1988 , it had to temporarily freeze benefits and raise taxes .
" Claimants will still receive unemployment compensation benefits and that will continue no matter what happens with the trust fund or with the legislature , " she said .
But " benefits may be locked at that level for a few years . "
Wall Street woes hit New York
The implosion of Wall Street and the weakened economy around the state has led to a surge of unemployment claims in New York .
The state now pays benefits to 148,000 people , up from 113,000 a year ago , said Leo Rosales , spokesman for the state Department of Labor .
As a result , New York 's trust fund has dwindled to $ 357 million , down from $ 538 million a year ago .
To meet its obligations , the state has been borrowing from the feds for years , receiving nearly $ 1.1 billion over the past three years alone .
In 2006 , the state had to pay $ 7 million in interest of $ 1.5 billion it borrowed in 2005 .
The state legislature tried unsuccessfully in the spring to increase unemployment insurance taxes , while also raising the maximum weekly benefit , which now stands at $ 410 , to $ 550 .
The bill would have increased the wage base to $ 11,500 over time , from its current $ 8,500 .
Tuesday 's election left Democrats in control of both chambers of the state legislature , and the bill now has a better chance of getting passed , said Assembly member Susan John , a Democrat , chair of the labor committee .
" Members are back home in their districts and are recognizing how much people are struggling , " John said .
Wall Street firm Goldman Sachs Group Inc. in September quietly approached Citigroup Inc. about the possibility of merging the two firms ' operations , according to a person familiar with the matter .
The call , placed by Goldman Chief Executive Lloyd Blankfein to counterpart Vikram Pandit at Citigroup , was made not long after Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. filed for bankruptcy protection on Sept. 15 , a move that sent the shares of rival brokers like Goldman and Morgan Stanley down sharply .

Nokia announced today the launch of Qt Extended 4.4 , a complete mobile and embedded development platform based on the open source Qt toolkit .
It is designed with a modular architecture that provides building blocks for assembling a Linux - based software stack for various embedded devices ranging from phones to set - top boxes .
Nokia acquired Norwegian software company Trolltech earlier this year for $ 153 million and is now working to consolidate Trolltech 's technologies in order to simplify the Qt software ecosystem .
The release of Qt Extended 4.4 is part of an effort to rebrand and overhaul Trolltech 's former Qtopia platform .
The Qt Extended platform consists of 19 separate components that span a broad range of functionality , including messaging , multimedia , and productivity .
" Qt Extended is designed to accelerate software development for a wide range of consumer devices , such as video IP phones , media players and other advanced devices , " said Nokia 's Qt software vice president Sebastian Nystrom .
" With the new release of Qt Extended , we are making it easier to differentiate the user experience and the feature set . "
The Qt Extended platform
The underlying telephony stack supports GSM , GPRS and VoIP .
For those capabilities , the platform supplies reference implementations that hardware makers can replace or extend .
These pieces are wrapped with an abstraction layer that gives application developers easy access to the functionality in a consistent way across Qt Extended devices .
The Qt Extended messaging component spans the full range of mobile communication technologies , including SMS , MMS , e-mail , and instant messaging .
It is built on top of Telepathy , a modular communication framework that is also used on Nokia 's Maemo platform and is increasingly being adopted on the Linux desktop .
The platform includes a messaging library that provides application developers with a high - level API for composing messages and manipulating the system 's message data store .
It also exposes Telepathy - based services , including XMPP communication via the Telepathy 's Gabble connection manager .
In addition to including audio and video playback infrastructure , the multimedia framework in Qt Extended also offers a set of common widgets for building multimedia applications .
The top layer of the multimedia stack is the Phonon abstraction library .
Qt Extended supports Helix and GStreamer backends for Phonon , but adopters can also make their own to plug into the stack .
The multimedia stack also supports a DRM implementation that is compatible with the Open Mobile Alliance DRM standard .
The platform 's built - in personal information management ( PIM ) layer is constructed on top of the SQLite database library .
It is fully extensible and can be accessed by multiple applications at the same time .
The toolkit includes synchronization APIs and widgets that can be used to develop new PIM applications .
The platform includes a reference implementation of a very basic PIM suite .
The user interface is , of course , built with the Qt widget toolkit .
The layout and design of the menu system , dialer , and window manager can be customized with XML - based theming descriptions .
It also includes an extensible input method system that supports basic handwriting recognition , standard phone numerical pads ( with predictive text ) , and qwerty keyboards .
Qt Extended comes with a lot of other useful things , including the QWebKit widget for building mobile browsers and rich Internet applications , support for Bluetooth and WiFi , and some important architectural components , like a policy - based security system for sandboxing applications and an interprocess communication layer that leverages
Qt 's signal and slot model .
Running Qt Extended
Nokia is distributing two basic reference platforms built on top of Qt Extended .
One of them is a GSM phone platform that is designed for the OpenMoko handsets , and the other is for a desktop video phone device .
These reference platforms can be used as a starting point for device makers that are building their own Qt Extended hardware products and can also be used by third - party application developers who want to target Qt Extended devices .
There are numerous commercial products that run various flavors of the Qt mobile platform , including the Sony Mylo , the Dash navigation system , and the Netflix Roku streaming video box .
I 've experimented with a previous version of the Qtopia phone reference platform on one of Trolltech 's now - defunct Greenphone devices , but the best way for developers to do application testing and get a real hands - on feel for the platform now is to test it on an OpenMoko phone .
Relative to some other mobile platforms that we have looked at recently , Qt Extended is a strong contender , and it has a lot of nice capabilities .
The biggest strengths are the quality of the development tools and the flexibility of the toolkit .
There are a lot of things in Qt that make it a real asset on mobile devices .
For example , it 's easy to create visually rich touchscreen - friendly Qt widgets using SVG and CSS .
Qt Extended is distributed under the same kind of dual - licensing model as the desktop toolkit .
Qt developer Lorn Potter commented on this in a blog entry this past weekend .
" Qt Software and Nokia are still committed to releasing Qt and Qt Extended under the GPL as open source , and will continue to do so , " he wrote .
" Changes are a part of life and what make it exciting .
The Open Source community has nothing to fear by this name change , or by Nokia buying Trolltech . "
Check out the Qt Extended launch web site for more details about the platform and some demo videos .
( CNN ) --
When her mother and father called her into the den , 9 - year - old Gigi Pasley thought they were going to tell her a big surprise , " a good surprise " she said , one she'd be delighted to hear .
Gigi Pasley , 11 , with her parents , Irvin and Jessica , and brother , Myles , has survived leukemia and bone cancer .
But instead , as her father sat next to her on the couch and her mother knelt down beside her , they told Gigi she had cancer .
Her reaction was not what her parents expected .
She sat quietly , with her head down , for a long time .
" And then she burst out with this awful sound , a moan , a scream of complete and utter agony , " said her mother , Jessica Pasley .
" She was completely distraught , so much so that my husband , who 's a big , tough guy , had to leave the room .
He had to walk away . "
When she finally managed to talk , Gigi said , " I do n't want to die at age 9 . "
The Pasleys learned that day there 's no good way to tell your child she has cancer .
When it comes time to tell a child he or she has cancer , or some other devastating disease , many parents try to skirt the issue .
" They say , ' Well , we 'll tell her it 's just a cold , or it 's just a virus , or we 'll tell her she 'll have surgery and then everything will be fine , ' " said Dr. Lawrence Wolfe , a pediatric hematologist - oncologist at Long Island Jewish Medical Center in New York .
But he said the child always figures it out in the end .
" Truth - telling pays off , even if you 're clumsy about it , " he said .
Other experts agree .
The American Society of Clinical Oncology and the National Cancer Institute , both of which have guidelines for how to talk to children about cancer , stress the importance of honesty .
" You may want to protect your child , but children usually know when something is wrong , " the National Cancer Institute 's Web site says .
Not telling the truth can lead to more problems .
" A child may think he or she has cancer as a punishment for doing something wrong . "
When Gigi 's bone cancer was diagnosed , the Pasleys knew enough to be straight with her .
They 'd had experience with cancer : Gigi and her identical twin sister , Jade , were found to have leukemia shortly after their first birthday .
Jade died a year later .
Gigi beat the disease , only to have a relapse when she was 4 years old .
Again , she recovered -- and the cancer returned for a second time when she was 6 .
Empowered Patient : Watch more on talking to your kids about illness »
Now 11 , Gigi said she appreciates her parents ' honesty that night in the den two years ago when they told her about her bone cancer .
" I was upset and really scared when they told me because this time it was a new cancer , " she said .
" But I was thinking to myself , if I beat leukemia already as many times as I did -- three times -- I can beat this cancer , ' and I did . "
But the Pasleys did n't tell their daughter absolutely everything .
They did n't say that her doctors thought she might have only three months to live , even with aggressive treatment .
" We never talk about timetables , " Jessica Pasley said .
" It does n't make any sense to us . "
Exactly what you say to a child who 's just received a terrible diagnosis depends on the illness , the child 's personality , and on the child 's age .
Here are some basic guidelines by age group .
What to tell children up to age 4
Very young children might think they did something to cause cancer , according to the American Society of Clinical Oncology , and need to be reassured this is n't the case .
But often children this age are n't focused on the illness , Wolfe said .
Rather , they 're focused on their parents and are very sensitive to their behavior .
Since seeing a parent cry might be unavoidable , it needs to be explained to them .
" Tell them Mommy and Daddy may be upset about their illness , but you 're not upset with them , " he advises .
What to tell children from 4 to 7 years old
Do n't Miss 950,000 children worldwide killed by injury , violence
950,000 children worldwide killed by injury , violence As children starve , world struggles for solution
Wolfe said children this age are more aware of their illness , but their biggest fear probably is n't illness or death -- it 's being separated from their parents .
" Explain to them , ' You 're sick and going to have to spend time in the hospital .
Mommy and Daddy will always be there to comfort you .
We 're always there for you . ' "
What to tell children from 8 to 13 years old
The National Cancer Institute suggests explaining cancer to children this age in terms they can understand .
" You might describe the cancer cells as " troublemakers " that get in the way of the work of the good cells , " the Web site suggests .
" Treatment helps to get rid of the troublemakers so that other cells can work well together . "
Wolfe advises also telling children about their illnesses in the context of their own day - to - day life .
" If you just say , ' You 're very sick and will have to be in the hospital for a while , ' that might not speak to the child , because he or she might not understand what ' for a while ' means , " he said .
" If your child 's life , for example , revolves around sports , say , ' You might not be able to do sports as much .
We have to curtail your activities to make you well . '
Do truth telling in language they 'll understand . "
What to tell a teenager
Telling the truth is perhaps most important for adolescents , Wolfe said .
If they ever sense you 're lying , they 'll feel as if their illness is even more out of control than it already is .
" Any attempt to soften the blow -- that 's where the adolescent loses their footing , " Wolfe said .
" In order to have their feet on the ground , they need to know the truth . "
He warns parents against trying to hide their own grief and sadness , because teenagers might mistake your stoicism for not caring .
" If you feel like you have to fall apart , you should fall apart .
If parents want to seem to be in control , what could go through the teen mind is that they do n't seem to care , " he said .
Also , parents should try to prepare themselves for their teenagers ' " heart - wrenching " reactions to news of a cancer diagnosis -- reactions sometimes even more intense than those of a younger child .
Wolfe adds that being honest does n't mean you have to tell your child everything .
For example , he said the Pasleys did the right thing by not telling Gigi doctors thought she might have only three months to live .
" I do n't think that future - predicting truth telling is necessary -- the kind where you 're looking into a crystal ball , " he said .
" If the child is sophisticated to say , ' Am I going to die of this ? ' you can answer that it 's a possibility , but we 're embarking on a plan now to try to keep that from happening . "
Gigi 's lived way beyond those three months .
Nearly two years after her bone cancer diagnosis , doctors can't find evidence of the cancer anywhere in her body .
" It was hard to get through it , but I did , " Gigi said .
" And I 'm proud of myself , " she said .
All About Cancer
In results from an eagerly anticipated study that could dramatically change the treatment of cardiovascular disease , researchers have found that statin drugs -- now given to millions of people with high cholesterol -- can halve the risk of heart attacks and stroke in seemingly healthy patients as well .
The study of nearly 18,000 people with normal cholesterol found that the drugs , already among the most widely prescribed in the country , also lowered the risk of death from heart disease by 20 % , suggesting that millions more people should be put on a daily regimen .
The effects were so beneficial that the planned four - year study was halted after less than two years , researchers said Sunday at a New Orleans meeting of the American Heart Assn .
“ These are very , very dramatic findings , ” said Dr. Elizabeth G. Nabel , director of the National Heart , Lung and Blood Institute .

Nabel , who was not involved in the research , noted that the institute already had an expert panel revising guidelines for treatment and prevention of heart disease and that the new results were likely to be included in its recommendations .
The revision would most likely call for testing a wide range of healthy people with a simple blood test for above - normal levels of a compound called C- reactive protein , which indicates increased arterial inflammation that can be treated with statins .
The new study focused on a specific drug -- rosuvastatin , sold as Crestor by drug maker AstraZeneca , which funded the research .
But Dr. Tim Gardner of the Christiana Care Health System in Wilmington , Del. , and president of the American Heart Assn. , said , “ This is likely to be a class effect , not a specific drug effect .
This is a win for all statins , I would say . ”

The new treatment could prevent 50,000 heart attacks , strokes and deaths each year if it were widely adopted , experts said .
The findings “ really change what we are going to do in the future , ” said Dr. W. Douglas Weaver of Henry Ford Hospital in Detroit and president of the American College of Cardiology .
“ This targets a patient group that normally would not be screened or treated to prevent cardiovascular disease . ”
Critics , however , charged that such wide use would cost the U.S. healthcare system more than $ 9 billion a year at a time when healthcare costs are climbing dramatically and could expose large numbers of people to potential side effects .
Crestor is one of the most expensive statins , costing about $ 3.45 a day , but generic statins typically sell for less than $ 1 .

About 120 people would have to take the drugs for two years to prevent one heart attack , stroke or death , Dr. Mark Hlatky of Stanford University wrote in an editorial accompanying the report , which was published online Sunday by the New England Journal of Medicine .
Nonetheless , the findings will most likely be widely adopted soon , Gardner said .
“ It will be incorporated into practice guidelines after all the nuances are sorted out , ” he said .
Statins , first introduced in 1987 , block the production of cholesterol in the liver .
High cholesterol is a major risk factor for heart attacks and stroke because it contributes to the buildup of plaque that blocks arteries , preventing oxygenated blood from reaching the heart and brain .
Advertisement
An estimated 450,000 Americans die of heart disease each year and an additional 150,000 from strokes .
More than 13 million Americans take statins regularly , and worldwide sales total more than $ 22 billion a year , the bulk of that in the United States .
But doctors have long been mystified by the fact that about half of heart attacks occur in patients with normal cholesterol levels , and researchers have been looking for other important risk factors .
Three years ago , Dr. Paul Ridker of Brigham and Women ’s Hospital in Boston and his colleagues studied results from clinical trials in which statins had been used to treat high cholesterol levels and concluded that , in addition to their cholesterol - lowering ability , the drugs also reduced arterial inflammation , which can lead to the buildup of plaque .

The finding was part of a series of studies that showed statins have a number of beneficial effects beyond their ability to reduce cholesterol .
Several reports have shown that they also help prevent glaucoma and cataracts and inhibit dementia .
Others suggest that they also moderate the symptoms of multiple sclerosis and increase bone density .
These benefits may be related to their ability to reduce inflammation .
C-reactive protein , or CRP , has long been associated with inflammation .
Very high levels of CRP are associated with arthritis and other autoimmune diseases .
But slightly elevated levels -- about a hundredth of the levels seen in arthritis -- have been linked to inflammation in the arteries that causes cardiovascular diseases .
In the new trial , called Jupiter , Ridker and his colleagues studied 17,802 patients with normal cholesterol levels and elevated CRP , as measured by a test called high - sensitivity CRP , on which Ridker and his hospital hold the patent .
Advertisement
Men in the study were over 50 ; women were over 60 .
About 7,000 of the patients were women and 5,000 were minorities -- both groups that have not received much attention in previous statin trials .
Half of the patients received 20 milligrams of rosuvastatin and half a placebo .
“ We specifically chose rosuvastatin because it is the most potent of the statins , ” said Ridker , who has worked as a consultant to AstraZeneca and other pharmaceutical companies .
“ We got very large effects on both [ cholesterol ] and CRP . ”
Low - density lipoproteins , the so - called bad cholesterol , were reduced by 50 % , and CRP was reduced by 37 % .
Advertisement
Patients receiving rosuvastatin had a 54 % lower risk of heart attacks , a 48 % lower risk of stroke and a 46 % lower risk of requiring either angioplasty or bypass surgery , Ridker said .
There were 136 heart - related problems a year for every 10,000 people taking the placebo , compared with 77 for those taking rosuvastatin .
“ This is very good news for these populations , ” Ridker said .
The primary side effect was a slight increase in newly diagnosed diabetes among those taking the drug , an increase that has also been noted in previous trials of statins .
Advertisement
Experts believe that the benefits of a regimen of statins for the targeted patient group outweigh any increase in side effects .
“ This will become an important part of the armamentarium of the primary care doctor , ” Weaver said .
“ I see this as being part of that panel of preventions that they will be applying in men over 50 and women over 60 . ”
The CRP test costs about $ 80 .
Dr. James Stein and Dr. Jon Keevil of the University of Wisconsin , Madison , estimate that about 4 % of the adult U.S. population , about 7.4 million people , fit the criteria to receive the test .

Houston anti-kidnapping expert kidnapped in Mexico
MEXICO CITY —
An American renowned as an anti-kidnap expert has himself been abducted in northern Mexico after several days of seminars in which he was teaching police and citizens how to deal with kidnappings .
Felix Batista , 55 , is a senior consultant with ASI Global , a Houston - based firm that assists clients with security issues , including both preventing and resolving kidnappings .
He was taken Wednesday evening outside a restaurant in the industrial city of Saltillo in the state of Coahuila , which borders Texas .
A former U.S. Army intelligence officer , Batista has worked for nearly two decades as a security consultant in Latin America from his base in Miami .
He has become a frequent source for journalists writing about security issues in the region and has often lectured industry and citizens groups in the United States and Mexico .
Charlie LeBlanc , ASI Global 's president , told the Houston Chronicle that Batista was " not there on ASI business . "
Local press in Saltillo reported that Batista had given security seminars to local police and citizens groups last week .
Batista , in a bio for a recent conference , said he had successfully negotiated the release of nearly 100 kidnap victims , including with Colombian leftist guerillas and some of Mexico 's more notorious kidnapping gangs .
LeBlanc declined to comment whether the company or anyone else had received ransom demands from the kidnappers .
The U.S. Embassy in Mexico City also declined to comment on the case .
Although often overshadowed by narcotics - related violence , kidnapping has become a scourge in Mexico .
Kidnappings have hit upper and middle - class civilians hard .
Even poor families have been targeted .
Hundreds of new cases are reported each year , with still more going unreported for fear of endangering the victims .
Just last summer , the 14 - year - old son of one of the Mexican capital 's wealthiest merchant families was kidnapped and slain .
And police last week identified the remains of the 19 - year - old daughter of Mexico 's former top sports official Nelson Vargas .
She had been kidnapped on her way to school in Mexico City 15 months ago .

For decades of Christmases , it had been a gratifying way to function as a substitute Santa Claus .
Every holiday season , thousands of New Yorkers trooped to Manhattan ’s main post office and sifted through heaps of dream - encased letters that children had scribbled to the big guy at the North Pole .
They picked out the ones that tickled the heart and responded with gifts for otherwise empty stockings .
Then came Thursday .
Gift - giving souls who reported to Operation Santa Claus at the post office on Eighth Avenue and 33rd Street , looking for the familiar cardboard boxes bursting with letters , were instead greeted with no boxes , no letters and no explanation .
The United States Postal Service abruptly shut down public participation in all the Operation Santa programs  in New York and other major cities across the country  at 1 p.m.
Wednesday , without offering post offices or letter - seeking citizens any understanding of why .
A Postal Service official in Washington , after an initial , limited acknowledgment of a “ privacy breach , ” said that at one of the programs , not New York ’s , a man whom a letter carrier recognized as a registered sex offender had “ adopted ” a letter .
When postal officials confronted the man , the official said , he said he was sincerely trying to do a good deed , but postal inspectors nonetheless retrieved the letter and notified the family of the child .

He had won one of the truly plum prizes of overachievement at Harvard : he had been voted president of the law review , the first African - American ever so honored .
Though his politics were conventionally ( if not stridently ) liberal , even the conservatives voted for him .
Obama was a good listener , attentive and empathetic , and his powerful mind could turn disjointed screeds into reasoned consensus , but his appeal lay in something deeper .
He was a black man who had moved beyond racial politics and narrowly defined interest groups .
He seemed indifferent to , if not scornful of , the politics of identity and grievance .
He showed no sense of entitlement or resentment .
Obama had a way of transcending ambition , though he himself was ambitious as hell .
In the grasping race for status and achievement — a competition that can seem like blood lust at a place like Harvard — Obama could make hypersuccessful meritocrats pause and remember a time ( part mythical perhaps , but still beckoning ) when service to others was more important than serving oneself .
Gregory Craig , a lawyer in Washington , D.C. , was one of those Americans who wanted to believe again .
Craig was not exactly an ordinary citizen — he had served and worked with the powerful all his life , as an aide to Sen .
Edward Kennedy in the 1980s , as chief of policy planning at the State Department in the Clinton administration and as a lawyer hired to represent President Clinton at his impeachment trial in the U.S. Senate in 1999 .
He had seen the imperfections of the mighty , up close and personal , and by and large accepted human frailty .
But , like a lot of Americans , he was tired of partisan bickering and yearned for someone who could rise above politics as usual .
A 63 - year - old baby boomer , Craig wanted to recapture the youthful idealism that he had experienced as a student at Harvard in the 1960s and later at Yale Law School , where his friends included Bill Clinton and Hillary Rodham .
In the late fall of 2003 , he was invited to hear a young state senator from Illinois who was running for the U.S. Senate .
Craig was immediately taken with Barack Obama .
" He spoke 20 to 30 minutes , and I found him to be funny , smart and very knowledgeable for a state senator , " Craig recalled .
Craig was so visibly impressed that his host that evening , the longtime Washington mover and shaker Vernon Jordan , teased him , saying , " Greg has just fallen in love . " continue
Barack and Illinois Veterans Affairs Director , Tammy Duckworth on Veteran's DayLondon 's Evening Standard••Ok , I am back on line , somewhat .
There are many of us out there who have been on the O - Train since 2007 , and many more since 2006 .
I have been posting " This Week With Barack Obama " since July , 2007 .
Hey , that is aSo , I think it is JUST DUE that I took some time off to savior a very sweet win .
Many of us have been hopping around from different states since the Iowa Caucuses , working the peeps , and getting our peeps out to the polls , caucuses , performing the campaign 's what knots .
Many of us have been orchestrating , participating in voter 's registration drives since 2007 .
And it wasthat made the difference in the primaries and November 4th .
So , if I am a bit lazy , lackadaisical , sipping my ' tini's while pouring through my Obama memory lane , be patient with me .
It is not every day that a masterful , sincere , real politician is elected through the most adversarial odds and comes out the winner .
All of us need to follow the lead of the Obamas and just chill , savor and be jubilant .
In the end , this moment is temporary because Barack 's got a lot of shit on his plate and the rubes are lining up to jockey their position , to get a piece of the pie , just want a meet .
And us ?
We are watching because we expect big , bold things from the Obama Administration , this country needs just that right now .
Barack , ' ya heard ????
Hope so.••••Cross-posted @ Daily Kos ••
Being sick is one of the most vulnerable human experiences .
The last thing someone needs is to be met at 3 am — pained and panicked — by an unending automated robot message on the other end of the phone .
While automated messages are efficient in today ’s world , healthcare is not the place for them .
What ’s needed is a doctor ’s answering service , where patients are met with immediate human contact in their most critical moments .
If you strive for a patient - first practice , a medical answering service is sure to spike your success .
Keep reading to find out why .
Why Do You Need a Doctor ’s Answering Service ?
It ’s no surprise to anyone that healthcare providers are constantly fighting burnout .
Even when they ’ve clocked out , their phones haunt them at all hours .
Physician answering services are an easy way to take a load off .
There are many reasons why you , your practice and your patient would benefit from an after - hours doctor .
Let ’s break this down .
Happy and Healthy Patients
Certainly , the patient does n’t want to be calling in the middle of the night .
They ’ve stalled hours already , trying to convince themselves their condition can wait ; but it can’t .
The main office call line is only open from 8 am - 5 pm and sickness does n’t operate within normal hours .
So they leave a distressing message and you wake up to an unhappy , unhealthy patient .
An emergency call should be directed to an emergency call line , which is exactly what a medical answering service is .
Patients can feel better about calling any time , knowing they wo n’t be met with automation or long hold times .
Immediate help is exactly the definition of continued care — to be cared for beyond normal business hours .
Answering services are the bridge between the patient and the provider .
With less patient stress and increased care , physician answering services better the entire healthcare experience .
Happy and Healthy Business
From an operations standpoint , a doctor ’s answering service offsets patient stress as well as staffing costs .
An after - hours doctor simply lightens the load for those on - hours .
With a HIPAA compliant system , keeping privacy - protected records gives immediate relief to the patient and immediate information to the staff .
Better customer care means increased customer satisfaction .
Not only does this help business , but it keeps everyone healthy — staff included .
A doctor ’s answering service is the definition of working smarter , not harder while serving everyone along the way .
Happy and Healthy Staff
What a world it would be for doctors to have a clear beginning and end to their day .
While sickness never sleeps , a doctor ’s answering service would ensure that the doctor does .
All practices should learn more about how medical answering services could help you .
Sickness thrives in stress .
For your sake and that of your patients , let a doctor ’s answering service serve you , for a change .
Crisis Averted
Staying healthy is a round - the - clock position , whether or not you ’re a healthcare provider .
Tending to yourself — let alone others — is a full - time job .
Life ’s hard enough , so make your job easier with a doctor ’s answering service .
Having human contact during a crisis creates optimal healing .
While we ca n’t control getting sick , a medical answering service is the best response .
It truly is a service to all parties involved .

The netbook and MID ( mobile internet device ) markets are all the rage these days , and Intel is betting big on these markets with its
Atom processor line .
However , Intel does n’t stop there – the company is even buying wireless networks .
According to Intel ’s CEO Paul Otellini , it ’s all part of bringing the Internet to new places and people .
Otellini told the Associated Press that he is n’t afraid that these small netbooks are going to cannibalise sales of bigger , more powerful notebooks .
“ If a higher - priced notebook is n’t substantially better and does n’t offer more utility , shame on us , ” he said , “ If there ’s cannibalization , I ’d rather be the cannibal than someone else . ”
Intel is also investing a lot of money in rolling out WiMax networks in the US and Japan .
“ You wo n’t see Intel per se becoming a network operator .
That ’s not our competency , ” Otellini explained , “ But as a means to enable hundreds of millions of high - performance mobile devices that access the Internet – both notebooks and smart phones – I think it ’s a good investment for us . ”
In the process , Intel is also looking beyond its regular software partner Microsoft , opting to support Linux on these small devices , due to it being a cheaper and less resource - hungry alternative to Windows Vista .
In addition , it will be around for a while , which Windows XP wo n’t be .
“ Vista has a larger memory footprint , a larger graphics requirement and a higher price point .
This is all about low - cost computing , ” Otellini said , “ I see much of the activity in Mobile Internet Devices , sort of the evolution of the handset , being centered around Linux . ”
From my own subjective experience , I can say that the netbook and MID markets – but the netbook market in particular – is roughly in the same position that the Macintosh was in about 3 - 4 years ago ( at least , here in The Netherlands ) .
Back then , I was one of only a very few Macintosh owners at my university , and the iBook was a head turner .
People wanted to look at it , touch it , play with it , for the simple reason that it was different from what they were used to ( and usually prettier , too ) .
These days , Macs are abound , and nobody blinks twice at seeing a MacBook .
However , as soon as I take out my small netbook , heads turn , people want to play with it , touch it .
It ’s the iBook all over again .
They ’re different .
I would n’t be surprised if in a few years from now , the netbook market will be about the same size as the portable Mac market is now .
Britney Spears & Justin Timberlake Perform Live in L.A. ( VIDEO , PHOTOS )
Fans did n't have to wait long to seeat 's Sticky & Sweet tour performance at Dodger Stadium on Thursday night .
The crowd went wild as the pop star opened the show .
She and the Material Girl did a version of Human Nature .
Wearing black pants and a white top , Spears wowed the crowd , albeit with a tamer performance than when the pair sang together on MTV Video Music Award and provided fans with a titillating girl kiss .
The crowd got another great treat as Justin Timberlake , who used to date Britney , performed 4 Minutes with Madge .
There was some concern that the show might have to be canceled because of problems with the stage .
Madonna told reporters earlier in the day , " Even though my stage roof was damaged and some lights and effects are n't working , I want to do the show anyway because I do n't want to disappoint my fans . "

Claire Jones was given a suspended jail sentence for concealing the birth A mother told an inquest she did not know she had given birth until flushing her baby down a toilet by accident .
Claire Jones , 32 , became pregnant after an affair with a work colleague but hid her condition from friends and family .
After " panicking " in the toilet at her partner 's parents ' home in Penarth , Vale of Glamorgan , she hid the baby in her car boot , where police found it .
Recording a narrative verdict , Cardiff Coroner Mary Hassell said Ms Jones had built up a " web of deception " .
The hearing was told Ms Jones , of Pontnewydd , Cwmbran , did not reveal her pregnancy , telling friends and family , including David Stoneman , her partner of 11 years , that a wheat allergy had caused a hard mass to form in her stomach .
I wish I had done something more , but I just panicked - I miss him every day
Claire Jones
But on 28 December last year , a week after her due date , she experienced pains which she put down to diarrhoea .
She told the inquest : " While I was still on the toilet , I flushed it , and I felt something pull .
I stood up slightly , and I could see a foot in the bowl of the toilet . "
Cardiff Coroner Mary Hassell asked Ms Jones if she realised she had given birth .
Ms Jones replied : " No " .
She said the baby was underneath the water covered in toilet paper .
Ms Jones broke down as she said : " I could see the baby 's foot , so I pulled the baby out .
' Towel ' " I sat by the toilet .
I put him on my lap .
He was n't crying .
I was trying to feel for a pulse and there was nothing . "
Ms Jones was asked why she did not call for help .
She said : " Because nobody knew I was pregnant .
Because he was n't breathing , I just panicked .
I did n't know what to do . "
She said she tried to revive him by blowing into his mouth and massaging his heart .
She said : " I just kept trying and trying , and it was n't working .
There was nothing I could do .
He was blue .
David Stoneman , who was Claire Jones ' partner , and Marcus Bezerra ( right ) her work colleague " I wrapped him in a towel .
I do n't remember how , but I must have put him in the boot of the car . "
The inquest heard Ms Jones was arrested 10 days later at the home in St Mellons , Cardiff , she shared with Mr Stoneman , and Daniel 's body was found in her Vauxhall Astra car .
A post -mortem examination found Daniel weighed seven - and - a- half pounds ( 3.4kg ) , but could not confirm if he died before or after birth .
Pathologist Andrew Davison said Daniel was likely to have drowned if he had survived the birth .
Ms Jones said she " blocked out " what happened , and did not remember Daniel was in her car until police arrested her .
Following a trial at Cardiff Crown Court in August , she was given a 48 weeks ' suspended jail sentence for concealing the baby 's birth .
She told the inquest : " I wish I had done something more , but I just panicked .
I miss him every day . "
' Mess '
She said she planned to leave Mr Stoneman , and her work colleague Marcus Bezerra , who was aware of the pregnancy , bought items for the baby in preparation for his birth .
When asked why she did not leave Mr Stoneman before the baby was due , she replied : " Things had got in such a mess with the two relationships .
I did n't want to hurt anybody .
I just messed everything up . "
Ms Hassell said Ms Jones had manufactured " a tissue of lies " and dismissed as " beyond belief " Ms Jones ' claim about not knowing if she had given birth .
She said : " It is impossible to know if Daniel would have survived if Ms Jones , who had her mobile telephone with her in the toilet , had called for help .
' Drowning '
" The house was full of people who , I have no doubt , would have rushed to her aid .
She did not seek medical attention for herself or for her baby . "
Ms Hassell said she was " sad " to see the distress suffered by so many people as a result of Daniel 's death .
She said : " If Daniel was stillborn , it is not possible to say why he did not survive .
" If he was born alive , the most likely reason for his death was drowning in the toilet bowl . "

We know Confederate Motor Company can design sweet motorcycles because its first bike , the Wraith , is all kinds of awesome .
But we 've gotta wonder what the company 's designer was smoking when he penned the new Renaissance Fighter and whether he 'll share it with the people Neiman Marcus thinks will drop $ 110,000 to buy one .
The Renaissance takes the board - track racer aesthetic of the too - cool - for - words B91 Wraith and projects it well into the next century .
The result is a bike that , although technically impressive , is as ugly as it is overpriced .
That is n't keeping Neiman Marcus from offering the Renaissance in its Christmas Big Book , that annual repository of all things garish , gaudy and gauche .
What 's sad is the Renaissance offers some amazing specs , including a 1,966 cc engine in an aluminum and titanium frame , a close - ratio 5 - speed billet aluminum transmission and a four - piston front brake clamping down on a ceramic rotor .
And , of course it 's got that funky , but very effective , girder fork that Confederate is known for , and incorporating the LED headlights into the fork legs was a nice touch .
The whole package weighs a very reasonable 430 pounds .
But there 's no two ways about it — the bike is ugly as sin .
Wes Siller Siler at Hell For Leather offers a succinct rundown of the bike 's many transgressions and calls it , among other things , " uncohesive and , in places , tacky . "
We 'd add pretentious after reading the description Confederate offers on its website :
" The Fighter clarifies opaqueness and nullifies hype with straight - forward true to concept certitude .
At the source is a classic right triangle .
Proportion is classically derived .
Scale is middle way .
Bearing exudes structural permanence .
Human integration deploys yang energy , vitality and power in the most simple , pure and direct form . "
We 're still laughing .
Confederate makes some mighty big performance claims , including a top speed of 190 mph .
That seems unlikely , given that a Wraith using the same engine hit 166.459 mph at the Bonneville Salt Flats last month , setting a new record for an unfaired pushrod 2,000 cc motorcycle .
Of course , maximum velocity is n't the point with a bike like the Renaissance , and neither is handling — with a 64 - inch wheelbase , 19 - inch front wheel and that gumball of a back tire , it 's only good for straight - line cruising .
Confederate is building just 45 Renaissance Fighters , and every one of them will be available only through Neiman Marcus .
According to Confederate 's website , three already are spoken for , further proving wealth can not buy taste .

The Sony PRS700 : the Newest Member of the Sony Reader Family Sony PRS700  Meet The PRS505s  Little Brother
Yes , this is what all the " Yes , thiswhat all the " October 2nd " fuss has been about !
First Things First : What : Sony PRS700 -- a higher - end model with some fancier features and a sleek new look .
When :  End of October / beginning of November . 
Where : SonyStyle.com , more than 40 SonyStyle stores nationwide and at authorized retailers across the country . 
How Much : $ 400 .
What about the 505 ?
Sony is saying they re not replacing the 505 , but rather adding a higher - end model to the PRS line .
Buyers can go with the 505 , or shell out the extra cash if the 700's extras are worth it to them .
The 700's specs ( what we have of them so far ) are pretty close to what the 505s specs are : same display size , same overall dimensions , same format supports .
The differences are mainly in fancier touches .
For example : touch screen control .
The 700 has dispensed with the 0 through 9 buttons in favor of a direct touch screen selection of menu options .
It also has text highlighting and annotation , via an on - screen virtual keyboard .
That keyboard is also used to support searching within text -- no word yet on whether it will search across texts or not .
Pages can be turned with a finger swipe on the screen -- and the swipe direction is configurable !
The 700 will include a stylus for those who have larger fingers , or just hate having fingerprints on the screen .
For the old - school types , it still has hardware page change buttons .
Some other nice incidentals include a reportedly much snappier page change speed , bigger page block jumping ( i.e. 20 or 30 pages as well as the 10 pages -- the " go to page " feature is still intact , again via the virtual keyboard ) , but in my view the biggest new feature after the touch screen is easily the built in frontlight .
Let me say that again : Built .
In . Frontlight .
Answering the question of how exactly that will play out with the touch screen will have to wait until we get first - hand looks at the device itself , but the picture we have of it already is enough to start me slavering .
Other new features include five font sizes and what seems to be a totally new zoom feature .
There s still no wireless ( they say they re looking at it for future devices ) , the battery still is n't user replaceable , and there 's no true digital ink capability , it 's all handled through virtual keyboard / menu interaction .
Sony expects a firmware update at some point in the future to allow exporting text annotations from the device , which could be handy for students .
The other noticeable lack is geographic : it 's U.S. only for now .
The explanation for that had to do with the markedly insular nature of the various Sony divisions ( i.e. Sony USA compared to Sony Europe ) , but I really think they should have worked that out , perhaps they will do so quickly .
But wait !
That 's not all !
Along with this launch , Sony will be launching a new version of their
Even as I post this , our pinch - hitter reporter is attending the " Event " and will have first - hand impressions to share with us as soon as he can , so stay tuned !
The
Okay , folks , no shoving now .
The line forms right here ( yes , yes , that 's right : right there behind me ) -- so who 's ready to queue up ?

Along with this launch , Sony will be launching a new version of their eBook Store .
It is supposed to have easier searching and navigation , as well as a " streamlined checkout process . "
Personally , I 'm most hoping they get rid of the frames within frames thing , and make it easier to find things like the wishlist and books already bought .
Making purchased books easier to download in bulk would be a nice touch too .
Even as I post this , our pinch - hitter reporter is attending the " Event " and will have first - hand impressions to share with us as soon as he can , so stay tuned !
The press release is here , and the SonyStyle Reader Page should have full specs shortly .
Okay , folks , no shoving now .
The line forms right here ( yes , yes , that 's right : right there behind me ) -- so who 's ready to queue up ?

Record numbers of voters across the nation are casting ballots before election day , including high proportions of Democrats and African Americans in some of the battleground states in what appears to be a promising sign for Barack Obama .
In the 32 states that allow people to vote before Nov. 4 without a special excuse , election officials report heavy turnout as the presidential campaign reaches its frenzied last days .
That ’s not surprising in a campaign that has received round - the - clock attention .
But it also reflects the intensive efforts of campaigns competing to bank votes before election day .
In North Carolina , which has n’t gone for a Democrat for president since Jimmy Carter in 1976 , almost a million people have voted , and Democrats outnumber Republicans by 2 to 1 .
“ We ’re going to bust every record we ’ve ever had , ” Gary Bartlett , executive director of the State Board of Elections , said of the state ’s early - voting participation .

A surprise is the makeup of the early voters , election experts said .
In past campaign seasons , Republicans have used early voting to their advantage , mobilizing a slice of the electorate that typically skews their way .
Yet a look at voters in a handful of crucial states suggests that Obama is turning out his base in numbers that surpass those of Republican John McCain .
“ Historically , we ’ve seen that early voters are older , they tend to be white , have higher incomes and are better educated , ” said Paul Gronke , director of the Early Voting Information Center at Reed College in Portland , Ore .
“ And that group of people tends to trend Republican .
Now we have a mirror image in this campaign . ”

Lloyd and Sandra Clemons , a retired couple who voted early Friday near Pittsboro in Chatham County , N.C. , said they chose Obama , whom they described as an inspirational figure .
Sandra Clemons , a former municipal worker , said she was initially a Hillary Rodham Clinton supporter because she figured Obama ’s candidacy would fade .
“ I was afraid he would n’t make it and I ’d be disappointed .
Now I think it ’s a major historic event -- just unbelievable , and very exciting , ” she said .
Early voting continues in many states , so the numbers can change .
But Obama seems well - positioned in several Republican - leaning states that have the potential to broaden his path to the magic number of 270 electoral votes .

In North Carolina , early voting shows Obama ’s party in the lead .
Of the 930,516 people who have voted early , 56 % are Democrats and 27 % Republican .
Blacks account for 21 % of North Carolina ’s registered voters but make up 28 % of those who ’ve voted early .
In Georgia , which has n’t chosen a Democratic presidential candidate since Bill Clinton in 1992 , African Americans are voting in disproportionately high numbers .
Of the 967,210 people who ’ve voted early , 35 % are black , state data show .
By contrast , blacks constituted only about 25 % of the total that voted for president in 2004 .
Iowa voted for President Bush in 2004 , but the Obama campaign hopes to win the state .
Early voting figures bode well for that .
About 51 % of the 277,909 Iowans who ’ve voted early are Democrats , compared with 28 % Republicans .
Stewart Iverson , chairman of the Iowa Republican Party , said he was n’t unnerved by the trend .
He views the state as a tossup , and says McCain has a “ decent shot at winning . ”

“ We ’ve been through this in several election cycles , ” he said .
“ On election day , what we ’ve found is normally a greater percentage of registered Republicans vote than Democrats . ”
Florida , a huge prize with 27 electoral votes , offers a mixed picture .
More than 1.5 million Floridians have already cast ballots .
Democrats hold a tiny advantage : 42.7 % to 42.6 % .
Republicans now hold a 16 - point edge in absentee balloting , whereas Democrats have a 23 - point lead among people showing up at the voting booths .
A Florida GOP official voiced worry that the gap would grow .
“ We know Florida is a battleground state , and we ’ll just have to work that much harder to deliver these 27 electoral votes to John McCain -- and that will take every ounce of the grass - roots machine we ’ve built up , ” said the official , who asked for anonymity to speak more freely .

Early voting is becoming more commonplace as states eager to relieve election day congestion offer new options to cast ballots in advance .
Experts estimate that upward of 30 % of all votes may be cast early this year .
In comparison , 14 % of the electorate voted early in the 2000 election .
A Gallup poll released Friday found that , of the people who ’ve voted early nationwide , roughly half have supported McCain , the other half Obama .
Republicans may have been hoping for more of an edge .
In Bush ’s two successful campaigns for president , he won the early vote both times , according to experts on preelection - day voting .
It ’s not clear the pattern will hold .

Examining the “ demographic profile of early voters in North Carolina , Georgia and Florida , we ’re seeing a larger percentage of Democrats than one might expect , ” said George Mason University ’s Michael McDonald , who specializes in voter turnout .
“ We ’re seeing a larger share of African Americans than we would expect .
These points taken as a whole do tell us indeed that the people who ’ve voted so far are more likely to be Obama supporters than McCain supporters . ”
In New Mexico -- another state that voted for Bush in 2004 -- Democrats account for 69 % of the 55,743 people who ’ve voted early ; Republicans , 31 % .
Those figures do not include absentee ballots , which state officials said were not available .
Nevada ’s two largest counties , Clark and Washoe , favor the Democrats in early voting .
Nearly 172,000 people have voted , and the turnout has been 56 % Democratic and 28 % Republican .
In a conference call Friday , Obama campaign aides said they were encouraged .

David Plouffe , Obama ’s campaign manager , said : “ We like what we ’re seeing in terms of the early vote . ”
He added : “ We might head into the election with some margin already in the bank , which is unusual for a Democrat . ”
Still , Republicans said they were confident .
Election day turnout is how elections are decided , they said .
“ We ’re not surprised by the strong showing by Democrats .
We expected them to do well , ” said Brent Woodcox , spokesman for the North Carolina Republican Party .
“ The Obama campaign is spending a vast amount of resources to turn out every vote they can . ”

Times staff writers Doug Smith in Los Angeles and David Zucchino outside Pittsboro , N.C. , contributed to this report .
The Daily Mail accepted the claims it printed were wholly untrue Italian footballer Marco Materazzi has won damages from the Daily Mail over claims he racially abused Zinedine Zidane in the 2006 World Cup final .
The amount was not disclosed , but the paper accepted it was wrong to report Materazzi had called Zidane " the son of a terrorist whore " .
French star Zidane was sent off after head - butting the Italian 's chest .
Jonathan Price , lawyer for the Daily Mail 's owners , said the paper offered its apologies for the distress caused .
Materazzi , who currently plays for Inter Milan , was not at London 's High Court for the settlement of his libel case against Associated Newspapers .
His counsel , Jane Phillips , told Mr Justice Eady that , in July 2006 , in its coverage of the World Cup Final , the newspaper published a series of items accompanied by photos , including one of Materazzi being head - butted by Zidane , captioned " Revealed : the insult that made Zidane see red " .
She added that the articles stated quite wrongly that Materazzi , who scored one of the crucial penalties which secured an Italian victory , had used vile racist abuse during the match .
' Wholly untrue ' From July to December that year , it also published articles on its website which included similar defamatory material .
Ms Phillips said the newspaper accepted all of the allegations were wholly untrue and that there was no question of Materazzi having said anything of a racist nature to Zidane such as to goad him .
Mr Price , for Associated Newspapers , said that it offered its apologies for the distress and embarrassment caused , and had agreed to pay Materazzi substantial - but undisclosed - damages and his costs .
The Italian also won damages and an apology from the Daily Star earlier in the year .
' Insulted his sister '
Following the head - butting incident , in July 2006 , Materazzi was handed a two - match ban by world governing body Fifa .
France 's captain Zidane , playing his last match before retiring from football , was banned for three games and fined £ 3,260 .
At the time he claimed he was provoked after Materazzi had " insulted his mother " .
But he has never specified exactly what Materazzi said to him and has refused to apologise to his opponent .
Materazzi later stated that Zidane 's sister was the subject .
" I was tugging his shirt , he said to me ' if you want my shirt so much I 'll give it to you afterwards , ' and I answered that I 'd prefer his sister , " he said .

BBC News , Tehran
Many Iranians long for reconciliation with the United States
It has taken nearly two days to emerge , but the message of congratulations from Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad to US President - elect Barack Obama is almost certainly unprecedented since the Islamic Revolution .
Iran and the United States are more used to trading insults - the " Axis of Evil " versus the " Great Satan " .
So this message seems to open intriguing possibilities in US - Iranian relations .
You might have not guessed it from his rhetoric , but it is widely believed in Tehran that President Ahmadinejad is keen for some sort of reconciliation with the US .
This poses a big dilemma for Mr Obama 's new foreign policy team .
New beginning ?
During the presidential election campaign , Mr Obama offered to talk with Iran without preconditions .
But any improvement in US - Iranian relations could hand a big prize to Mr Ahmadinejad , as he runs for re-election next summer .
Mr Ahmadinejad said the world expected changes from Mr Obama
It is something to distract Iranians from the disastrous state of their country 's economy and public finances , as crashing oil prices compound years of mismanagement .
Mr Ahmadinejad 's own , rather eccentric approach to diplomacy could of course sabotage any attempt at talks , without any outside help .
His message of congratulations to Mr Obama contained some of the familiar old rhetoric - nations around the world wanted an end to American war - mongering , he said .
And his spokesman responded to Mr Obama 's offer of talks a few weeks ago by saying that Iran had its own conditions for dialogue - the US should first end its support for Israel , and end its presence in the Middle East .
No problem there , then !
In any case , Mr Ahmadinejad is not the only , or even the most important voice , in the Iranian government .
The speaker of the Iranian parliament , Ali Larijani , is seen as preferring a dialogue with Europe rather than the US .
The great nation of Iran welcomes basic and fair changes in US policies and conducts , especially in the region
Mahmoud Ahmadinejad
Iranian President
He is becoming an increasingly powerful opponent of the Iranian president .
The Supreme Leader , Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , is meanwhile sounding increasingly hawkish in his comments about America .
He seems to believe that the Islamic Republic thrives on its hostility towards the " Great Satan " .
Indeed , the long silence before the Iranian government made any reaction to the election showed just how confused they must be .
There must be those who long for the simplicity of a world in which the US is the enemy , and its president is vilified across the globe .
Domestic woes
As for ordinary Iranians , many of them long for a reconciliation with the US , and an end to their international isolation .
There was dismay recently when Iran received just 32 votes in the UN General Assembly in its bid for a seat on the Security Council , compared with 158 for Japan .
Despite Mr Obama 's offer of talks , his team is quick to point out that they are not going to be soft on Iran
It is hardly the world leadership to which Mr Ahmadinejad aspires .
But there is also growing bitterness in Iran towards the president and his government , with many people reluctant to see them enjoy any sort of diplomatic success .
Iranians have a charming faith that their country is at the very centre of world affairs .
So their first disappointment may come if the Mr Obama fails to take this immediately into account .
But sooner or later , relations with Tehran will be one of the thorniest questions on the future president 's desk .
Indeed , it could well become one of the biggest challenges of his presidency , as it has been for several of his predecessors .
Despite Mr Obama 's offer of talks , his team is quick to point out that they are not going to be soft on Iran .
It was a Democrat , Jimmy Carter , whose presidency was destroyed by the seizure of the US embassy in Tehran in 1979 .
After that , the Democrats lost the White House for 12 years .
There are still bitter memories .
Nuclear impasse
On the face of it , the biggest issue for Mr Obama 's new foreign policy team will be Iran 's controversial nuclear programme - how to prevent Iran getting a nuclear weapon , even though its government insists it has no such intention .
But despite growing concern , particularly in Israel , most estimates are that Iran is still some way from being able to make a nuclear bomb .
Are they really prepared to give up US ambitions of regime change in Iran , and to make their peace with the Islamic Republic ?
Furthermore , at the moment Iran 's two main nuclear facilities , the Bushehr reactor and the uranium enrichment plant at Natanz , are closely monitored by the UN 's nuclear watchdog , the IAEA .
In order to move from peaceful use , Iran would have to kick out the inspectors - giving the world a clear warning of its intentions .
The more immediate problem may be the situation in Iraq .
If the new US president fulfils his pledge to speed up the pullout of American troops , how then to prevent the Iraqi government becoming ever more closely allied to Iran ?
Not exactly the cause for which thousands of US , British and allied troops - and their friends in Iraq - lost their lives .
And there is a more fundamental question facing the new US administration .
Are they really prepared to give up US ambitions of regime change in Iran , and to make their peace with the Islamic Republic ?
For that is surely the fundamental issue at the root of all the disagreements between Tehran and Washington .
Mr Obama may reflect on the paradox that normalisation , or normality , not the threat of war , could well be the biggest challenge .

Barack Obama ’s campaign has written the Department of Justice demanding a criminal investigation of the “ American Issues Project . \ "
Obama to DOJ : Block terrorist ad
Sen .
Barack Obama has launched an all - out effort to block a Republican billionaire ’s efforts to tie him to domestic and foreign terrorists in a wave of negative television ads .
Obama ’s campaign has written the Department of Justice demanding a criminal investigation of the “ American Issues Project , ” the vehicle through which Dallas investor Harold Simmons is financing the advertisements .
The Obama campaign — and tens of thousands of supporters — also is pressuring television networks and affiliates to reject the ads .
The effort has met with some success : CNN and Fox News are not airing the attacks .
Advertisement
Obama has also launched his own response ad , directly addressing Simmons ' attempt to link him to domestic terror .
The project is “ a knowing and willful attempt to violate the strictures of federal election law , ” Obama general counsel Bob Bauer wrote to Deputy Assistant Attorney General John Keeney last week in a letter provided to Politico .
Bauer argued that by advocating Obama ’s defeat , the ad should be subject to the contribution limits of federal campaign law , not the anything - goes regime of issue advocacy .
Bauer ’s letter called on the Justice Department to open “ an investigation of the American Issues Project ; its officers and directors ; and its anonymous donors , whoever they may be . ”
“ This is a sad ploy to circumvent the First Amendment by a campaign who has no arguments with the merits of our ad .
It ’s the classic maneuver :
If you ca n’t win on the merits , file a lawsuit , ” said a spokesman for the American Issues Project , Christian Pinkston , who said his group 's non-profit status allowed it to participate in elections as long as it does a majority of policy work , which it plans to do .
A spokeswoman for Keeney , Laura Sweeney , declined to comment on Bauer ’s letter .
The Obama campaign plans to punish the stations that air the ad financially , an Obama aide said , organizing his supporters to target the stations that air it and their advertisers .
But the ad continues to air widely .
Evan Tracey , who tracks campaign advertising at TNS Media Intelligence , said it has been broadcast 150 times in Ohio , Pennsylvania , Virginia and Michigan .
Federal Election Commission reports indicate that Simmons has spent more than $ 2.8 million buying ads .
Obama ’s campaign has written a pair of letters to station managers carrying the ads .
The letter calls the ad ’s attempt to link Obama to terrorism “ an appalling lie , a disgraceful smear of the lowest kind on the senator ’s patriotism and commitment to the rule of law . ”
Airing the ad “ is inconsistent with your station ’s obligations under Federal Communications Commission regulations , ” the letter continues , saying Simmons ’ group lacks formal incorporation .
One large group of network affiliates , the Sinclair Broadcast Group — which aired an documentary attacking John Kerry in 2004 — has been running the ads , Obama aides said .
The campaign has launched a special effort to pressure Sinclair .
“ Obama supporters have now sent more than 93,000 e-mails to the Sinclair stations that have decided to run the ad , ” said Obama ’s spokesman Tommy Vietor .
“ Other stations that follow Sinclair ’s lead should expect a similar response from people who do n’t want the political discourse cheapened with these false , negative attacks . ”
Spokesmen for Sinclair , CNN and Fox did n’t respond to requests for comment .
The ad focuses on Obama ’s relationship with Bill Ayers , a Hyde Park acquaintance at whose home Obama attended a gathering early in his political career .
Ayers is a complicated figure : professor and adviser to the mayor of Chicago despite not having repented his past as a domestic terrorist with the Weather Underground .
" How much do your really know about Barack Obama ?
What does he really believe ? " asks the ad , which also uses imagery from the Al - Qaeda terror attacks on Sept. 11 , 2001 .
" Why would Barack Obama be friends with someone who bombed the Capitol and is proud of it ? " asks the ad ’s narrator .
Its financier , Simmons , who made his first fortune in chain pharmacies , was a major donor to the Swift Boat Veterans for Truth , the group that damaged Kerry in 2004 by questioning his patriotism .
He has raised more than $ 50,000 for Obama 's rival , Sen . John McCain , though there ’s no evidence that his anti-Obama effort has McCain ’s explicit blessing .
Obama has launched a response ad , which addresses McCain directly , and will air in Ohio , Tracey said .
" With all our problems , why is John McCain talking about the ' 60s , trying to link Barack Obama to radical Bill Ayers ? " says Obama ’s ad .
" McCain knows Obama denounced Ayers ' crimes , committed when Obama was just 8 years old . "
McCain ’s camp , meanwhile , appears to welcome the controversy .
“ The fact that [ Obama ] is launching his own convention by defending his long association with a man who says he did n't bomb enough U.S. targets tells us more about Barack Obama than any of tonight 's speeches will , ” said McCain spokesman Brian Rogers .
Correction :
An earlier version of this story said , citing the Obama campaign , that a Roanoke , Va. , television station was not airing the ad .
That was incorrect ; the station , WFXR , is airing the ad .

Two Republican senators facing reelection battles in states also seeing presidential campaign attention are speaking out against anti-Obama robocalls from John McCain 's campaign and the RNC .
Maine Sen. Susan Collins expressed her dispeasure first on Friday .
“ They do n’t serve John McCain well , ” Collins told PolitickerME .
“ This kind of campaign call does not reflect the kind of leader that he is . "
And today Minnesota Sen .
Norm Coleman 's campaign issued a blanket statement condemning negative ads and phone calls .
" I call on Al Franken , the DNC , the RNC , the DSCC , the NRSC and any other organization engaged in negative attacks on any candidate to bring them to an immediate end , " Coleman said in the statement .
Asked if this included McCain 's campaign , Coleman spokesman Luke Friedrich replied : " The senator is calling on everyone . "
Coleman , who like nearly every other Republican running a competitve race has seen his poll standing slip in recent weeks , made a show of taking down his negative ads earlier this month .
Collins is thought to be in a stronger position , but she has gone to great lengths this year and in her political career to run " clean campaigns . "

FRANKFURT ( Reuters ) - Volkswagen's VOWG .DE share price tripled on Monday as short sellers piled into the stock to sew up their speculative positions on news Porsche had bought up nearly all VW 's remaining free float .
A Volkswagen logo sign is seen next to the grill of a 2009 GTI automobile inside the lobby of the U.S. headquarters building of Volkswagen Group of America in Herndon , Virginia , September 18 , 2008 .
REUTERS / Larry Downing
The stampede pushed the value of VW 's voting stock alone at one point to a record 188 billion euros ( $ 233.9 billion ) , surpassing Toyota 's 7203 .
T market cap of $ 113 billion .
Porsche PSHG_p.DE said on Sunday it held stock and options equivalent to 74 percent of Europe 's biggest carmaker and aimed to push through a domination agreement next year that would give it management control and capture VW 's mighty cash flows .
This will almost certainly meet objections from VW ’s home state of Lower Saxony , which controls just over 20 percent .
[ ID :nLQ46943 ] .
In return for losing their dividend , minority investors would get an annual cash payout set by Porsche .
Porsche controls 31.5 percent of VW stock via cash - settled options and its counterparties are likely holding shares as insurance against price spikes .
This means investors who sold borrowed VW shares in hope of buying them back at lower prices are scrambling to find the few remaining shares on the market .
Sanford Bernstein analyst Max Warburton questioned Porsche ’s motives in announcing its holding , and suggested the company may have wanted to cash in one last big jackpot at the expense of unsuspecting investors .
“ To have shorted the stock , hedge funds must have inadvertently borrowed stock from Porsche , ” he told clients , citing the less than 6 percent of the shares in free float .
Warburton believes VW ’s daily trading volume consisted of speculators unknowingly selling these shares back to Porsche or its counterparties , running headlong into a trap .
Estimating the amount of short positions left to be closed at more than 15 percent of VW ’s total voting stock , Porsche and its banks could now “ name their price . ”
Volkswagen surged as high 635 euros in the closing half hour of the session , lifting the DJ Stoxx European autos index .
SXAP some 70 percent despite heavy losses in every other constituent stock .
The shares finished up 146 percent , closing at a record 520 euros .
By comparison , VW 's preferreds VOWG_p.DE sank 14.4 percent to 37.64 euros -- most likely due to the unwinding of trades shorting ordinaries to go long preferreds .
Porsche fell 9 percent , pricing the future owner of Volkswagen at around 7 billion euros .
WIDENING SPREADS
M.M. Warburg 's Marc - Rene
Tonn suggested the fully floated 105.2 million preferred shares might replace VW ordinaries in the German blue - chip DAX index .
GDAXI .
“ VW preferred shares appear to offer much better value to investors when compared to the ordinaries from a fundamental valuation point of view , particularly when considering a net cash position of 30 euros per share at VW , ” he wrote on Monday .
Christian Aust of UniCredit agreed : “ This might open the room for the VW preferred shares to enter the DAX as currently both the market cap ( 4.45 billion euros ) and the turnover criteria ( Rank 30 ) are fulfilled . ”
Analysts have in the past recommended buying VW preferreds over ordinaries in expectations that the growing spread between the two , once just several euros , would close .
This month VW ordinaries surged to 452 euros as traders cited speculation the collapse of Lehman Brothers may have forced hedge funds that had gone short using shares borrowed from the U.S. investment bank to close their positions quickly .
The head of German regional lender WestLB WDLG.UL , Thomas Fischer , had to fall on his sword in July 2007 after the bank was burned by proprietary trades that speculated on VW ordinary - preferred spreads earlier that year .
If the free float in Volkswagen ’s ordinary shares were to fall below 5 percent , the Frankfurt Stock Exchange ’s index revision committee would automatically replace them in the DAX index with the top - ranked stock measured by free - float market capitalization and trading volume , Deutsche Boerse said .
" At the moment , Volkswagen 's preferred shares VOWG_p.DE are the best placed non -index shares , but it would not be an automatic decision to replace VW 's ordinary shares with the company 's preferred shares in the DAX .
It 's the ranking at the time of the decision that counts , " a Boerse spokeswoman said .

MUMBAI , India ( CNN ) --
More than a day after gunmen stormed ashore and attacked at least seven locations in Mumbai , killing 125 people , members of India 's premier counterterrorist force early Friday were seeking to end standoffs at the two luxury hotels and Jewish center that were attacked late Wednesday .

Fighting broke out early Friday between government soldiers in a helicopter and gunmen holed up inside a Jewish center where two or three gunmen were believed to be remaining .
The helicopter dropped off seven or eight soldiers onto the roof of the Chabad house , and then moved away from the line of fire , CNN sister station CNN - IBN reported .
The operation followed after grenades had been tossed from inside the structure toward anyone approaching the building -- three such explosions occurred in four hours .
But movement appeared imminent shortly before dawn , when several jeeploads of police , firetrucks and at least one ambulance pulled up to the five - story structure .
The fighting at Chabad house comes as Indian security forces appear to be gaining control of two Mumbai five - star hotels attacked by gunmen in a wave of violence that has lasted more than 24 hours and killed at least 125 people .
A gunman was killed around 1 a.m. in the Oberoi hotel , where commandos were going room - to - room , trying to flush out attackers and rescue people , J.K. Dutt , the director of India 's National Security Guard , told CNN - IBN , CNN 's sister network in India .
Dutt said he could not say how many gunmen remained in the Oberoi , where hostages have been trickling out of the building for hours .
Security forces used in - house telephones to ask guests holed up in their rooms to switch on lights and open curtains , so that they could provide cover , CNN correspondent Andrew Stevens reported .

A siege at the nearby Taj Mahal hotel was over , CNN - IBN reported , but one gunman remained holed up there early Friday morning , Dutt told IBN .
Police sources said at 2 a.m.
Friday that they believed the gunman was wounded and getting tired .
Dutt said his teams had rescued most of the hostages inside the Taj , but an undetermined number of people remained inside .
One woman expressed frustration over the lack of information regarding her sister and niece , who have been trapped inside the Taj for nearly 30 hours .
" I have whatsoever no information as to what 's being done to rescue them , " said the woman , who did not give her name to CNN .
" There is somebody inside who is preventing the rescue , " she said .
" They should take action and let us know what is happening . "
Deepak Datta told CNN that he waited in his room at the Taj , listening to gunfire , for almost 24 hours before commandos rescued him .
" There was a lot of explosions right before my rescue , " he said .
" The explosions kept getting louder then they opened the door with a master key , " Watch more about the rescue »
Elsewhere in the city , a standoff continues at a Jewish center in the city , a spokesman for the Israeli foreign ministry said .
For hours , gunfire and grenades were tossed from inside at anyone approaching the building , with three such explosions occurring in four hours .
But movement appeared imminent shortly before dawn , when several jeeploads of police , firetrucks and at least one ambulance pulled up to the five - story structure .
It is unclear who was responsible for the series attacks , which hit several high - traffic landmarks in the city , including the hotels , a hospital , a train station and a popular tourist cafe .

But whoever planned the attacks spent months coordinating them , even setting up " control rooms " in the two hotels targeted , the Press Trust of India reported , citing Union Cabinet Minister Kapil Sibal .
" Enormous planning went into the incident .
The terrorists were dropped by a mother ship and traveled in rubber boats which they docked ( at Mumbai ) , " Sibal said .

The French Foreign Ministry said 15 to 20 French nationals were trapped in the two hotels .
Authorities found 8 kilograms ( 17 pounds ) of RDX , one of the most powerful kinds of military explosives , at a restaurant near the Taj , indicating that the attackers may have been planning more violence .

Make the fuel drainage hole .
There are two possible approaches to making the fuel drainage holes :
The first is to make a screw sized hole in the middle of the top .
Get a short , fat sheet metal screw that will act as fuel hole cap .
Make sure this fits snugly , to prevent fuel escaping from this hole .
The second method is to create a flower shape of the same small size as the pin holes made for the outer rim .
To do it this way , make one hole in the center and 6 holes evenly spaced around the center hole .
As these holes will be smaller , the fuel will drip through to the base , not pour through .
This method is obviously easier if you do not have access to a screw but is a little slower than the first method for filling purposes .

Cut the top can .
Once you have made the holes using the strength of the whole can , it is time to cut the top part .
Cut it along the line you drew earlier .

Cut small vertical slits .
Once you have the top piece cut , you will need to create slits to allow the two halves of the stove to telescope together .
Cut vertical slits with scissors , taking care not to cut past the rim of the can ( the rounded part ) .
Cut in about four to six even places ( you can always cut a few more slits if the top is n't easing in gently ) .
As an optional step , you could use a paper punch to make holes halfway up the can , then cutting the slits up to them .
This will stop the can from tearing when trying to mate the two halves .

Fill the base with a suitable filling that will soak up the fuel such as perlite or vermiculite .
At a pinch , you could even use sand .
Perlite is a naturally occurring siliceous rock that is found in many parts of the world .
You can purchase it at most gardening centers .
In each case , the filling acts as a wick to hold the fuel and disburse it evenly and gradually .

Fit the stove together .
Once you have the filling in place in the base , and the slits made for the top , it is time to put the two pieces together .
Steady the stove base by placing it on an even surface , such as a table top or flat ground .
Take the top and gently but firmly push it down into the base of the stove until it fits snugly ; shuffle the perlite or other filling around a little to help ease in the top .
Some users recommend creating a wedge from some of the spare aluminum to ease it in .
The top will now be sloping inwards ( dimple ) , ready for pouring in your fuel .

9 Prepare the stove for use .
Make sure the stove is sitting on a surface free of flammable material .
Choose a spot of ground free of plant matter , or put the stove on a pie plate or a dinner plate .
Depending on which fuel holes you have used , proceed to adding your fuel .
Only some fuels should be used in this type of stove ( see " Tips " for these fuels ) :
Plugged hole - remove your fill hole plug ( the metal screw ) .
Slowly pour the fuel into the top , allowing it to drain into the fill hole .
Fill the stove base about 1 /4 to 1/2 way full .
Replace the plug if you have used a large hole , to prevent further dripping of the fuel .
Flower shaped hole - pour the fuel into the stove base via the small holes in the dimple , until the stove base is about 1 / 4 to 1/2 way full .
This method relies on the fuel dripping through the small holes , so it will not be as fast as the first method .

Tip a little extra fuel ( about a teaspoonful ) in the dimple ( middle ) of the stove so that it pools there and even splash a little over the rim holes ( it will burn off quickly ) .
Two of the world 's leading wind farm operators have teamed up to make joint bids for the next round of offshore licences in Britain .
ScottishPower Renewables , part of Spain 's Iberdrola Renovables , is joining forces with Sweden 's Vattenfall with the aim of developing 6,000 megawatts of installed capacity .
The partners have not said how much the development will cost , but industry experts believe the investment will run into several billions of pounds .
The partnership will take the form of a consortium which will submit its tender to the Crown Estate under the third round of licences for offshore development .
" Round three is a very important part of the UK's renewable aspirations and this consortium has the skills and determination to play a key role in this process , " said Xabier Viteri , chief executive of Iberdrola Renovables .
Both Iberdrola and Vattenfall already have significant wind farm operations .
Within Iberdrola , ScottishPower operates 550 megawatts of capacity across the UK and Ireland .
It is also building what it describes as the world 's largest onshore windfarm at Whitelee , south of Glasgow , and has received consent for its first offshore windfarm off the Cumbria coast , west of Duddon Sands .
Vattenfall owns two of the world 's largest offshore windfarms , Lillgrund off the south coast of Sweden and Horns Rev in the Danish North Sea .
In the UK it owns Kentish Flats in the Thames estuary and recently bought Amec Wind Energy and Eclipse Energy .
Yesterday , as well as the partnership with ScottishPower , the Swedish company said it had bought the Thanet Offshore project .
It paid £ 35 m for the scheme , which will have an installed capacity of 300 MW .
The investment required will be about £ 780m .
Anders Dahl , the head of Vattenfall 's wind power division , said : " Great Britain is ideal for wind power with good wind conditions and a long coastline . "
Mike O'Brien , energy and climate change minister , said : " I am pleased Thanet windfarm will be able to proceed under its new owner , Vattenfall .
This proves the UK is still a good place to invest in offshore wind despite the current economic difficulties .
The UK is a world leader in this technology .
Our plans for more windfarms offshore will not only help in the fight against climate change but will increase the amount of home grown energy and create jobs . "
Rob Hastings , director of the marine estate at The Crown Estate , said : " We are very pleased that Vattenfall have completed this deal to buy Thanet .
The UK is now the world 's leading producer of offshore wind power and we will be working closely with Vattenfall to ensure the build schedule is maintained . "
Last year the then business and enterprise secretary , John Hutton , indicated Britain could build up to 33 gigawatts of offshore capacity by 2020 .

A Massachusetts state senator who was photographed while seeming to stuff thousands of dollars in bribe money into her sweater has resigned .
The resignation of the senator , Dianne Wilkerson , was announced by the State Senate president , Therese Murray .
Ms. Wilkerson , a 53 - year - old Democrat , was indicted Tuesday on eight counts of attempted extortion .
And , so you do n’t have to troll around the pics , here are the said pictures of Ms. Wilkerson literally stuffing her shirt full of cash ( maybe she moonlights as a stripper too ? ) :

SANTIAGO ( Reuters ) - Copper socks ?
Copper towels ?
How about copper subway poles ?
These are only a few of the uses Chile , the world ’s biggest copper producer , is applying to the red metal now used more in the construction and auto sectors .
Used since ancient times to make tools , weapons and even plumbing systems , investigators are experimenting in Chile with new ways to use the metal and exploit its bacteria - and fungus - fighting characteristics .
“ Public transport systems , where germs can be transmitted and there are large numbers of people , there is a potential market for applications for surface - metal copper , ” said Jurgen Leibbrandt , head of market development for the Chilean state copper giant Codelco .
“ In clothes there is another venue ... where it has excellent anti-fungus qualities , ” he said .
Codelco is already working with the private sector to market socks , towels , pillow cases and even underwear sewn with copper fibers that fight fungi and even help combat acne .
And the private sector is in a drive to join Chile ’s leading export , copper , with the salmon industry , another of its next best known exports , to cut disease in fish stocks .
Chile is the world ’s second largest salmon producer after Norway , but the industry has high costs because of expensive solutions to controlling infections .
“ Joining these two industries to finding a solution that is economically viable is certainly viable , ” said Leibbrandt .
Manufacturers say copper has properties that kill bacteria and reduce threats of infections .
One Chilean entrepreneur , Joaquin Ruiz , has invented copper sponge filters to be used to purify water used on salmon farms to eliminate disease and fungi , and reduce the use of large amounts of costly antibiotics currently employed to do the same job .
“ That means huge savings .
Instead of using large quantities of antibiotics and germ killing agents , with this you are just putting up a simple sanitary barrier , ” Ruiz , the developer of the Metal Foam sponges , told Reuters .
Codelco is experimenting with bacteria - repellant cages for the industry .
Investigators are also looking where they can use the metal to reduce levels of infection in hospitals and they have found the metal helps to kill Methicillin - resistant Staphylococcus aureus ( MRSA ) , a bacterium responsible for difficult - to - treat infections in humans .
“ If you prevent one MRSA infection , you save $ 21,000 , so your return on investment will be very very short , perhaps one patient , ” said Michael Schmidt , of the University of South Carolina medical school .
“ So this is going to be a fairly efficient and inexpensive solution to combat infections . ”
The future of cancer drug development may be targeting pathways rather than single genes and their products .
Two new and unprecedentedly detailed analyses of pancreatic and brain cancers found dozens of mutations , but only a few were present in any given tumor .
That could explain why gene - targeting cancer drugs have been so hard to develop :
Even if a drug is successful , it will only affect a fraction of all tumors .
However , these varied mutations appear to influence only a few cellular pathways – cause and effect cascades of enzymes and signals that go haywire in cancer cells .
Some scientists say that chemicals capable of disrupting pathways , whether at a cancer - implicated gene or somewhere else altogether , are far more promising than the current generation of gene - targeting cancer drugs .
" Virtually all drug development over the past ten years has focused on targeted therapies directed against individual genes or gene products , " said Bert Vogelstein , a Howard Hughes Medical Institute cancer researcher and co-author of the studies , both published today in Science .
" It 's going to be even more difficult than previously expected to derive real cures from such therapies . "
Vogelstein pointed to Gleevec , a leukemia drug known generically as Imatinib , as an exception that proves the rule :
It targets tyrosine genes , and is one of the few modern cancer drug success stories .
Most potential drugs developed in the last decade have failed during clinical testing , and of those that have come to market , few have significant impacts on a disease that will kill more than 560,000
Americans this year .
" A simple reliance on dominant gene product mode of drug discovery will likely be fraught with disappointment , " said Lynn Hlatky , director of the Center of Cancer Systems Biology at Tufts University .
She was not involved in the studies .
But other researchers say that pathway - targeting drugs are more complicated than they seem .
Jackson Laboratory cancer researcher Tom
Gridley agreed " you 'll never be able to come up with enough drugs to target each individual component , " but held out hope that high - profile genes could still be targeted .
Further complicating the situation , said Harvard Medical School oncologist Lynda Chin , there are many different ways to disrupt pathways – and these have different clinical value .
" Sometimes you hit a different point in the pathway , and that works for one patient but not another , " said Chin , a co-author of a brain cancer analysis published today in Nature by the Cancer Genome
Atlas project .
Though not as detailed as the Science analyses , the
Nature study looked at 200 pancreatic cancer tumors .
" What 's needed is an understanding of critical nodes , " said Chin , suggesting that focusing on pathways – while an advance on single - gene , single - outcome thinking – is insufficient .
" What the genome efforts give us is a network , not even a pathway .
Everything is going to be interconnected .
And at the end of the day , we still need to figure out what the key nodes are to target , and whether this should be done with a targeted drug or a pathway drug . "
Gridley added that pathways do n't function in isolation : Disrupt one , and another is affected , with potentially catastrophic side effects .
" Detecting the tumor and removing it as early as possible may be the way to go , because it 's difficult to find drugs of the requisite efficacy and specificity , " he said .
Vogelstein echoed his point , noting that " the history of medical research shows that the best way to control diseases in the long term is by prevention , not therapy . "
Chin was sympathetic :
The mutations identified in the papers will eventually help doctors in their search for early genetic traces of cancer .
" There 's a huge importance in early diagnosis .
But that 's not an alternative to therapeutics , it 's a parallel , " said Chin .
" We know that there are patients who get diagnosed early , and the cancer still recurs .
They will still die from the cancer , even with early diagnosis .
And we need to treat them , too . "

The State of Missouri
The election is mostly over , but not entirely .
Let 's review where we are .
In Missouri , John McCain leads by 4986 votes out of almost 3 million cast .
The absentee and provisional ballots are still being tallied , but it is unlikely that Barack Obama can turn this one around .
State law requires a final count by Nov. 18 .
On the other hand , it is now definite that Obama picked up one electoral vote in NE - 02 , which will most like cause the Nebraska legislature to change the law and make the state winner - take - all in 2012 to deny Obama NE - 02 agan .
The final electoral vote score nationally will probably be 365 to 173 .
Three Senate Races Still Undecided The Senate race in Minnesota between Sen. Norm Coleman ( R - MN ) and Democrat Al Franken ( D ) is currently frozen with Coleman 206 votes ahead .
A recount will start after Nov. 19 at about 120 locations throughout the state .
Each side will have a lawyer present at each location .
Actually , given the nature of the activity to occur , it might have been better for each side to have a mathematician present , but such is life in modern America .
If you are really into the nitty gritty details of recounts , check out this posting at Daily Kos .
In Alaska , Anchorage mayor Mark Begich ( D ) is currently 841 votes ahead of Sen .
Ted Stevens ( R - AK ) , who if he wins would be the only convicted felon ever to be elected to the United States Senate .
However , there are about 25,000 absentee ballots yet to be counted , many from the Anchorage area , where Begich is well known .
In addition , 15,000 provisional ballots are still uncounted .
Typically half of all provisional ballots are rejected , but since they are more likely to come from low - income voters who do n't have proper ID or people with transient housing , they tend to skew Democratic .
Some , but not all , of the remaining votes will be counted today .
Stevens own pollster , David Dittman , has said that the race is over and Begich will win .
All in all , this is the Democrats best shot at another Senate seat .
If Stevens does somehow win , he will probably be expelled from the Senate , but in a special election , any Republican ( and especially Sarah Palin ) will be able to hold the seat .
If Begich does win , Palin will be stuck in Alaska , which will make it much harder for her to campaign for President .
Just the logistics will be daunting .
Although the state capital is Juneau , she actually lives in Wasilla , which is 45 minutes north of Anchorage , AK .
The states she would want to campaign in are Iowa , New Hampshire , and South Carolina .
There are two reasonable ways to get to New Hampshire from Anchorage .
First , she could fly to Chicago and then get a flight to Manchester , NH ( total time : 10:35 ) .
Or second , she could fly to Minneapolis and then catch a flight to Logan in Boston ( total time : 9:35 ) and then drive an hour to Manchester or 75 minutes to Concord .
To campaign in Iowa , she could fly to Minneapolis and then catch a flight to Des Moines ( total time : 7:53 ) .
To campaign in Charleston , she could go via Chicago and get to Charleston in 10:01 .
No matter how she does it , it takes a day to get there and a day to get back .
Going to any of the states to give a speech at some event in the middle of the day will cost her three days .
In contrast , Mitt Romney lives in Massachusetts , so New Hampshire is just a short drive away and Charleston and Des Moines are reachable in under 5 hours .
The third undecided Senate seat is Georgia , where a runoff will take place on Dec. 2 between Sen. Saxby Chambliss ( R - GA ) and Jim Martin ( D ) .
Both sides are gearing up for a real battle , but turnout in runoffs is typically half of turnout in general elections and Democrats can win there only with massive turnout .
Besides , Chambliss actually won the election ; he just failed to make the 50 % threshold due to the presence of a Libertarian candidate .
Barring something very unexpected , Chambliss will be reelected .
Thus the final score seems to be one for the Democrats ( Alaska ) , one for the Republicans ( Georgia ) , and one true tossup ( Minnesota ) .
The conclusion is that the Democrats are likely to have 58 or 59 seats in the new Senate .
More here .
Six House Races Still Undecided Six
House races are still open .
In AK - AL , the dogs are pulling in the sleds full of votes as fast as they can , but many absentee and provisional ballots still remain to be counted .
Still , Rep. Don Young ( R - AK ) is leading Ethan Berkowitz ( D ) by 15,000 votes and it seems very unlikely that Berkowitz can win this one .
In CA - 04 , state senator Tom McClintock ( R ) holds a 928 - vote lead over retired Air Force colonel Charlie Brown ( D ) .
A recount is likely there , but it looks good for McClintock .
In OH - 15 , Steve Stivers ( R ) has a lead of 149 votes over Mary Jo Kilroy ( D ) for this open seat being vacated by Deborah Pryce .
There are thousands of provisional ballots still being counted .
In 2006 , Kilroy picked up about 2400 votes from the provisional ballots , so this one is not over yet .
VA - 05 is less of a nailbiter .
In fact , Tom Perriello ( D ) has already claimed victory over incumbent Virgil Goode ( R ) but Goode has not conceded .
Perriello leads by 745 votes pending a recount .
Finally , there are runoffs scheduled for Dec. 7 in LA - 02 and LA - 04 .
The former is the district where William Jefferson ( D ) was discovered to have a freezer full of cold cash .
Jefferson will surely win the runoff in this majority black district , but after he is in jail , there will be a special election that will be won by another Democrat .
LA - 04 is R+7 , so in theory the Republican , John Fleming ( R ) , should be able to win this , but competing partisan poll give conflicting results .
Democrat Paul Carmouche might possibly win this one .
It 's too close to call .
So , what 's the bottom line in the House .
Let 's give the Republicans AK - AL , CA - 04 and the Democrats LA - 02 and VA - 05 , with OH - 15 and LA - 04 being true tossups .
Most likely the Democrats will end up with 258 - 260 seats in the House .
Consequently , whatever Nancy wants , Nancy gets .
Did Palin Do Her Job ?
Politico has an interesting piece on whether Sarah Palin accomplished what she was supposed to accomplish .
She was picked for basically three reasons : ( 1 ) to excite the base and drive up turnout , ( 2 ) to attract independent voters , and ( 3 ) to pull the disgruntled ( PUMA ) women away from the Democrats as a punishment for not nominating Hillary Clinton .
How did she do ?
First , as to driving up core Republican turnout , she did n't .
Core Republican turnout was 1.3 % lower than what the embattled George Bush got in 2004 .
In fact , the reason Obama won Ohio was not that Democrats turned out in great numbers ( Obama actually got fewer votes in Ohio than Kerry ) but that Republicans stayed home in droves ( 300,000 fewer Republican votes than in 2004 ) .
Second , Palin did n't help much with independents ; they went for Obama by 8 % and in numerous polls many of them cited her specifically as their reason for voting for Obama .
Probably the biggest disappointment was her lack of support among women ; Obama won among women by 13 % .
The idea that Hillary Clinton 's supporters would vote for any woman , even one who opposes everything Clinton stands for , proved completely false .
Many people have written that just thinking this ploy would work is by itelf an insult to women 's intelligence and quite sexist .
Clearly it backfired .
The Pollsters Did A Good Job in 2008
As we discussed here Nov. 5 , the pollsters were pretty good this cycle .
Almost all final state polls were within the margin of error .
Even the average of the national polls was spot on .
The only black spot was Alaska , where the polls showed the Democrats winning both the Senate and House seats in landslides .
The Senate seat turned out to be very close and Don Young ( R ) will probably hang onto his House seat .
Mark Blumenthal has a column in the National Journal scoring the pollsters .
His conclusion was also that they did pretty well .

Researchers at MIT have made significant progress in understanding a class of materials that has resisted analysis for decades .
Their findings could lead to the rapid discovery of a variety of useful new kinds of glass made of metallic alloys with potentially significant mechanical , chemical and magnetic applications .
The first examples of metallic alloys that could be made into glass were discovered back in the late 1950s and led to a flurry of research activity , but , despite intense study , so far nobody had solved the riddle of why some specific alloys could form glasses and others could not , or how to identify the promising candidates , said Carl .
V. Thompson , the Stavros Salapatas Professor of Materials Science & Engineering and director of the Materials Processing Center at MIT .
A report on the new work , which describes a way to systematically find the promising mixes from among dozens of candidates , is being published this week in Science .
Glasses are solids whose structure is essentially that of a liquid , with atoms arranged randomly instead of in the ordered patterns of a crystal .
Generally , they are produced by quickly cooling a material from a molten state , a process called quenching .
" It is very difficult to make glasses from metals compared to any other class of materials , such as semiconductors , ceramics and polymers , " Thompson said .
Decades of effort by scientists around the world have focused on " understanding and on exploiting the remarkable properties of these materials , and on understanding why some alloy compositions can be made into glasses and others cannot , " he said .
They still have n't solved that " why , " Thompson said .
But this new work does " provide a very specific and quantitative new insight into the characteristics of liquid alloys that can most readily be quenched into the glassy state , " he said , and thus provides a much more rapid way of discovering new alloys that have the right properties .
The research was the result of a collaboration between Thompson and MIT post - doc Johannes A. Kalb with Professor Yi Li and graduate student Qiang Guo at the National University of Singapore , working together across thousands of miles of separation through the Singapore - MIT Alliance .
Essentially , the work consisted of producing an array of different alloys with slightly varying proportions of two metals , each deposited on a separate microscopic finger of metal .
Then , they analyzed the changes in density of each different mixture when the glass crystallized , and found that there were a few specific proportions that had significantly higher density than the others -- and those particular alloys were the ones that could readily form glasses .
Of three of these special proportions they found , two were already known glass - forming alloys , but the third was a new discovery .
The new work could even lead to a solution to the longstanding puzzle of why only certain alloys make glasses , he said .
" I expect these new results , and the technique we developed to obtain them , will play a key , and hopefully decisive , role in solving the mystery of metallic glass formation . "
Such materials could have a variety of applications because of their unusual physical and magnetic properties , Thompson said .
They are " soft " magnetically , meaning that it 's very easy to change the magnetic orientation of the material .
This is a highly desirable characteristic for the cores of transformers , for example , which must switch their magnetic orientation dozens of times per second .
Transformers made from metallic glasses could potentially greatly reduce the amount of electricity wasted as excess heat in conventional transformers , reducing the need for new generating plants .
In addition , these glasses are unusually hard mechanically and have a high degree of springiness ( known technically as a high " elastic modulus " ) .
This springiness could make them a useful material for some sports equipment such as golf clubs or tennis rackets , Thompson said .
Although metallic glasses are relatively expensive , he said , for some people interested in the best - performing sports equipment , or in virtually unbreakable housings for cellphones , for example , " no expense is too high . "
The new research is a major accomplishment for the Singapore - MIT Alliance , Thompson said , and would not have been possible without the high - quality communications and collaboration tools it provides .
Despite their physical separation , " Prof . Li and I have been working together now for almost ten years , " he said .
" We routinely meet via video conferencing and have both been deeply involved in the co-supervision of the remarkable PhD student , Qiang Guo , who carried out this research . "
Thompson said he sees such collaborations as a significant example of a growing trend .
" I think this and other accomplishments within the SMA program demonstrate that the future of research lies in technology - mediated collaborations among people with common interests and complementary capabilities , regardless of where the different parts of the team are located , " he said .
The research was supported by the SMA program , and Kalb was partially supported through a fellowship from the German Alexander Von Humboldt Foundation .
On Wednesday ( October 15 ) , the day after the federal election , Fair Vote Canada ’s phone was ringing away .
But for the weeks before then : silence .
Larry Gordon , the executive director of the Toronto - based group that lobbies for proportional representation in government , said that there ’s a renewed vigour for democratic reform in Canada .
After Ontario ’s pro-rep referendum fizzled in October 2007 , Gordon told the Straight on the phone from the riding of Beaches - East York that the mainstream media “ relegated voting reform to the dead story file ” .
But buzzing from coffee overload last night , Gordon was jubilant to see hundreds of comments on the CBC Web site chirping about proportional representation .
“ Last night we set two records , ” he said .
“ First , it was the worst voter turnout in history .
Second , a political party got the highest number of votes without sending anyone to Parliament . ”
That , of course , was the Green party .
Gordon believes that part of the reason for the low voter turnout is a general “ anger and frustration at the gut level with the political system ” , and feeling that one ’s vote does n’t count .
The breakdown of the vote , according to Elections Canada :
The Green party got 6.8 percent of the votes , and no seats .
The Bloc Québécois got 10 percent of the votes , but 16.2 percent of the seats .
The NDP got 18.2 percent of the votes , but 12 percent of the seats .
The Liberals got 26.2 percent of the votes , but 24.7 percent of the seats .
The Conservatives got 37.6 percent of the votes , but 46.4 percent of the seats .
In other words , the Bloc and the Conservatives were the big winners , and everyone else , losers .
Gordon commended B.C. premier Gordon Campbell for being the first politician in any democracy to recognize that it is a conflict of interest for a ruling party to decide on how people vote .
But he also noted that , when British Columbians voted in a referendum on a single transferable vote system in 2005 , Campbell “ rigged ” the results by demanding that 60 percent agree .
The referendum got 57.7 percent support .
It lost .
On the May 2009 provincial ballot , there will be another proportional rep question .
“ Sometimes we think , ” ˜My God , this will never happen , ’ ” he said .
“ But they tried to stop women from getting the vote .
They tried to halt the franchise to all citizens .
The year before it [ women ’s suffrage ] passed in Ontario , it was literally laughed at and jeered at . ”
Gordon admits that proportional rep could cost the big parties their popularity .
Without strategic voting , citizens could choose parties without compromising , so the big winners , he figures , would be the Greens and the NDPers .
Given that Fair Vote Canada has a staff of one , Gordon , and none of its affiliated provincial organizations have paid staff , the buzz around proportional rep is pretty remarkable .
That ’s why , Gordon said , it ’s time for citizens to take up the flag .
“ You do n’t get democratic reform by holding your breath or saying , ” ˜Ain’t that terrible , ’ ” he said .
“ When the light bulb goes off and you realize how important this issue is , it ’s not enough to say , ” ˜ Oh yes , we should have reform . ’

Many people think you can tell a lot about a person 's subconscious thought by measuring various bodily functions including heart rate , blood pressure , and muscle tension ( think polygraph machines ) .
Whether you believe that biofeedback technology is cutting edge , interesting to ponder , or just a lot of hooey , there are a few biofeedback apps for Linux users who want to explore the concept .
The OpenEEG Project wants to further the development of free and open source software for biofeedback and EEG ( Wikipedia : Electroencephalography ( EEG ) is the measurement of electrical activity produced by the brain as recorded from electrodes placed on the scalp ) analysis .
Its Website tracks existing apps , including a few closed source options that offer support for OpenEEG hardware .
" It is aimed toward amateurs who would like to experiment with EEG , " notes the Web site .
" However , if you are a pro in any of the fields of electronics , neurofeedback , software development etc. , you are of course welcome to join the mailing - list and share your wisdom .
One app that caught my eye is BioEra , " a visual designer for analyzing bio - signals in real time [ that ] can be used with any bio - feedback device that has ability to send bio data to computer . "
It works on Linux , Mac OS X , Windows , and even PocketPC PDAs .
While not everyone believes in bio- and neurofeedback , researchers at NASA think it has merit .
They use it to help train pilots , which ultimately led to spinoff technology that 's helping children overcome the affects of ADD and ADHD .
Far fewer people filled out the report cards this year , however , and some board members appeared skeptical of the surveys .
“ Are you discouraged by these results or encouraged ? ” a board member , Mark D. Lebow , asked the New York City Transit president , Howard H. Roberts Jr. “ Because it sort of reminds me of the person who wants to change his nasty personality :
He makes the most concerted efforts and he gets the most marginal improvements . ”
But Mr. Roberts said he did not expect big changes in just a year .
“ I ’m very encouraged with the progress that we have made , ” said Mr. Roberts , who acknowledged that New Yorkers can be hard to impress .
“ They see a little improvement , but they see a lot of other places that there is n’t improvement .
What would have astonished me is if the results had turned out to be A’s . ”
Mr. Roberts has said the report cards would be a major tool in measuring efforts to improve service and in particular a new program to give each subway line a general manager with the power to be more responsive to riders .
That program began as a pilot on the No. 7 and L lines last December , after a first round of report cards were submitted by riders .
The other numbered subway lines are getting general managers this year , followed by the rest of the lettered lines next year .
COVINA , Calif . 
A man in a Santa Claus outfit opened fire on a Christmas Eve gathering of his in - laws in this Los Angeles suburb and then methodically set their house ablaze , killing at least eight people and injuring several others , the authorities said Thursday .
Shortly after the attack , the gunman , identified as Bruce Jeffrey Pardo , 45 , killed himself with a single shot to the head at the home of his brother in the Sylmar section of Los Angeles , the police said .
In addition to the eight people whose bodies were found in the ashes of the house here , none of whom were identified , at least one other person was thought to be missing , and perhaps as many as three .
Among the total of dead or missing were the couple who owned the home and their daughter , the estranged wife of the gunman , the police said .
Investigators continued to search the charred structure Thursday , and coroners said dental records would be needed to identify some of the remains .
The frenzied shooting occurred just before midnight Wednesday at the two - story house , set on a cul - de- sac in this middle - class town about 22 miles east of Los Angeles .
Lt. Pat Buchanan of the Covina Police Department said Mr. Pardo , armed with one or two handguns and fire accelerant , had gone to the house looking for his former wife , Sylvia , with whom he was finalizing a contentious divorce after only a year of marriage .
People who escaped the house got out by smashing through glass and jumping .
One woman broke an ankle when she leapt from a second - floor window .

The house was owned by James and Alicia Ortega , an elderly couple who were retired from their spray - painting business and who often invited their large extended family over for parties , particularly around Christmas .
Relatives said about 25 people , among them many children , were inside the home celebrating when Mr. Pardo knocked on the door around 11:30 p.m .
He had apparently disguised himself as a hired entertainer for the children in order to gain access .
When a guest opened the door , Lieutenant Buchanan said , Mr. Pardo stepped inside the house , drew a semiautomatic handgun and immediately started shooting , beginning with an 8 - year - old girl who was hit in the face but who survived , as did an older girl who was shot in the back .
As Mr. Pardo unleashed a barrage of gunfire in the living room , relatives smashed through windows , hid behind furniture or bounded upstairs .
Then he sprayed the room with accelerant , using a device made of two pressurized tanks , one of which held pressurized gas .
Within seconds , the house was ablaze .
Joshua Chavez of Seattle was visiting his mother ’s house , which sits behind the Ortegas ’ , when he heard a loud explosion .
“ Then I saw black smoke and this large flame , ” he said .
Mr. Chavez ran out to the backyard and heard three girls , including the one who had been shot in the back , trying to climb over his mother ’s wall .
“ There ’s some guy shooting in there , ” he said one of the girls told him .
“ About 20 seconds after that , ” he continued , “ the house was totally on fire .
One girl said that a guy dressed as Santa started shooting . ”

Another neighbor , Jeannie Goltz , 51 , saw three more partygoers fleeing the burning home .
One of them , a young woman , had escaped upstairs from the living room but broke her ankle when she jumped out a second - story window .
SWAT teams arrived shortly after Ms. Goltz had shepherded these three survivors into another neighbor ’s house , but by that time Mr. Pardo was on his way back to Los Angeles .
Police officers said they could not recall so horrific a crime in Covina , and neighbors said they would never have imagined anything so grisly on their quiet block .
The Ortegas had lived in the house for more than two decades and were known for their family spirit , their generosity and their dog , which frequently escaped their yard .
“ I would generally play Santa for the family every year , ” said Pat Bower , a neighbor of the Ortegas for 25 years .
“ The family was always together .
Brothers and sisters , aunts and uncles were always in the house .
They were a gigantic family .
We all envied them , actually . ”
Robert and Gloria Magcalas lived next door to the Ortegas for 11 years but were celebrating Christmas Eve with relatives in Los Angeles .
Their own home was barely spared the flames .
“ They were a big , loving family , ” Mrs. Magcalas said .
“ We usually exchanged gifts with them today .
They gave us tamales and cookies every Christmas . ”
The police said they had found two handguns in the ruins , and an additional two pistols at the scene of Mr. Pardo ’s apparent suicide .
Officials said they would continue to search the crime scene Friday , seeking information about the identities of the dead .
Others , however , have a different idea .
These brave types have latched onto other lost causes .
Ones that , quite frankly , deserve to be lost .
Such as :
Sometimes , lost causes are the only ones worth fighting for .
Hunger , war , disease , they 'll always be with us , but caring souls will always fight to raise awareness about these issues .

NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
American homeowners will collectively lose more than $ 2 trillion in home value by the end of 2008 , according to a report released Monday .
The real estate Web site Zillow.com calculated that home values have dropped 8.4 % year - over - year during the first three quarters of 2008 , compared with the same period of 2007 .
Some 11.7 million Americans are now " underwater , " owing more on their mortgage balances than their homes are worth .
Zillow collects home values and analyzes home price trends in 163 markets ; all but 30 registered price drops over the nine months ended Sept. 30 , compared with the same nine - month period of 2007 .
" This year marked the acceleration of the market correction , and is likely to end with the eighth consecutive quarter of declines in home values , " said Stan Humphries , Zillow 's vice president of data and analytics .
" Homeowners in most areas we cover are struggling with foreclosures pouring into the market , large amounts of negative equity and dropping home values . "
No bottom in sight
One piece of good news is that in some , although not all , of the markets hardest hit by the downturn , such as San Francisco , San Diego and Punta Gorda , Fla. , home values are not falling as steeply as they were .
Offsetting that cause for optimism , however , are growing economic problems , especially increased job losses .
" When we look for a turnaround , we look for two or three consecutive quarters [ of smaller price declines ] , " he said .
" We also want to see sales numbers pick up , inventories go down and improvements in foreclosure figures .
Foreclosures really muddy the picture . "
The foreclosure picture is not likely to clear up in the coming months , according to Humphries .
He expects to see more foreclosed , vacant homes added to already bulging inventories , sending prices spiraling down and putting more mortgage borrowers deeper underwater .
Most of the subprime loans that will fail have already done so , but there are other toxic mortgage products whose default rates probably have not yet peaked .
The number of option ARMs that fail , for instance , will continue to increase over the next few years according to Humphries .
These loans allow homeowners to make minimum payments , which cause the loan principle to balloon .
There are also lots of " liar loans " loans , which were issued without checking a borrower 's assets or income , that are still going bad .
Zillow 's home value statistics closely track the foreclosure crisis ; price declines are steepest in areas that have been hit hardest by foreclosures .
The worst performing market in the nation was Stockton , Calif .
The average home price there plunged 32.3 % year - over - year to $ 210,179 in the first three quarters of 2008 .
Almost as bad were nearby Merced , down 31.2 % to $ 167,282 , and Modesto , was was off 30.4 % to $ 197,368 in the same time period .
Humphries expressed surprise that these areas are still performed so poorly .
" I would have thought that they would have produced some more positive trends by now , " he said , " but we are seeing no slowdown . "
The best performing metropolitan area was Jacksonville N.C. , where home values rose 4.9 % year - over - year to $ 139,261 in the first three quarters of the year .
Winston - Salem , N.C. , also registered a gain , of 4.1 % to $ 136,854 .
Anderson , S.C. , prices climbed 3.5 % to $ 101,816 and State College , Pa. , went up by 3.4 % to $ 206,995 .
Scratch just a bit under the hope generated by the coming electoral changes in Washington , Jerusalem , and maybe Ramallah , and you discover deep despair about the possibility of an Israeli - Palestinian peace deal .
The roads taken in the last 15 years in pursuit of a deal – the negotiations since Oslo , the unilateralism of the Gaza disengagement , and even the violence since the ( second ) Intifada – all failed .
The opponents of an agreement did not waste that time , however :
The number of Israeli settlers grew almost threefold since the early days of the peace process , making a territorial compromise even more difficult .
Political leadership on both sides offers little hope for reconciliation .
The Palestinian national movement is weak and deeply divided .
The coming Israeli elections will most likely bring about a more hawkish Israeli Parliament , if not a more conservative prime minister .
A sense of hopelessness has reached even the most committed peace activists .
The Palestinian activist Sari Nusseibeh , for example , wondered publicly if territorial compromise is still an option .
And Israel 's Yossi Beilin recently announced that he will retire from politics altogether .
Israelis and Palestinians need a new vision .
They need a vision that will include a powerful incentive not only to get the train of negotiations back on track , but will also outline a final destination for its journey .
With the lessons of the failed Oslo process before us , it is clear now that a future peace agreement needs to respond to the deepest grievances and darkest fears of both sides .
To find a path forward , we need to go back to the origins of it all .
It was Europe 's violent rejection of Jews in the past that begat modern Zionism and paradoxically contributed to its success .
Once the problem , Europe may now be the solution .
To both encourage and reward a territorial and security agreement between the Israelis and Palestinians , it should offer a clear path for their membership in the European Union .
It could help the parties fashion a settlement .
The prospect of joining the richest union of states on earth is an enormous incentive for reaching a deal .
The union 's organization and values offer the frame for a peace agreement .
In fact , the dual identity of a supranational entity comprised of peaceful national states holds the answer for both sides ' most profound concerns .
For Israelis , EU membership offers physical security and permanent legitimacy .
For Palestinians , membership means a territorial settlement , including a return , of sorts , of their lands through the new joint European source of security and authority over them .
Such an arrangement also holds significant benefits for Europe .
It would contribute to political stability on its eastern and southern flank .
If successful , it might even open a path for EU members to certain North African states , thus limiting the frustrations of millions of would - be immigrants to leave their instable region and go to Europe .
If European capital moves to areas of abundant nearby labor , labor has less reason to migrate to areas of capital abundance .
Perhaps more important , it will expand the geographical borders of Europe , as well as the confines of its current identity , in a manner that will make the conversation with Turkey far easier .
Of course , there will be challenges .
Israelis are haunted by the potential flood of Palestinian refugees from the open borders that Europe espouses ( though the Schengen agreement has been applied differentially ) .
Palestinians are still angered by the result of European colonialism , and Europeans may not want to proceed beyond admitting the nearby Island of Cyprus .
Europe might be hesitate to broker such a deal , but the possibility of their succeeding with a Palestinian settlement , which had eluded the US for 40 years , would be a strong incentive to proceed .
All these are weighty issues , but solvable ones .
The possibility of a day in which the descendants of the ancient foes – Christendom , Islamic civilization and Judaism – come together to resolve the century - long conflict over the Holy Land , finally acknowledging their common ancestor , Abraham , is not far afield .
By using entrance to the European Union as an incentive for peace , Europe would not only free the region from a seriously destabilizing quarrel , but may also finally put to rest a millennia - long rivalry .

ORLANDO , Florida ( CNN ) --
Remains found last week in a wooded area have been identified as belonging to missing Florida toddler Caylee Anthony , authorities said Friday .
Caylee Anthony , 2 , had been missing since June in a case that has received national attention .
The cause of the child 's death will be listed as homicide by undetermined means , said Jan Garavaglia , medical examiner for Orange County , Florida .
She said she does not expect enough additional evidence to surface for that finding to be revised .
The remains were identified through DNA testing , comparing a sample from the remains to a sample known to be from Caylee .
Some of the remains had been sent to the FBI lab in Quantico , Virginia , for testing .
The skull was found December 11 a half - mile from the home of Caylee 's grandparents , where the girl and her mother , Casey Anthony , 22 , lived before the girl disappeared .
She was last seen in June .
Casey Anthony faces charges including first - degree murder in the case .
Watch a Nancy Grace video tribute to Caylee Anthony »
Orange County Sheriff 's Capt .
Angelo Nieves said Thursday that searchers at the site had found " significant skeletal remains " since the discovery of the skull .
A " large percentage " of Caylee 's skeleton has been recovered , Garavaglia said Friday .
The bones showed no sign of trauma before death .
A child 's skeleton has many more bones than an adult 's , she said , and not all are fully developed .
Some of the bones recovered are no larger than a pebble , she said .
Watch the medical examiner discuss her findings »
Garavaglia said the manner of Caylee 's death -- an opinion based on factors including an examination of the body and circumstantial evidence -- was determined to be homicide .
Caylee 's grandmother Cindy Anthony was notified of the test results by the medical examiner 's office , Garavaglia said .
Officials at the Orange County Corrections Department said Casey Anthony was notified of the results by a chaplain about 1:45 p.m. , per jail policy .
One of Casey Anthony 's defense attorneys , Jose Garcia , entered the jail earlier , corrections officials said in a written statement .

" Due to happenstance , not policy , attorney Garcia was not in the presence of the inmate when the notification was made , " the statement said .
" We will not be commenting on the demeanor of inmate Anthony or her reaction to the news . "
The Anthony family 's pastor , Thomas Shane Stutzman of Eastside Baptist Church , arrived at the jail about 2 p.m. but left 19 minutes later because Casey Anthony had refused his visit , as she was meeting with Garcia at the time , jail officials said .
Casey Anthony could face a sentence of life in prison if convicted .
Prosecutors said this month that they will not seek the death penalty against her .
Garavaglia would not disclose specific information regarding the remains other than to say they were completely " skeletonized . "
Toxicology tests on the remains are pending , she said .
" Our number one priority from day one was to locate little Caylee Anthony , " Orange County Sheriff Kevin Beary said .
" We have stayed the course , and we will continue to do so until we have thoroughly completed our investigation into this tragedy . "
The sheriff grew emotional while responding to a reporter 's question about the effect of the case on him personally .
" Having a kid ... I 've raised two girls , goodness gracious , " Beary said , his voice breaking .
" The bottom line is , no child should have to go through this . "
The case has left an " open wound " in the community , he said , but he thinks closure will not come until after trial .
George and Cindy Anthony , Casey Anthony 's parents , did not give up hope that Caylee was still alive until they were notified of the test results , their attorney , Brad Conway , said Friday .
He took no questions but read from a statement .
" They now know that their precious granddaughter is safe and hope that she will serve as the angel that protects thousands of missing children and their families , " he said , adding that the Anthonys want " the same answers as everyone who has been assigned to investigate and prosecute this case " and will be available to authorities .
" As you can imagine , the Anthonys are grieving deeply over this loss , " he said .
" Please respect their privacy and understand they will stand together as a family in order to get through this .
...
This is a tragic moment in the lives of good and honorable people .
Please treat them respectfully so they can grieve with dignity over the loss of this precious child , Caylee Marie Anthony . "
On Thursday , the sheriff 's office said that the utility worker who found the skull December 11 had called police three times -- August 11 , 12 and 13 -- regarding the site where the remains were found .
That utility worker , Roy Kronk , came forward Friday .
Reading from a statement , he said that " back in August of this year , I previously reported to Crimeline and to the sheriff 's communications center that I had spotted something suspicious , a bag in the same area . "
" I have been and will continue to cooperate fully with the ongoing investigation by the sheriff 's office and the FBI , " Kronk said .
He refused to provide details of what he saw at the site where the remains were found .
Watch Kronk talk about his calls to police »
His attorney , David Evans , said Kronk " has no connection whatsoever to this case , has no connection whatsoever to the Anthony family or any of the proceedings that have gone on before .
He is here as a concerned citizen and no more .
Those who have specified to the contrary could not be more wrong . "
Evans said Kronk was asking for privacy for his co-workers , who have been the subject of " intrusive news - gathering activities . "
Some of those colleagues , he said , " protected his privacy and sacrificed their own in doing so . "
Kronk will not be granting interviews at this time , Evans said .
Police said Thursday that in his first call August 11 , the worker reported seeing a gray bag on the side of the road .
A deputy responded , Nieves said , but the worker was no longer at the scene , and the deputy did not see the bag .
On August 12 , the worker called a police crime line .
The call was sent to a detective , who told the meter reader that the area had been searched and cleared by cadaver dogs , police said .
On August 13 , the worker reported finding a bag in a swampy area , and a deputy was dispatched .
The deputy looked at the area but found nothing , thinking the " bag " may have just been trash , Nieves said .
The meter reader revisited the site last week , apparently while working in the area , authorities said , and found the skull .
The site was searched earlier , Beary said , but was flooded at the time .
Nieves said Thursday that police were conducting a thorough review of the tips and their response but emphasized that the meter reader has been cooperative and is not a suspect .
Beary acknowledged Friday that there were questions surrounding those tips but said the only way to find the answers was to conduct an investigation .

Lawyers : Gonzales mishandled classified data Associated Press
Published : Monday September 1 , 2008
Print This Email This By LARA JAKES JORDAN , Associated Press Writer
WASHINGTON - Former Attorney General Alberto Gonzales mishandled highly classified notes about a secret counterterror program , but not on purpose , according to a memo by his legal team .
The memo , obtained by The Associated Press , acknowledges that Gonzales improperly stored notes about the program and might have taken them home at one point .
Removing secret documents from specially secured rooms violates government policy .
Gonzales ' lawyers wrote in their memo that there is no evidence the security breach resulted in secret information being viewed or otherwise exposed to anyone who was not authorized .
The classified notes focus on a March 2004 meeting with congressional leaders about a national security program that was about to expire .
Efforts to renew the program sparked an intense Bush administration debate that played out at the hospital bedside of then - Attorney General John Ashcroft .
The memo was prepared by Gonzales ' legal team as a response to a report being finalized by the Justice Department 's inspector general .
The report , which could be released as early as Tuesday , is expected to criticize Gonzales ' handling of sensitive compartmentalized information , or SCI , according to the memo .
Gonzales agrees with inspector general 's findings that his handling of notes and other SCI documents " was not consistent with the department 's regulations governing the proper storage and handling of information classified as SCI , " concluded the legal team 's memo .
" Judge Gonzales regrets this lapse . "
Sensitive compartmentalized information is one of the highest and most sensitive levels of classified documents and is deemed top secret .
It usually relates to national security cases .
Gonzales ' lawyers acknowledge that he kept the notes in a safe in his fifth - floor office at the Justice Department , along with a small number of other highly classified papers , instead of in the special facilities accessible only by certain people with top secret security clearances .
He also may have taken the notes home at one point in 2005 as he was moving out of the White House counsel 's office , where he served until he was sworn in as attorney general at the start of President Bush 's second term , the memo says .
The inspector general 's report will be the latest in a series taking Gonzales to task for his management of the Justice Department .
He resigned under fire in September 2007 .
At least two more reports , including one looking at Gonzales ' role in the ouster of nine U.S. attorneys , are expected in coming months .
It also could re-ignite a simmering controversy about Gonzales ' role in urging an ailing Ashcroft to continue a national security program the Justice Department had deemed illegal .
Preparing for the criticism , Gonzales ' legal team fired back with the 12 - page memo and a three - page addendum accompanying it .
The documents indicate the attorney general was merely forgetful or unaware of the proper way to handle the top secret papers .
Both documents were written by Gonzales attorney George Terwilliger , who served as the Justice Department 's No. 2 official between 1991 and 1992 .
The classified notes , according to the lawyers ' memo , focus on a March 10 , 2004 emergency meeting in the White House Situation Room with Gonzales , other high - ranking Bush administration officials and the eight House and Senate leaders and intelligence committee chairmen .
It was held to brief the bipartisan group of lawmakers about a sensitive counterterror program that was set to expire the next day .
Then - Deputy Attorney General James Comey , who was running the Justice Department while Ashcroft was hospitalized for pancreatitis , had refused to sign off on the program because he questioned whether parts of it were legal .
At the Situation Room meeting , administration officials asked the congressional leaders to consider creating legislation to let the program continue , according to the memo .
The exact nature of the counterterror program is not clear .
FBI Director Robert Mueller has said it was a terrorist surveillance program that allowed the government to conduct electronic surveillance on people in the United States without court oversight until 2007 .
Gonzales has denied that and maintains it involved other intelligence activities .
Gonzales ' classified notes themselves remain classified and have not been released .
Gonzales took the notes of the meeting at President Bush 's request , and kept them in a safe in his White House counsel 's office , which is a secure SCI facility , according to his lawyers .
Once he moved to the Justice Department , however , the memo says Gonzales kept the notes in a safe a few steps away from his desk in the attorney general 's office  which is not considered a secure facility for SCI data .
Gonzales ' " best recollection is that he always placed the notes in the most secure place over which he had immediate personal control , " the memo states .
He apparently was advised that his office safe was not proper storage for the notes or other highly classified material , the memo shows .
However , there 's no proof that Gonzales intentionally defied that guidance , the memo states , arguing he acted " without conscious disregard " for the rules .
The memo also takes a shot a Comey , who in Senate testimony last year described the hospital visit as an attempt by Gonzales and then - White House Chief of Staff Andy Card " to take advantage of a very sick man . "
In the memo , Terwilliger calls such criticism " demonstrably hyper - inflated rhetoric without basis in fact . "
He says during the hospital visit Comey was " seeking to interpose himself between the president and a high - level official communication to his attorney general on a vital matter of national security . "
This gracious nod to McCain cannot hurt Obama , of course , and so it 's not noble in any objective way , but it 's presidential behavior and it 's gracious .
People do n't give Obama credit enough for staying remarkably civil during onslaughts from first the Clinton campaign and now the Rove machine .
In this climate , the grace is actually lethally effective politics as well :
“ I want to acknowledge that Senator McCain tried to tone down the rhetoric in his town hall meeting yesterday , ” Mr. Obama said , speaking at an early - morning rally in North Philadelphia .
“ I appreciated his reminder that we can disagree while still being respectful of each other .
I ’ve said it before , and I ’ll say it again  Senator McCain has served this country with honor , and he deserves our thanks for that . ”
As I watched last week , as McCain constructed yet another a massive effort to detonate Obama , I could n't help but think of this again .
It sums up the entire fall campaign in a way :

The Associated Press Indian forces assault besieged Jewish center after 143 die MUMBAI , India ( AP )  Commandos ended a siege of the luxury Oberoi hotel on Friday while other forces rappelled from helicopters to storm a besieged Jewish center , two days after a chain of militant attacks across India 's financial center left at least 143 people dead and the city in panic .
While explosions and gunfire continued intermittently at the elegant Taj Mahal hotel Friday afternoon , officials said commandos had killed two gunmen inside the nearby Oberoi hotel and ended the attack there .
" The hotel is under our control , " J.K. Dutt , director general of India 's elite National Security Guard commando unit , told reporters , adding that 24 bodies had been found .
Dozens of people — including a man clutching a baby — had been evacuated from Oberoi earlier Friday .

The airborne assault on the center run by the ultra- orthodox Jewish outreach group Chabad Lubavitch was punctuated by gunshots and explosions — and at one point an intense exchange of fire that lasted several minutes — as forces cleared it floor by floor , according to an Associated Press reporter at the scene .
By Friday afternoon , the commandos had control of the top two floors .
One camouflaged commando came out with a bandage on his forehead , while soldiers fired smoke grenades into the building and a steady stream of gunfire reverberated across narrow alleys .
Israel 's ambassador to India , Mark Sofer , said they believed there were up to nine hostages inside .
Their fate was not clear .
Sofer denied reports that Israeli commandos were taking part in the operation .
More than 143 people were killed and 288 injured when suspected Islamic militants attacked 10 sites in Mumbai starting Wednesday evening .
Security officials said their operations were almost over .
" It 's just a matter of a few hours that we 'll be able to wrap up things , " Lt. Gen. N. Thamburaj told reporters Friday morning .
The group rescued from the Oberoi , many holding passports , included at least two Americans , a Briton , two Japanese nationals and several Indians .
Some carried luggage with Canadian flags .
One man in a chef 's uniform was holding a small baby .
About 20 airline crewmembers were freed , including staff from Lufthansa and Air France .
" I 'm going home , I 'm going to see my wife , " said Mark Abell , with a huge smile on his face after emerging from the hotel .
Abell , from Britain , had locked himself in his room during the siege .
" These people here have been fantastic , the Indian authorities , the hotel staff .
I think they are a great advertisement for their country , " he said as security officials pulled him away .
The well - coordinated strikes by small bands of gunmen starting Wednesday night left the city shell - shocked .
Late Thursday , after about 400 people had been brought out of the Taj hotel , officials said it had been cleared of gunmen .
But Friday morning , army commanders said that while three gunmen had been killed , two to three more were still inside with about 15 civilians .
A few hours after that , Thamburaj , the security official , said at least one gunman was still alive inside the hotel and had cut of electricity on the floor where he was hiding .
Shortly after that announcement , another round of explosions and gunfire were heard coming from the hotel .
Prime Minister Manmohan Singh blamed " external forces " for the violence — a phrase sometimes used to refer to Pakistani militants , whom Indian authorities often blame for attacks .
On Friday , India 's foreign minister ratcheted up the accusations over the attacks .
" According to preliminary information , some elements in Pakistan are responsible for Mumbai terror attacks , " Pranab Mukherjee told reporters in the western city of Jodhpur .
" Proof can not be disclosed at this time , " he said , adding that Pakistan had assured New Delhi it would not allow its territory to be used for attacks against India .
India has long accused Islamabad of allowing militant Muslim groups , particularly those fighting in the disputed Himalayan region of Kashmir , to train and take shelter in Pakistan .
Mukherjee 's carefully phrased comments appeared to indicate he was accusing Pakistan - based groups of staging the attack , and not Pakistan itself .
Islamabad has long denied those accusations .
Earlier Friday , Pakistan 's Defense Minister Ahmed Mukhtar , in Islamabad , denied involvement by his country : " I will say in very categoric terms that Pakistan is not involved in these gory incidents . "
The gunmen were well - prepared , apparently scouting some targets ahead of time and carrying large bags of almonds to keep up their energy .
" It 's obvious they were trained somewhere ...
Not everyone can handle the AK series of weapons or throw grenades like that , " an unidentified member of India 's Marine Commando unit told reporters , his face wrapped in a black mask .
He said the men were " very determined and remorseless . "
A U.S. investigative team was heading to Mumbai , a State Department official said Thursday evening , speaking on condition of anonymity because the U.S. and Indian governments were still working out final details .
India has been shaken repeatedly by terror attacks blamed on Muslim militants in recent years , but most were bombings striking crowded places : markets , street corners , parks .
Mumbai — one of the most populated cities in the world with some 18 million people — was hit by a series of bombings in July 2006 that killed 187 people .
These attacks were more sophisticated — and more brazen .
They began at about 9:20 p.m. with shooters spraying gunfire across the Chhatrapati Shivaji railroad station , one of the world 's busiest terminals .
For the next two hours , there was an attack roughly every 15 minutes — the Jewish center , a tourist restaurant , one hotel , then another , and two attacks on hospitals .
There were 10 targets in all .
Indian media showed pictures of rubber dinghies found by the city 's shoreline , apparently used by the gunmen to reach the area .
Both the luxury hotels targeted overlook the Arabian Sea .
Analysts around the world were debating whether the gunmen could have been tied to — or inspired by — al - Qaeda .
A previously unknown group calling itself the Deccan Mujahideen claimed responsibility in e-mails to several media outlets .
The Deccan is a region in southern India that was traditionally ruled by Muslim kings .
Survivors of the hotel attacks said the gunmen had specifically targeted Britons and Americans , though most of the dead seemed to be Indians and whoever else was caught in the random gunfire .
One of the gunmen " stopped once and asked , ' Where are you from ?
Any British or American ?
Show your ID , " Alex Chamberlain , a British citizen dining at the Oberoi , told reporters .
Among the dead were two Australians and a Japanese , said the state home ministry .
An Italian , a Briton and a German were also killed , according to their foreign ministries .
The United States , Pakistan and other countries condemned the attacks .
Relations between Hindus , who make up more than 80 % of India 's 1 billion population , and Muslims , who make up about 14 % , have sporadically erupted into bouts of sectarian violence since British - ruled India was split into independent India and Pakistan in 1947 .

The War Party loves generals : John McCain mentions Gen. David Petraeus at the drop of a hat , citing him as the final military and moral authority when it comes to U.S. strategy in the Middle East .
The reverent tone is supposed to indicate that no further argument is necessary .
Military figures are , for the neoconservatives , an essential adjunct to their favorite narrative , which defers to military leaders in a way the Founding Fathers would have found horrifying  they who wondered aloud whether the young republic ought to have a standing army at all , lest it give rise to a permanent military caste that would wield undue influence .
That never happened .
Although generals have laid claim to the presidency often , the military as a separate political subclass never gained either ascendancy or undue influence , except insofar as individual military figures went into politics .
The tradition of keeping the military as a body out of politics is long and praiseworthy , and it has happily been largely observed  except , of course , by the neocons , who tread on tradition as a matter of high principle and have made a demigod out of Petraeus , a role he seems to revel in .
Yet Petraeus is the exception that proves the rule .
The U.S. officer corps was solidly against our Iraqi adventure , and they are horrified at the prospect of a repeat  on a much larger scale , of course  in Iran .
They are , like the exemplar of the species , Colin Powell , reluctant interventionists , at best , and generally considered unreliable and even dangerous by the War Party .
Others , like the late Gen. William E. Odom , are more fearless in expressing their anti-interventionist instincts , and if we go back in American history , we come across other unlikely peaceniks in uniform .
The unlikeliest was no doubt Gen. Douglas MacArthur , the hero of the 1950s " isolationists " ( i.e. , the good guys ) , who wanted to nominate him for president on a third - party ticket opposing another general by the name of Eisenhower .
MacArthur was , however , even more of a reluctant politician and declined to run for public office , in spite of efforts by conservative backers of Sen. Robert A . Taft to put his name on the ballot .
This was perhaps due , in part , to such sentiments as the following :
" It is a part of the general pattern of misguided policy that our country is now geared to an arms economy which was bred in an artificially induced psychosis of war hysteria and nurtured upon an incessant propaganda of fear .
While such an economy may produce a sense of seeming prosperity for the moment , it rests on an illusionary foundation of complete unreliability and renders among our political leaders almost a greater fear of peace than is their fear of war . ”
These words were uttered at the dawn of the Cold War , when it was nothing less than ideological heresy , on the Left as well as the Right , to question either the threat emanating from the East or the onward - and - upward optimism of the postwar American high .
" The propaganda of fear " was doing its work , and , besides , the people were narcotized by a false prosperity .
The perpetual motion machine of the arms industry was covering up inherent weaknesses in the American economy , providing a cosmetic solution to the problems unleashed by inflationary policies and the gradual militarization of the productive forces .
This policy was the perfect solution for politicians who stood at the helm of the USS Empire as it made its maiden voyage and ventured out beyond the far horizon .
In the early Fifties , America stood at the threshold of its imperial destiny , and one writer , Garet Garrett by name , not only saw it coming [ . pdf ] , but also saw how it would end .
His remarkably concise and pungent commentary on the rise of empire , in a pamphlet of the same name , is still the best single statement on how and why we lost our old republic .
In it , he remarks ,
" The bald interpretation of General MacArthur ’s words is this .
War becomes an instrument of domestic policy .
Among the control mechanisms on the government ’s panel board now is a dial marked War .
It may be set to increase or decrease the tempo of military expenditures , as the planners decide that what the economy needs is a little more inflation or a little less  but of course never any deflation .
And whereas it was foreseen that when Executive Government is resolved to control the economy it will come to have a vested interest in the power of inflation , so now we may perceive that it will come also to have a kind of proprietary interest in the institution of perpetual war . "
Let there be no doubt as to our rulers ’ response to the stinging repudiation of the bailout , which was supposed to save their necks and those of their cronies and backers .
On their panel board is a dial marked War , and it is conveniently within reach .
When the news breaks , will the people once again inundate congressional phone lines and bring down the government ’s
Web site with the full weight of their fury ?
If so , their protests will be misdirected : they should instead be aimed at the White House , which alone has the power to go to war without congressional consent .
The rule of law would indicate otherwise , but ever since they let Truman get away with it in 1950 , when he sent U.S. troops to Korea without bothering to consult with the people ’s elected representatives , that power has remained the exclusive prerogative of the executive branch .
Because the precedent went unchallenged and was barely even noticed  except by a few eccentrics , like Garrett , who remembered that archaic old parchment known as the Constitution  today a president can unilaterally decide to " save " mankind , his political career , and jump - start the economy , all in one fell swoop .
All he has to do is issue the order , and instantly the country is at war .
War , like its progenitor , inflation , is a narcotic that causes us to forget the real problems and their causes and permits all sorts of actions that would not be considered normal under any other circumstances .
It is a perfect holiday from the rule of law and is fully taken advantage of by our lawless politicians , who seize on it as a pretext for anything and everything [ . pdf ] .
It emphasizes the worst excesses and encourages their fullest development , so that human behavior is distorted beyond all recognition .
Human reason is not merely violated , but inverted : we enter a Bizarro World , where those who made bad investments are bailed out  rewarded  while ordinary folk who live by the rules and pay their bills are taxed to make up the difference .
As the wheels of commerce screech to a grinding halt and the empire of lies  funny money , phony " weapons of mass destruction , " and bogus threats to our national security emanating from every corner of the globe  begins to unravel , get ready for the alarm to go off signifying the start of yet another war scare .
It ’s a great diversion from economic troubles , albeit an expensive one  but , as the proposed banksters ’ bailout showed , no expense is to be spared in saving their necks .

British Pound Crashes to New Lows as Economic Crisis Deepens
The foreign exchange markets are witnessing heavy and sustained selling of sterling which continues following the Bank of England 's inflation report and statement on the economy .
The British Pound has fallen below £ / $ 1.50 to currently stand at 149.12 , and to a new low against the Euro of 119 .
The fast developing sterling crisis illustrates the systemic failure of the Bank of England and Labour Government to manage both the economy and the credit crisis and marks another marker following last weeks panic interest rate cut of 1.5 % , as the government took control of monetary policy back from the Bank of England and effectively ordered the Bank to cut interest rates by 1.5 % despite inflation hitting 5.2 % .
Mervyn King through a number of TV interviews during the day set out to to reassure the financial markets as to why the Bank of England cut interest rates by a near unprecedented 1.5 % last week instead of during the previous 6 months and why the Banks outlook has changed so much since the August report by stating .
“ We 've reacted because the world has changed .
The way we go about setting interest rates has n't changed .
I think it 's worked well and I think it will continue to work well , ”
Unfortunately the more Mr King spoke the more investors dumped sterling as it became increasingly apparent that those at the helm of the UK economy are barely able to comprehend what is going on in the present let alone to attempt to competently manage and accurately forecast as to what is to transpire and what needs to be done .
The governments response to the credit crisis and economic meltdown has been :
1 . The £ 500 billion bank bailout package comprising £ 50 billion equity stakes , £ 250 billion loan guarantees and a further £ 200 billion in short - term liquidity injections .
2. Panic interest rate cuts that have seen rates cut by 2 % in less than a month , falling from 5 % to 3 % .
These are panic measures to a ) prevent an deflationary economic depression and b ) boost the economy in advance of the June 2010 general election deadline .
Having first written about the perfect economic storm that Britain is now facing over 7 months ago , that perfect storm is now coming to pass as the currency crashes in the wake of unrestrained government borrowing , that sows the seeds for many years of stagflation following the impact of the asset price deflation .
The Impact of the Crash in Sterling
Britain 's living abroad reliant on UK earnings i.e. wages , interest or benefits paid in sterling are witnessing a fall in disposal income as the devaluation hits them directly in their pockets as the cost of living in sterling terms soars .

UK PLC loss of asset values -
In addition to the headline falls of 16 % for house prices and 40 % for the stock market , investors should also bare in mind the 22 % drop in terms of euro and 29 % in dollars which translates into a housing market crash to date of 38 % to 55 % which has ALREADY occurred , and a stock market crash of 62 % to 69 % .
This is highly deflationary and hence the Bank of England is now , belatedly worrying about deflation through its panic interest rate cuts .

The fall in sterling is highly inflationary and will result in forward inflation after the current deflationary bust .
I.e. the UK economy is presently falling off the edge of a cliff , however once GDP stops plunging ( by late next year ) , then inflation will start to make a return as the price of imported materials , goods and services soars .

Mervyn King points to the fall in sterling as a boost for exports , What exports ?
and who will we sell to during a recession ?
The manufacturing sector is has shrunk to less than 17 % of the UK economy and of that exports are less than 5 % , whilst a 25 % crash in sterling ' should ' boost exports , however the benefit of which will be far less than the Bank of England suggests .

Tourist Industry - Theoretically sterling 's fall should boost Britain 's domestic tourism industry as foreigners flood into Britain to benefit from the sharply lower exchange rate .
However with much of the developed world also going into recession it remains to be seen whether debt ridden consumers will be able to afford the luxury trips to the UK , especially as Germany , Europe 's biggest economy has just declared itself to be officially in recession following today 's release of worse than expected economic data that shows 3rd quarter GDP contracted by 0.5 % ( consensus 0.1 % ) which follows second quarter contraction of 0.4 % , and where Germany goes the rest of Europe will soon follow .

Boosts Competitiveness -
The key impact is that a fall in sterling should lift the price of imports and therefore boost the ability of British companies to compete in the short - term , however again there exists the problem of the lack of UK manufacturing , as well as the risk of foreign suppliers discounting and dumping stock onto the UK market as their own economies buckle under the weight of the economic crisis .
This was illustrated this week following China 's $ 600 billion economic stimulus package which effectively aims to subsidise Chinese exports .

Interest Rates , Inflation and Deflation
The Bank is now forecasting inflation will fall sharply during 2009 to below 1 % CPI with the RPI measure going negative and pushing the economy into deflation during the year .
However as we have witnessed with the perpetual 2 % inflation forecasts in 2 years time , the Bank of England forecasts are consistently wrong .
Similarly the Bank of England is now forecasting that the UK economy will contract sharply in 2009 by 2 % , this is against the forecast made barely 3 months ago that stated that UK 2009 GDP growth would target 1 % .
It remains to be seen the degree to which these forecasts will also be revised further in 3 months time and during 2009 as has been the repeated tendency throughout 2008 .
My existing forecast for UK interest rates to fall from 5 % to 3.25 % has now been fulfilled ahead of schedule following the Bank of England 's panic interest rate cuts .
Clearly with deflation on the horizon and an economic bust worse than the 1990's recession it does not take a genius to work out that UK interest rates are heading still lower , we will probably see interest rates of 2 % or even lower by mid 2009 , especially if negative RPI transpires as the next section elaborates upon .
Deflation - Negative RPI and Government Debt
The Bank is forecasting negative RPI next year , the importance of this is the fact that many pay deals and state benefits are linked to the RPI measure therefore a negative RPI implies that benefit payments will be cut next year , it will be interesting to see the public response , as it implies the UK is in store for civil unrest and worker militancy , especially amongst the public sector .
Therefore in advance of 2010 Election the Labour government will increasingly cave in to public sector worker demands and push borrow far more than the current estimates and forecasts .
Deflation has not been seen since the 1930's Great Depression .
The effect of deflation are worse than inflation as a deflationary spiral brings investment to a halt and the value of debts increases in real terms as wages contract , leaving borrowers worse off than people have experienced during the recessions of the post war period .
Long before the current crisis broke , way back in April 2008 , I was forecasting that the UK would soon bust through the 40 % GDP golden rule and lift borrowing to over 60 % by the end of 2009 which would send sterling crashing .
Following the £ 500 bank bailout I raised official UK debt surging to over 100 % of GDP with similarly severe impact on sterling that had by then started to become apparent as sterling crashed through £ / $ 1.80 down to £ / $ 1.70 .
However it does look increasingly likely that Gordon Brown has now adopted the policy of bankrupting Britain in an attempt to win the next Election , which sets the scene for many years of economic stagflation to follow deflation .
Currency Trends
Sterling has been heavily oversold for over 2 weeks , however despite this sterling continues to home in on the longer - term target of £ / $ 1.37 which represents critical multi- decade support , below which would be parity to the US Dollar .
Chart courtesy of stockcharts.com
Sterling 's Break below 122.50 against the Euro to a new Euro all time low signals that the currency has entered a new downtrend that looks set to continue well into 2009 .
Soaring Unemployment Heading for 2 million for Christmas
The latest UK unemployment data released today showed unemployment soared by 140,000 in the 3 months to August , up 33,000 on the month and the number officially claiming unemployment benefit rose by 25,600 in October to 970,000 .
This was followed by the Bank of England 's report on inflation and the economy that stated that UK is heading for 2 % GDP contraction for 2009 which is significant change to the existing forecasts of growth for 2009 .
With a three month lag in published data , the actual unemployment rate looks set to pass above 2 million by Christmas to be released in March 2009 .
My UK unemployment forecast as the below graphs illustrate is for unemployment to rise to just above 2.5 million by April 2010 , however a 2 % GDP contraction forecast by the Bank of England for 2009 now implies that the UK is heading for a severe recession which implies UK unemployment could pass above 3,000,000 during the recession , this despite the fact that he unemployment statistics are heavily manipulated to under report true unemployment which would be some 6 million higher if all those of working age were included in the data .
The real number of unemployed in the UK now stands at 7.9 million , up 15,000 in the three months to August .
UK House Price Crash Continues
The most recent house price data released by the Halifax shows that UK house prices have fallen by more than 16 % from the peak of August 2007 and October 2008 .
The crash in both US and UK housing markets over the last 12 months was increasingly followed in September by the bankrupt banks collapsing one by one like a chain of dominos with governments rushing to their rescue during September and early October to the tune of unheard of amounts of tax payers money that now runs to collectively over $ 3 trillion .
This triggered the near panic co-ordinated interest rate cuts in October of 0.5 % .
The whole trend for the house price crash has been forecast well in advance of events , right from the very peak to the initial down - trend path amidst prevailing mainstream denial that house prices were actually falling as recent as of March of this year , and right up to the most recent data that fulfills the original forecast of a 15 % fall in average UK house prices as projected in August 2007 .
The current house price forecast is now complete , therefore I now intend on working exclusively towards completing in - depth analysis geared towards generating the next accurate forecast for UK house prices to cover the next 2 to 3 years , which despite the now pervading bearishness may still have a surprise or two in store .

17 Nov 08 , 00:39 Great stuff
You are absolutely spot on about stagflation post -2009 .
It is now inevitable .
Britain 's sick again .
I ’m convinced the only reason that David Milch ’s extraordinary deconstruction of the Western , Deadwood , is n’t regularly on the shortlist of Greatest Television Shows Of All - Time is that it never got a chance to end properly .
After three seasons , David Milch and / or HBO cut it short , promising those of us who loved its multi-dimensional characters , intertwining plotlines and poetically profane use of language that there would be a pair of two - hour movies to wrap things up .
Yeah , surrrrrrrrrrre .
This was one of those situations where I really wanted to believe that it was going to happen , but knew in my heart of hearts that it was total and utter bullshit .
Especially when that bullshit became manifest in the form of John From Cincinnati , which started out either incredibly slow , and swiftly became unwatchable , or started out unwatchable and swiftly became incredibly slow .
1
Look , I do n’t need “ Samwise seeing Frodo off at the Grey Havens ” endings for everything — I was perfectly happy with last scene of The Sopranos — but in the case of Deadwood , they were still adding plotlines and characters in the last couple of episodes ( what was up with those traveling actors ? ) .
It seemed like we were just beginning to find out who Al Swearengen , Seth Bullock , et al. really were , and while I doubted that they could give us enough in four hours , it was still better than none .
Well , in any event , fellow Deadwood fans , it looks like we have our conclusion .
Not so much with another season , or the movies , but rather as an extra on the upcoming Deadwood : The Complete Series box set .
The 19 - disc , 36 hour “ Deadwood : The Complete Series ” boxed set , with a suggested retail price of $ 179.97 , will be released by HBO Home Entertainment Dec. 9 .
Among its two hours of bonus materials is something called “ The Meaning of Endings ” described as “ creator David Milch ’s discussion on what would have happened had the ‘ Deadwood ’ series continued ” in an HBO Home Entertainment press release Tuesday .
So , we ’ve gone from the two hour movies to “ a discussion . ”
By David Milch , whom , if you ’ve ever watched the extras on the individual season box sets , is stone batshit crazy at worst and only able to have discussions with aliens on a higher intellectual plane that the rest of us at best .
And notice that it ’s called “ The Meaning of Endings , ” which means that it will be a philosophical discussion on the nature of how things end , but do n’t ever really end because the universe finds a way to carry on and really , whatever endings we believe that these characters should have are the endings that they do have , really .
Unless , of course , they do n’t .
Oh , and I only get to see this if I pay $ 180 for the full series set — despite the fact that I ’ve already paid at least $ 100 for HBO during the initial runs and at least $ 180 total for the individual season box sets after that .
So , Deadwood fans , the only conclusion I can see is : “ screw you ! ”
Cocksuckers !
In the end , it makes me more sad than anything : there is a part of me that knows that Deadwood could have ended up as perhaps the greatest thing ever created for TV , better than The Sopranos , better than The Wire , better than anything you could possibly name , but in the end , they just packed up their six - guns and slunk out of town .
Firstly , yayy , thanks Gizmodo : I can now post comments from my iPhone when I should be working .
Secondly , anybody ever see how fast 3.1 would run on a much more modern system ?
like a 300MHz Pentium with huge memory ?
Like 32 MB ?
Wow .
Kinda like we 'll be saying about Vista on a current machine in 5 years or so ?
Simplify .
That , at its heart , is the purpose of XBRL — extensible business reporting language .
XBRL employs a common set of tags for financial terms , making reports more searchable and transparent to everyone who uses them .
Data Facilitator
“ XBRL is a technical standard for how information for business reporting is initially created , processed , distributed and ultimately used , ” Michelle Savage , vice president of communications for XBRL US , told LinuxInsider .
Designed to provide information to investors and anyone else researching financial markets , it is an open standard that is operating system agnostic .
XBRL ( based on XML , or extensible markup language ) is used for bank call reports and data transfers from one government agency to another .
“ It takes one piece of information and packages data around it — gives it human and computer - readable label , gives it a definition , ” Savage noted .
For example , in the case of earnings per share , “ the human - readable label is fully diluted EPS , ” she said .
“ It packages that information and also tells the user what time period is covered . ”
The U.S. government has gotten involved , endorsing the use of XBRL .
Earlier this year , the Securities and Exchange Commission proposed rules that would mandate its adoption .
“ XML - based reporting for public companies ’ financial statements will make information more accurate , timely and actionable , because descriptive information is embedded in every datapoint , ” Mark Bolgiano , president and chief executive officer of XBRL US , told LinuxInsider .
“ Ultimately , better information results in greater transparency — and that ’s what XBRL is all about . ”
XBRL Skeptics
Not everyone is completely on board with XBRL , however .
As currently envisioned , the system has accuracy issues , according to Jeff Mahoney , general counsel at the Council for Institutional Investors .
“ We ’re not opposed to the concept so much , but some of the elements of the proposal raised concerns with us , ” Mahoney told LinuxInsider .
“ We ’re all for facilitating the distribution of financial information to investors in other markets and using electronic means to do so .
We ’re certainly supportive of technology to help investors sort financial information . ”
Two aspects of the XBRL proposal have sparked debate :
“ One is the assurance that the information is being properly tagged , ” Mahoney said .
“ There was a lot of controversy about whether auditors should give some assurance on the tagging . ”
The SEC proposal , Mahoney said , does not provide any type of assurance other than liability - related provisions .
There needs to be “ some effective way to ensure that the data tags are appropriately applied , ” he stressed .
“ I think it ’s fair to say that it ’s not clear there ’s any insurance that that will be taken care of . ”
There are also concerns about auditing information conveyed using XBRL and legal protections for users of the data , said Mahoney .
“ In a nutshell , if you have an error in the XBRL data , you have greater legal protection than if you have an error in the data in your traditional financial statements , ” he explained .
“ So , then you ask why would there be a distinction between the two ?
The SEC ’s answer is , basically , they ’re giving greater protection for this XBRL data because , in my mind , they want to encourage people to use it . ”
The move to XBRL is driven more by the interests of data issuers than by the concerns of investors and other users of financial information , Mahoney said .
For one thing , it lowers issuers ’ costs , he pointed out .
However , “ if there ’s less assurance of greater legal protection , there ’s greater risk that this information is not going to be useful to investors — in other words , junk in , junk out . ”
Investors Benefit ?
Investors will benefit from the technology , insisted Savage .
“ It improves the clarity of [ financial ] information so the end user understands it .
It makes it computer - readable , so large volumes of information can be consumed more readily . ”
The new language also saves time , she said .
“ With a few keystrokes , [ XBRL data ] can be drawn into a software program that allows you to see that information faster — and it ’s also more clear , because the definitions tell you what you ’re working with . ”
It may prove to be a Herculean task for some companies to institute XBRL as the standard in financial communications — but the change ultimately will be positive , according to Rob Enderle , principal analyst with the Enderle Group .
“ The goal here is to make it easier for investors and financial analysts to get to critical information and make a more accurate assessment of the company , ” Enderle told LinuxInsider .
“ The problem is that financial organizations tend to be slow to change and generally do n’t have the headroom for much training , which means accurate adoption of a tool like this tends to take a long period of time . ”
XBRL ’s biggest obstacle may be human nature .
“ We , as a race , do n’t take to change all that readily , ” Enderle said .
“ In the end , once adopted , it should reduce the time it takes to do good financial analysis and improve the accuracy . ”
( CNN ) -- Polaroid Corp. announced it was filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection .
The Minnesota - based company said it is taking itself and its subsidiaries into bankruptcy in order to restructure its finances .
" Our operations are strong and during this process Polaroid will ship products to our retail partners , work with our suppliers and contract manufacturers to fulfill retailer demand ... " said Mary L. Jeffries , Polaroid chief executive officer .
" We expect to continue our operations as normal during the reorganization and are planning for new product launches in 2009 , " she said , adding that employees should receive their paychecks without interruption .
The bankruptcy filing was necessary because of an investigation of its parent company , Petters Group Worldwide , which has owned Polaroid since 2005 , the Polaroid statement said .
The group 's founder and other employees are under investigation for fraud .
Polaroid said the investigation does not involve its leadership team .
Taking a long - term view is n't easy nowadays .
Even the recent past seems blurry at times .
Google 's just seven years old , but it 's hard to imagine life before instant search .
Broadband has been widely available for only a few years , but already dialup internet seems to high - speed users like a throwback to the Neanderthal era .
In an age of rapid - fire change , contemplating the future is downright headache - inducing .
Investors who plan strategies over multiple years or decades recognize that today 's must - have technologies are probably destined for tomorrow 's waste bins .
But there 's no scientific method for identifying their replacements .
That 's why this week 's column includes input from an assortment of experts who share their views on top contenders to be the technologies of tomorrow .
Next time around , we 'll see what future - thinking folks predict about the opposite question :
Which heavily touted technologies are destined to flop ?
For now , let 's take a look at the positive trends futurists see on the horizon .
Simplicity :
Over the past couple of decades , gadget makers have toiled ceaselessly to add functionality .
As a result , your cell phone can now play games , do math and sound off like a barking dog when your ex calls .
Your digital camera can shoot extremely poor - quality video .
And nearly every device you own with a screen also contains a clock .
The problem , says Ian Pearson , futurist in residence at British Telecommunications , is that most people buy a device for a particular purpose .
They neither want nor care about all the extra capabilities .
" We 've done 20 years of adding functionality , and 99 percent of that functionality is n't needed , " Pearson said .
" There will be an enormous market over the next several years for really simple stuff . "
For investors , there are few obvious examples of simplicity - minded gadget makers .
Apple Computer 's iPod is often cited as a model of the simpler - is - better ethos .
With shares selling for close to their all - time high , however , Apple ( AAPL ) is a pricey pick .
Royal Philips Electronics ( PHG ) has an internal strategy effort called " simplicity - led design . "
But many of the products incorporating the simplicity concept wo n't be on the market for several years .
Pearson says the simplicity principle can apply to software as well .
It 's something , he says , that he'd like Microsoft to consider before adding yet another feature to its next version of Word .
Mobile socialization : Already our cell phones and PDAs work well at both contributing to our social lives ( i.e. , getting in touch with friends ) and spoiling them ( i.e. , meeting friends but ignoring them to answer cell - phone calls ) .
But according to futurists , we 've only scratched the surface of figuring out how our portable communications devices can be of service .
What 's in store ?
How about mapping programs that show us whether anyone we 'd like to see is nearby .
Or a mobile reference modeled on Wikipedia that can tell us if the restaurant on the corner is any good .
Perhaps a few voice - recognition applications that actually work .
While we 're at it , why not throw in programs to protect our privacy by limiting who has access to information about where we are ?
" Those sorts of things can easily be built into mobile devices , " said Pearson .
Speech - recognition technology will be instrumental in enabling new mobile services , said Ronald Gruia , author of the blog Technology Futurist and emerging communications program leader at consulting firm Frost & Sullivan .
In recent years , speech software developers , in particular Nuance Communications , which until recently went by the name ScanSoft ( SSFT ) , have gotten much better at what they do .
Gruia believes it 's only a matter of time before speech - enabled mobile apps for tasks like composing e-mail while driving can be commonplace .
R.I.P. combustion engine ? :
Gas - guzzling cars and trucks are such an integral part of the modern landscape that we practically take them for granted .
When you think about it , that 's a pretty amazing feat , considering the noise and smog they generate .
At some point , escalating fuel prices , surging global oil demand and a dwindling supply of easily accessible crude will take their toll , however .
That point is closer than ever , says Jennifer Jarratt , a partner at Leading Futurists .
" There 's a wide - open space there for disruptive technology in the hybrid car market , " she said , noting that established automakers are still reluctant to consider life without the combustion engine .
The World Future Society estimates in its annual list of top predictions for the future that only 40 years ' worth of oil is left in the ground , " so action is needed now to plan for a smooth transition to alternatives – notably hydrogen . "
Investing in alternative fuels , however , is a tricky business .
Options are limited , and for the most part , quite risky .
Going green : Futurists have been warning about our over - consumptive , pollution - and nonbiodegradable - waste - generating ways for decades .
Lately , those warnings are getting more strident .
" I have actually told my own investment adviser : Do n't put my money in energy companies that are n't investing in alternatives , " said Marsha Rhea , senior futurist at the Institute for Alternative Futures .
Many futurists predict that growth in the market for renewable energy sources will be particularly strong .
The World Future Society , for one , forecasts that offshore wind farms will grow into a $ 3 billion - a- year industry by 2008 .
Andy Hines , a lecturer in futures studies at the University of Houston - Clear Lake , also envisions growing demand for information - sensing devices that can reduce energy consumption .
IT revolution of 2006 : Even futurists sometimes prefer the short - term horizon .
Pearson , for one , expects 2006 will bring one of the more fascinating inflection points in the evolution of digital technology .
" We see the convergence of a whole stack of IT trends , " said Pearson , who 's gearing up for what he calls " the 2006 IT explosion . "
Basically , the explosion will consist of a number of technologies : better screens , improved location technology and highly sophisticated gaming consoles that provide a hub for home entertainment .
Pearson expects 2006 to be a good year for gadget sellers .
The broad selection of fancy new electronics will provide consumers plenty of temptation .
He , however , plans to wait .
" One of the big reasons I do n't buy things is because as a futurist I see what they 're going to do in the next few years , " he said .
