In my humble opinion , this is a waste of valuable time .
The Republicans in congress will NOT allow this initiaitive to reach the floor in time to have any impact .
The Democrats are powerless to cause it to happen , even IF they had the balls to try and make an issue of it .
The Democrats are either bought off or stupid ; if they were n't , they would walk out of congress EN MASSE * and make their point on the steps of the House and Senate that they will not return until a vote is taken , BUT THEY WON'T because they are scared and they are " saving their powder . "
( * Leaving one member in each house to refuse to allow unanimous consent for anything and demanding a roll call vote on everything )
I wish I were wrong , but given what the Republican thugs in congress HAVE chosen to bring to the floor for a vote on " Election Reform " ( mandatory ID cards at registration and ballot casting ) , I doubt it .
You would have to believe there were any honest Republicans left in congress for this to work , and there is no sign that there are more than two or three at most .

TOPIC : Civil Rights Dear Barbra Boxer ,
It 's time to fix america 's elections .
It 's time to end the corruption .
It 's time to fix the constitution .
It 's time to get rid of electricity in our elections !
LET AMERICA VOTE ACT
( EMERGENCY PAPER BALLOT MANDATE OF 2006 ) Emergency paper ballots shall be made available at every voting jurisdiction in the United States during the November 7th , 2006 General Election .
These paper ballots shall be available in sufficient numbers for optional use by voters who prefer to use them , and by all voters in the event of voting machine failure or unavailability .
These paper ballots are not to be provisional ballots , but regular paper ballots that shall be counted immediately upon the close of polls on election night along with all other votes cast by properly registered voters .
Democracy is at stake .
After at least two years of reporting in exhaustive details on these matters here , and at this late stage of the game , I believe the above " reform " is , unfortunately , the most we can likely hope for in time to have any real impact in mitigating a full - on train wreck during this November 's crucial excercise of the right of democracy .

I 'm afraid it 's hard to argue with Charlie L regarding his doubts about the likely success of this action but we still have to try .
What I would suggest and ask is that , if we are going to send this out to our e-mail lists , we need to provide a link , possibly to Velvet Revolution , that makes it easy for people to go to that link to send out a form letter to Congressman and Senators demanding Emergency Paper Ballots .
Maybe that is already in the works but I think it is necessary if we are going to try to involve the masses .

With a grassroots outpouring of support , I believe this can be done in time .
But that means you all need to get to work making it happen , instead of telling us all why it can't .
In the end , if it does n't , at least we will have done everything within our powers .

Having worked on ballot printing for state and national elections for a large commercial printer in California in the 90's , it should be pointed out that paper ballots are not something you can whip out overnight .
I worked double shifts as a temp 7 days a week for a month to get them done , and I was brought in at the END of the process .
I doubt that this can be pulled off in time , even if you can get it past a Republican congress that knows they should all lose their asses by every rational indicator .
Should it be in place for 08 ?
Absolutely , if we all live to 08 ' with the current administration .

We must try , nonetheless .
The Congress was able to get their butts in gear for that ridiculous Terry Schiavo legislation in very little time .
Force them to go on the record saying that they really do n't give a sh*t about Americans ' right to vote and have that vote counted .
The legislation may not pass , but at least their votes will be counted and on the record as being against ensuring our right to vote on Election Day with the crappy machines they forced on us .

This is a great idea .
I have one suggestion that we should work to implement also .
We all remember how people showed up to vote in the last several elections only to discover that they were in the wrong place or they were in the right place but they were n't on the list of registered voters .
Or , even worse , they sent in absentee ballots and never knew that they had been scrubbed or never registered in the first place .
Here in Cambridge , the voting lists are posted at the polling place for public inspection ahead of time .
That makes it possible for a person to check to make sure that he or she is registered before getting a nasty surprise on election day .
Think what a difference that would have made in Ohio in 2004 .
People would n't have had to wait in line in the rain for hours only to find out that they should have been waiting in a different line in the rain for hours .

Des said " Force them to go on the record " .
The only problem with that is that the Republicans hold all the chairmanships and they can bottle this up in committee and never let it come to a vote by the general House or Senate , so they will not have to go on record .
Maybe I 'm wrong and there is a way to force it to a general vote but I 'm not aware of that .
I believe that measures to amend HAVA and require an auditable paper record of every vote have been floating around since before the 2004 election but people like Ney have kept them from even being voted on by his committee , let alone the full House .

Yet somehow , the " gatekeepers " in the MSM and blogosphere pretend this is some type of radical , fringe idea .

Steve , # 24 , you are absolutely correct that Repugs have a nasty habit of squashing these things in committee so that they do n't have to go on the record and the legislation never sees the light of day .
BUT ... what 's different this go -'round is that the Princeton Report has come out , and last week 's primary in Maryland was a disaster right in front of their faces .
So ... IF we raise hell , IF they get beaten over the head with this , the effort still can make a difference , because the public outcry wil take it out of their grubby little hands and , at the very least , force them to respond in public to the public .
There is more than one way to get them on record .
There may not be a snowball 's chance in hell that this 'll get passed for real , but this is still an opportunity to get the word out about the coming election day trainwreck .
And there may be a PR victory to be had .
That said , we are guaranteed that nothing will happen if we do n't raise a sh*tstorm , loudly and relentlessly , now .

OK , I said in # 4 above that this was a waste of time , but I will hereby recant .
( Maybe it was those ten Hail Mary 's that got me ) .
BUT , if you 're going to do this , DO IT RIGHT !
1 . Letters do n't matter .
We do n't have the time , and they do n't read them , they WEIGH them .
2 . E - mails matter even less .
3 . Pettions do n't matter .
4 . If you want this to happen , you must do the following ... a. CALL your Representative .
Give them your name and zip code .
( Do n't even bother with the leadership or anybody out - of - state --- they do n't care . )
Tell them you want the Rep to support this simple matter .
THEN , ask them if any member of the staff reads bradblog.com .
Do n't expect to speak to your Rep , be glad if you get an aide .
Call both the local / state office AND the D.C. office .
b. Repeat with your US Senator .
CALL both locations .
c. VISIT the local field office of your Rep and Senator .
d. IF you do n't get a difinitive answer to your questions ( i.e. you get some meally - mouthed " We 'll look into it " or " The Congressman / Senator is thinking about it . " ) then call back the NEXT DAY and ask if there 's been any progress on that " thinking . "
VISIT AGAIN the NEXT day and ask if there 's been any progress .
Come to their offices with printouts and URLs and ask if you can speak with an aide who works on " election issues . " e. NEVER BE CONFRONTATIONAL .
Just try to REACH them in some fashion .
f.
Get your friends to do this as well .
Two different voting members of the same household are still TWO votes , but GO SEPARATELY !
g. PUSH .
PUSH .
PUSH .
IF your representative are Democrats and they say ( as I did ) that the Republicans wo n't ever let it happen , ask them if that is their criteria for signing onto a bill .
Most likely , they have signed onto and even voted for bills that were doomed , both for " positioning " and perhaps even " on priciple . "
( Oh , who am I kidding --- " principle ? " )
IF you really want to make this happen ( and we should ) then let 's use our minimal available energy in an effective way .
IF we show them that the blogosphere can create FEET ON THE GROUND ( that could be VOTES IN THE BOOTH ) and not pixels on the screen , they will start to pay attention .
And do n't forget October 5 , 2006 --- a NATIONAL DAY OF PROTEST .

Why would n't you care how the votes are counted ?
That 's exactly what I and others have been screaming about for years now .
How the votes are counted is absolutely critical .
As I 've said before , you can have a 100 % voter turnout but if the ballots are counted on a fraudulent and corrupt system then what the hell do you have ?
Nothing .
You do not have democracy .
One must care how the votes are counted otherwise millions will be disenfranchised --- that 's a guarantee under Karl Rove 's illegitimate Bush regime --- and you 'll be right back to where you started !
Especially if optical scan machines ( made by Diebold , Sequoia , ES&S et al ) are used to " count " the ballots .
In my opinion , this idea will not see the light of day in this Congress or under this Bush Dictatorship no matter how many calls or letters or emails or petitions or you name it people send to these useless and worthless trash in Congress .
It 's more wishful thinking which has n't gotten people anywhere thus far has it ?
( No , it has n't ) .
More and more people are tuning out and tuning off .
I used to be able to talk politics in my close circle of friends .
We shared the same views pretty much .
I can't talk about politics now .
They do n't want to talk about it they tell me .
They are tuning out and turning off .
They are also not keeping up with what 's happening , even major news things .
They 're just turning off .
My neighbor says the same thing I say .
Also , in the past around this time of year I used to see lots and lots of political signs in the windows here my major city .
This year :
None nowhere and I hear no one talking about politics when I 'm out and about .

Steps to recovering the Electoral Process : 1 . A return of the franchise to all who deserve it .
That is , a national mandate that every citizen of the USA over 18 who is not incarcerated or mentally incapable has the right to vote .
2 . Simple and up - to - and - including - Election - Day registration that is free of charge or costs ( i.e. , if your bigoted and paranoid - of - immigrants state wants to mandate an ID , then your bigoted and paranoid - of - immigrants state can pay for an ID for every person making under $ 40,000 per year , PERIOD ! )
3 . Sufficient time to vote without financial penalty , i.e. 3 - 4 day election periods of 14 - 16 hour days that include a weekend and at least one 8 pm to 8 am period .
4 . Open-voting at any precinct in a jurisdiction .
For a congressional race , any precinct in that district , for a senate or federal race , any precinct in the state .
5 . Simple paper ballots that are filled out by hand .
6 . Hand counting in a public place .
7 . Precinct - level tabulation and reporting of totals prior to centralized accounting .
8 . Secretaries of State and heads of Election offices can have no role in any campaigns other than their own , and they can not receive money from parties .
9 . Each ballot is numbered and a matching numbered receipt is given to each voter , assuring that they would be able to " call up " and confirm their ballot if necessary and testify to any incongruities in it .
10 .
A drawing for ten $ 10,000 prizes out of every million ballots cast ( yeah , that will at ten cents to the cost of each vote cast --- can we afford it ? )
11 . Instant Runoff Voting 12 . ( except to the degree that it conflicts with IRF )
The option of " none of the above " on each and every single race , with the position not filled and the race run again 60 days later if nobody beats that option .
Ohh , there 's probably more , but that 's a start .
It will take 20 years to get this to happen , and only if we kill every neo -con Rethuglican first , since they are totally opposed to each and every one of these , especially the 1st .
Rethuglicans have admitted over and over again that they can only win if they can LIMIT the number of people who vote .
That must mean it should be our goal to have 100 % participation in the process .
Does that scare an intellectual elitist like myself ?
( " Oh my lord , you 're going to let that two - tooth hick vote ? " )
You better believe it does , but it will be my ( and everybody else 's ) responsibility to educate the electorate to make the important critical decision that voting is .
Oh , I almost forgot the one I like best …
13 .
Cost of media for candidates ( TV , radio , cable , print , outdoor ) will be at the actual cost of delivery plus 10 % .
These costs will be audited , and any abuses of pricing will be a class 1 Felony per instance with the top five executives and the Board of Directors of the company held liable for the criminal and civil penalties .
P.S. to Erma : I 'm pretty sure that Brad cares how the votes are counted , but if you do n't get to vote , there 's nothing to fight about .

Hello Gov. Dean -
I am writing in reply to the various emails I have gotten from democrats.org
I think it is great to get the vote out , BUT I think you all are missing the BIG PICTURE and are ignoring the big Red elephant in the room - the very high probability that electronic voting has made all our votes meaningless .
I 'd suggest we make our TOP PRIORITY finding a way to guarantee that our votes are indeed counted properly , or that we have recourse to have an accurate recount if need be .
AFTER that - by all means - then focus on getting the vote out with the confidence that all those hard earned votes will indeed be relevant .
My frustration is that years after Conyers blew the lid off voter fraud , and with all the fine work grassroots efforts like www.bradblog.com has done , our Democratic leadership has done nothing about electronic voter fraud .
And as long as we have the potential for electronic voter fraud – NOTHING ELSE MATTERS
The best politics ; the best funded and most brilliant campaigns ; the most genuine and dedicated intent ; the most intelligent , honest , and charismatic leaders - WILL END UP NOWHERE - if it all comes down to a simple keystroke in the 11th hour of an election in some locked down courthouse somewhere citing " national security " .
We can't be trying to desperately fix the hole in the fence with our back turned to the gate that has already been left open .
I believe the only plausible explanation why BUSH / GOP have such a blatant and shameless arrogance and disregard for the people and the Truth - is because they already know we are going to ( electronically ) " vote for them " anyway .
Can you imagine the humiliation of getting the Dem vote out bigger than ever before - only to have those votes stolen , so that in the end the GOP can say " See - the vast majority of people have stepped up and spoken and given us our mandate ! "
We were fucked before - and we are about to get fucked again .
Why get people out to vote , if their votes will just end up being stolen ?
I think all your energy and determination has to be put into scrapping these machines , or demanding a paper ballot that can remain as evidence - hanging chads and all if need be .
It would certainly leave more evidence than what electronic voting leaves us .
Electronic Voter Fraud should be saturating the airwaves with every dollar you have .
Without this fixed – all the other noble issues are irrelevant , as will be your Party again after November .
I do n’t know what the solution is .
Since I have n’t heard any coming from the Democratic leaders , here is a link I would ask you to PLEASE take the time to read .
https://bradblog.com/?p=3495
Reader Comment # 35 is particularly helpful .
I would be very pleased to hear your response , and I have some other simple basic strategies that I can’t imagine for the life of my why the Dems have n’t taken .
Respectfully yours – Mike

The Anti-Democratic leadership will likely not let any such bill pass .
Look at what they did to HR 550 , which is six cosponsors short of a majority in the House .
( However , at least all the cosponsors of HR 550 should support this . )
It might be worth trying to get this bill pushed through every
STATE legislature , or at least as many as possible .
These states do n't even have paper ballot requirements of any sort : Arkansas
Delaware
Florida
Georgia
Indiana
Iowa
Kansas
Kentucky
Louisiana
Maryland
Pennsylvania
South Carolina
Tennessee
Texas
Virginia

YES !
What are we left with , so far , in Florida is an ES and S machine with no printer !
Apparently , Jeb Bush will not approve " the printer " , because it has " flaws " .
Of course the printer is not enough , we need Voter Verified Paper Ballots and since we will not get that by election time , this is the only way !
WE CAN DO IT !
Thanks Brad !

Ron Paul vs. Alan Greenspan
Before the House Financial Affairs Committee , July 20 , 2005
RON PAUL : If , indeed , this is your last appearance before our committee , Mr. Greenspan , I would have to say that , in the future , I ’m sure I ’ll find these hearings a lot less interesting .
But I do have a couple of parting questions for you .
Keynes , when he wrote his general theory , made the point that he has tremendous faith in central bank credit creation because it would stimulate productivity .
But along with this , he also recognized that it would push prices and labor costs up .
But he saw this as a convenience , not a disadvantage , because he realized that , in the corrective phase of the economic business cycle , that wages had to go down — which people would n’t accept , a nominal decrease in wages , but if they were decreased in real terms , it would serve the economic benefit .
Likewise , I think this same principle can be applied to our debt .
To me , this system that we have today is a convenient way to default on our debt — to liquidate our debt after the inflationary scheme .
Even you , in the 1960s , described the paper system as a scheme for the confiscation of wealth .
And , in many ways , I think this is exactly what has happened .
We have learned to adapt to deficit financing .
But in many ways , the total debt is not that bad because it goes down in real terms .
As bad as it is , in real terms , it ’s not nearly as high .
But , since we went on a total paper standard in 1971 , we have increased our money supply essentially 12 - fold .
Debt in this country , federal debt , has gone up 19 - fold — but that is in nominal dollars , not in real dollars .
So my question is this :
Is it not true that the paper system that we work with today is actually a scheme to default on our debt ?
And is it not true that , for this reason , that ’s a good argument for people not — eventually , at some day — wanting to buy Treasury bills because they will be paid back with cheaper dollars ?
And , indeed , in our lifetime , we certainly experienced this in the late 1970s — that interest rates had to go up pretty high and that this paper system serves the interests of big government and deficit financing because it ’s a sneaky way of paying for it .
At the same time , it hurts the people who are retired and put their money in savings .
And aligned with this question , I would like to ask something to dealing exactly with gold , is that :
If paper money — today it seems to be working rather well — but if the paper system does n’t work , when will the time come ?
What will the signs be that we should reconsider gold ?
Even in 1981 , when you came before the Gold Commission , people were frightened about what was happening — and that ’s not too many years ago .
And you testified that it might not be a bad idea to back our government bonds with gold in order to bring down interest rates .
So what are the conditions that might exist for the central bankers of the world to reconsider gold ?
We do know that they have n’t given up on gold .
They have n’t gotten rid of their gold .
They ’re holding it there for some reason .
So what ’s the purpose of the gold if it is n’t with the idea that some day they might need it ?
They do n’t hold lead or pork bellies .
They hold gold .
So what are the conditions that you might anticipate when the world may reconsider gold ?
MR. GREENSPAN : Well , you say central banks own gold — or monetary authorities own gold .
The United States is a large gold holder .
And you have to ask yourself :
Why do we hold gold ?
And the answer is essentially , implicitly , the one that you ’ve raised — namely that , over the generations , when fiat monies arose and , indeed , created the type of problems — which I think you correctly identify — of the 1970s , although the implication that it was some scheme or conspiracy gives it a much more conscious focus than actually , as I recall , it was occurring .
It was more inadvertence that created the basic problems .
But as I ’ve testified here before to a similar question , central bankers began to realize in the late 1970s how deleterious a factor the inflation was .
And , indeed , since the late ’ 70s , central bankers generally have behaved as though we were on the gold standard .
And , indeed , the extent of liquidity contraction that has occurred as a consequence of the various different efforts on the part of monetary authorities is a clear indication that we recognize that excessive creation of liquidity creates inflation which , in turn , undermines economic growth .
So that the question is :
Would there be any advantage , at this particular stage , in going back to the gold standard ?
And the answer is : I do n’t think so , because we ’re acting as though we were there .
Would it have been a question at least open in 1981 , as you put it ?
And the answer is yes .
Remember , the gold price was $ 800 an ounce .
We were dealing with extraordinary imbalances , interest rates were up sharply , the system looked to be highly unstable — and we needed to do something .
Now , we did something .
The United States — Paul Volcker , as you may recall , in 1979 came into office and put a very severe clamp on the expansion of credit , and that led to a long sequence of events here , which we are benefiting from up to this date .
So I think central banking , I believe , has learned the dangers of fiat money , and I think , as a consequence of that , we ’ve behaved as though there are , indeed , real reserves underneath the system .

Ideas Why Trucks Suck
Far too many people make irrational choices of vehicle , and manufacturers continue to use obsolete engineering in their trucks .
By Ted Mitchell
Published February 26 , 2007
Several unfavorable safety statistics belong to trucks and truck - based SUVs .
The chance of a single vehicle crash resulting in death is about 50 percent higher in trucks .
Also , drivers are more likely to be male and drunk , especially in rural areas .
If you keep your eyes open , it is difficult not to conclude that truck drivers are more aggressive on average .
A Transport Canada engineer once told me that this crowd makes the worst possible combination : the most aggressive , young , undereducated male drivers are drawn to vehicles that have the least stability and pose the most danger to other road users .
I could quote more statistics , but imagine this : you are driving a top rated , Canadian built Honda Civic about to get T - boned by another vehicle , which do you choose : a ) another Civic , or b ) a 2,300 kg 4x4 truck ?
It is no stretch to assume the truck can kill you when the Civic will not ( further details of vehicle incompatibility risks are available from NHTSA ) .
What if that truck is actually just a commuter vehicle , as is the case most of the time ?
Your death will be due to the other driver 's vanity .
Buying an Image
Stylish truck : this may look like a working truck , but that impression is wrong .
It is primarily a fashion accessory .

Despite a rapidly urbanizing population with unpaved roads as rare as common sense , sales of light trucks continue to climb .
If we were being sane , this graph should show a downward trend :
Market share of LTVs ( trucks , SUVs , vans ) .
( Image Credit : NHTSA - click on the image to see larger )
The growth in market share of trucks and SUVs is so counter - intuitive that forces other than practicality must be strongly at work .
For anyone who watches TV , you should be aware where the problem starts : marketing .
After years of enduring a barrage of ridiculous claims and innuendo , the public no longer can see the exaggeration .
We accept phrases like " rethink truck " , " professional grade engineering " , " like a rock " , and other assertions of toughness , reliability , and patriotism .
Advertisers are keen on encouraging settings with a masculine look and country music in the background , emphasizing family values and nostalgia .
Buy the truck and apparently you become like this .
Most of the time their claims are greatly exaggerated or simply outright lies .
For example , one of the earliest Mercedes M-class ads had a picture of a whitewater kayak beside the SUV .
I recognized the kayak model because I owned it .
It turns out that the kayak was longer than the inside of the SUV , which did not have a roof rack .
Picture that fancy Mercedes driving down the road with a kayak sticking out the back , hatch half open and tied down with yellow rope .
Why do n't they make honest commercials like that ?
The truck is not a truck anymore .
It is a fashion accessory , a declaration of personality and values , a sex symbol , and compensation for low self esteem for those who confuse the terms " tough " and " mean " .
It is a patriotic statement not only in association but in actuality , since the solvency of the Big Three depends largely on the high profit margin of body - on - frame trucks and SUVs .
Vanity Trumps Need
Now if you try to match your actual needs with the attributes of various types of vehicle ( my last essay dryly describes this process ) , it is very difficult to justify owning a truck .
Perhaps 15 percent of truck purchases can be defended , and these are overwhelmingly by contractors and farmers .
For the SUV , this number is more like one percent .
However , you will find that SUVs are perfectly suited for touring the African savanna .
An SUV in its element .
If you concentrate really hard , it kinda looks like the QEW .

So internalized are the factors I speak of that it is probably useless to try convincing the purchasers of trucks of what they are actually doing .
Expect silly rationalizations about why they in fact " need " a truck .
If that excuse falters , well , " it 's a free country " .
Yes , unfortunately ; free to cause harm to others , effectively in the name of a style fad .
So we do n't need more efficient , cleaner trucks , hybrid trucks , etc .
We need fewer trucks , and more people to stand up and say no , that truck you own is ridiculous .
Truck bed cover :
Does anything say ' this truck does n't do real work ' better than this accessory ?
It reduces the utility of a truck bed to that of a car trunk .
Why not buy a car ?

Crimes Against Engineering
In the mid-1970s , cars and trucks looked the same underneath .
That is , body - on - frame , non-independent rear live axle on leaf springs .
Five to ten years later , coil springs replaced the leaf springs in cars , and minor upgrades were made to the front suspension as well .
This improved suspension tuning slightly , but the big benefits had to wait for the unibody frame .
Leaf springs allow heavy loading but are never really " tuned " properly because of the wide range of sprung weights .
Tuned for no load , a full one will make it bounce violently .
Tuned for the rated load , it is very jittery and hard to control when empty , which is the usual case .
The solution to this is adjustable suspension like the air shocks in transport trucks .
But that is not an option as it costs money .
It is easier and cheaper to buy performance via clever advertising .
By the mid ' 80s , unibody cars started showing up in numbers .
These first iterations were not so amazing , but after a few design refinements the benefits were boldly apparent .
By the early '90s , cars were nearly all unibody and vastly outperforming trucks , which had not developed their frame technology at all .
Today , only the beastly Crown Vic retains body on frame , and you can still see the lumbering monsters wallowing around in the guise of taxicabs and police cars .
The Impression of Sportiness
To the uninformed , modern trucks can give the impression of sportiness .
Mostly this is a function of fancy paint , chrome , advertising and words like " Sport " suggestively painted on the back .
But trucks also have firm suspension , so they superficially resemble real sports cars .
Only , in a truck , once you lose traction , things get ugly .
These simple suspension designs have a very low cushion for error , especially when paired with grippy low profile tires .
Unibody / four wheel independent suspension cars allow you to predictably squeal all four tires in a fast corner , but do n't try that in a truck , the result is generally not predictable , especially on uneven surfaces .
Now here is a technical breakdown of where manufacturers should be indicted .
1 . All jacked up and nowhere to go .
Why is this truck so tall ?
Because it looks tough and sells better that way .
This rare marketing photo actually shows the rear differential , usually photos are aligned to hide it behind a tire .
( Image Credit : Ford Canada )
Tall vehicles , from an engineering perspective , accomplish nothing positive .
More ground clearance in the centre of the vehicle is of no use when driving off - road if you have a massive differential hanging down from the axle , asking to snag on rocks and stumps like an overgrown scrotum .
Orchitis :
If you were designing a real off - road vehicle , where would you want the most ground clearance ?
( Image Credit : University of Pennsylvania School of Veterinary Medicine )
The negatives of height are numerous : increased instability and loss of control , greater rollover propensity , difficult entry and exit , and harder to load cargo .
Of course , the most heinous is the increased risk to other road users , where the longitudinally stiff frame can override a passenger car 's door sills .
This is the " battering ram aimed at the head and torso " of car drivers .
2 . Too much unsprung weight .
The live axle shown above is very heavy .
In unibody / independent suspension designs , these components are part of the sprung weight .
The difference is remarkable .
Excess unsprung weight is all bad .
Ride is rough and traction is impaired .
3. Non-independent suspension .
( Live axle )
When one rear wheel hits a bump , the other wheel 's motion is affected negatively .
This adds to the rough ride and poor traction .
4 . Low frame stiffness in torsion ( twisting )
The equation that governs twistability says that torsional stiffness is proportional to the width of the frame cubed .
That is , since truck frames are about half the width of the body , there is a factor of 23 = 8 times the stiffness due to frame width alone .
In addition , the geometry of unibody frames is more favourable than the truck ladder frame for torsional stiffness .
Taking both factors together , ballpark a difference of 20 times between the torsional stiffness of car and truck frames .
It is common to see truck beds visibly wiggling over small potholes .
Perhaps nothing is as necessary for a performance car as a torsionally stiff frame .
Not only does this enhance handling and ride quality , it also reduces noise and vibration .
The Bottom Lines
Body on frame vehicles have two overwhelming advantages .
Low assembly cost means high profit margins keep the Big Three alive .
Second is manufacturing flexibility , which means that many different bodies can be fitted to the same frame .
Consequently , sheet metal is rapidly adaptable to changing styles , a fantastic advantage in an industry based on fashion fads .
If trucks were to be made with unibody frames , they would have the following advantages :
Vastly improved torsional frame stiffness
Lower overall weight , as the same metal performs two functions , frame and passenger compartment
Design allows a strong passenger compartment and sacrificial crumple zones
Minimizes centre of gravity for a given ground clearance
Easily permits fully independent suspension with a low unsprung weight ratio
What you experience :
A quieter , more comfortable ride
Superior handling and traction
A higher level of occupant safety both in reducing and mitigating crashes and rollovers
Better fuel economy , acceleration and braking
Easier cargo loading
What others experience :
Lower risk of death in multiple vehicle crashes
Lower air pollution emissions
Lower risks for pedestrians and cyclists in the event of collision
What Next ?
30 years ago , cars and trucks were on a level playing field .
Today , the differences in frame and suspension engineering are massive .
There is only one truck , the Honda Ridgeline , which uses unibody technology .
It is also top rated in performance .
Recall this is the first attempt Honda has made at a truck , versus nearly a century of experience for the domestic competition .
Think about this proposal : if you drive a commuter vehicle , that is , not a heavy commercial truck , it should meet uniform criteria for stability , gas mileage , emissions , and crash compatibility .
( Currently , such criteria either do not exist or different , arbitrary standards are used for cars and trucks . )
The easiest way for manufacturers to meet such criteria is to use unibody technology for trucks .
Otherwise , if the vehicle can't meet criteria , a relevant business license and commercial driver doctor 's exams should be required .
Given the massive risks posed by large vehicles , commercial drivers should also meet performance criteria for collision history and have psychological profiles that exclude high risk drivers .
Or , we could revert to the time honored ideology that the market knows best .
Given the auto sector 's track record , we know roughly what to expect : serious resistance and misinformation campaigns , capitalizing on patriotism and other clever marketing ploys .
Expect auto journalist whores to label the Ridgeline a " pansy , urban boy toy ” , not tough enough for real men who need real trucks .
So the verdict is in : You do not " need " that vanity vehicle , and it is more obsolete than you can imagine .
Final Note
Critics may pan the ' theoretical ' nature of this essay .
That would ignore some 2,000 + hours of off - road driving experience I accumulated during my youth in northern Ontario .
As any northerner knows , the performance of real off - road vehicles such as dirt bikes , ATV's and skidders will thoroughly embarrass the most capable of four - wheel drive trucks and SUVs .
Despite using a truck for its intended design : 12 cords of wood a year , countless loads of garbage , tractor parts , hay bales , camping trips , etc. ad infinitum , our family did not " need " a truck .
A car with a roof rack and utility trailer would do most of those chores easily .
If it would not , there was always the tractor and hay wagon .

Long before animals with limbs ( tetrapods ) came onto the scene about 365 million years ago , fish already possessed the genes associated with helping to grow hands and feet ( autopods ) report University of Chicago researchers .
Paddlefish fins exhibit a unique pattern of Hox expression previously thought present only in the developing hands and feet of land vertebrates ( tetrapods ) .
This result supports the notion that fossil fish already possessed the genetic toolkit needed to evolve hands , feet , fingers and toes .
Credit : University of Chicago Medical Center
This finding overturns a long - held , but much - debated , theory that limb acquisition was a novel evolutionary event , requiring the descendents of lobed - fin fish to dramatically alter their genes to adapt their bodies to their new environments of streams and swamps .
The paper , " An autopodial - like pattern of Hox expression in the fins of a basal actinopterygian fish , " shows that the genetic and developmental toolkit that builds limbs with fingers and toes was around long before the acquisition of limbs , according to the scientists , and that this toolkit exists in some primitive form in a living primitive bony fish , the paddlefish .
" We found that the genetic capability seen in tetrapods to build limbs is present in even more primitive fish , " said lead author Marcus Davis , PhD , a postdoctoral fellow in Neil Shubin ’s lab at the University of Chicago .
Instead of using zebrafish — the hallmark animal for laboratory development studies — the scientists used paddlefish as a proxy for a more primitive ancestor .
Unlike the simple fins of zebrafish , paddlefish have an elaborate fin skeletal pattern similar to that seen in more primitive vertebrates such as sharks and many fossil fish .
This sturgeon - type fish is farm raised for caviar , which gives scientists relatively easy access to the animal for study .
The fin of paddlefish resembles that of zebrafish .
The interior arrangement is the same , but the back part of the paddlefish fin has longer elements .
Accepted theory among scientists has been that the pattern of Hox gene expression seen in zebrafish represents the primitive condition for the fin in any vertebrate , and the group leading to tetrapods elaborated on this Hox expression by adding a second phase and added to the skeletal pattern .
The scientists studied the development of paddlefish fins to test whether the genes activated to make hands and feet in tetrapods were different from the genes activated to make fish fins .
Davis working with postdoctoral fellow Randall Dahn , PhD , and Shubin , PhD , professor and associate dean for organismal and evolutionary biology at Chicago and provost of the Field Museum , disproved conventional wisdom .
The team looked at Hox genes — which play a vital role in limb development — in the pectoral fins of paddlefish .
To track where the Hox genes are active in the fin , the team inserted molecular markers and showed the activity pattern has similarities to patterns of these same genes in tetrapod limbs .

Tetrapods have a second phase of Hox gene expression that happens later in development .
During this second phase , hands and feet develop .
Although this second phase is not known in zebrafish , the scientists found that it is present in paddlefish , which reveals that a pattern of gene activity long thought to be unique to vertebrates with hands and feet is in fact much more primitive .
This is the first molecular support for the theory that the genes to help make fingers and toes have been around for a long time — well before the 375 - million - year - old Tiktaalik roseae , the newly found species discovered in 2004 by Shubin and colleagues .
Tiktaalik provided a missing evolutionary link between fish and tetrapods and was among the first creatures that walked out of water onto land .
Prior to this find , scientists had little evidence of where the wrist came from .
A popular theory , one Shubin himself subscribed to , was that it was a novel development — that genetic variance gave rise to an entirely new function .
What Tiktaalik revealed morphologically , Shubin , Davis and Dahn have proven genetically .
" This report provides important new information about the evolution of hands and feet in vertebrate animals , " said Lance Grande , PhD , head of collections and research at the Field Museum .
Scientists have attacked the evolutionary quandary of limb development on two fronts : the direct evidence of the fossil record and the morphology , and its relationship with specific genetic mechanisms .
What they needed , Davis said , was an animal " unmolested by time . "
" When you try to directly compare zebrafish fins and tetrapod limbs , it ’s like comparing apples to oranges because each retains portions of the skeleton lost by the other , " he said .
" Just as tetrapods went off and did something crazy with their fin by adding to it , zebrafish went off and did something crazy by losing part of their fin .
" So the innovation here is about a pattern of loss of gene activity [ for the zebrafish ] and not a pattern of acquisition [ for tetrapods ] , " he said .
Although this pattern of genes clearly helps to make hands and feet today in tetrapods , that may not be their original intent , Shubin said .
" Here ’s a fish that does n’t have an autopod but is still using those genes in a second phase to help pattern out a fin that does n’t have fingers , never did , and is very far removed from tetrapods . "
The capability of building limbs with fingers and toes existed for a long period of time , but it took a set of environmental triggers to make use of that capability .
According to Shubin , in the Late Devonian , animals like Tiktaalik and its descendants acquired limbs with fingers using this primitive design , largely because their ecosystem — the small streams that they lived in — was new .
" It had the tools , " he said , " but it needed the opportunity as well . "
The Shubin lab has expanded its studies to see if the Hox gene expression is present in yet older common ancestors .
The research team now is studying the primitive fin development of sharks .

We ’re trying to find someone with the skill and experience to help create an Internet search function that we can only describe as a “ Reverse Search Engine ” .
That is , normally requests are submitted to this website to solicit assistance for help with getting a Website listed as high as possible on Search Engines .
While we need that as well ( to include Country specific Search Engines around the World ) , this particular posting is primarily intended to find someone that has creative experience using network monitoring , sniffers , scanning and other network tools designed to detect and find things .
Since as opposed to setting and waiting for a Web User to find our Website , we would like to explore ways to proactively go out and search for those Web Users that are actively searching and seeking a certain thing .
As a Telecom Consulting Firm , in our case , for example , we would like to find Regional and Global Web Users who are out on the Internet actively searching for “ Telecom Services ” ( we can provide a more detailed list of specific “ search words ” , such as VoIP , DS1 , Conferencing , etc. , etc. , once we get to that point ) .
In our functional view of how this might work ; is that the “ Reverse Search Engine ” would monitor the Web in much the same way as LAN networking tools monitor the Local Area Network ( LAN ) , and once this “ Reverse Search Engine ” detects that there is a Web User doing a Search for “ Telecom Services ” ( to any Search Engine on the Web ) , this “ Reverse Search Engine ” would monitor the Port from which the Internet User is initiating the request (s ) , and through some network monitoring , scanning and / or sniffer tools , be able to view all of the data packets or email transactions from that port and gain an understanding of the name , email address and other information about this person , in order for a Firm like ours to then proactively reach out to the person and offer assistance in their Telecom Service needs .
We suspect that this functionality already exists and is in full use and operation today by Governments , in their world - wide efforts to fight Terrorism .
We simply would like to use that exact same functionality to better target those Customers looking for the types of Telecom Services that we offer .
If this is something you can do , please see my contact information below and either call me or email me so as we can see if we can find a way to work together on this project .
Thank you .

按照所能提供的运力计算，世界上最大的航空公司美国航空公司（下称美航）与亚洲最大的航空公司中国南方航空股份有限公司（下称南航）正因为一笔潜在的股权交易而被联系在一起。
上海证券交易所3月23日发布消息称，南航董事会发布公告称正在筹划重大战略合作，鉴于该事项存在不确定性等因素，股票自2017年3月23日起连续停牌。据《华夏时报》从多个信源处得到的消息表明
，这一重大战略合作事项很有可能是向美航出售一部分股权，并在两家公司之间推动进一步的业务合作。
收购将成 ？
日前，彭博社报道称，美航准备出资2亿美元收购南航股权，并借此在南航董事会谋得一个观察员席位，但目前为止除了南航的公告之外双方都没有对此事发表过正面评论。
一位接近南航的人士在接受《华夏时报》记者采访时透露，之前听说了双方在谈判的消息，但目前似乎并没有达成最终的协议。
而在一位参与过并购谈判的人士看来，通常这种涉及到上市公司之间的投资或者并购谈判在有结果之前对消息的控制都比较严
，但此次尚未谈成便有消息流出，不排除是谈判陷入某种僵持阶段时，某一方为了
“ 破局 ” 而故意放风做出的举措。
在官方宣布正式的合作细节之前，所有关于收购方式和金额的信息都只是猜测，但2亿美元这样一个甚至不足以购买一架新型远程宽体飞机的资金量级
，对于总市值高达百亿美元的南航而言，似乎也只能作为略表诚意的“开胃菜 ” 。
外资航空公司收购中国航空公司股权并非首次，2007年中国东方航空股份有限公司（下称东航）试图引入新加坡航空成为股东，从而拓展双方的合作
，但这一计划最终因未能通过股东大会决议而失败。
东航在2015年向美国达美航空公司（下称达美）出售了3.55%股份
，总价值约为4.5亿美元。
近来，国有企业进行混合所有制改革被提倡，其中包括允许向私人和外国投资者出售部分股权，在三大国有航空公司中东航一直较为积极地推进这一政策的实施。
虽然南航此前并未明确表示其在混合所有制改革的目标和方向，但作为一家中国国内航线网络最好的航空公司，也吸引到众多想在中国拓展更多业务的外资航企试图通过这样的方式与之展开合作，其中就包括南航所在的天合联盟中的部分成员。
美国三大航空公司中，美航在中国的业务规模要落后于美国联合航空公司（下称美联航）和达美，因此有着较为强烈的扩张需求。
但美航最近受到了一些打击，他 们 “ 虎口夺食 ” 从达美手中抢到的北京-洛杉矶航权在获批之后，因为无法拿到首都机场的起降时刻而不得不推迟，目前美国交通部批准这条航线暂缓半年开航，不过这并不意味着半年之后美航一定可以获得一个起降时刻。
北京与洛杉矶之间的航线是中美之间最受欢迎的航线，按照不完全的数据统计，去年前九个月这条航线就运送了近40万旅客
，增长幅度超过13%。而洛杉矶与中国三大航空枢纽之间的客流量是中美航线里最大的。
但中美之间新的航权谈判没有结果之前，美国航企已经几乎用尽了手中现有的热门区域航权，北京到洛杉矶就是“瓶底最后一口酒”，因此才引发美航和达美的激烈争夺。
比较有意思的一点在于，达美在看到美航无法获得时刻之后向美国交通部提出自己可以通过东航获得时刻，希望将航权重新抢回自己手中，虽然这个提议被美国交通部驳回，但一个紧密的本地合作伙伴在关键时刻发挥的作用显而易见。
美航与中国一些航空公司有一些诸如代码共享这样的业务合作，但因为其所在的寰宇一家航空联盟（OneWorld）在中国大陆地区并没有成员，所以远不如美联航和达美获得的支持多。
但即使是这样 ，美航也没有与同在寰宇一家的合作伙伴香港国泰航空进一步拓展合作关系，而是直接选择了130多公里之外的南航。
联盟乱局
虽然寰宇一家对于联盟成员与盟外航空公司的合作持开放态度，但作为联盟中最大的公司，同时也是创始成员，忽然去收购一家天合联盟成员公司的股份，也进一步凸显出这个联盟如今所面临的窘境。
寰宇一家目前一共有14家成员企业，规模小于另外两大联盟。与星空联盟那样有诸多老牌传统航企压阵，以及天合联盟在新兴市场大量吸收新成员的基底相比，寰宇一家近年来显然日子不好过。
2011年美航经历破产重组，最终被全美航空并购；日本航空公司也经历了一次死而复生的重整；马来西亚航空公司在接连两起事故之后一蹶不振；澳洲航空在和奉行不结盟政策的阿联酋航空“深度捆绑”之后也只是名义上留守在联盟中；柏林航空则因为持续亏损，被重整之后一分为三；国泰则刚刚发布了一份难看的财报，正待内部新一轮大规模重整。
英航和伊比利亚航空、芬兰航空、卡塔尔航空等其他成员也面临着地区安全以及全球经济不确定性带来的经营压力，虽然另外两大联盟也面临这样的问题，但像寰宇一家这样“ 主心骨” 受损的情况并未显现。
寰宇一家还有一个与另外两大联盟相比更为致命的问题：在中国大陆和印度这样仍处在上升期的航空市场没有成员伙伴，这也给盟内其他成员在这些地区的业务扩张带来了极大的困难。
目前星空联盟已经有了国航、深圳航空作为成员公司，同时还吸纳了基地位于上海的吉祥航空作为预备成员。天合联盟则拿下了中国三大国有航空公司中的两家，同时在亚洲等新兴市场接纳了大量规模较小的航空公司，从而形成了完善的航线网络布局。
反观寰宇一家在大中华区唯一一个合作伙伴国泰，因为与国航交叉持股，所以尽管身在寰宇一家，但某种意义上也在同时为星空联盟服务，并且其通过国泰港龙在中国内地的布局也完全没法与三大国有航空在内的企业为其联盟伙伴提供的服务相比。
正因为如此 ，寰宇一家内部也出现裂隙。芬兰航空首席执行 官PekkaVauramo近日就公开表示，缺少中国和印度的合作伙伴对其业务影响很大 。
“ 或许这一次国泰会被抛弃 。 ” 一位接近美航的人士在23日接受《华夏时报（公众号：chinatimes）》记者采访时透露，而与南航展开谈判就是一个明确的信号，美航和寰宇一家需要一个强有力的地区合作伙伴
，作用不仅仅可以帮助其获得航权，更能对其在这个地区扩张获得帮助。
而南航在国际业务上的拓展需求也使得其需要美航这样一个强大的合作伙伴给予支持。国航通过与国泰的关系以及收购深航，在华南地区对广州形成了极大牵制，以至于居于中国第三大航空枢纽的白云机场在国际业务上已经远远被北京和上海拉开距离
，近几年吸引力甚至已经不如一些客流量较高的二线机场。

When Bush announced the new surge strategy back in January , I thought that it would be “ temporarily successful ” as Hitler ’s Battle of the Bulge was in 1944 .
I was wrong — the surge has been a total , complete , and utter failure from beginning to end , just like the entire war .
The first sign of trouble was when the Bush administration and the military began touting early signs of success back in April .
They said sectarian violence was down in Iraq thanks to Bush ’s decision to throw 30,000 more troops into the meat - grinder , and they pointed to the 50 percent decline in the number of bodies dumped on the streets of Baghdad as proof .
Of course , what they left out was that over the same time period the number of car bombings grew .
“ Oops . ”
Now there ’s even more proof that the surge has failed .
In May , recorded civilian deaths reached 2,000 , the highest since the beginning of the surge .
( And who knows how many unrecorded deaths there are — the Ministry of the Interior which helps compile the stats is controlled by the Shia Supreme Islamic Iraqi Council [ SIIC ] which is responsible for the bulk of the sectarian killings in Baghdad ) .
The Green Zone ’s parliament was bombed in April , rockets and mortars attacks on the Zone have become common , and U.S. soldiers have been ordered not to walk alone in the Zone because they might be kidnapped .
Now , a new internal assessment by the U.S. military of the surge shows that they have been able to “ maintain physical influence over ” only 146 of the 457 neighborhoods in the capital — a whopping 32 percent — despite the fact that almost all the surge troops are in place .
Bush ’s “ bold new strategy ” to win the war never had a chance to succeed because it was based on a combination of delusion , wishful thinking , and desperation .
The theory ( insofar as there was one ) was that if the U.S. could curb the sectarian violence in Baghdad , all the hardcore sectarian politicians the U.S. installed into power would put aside their sectarianism , sing kumbaya , give each other flowers , make nice , and create a stable puppet government that would recognize Israel and allow the U.S. pull its combat troops out while keeping a garrison of tens of thousands there permanently .
Such a large military presence in the heart of the Middle East would allow the U.S. to blackmail competitors like Russia and China by threatening to cut off their oil supply and at the same time threaten Iran and Syria militarily .
According to the Army ’s counter - insurgency doctrine written by General David Petraeus , the man in charge of executing the surge , the U.S. needs a minimum of 120,000 combat troops in Baghdad to wrest control of its neighborhoods away from the Sunni resistance and the Mehdi Army , the anti-occupation Shi’ite militia led by Muqtada al - Sadr .
Prior to the surge there were 52,000 combat troops in all of Iraq .
So even if the U.S. sent all the troops it has in Iraq to Baghdad as well as the 30,000 surge troops on top of that it would still be unable to control the city !
The bottom line is that the U.S. cannot win in Iraq .
The British Ministry of Defence did a poll in 2005 that showed 65 percent of Iraqis ( that ’s 18.2 million people ) think attacks on U.S. and British forces are justified .
The basic problem for the U.S. is that there are no social forces in Iraq that want Iraq to be an American satellite .
Al - Sadr and the Sunni resistance , which combined probably have more popular support than all of the collaborators in the Green Zone government put together , want the U.S. out ASAP .
Among the forces in the Green Zone government , the Kurdish parties want autonomy and their share of oil revenue ; the Sunni parties want an end to the occupation , a share of the oil money , and some control over the state apparatus ; the SIIC has only collaborates with the U.S. to stay in power .
None of them are particularly interested in a permanent U.S. occupation .
Furthermore , the Iraqi police and army units that the U.S. created , armed , and trained are merely Shia militias with uniforms and legal authority whose members are routinely caught planting the deadly roadside bombs that have killed so many of our hapless soldiers .
Even the ever - in - denial - because - we ’re - making - progress - and - victory - is - around - the - corner - if - only - the - Democrats - stopped - coddling - terrorists Bush administration is beginning to realize that there ’s no winning strategy for a lost war , with the exception of Dick Cheney who is still babbling about victory .
Bush , whose approval rating now matches his I.Q. , has said that after the surge he would implement the recommendations of the Iraq Study Group ( ISG ) , whose report was published shortly after the Republicans got their long - overdue thumpin ’ at the polls last year .
Although Bush probably did not bother to read it ( the words “ Study Group ” probably killed what little interest he had ) , its recommendations were : talk nice to Syria and Iran , step up the training of Iraqi military and police units ( apparently the Iraqis blowing up our soldiers need should be doing a much better job ) , withdraw combat troops , and let the remaining troops hunker down in the four permanent mega - bases under construction .
If Bush does all of the above , it would be the smartest thing he has done in a long , long time .
The surge is going to end at some point in 2008 because it is not working and because it is militarily unsustainable .
Bringing the troops home from Iraq is what Americans overwhelmingly voted for in the last mid-term election .
Implementing the ISG ’s recommendations would allow Bush to take credit for something that he was initially hostile to .
More importantly , doing so would deprive the Democrats of the ability to criticize his Iraq policy because he would be implementing theirs .
( Leading Democrats Nancy Pelosi , Harry Reid , Hillary Clinton and Barak Obama have endorsed the ISG ’s recommendations to pull combat troops out of Iraq while maintaining a permanent garrison there .
Not one of them spoke out against the administration ’s comparison of U.S. presence in Iraq to South Korea , where tens of thousands of U.S. troops have been stationed for over fifty years . )
Bringing some troops home in 2008 would help the G.O.P. a lot with the Iraq problem that cost them so dearly at the polls in 2006 .
Bush could claim that he was obeying the will of the voters while the Dems would not be able to slam him for stubbornly staying the course .
If this redeployment occurs , it would mean the American ruling class has given up on the original aims of the war : complete and total domination over Iraq , the creation of a thoroughly pro-U.S. regime , and a permanent military presence .
Instead , they would opt for the ISG ’s Plan B : a permanent military presence tacitly tolerated by a semi-independent Iraqi government .
While this would be a step forward for the Iraqis and the U.S. antiwar movement , it would by no means be the end of the war or the end of the fight to get our troops out of Iraq .
Does television cause crime ?
The idea that people copy the violence they watch is debated endlessly by criminologists .
But this column concerns an odder and perhaps more interesting idea : if crime leaps out of the box , it is not the programmes that are responsible as much as the material in between .
It proposes that violence emerges from those blissful images of family life , purged of all darkness , that we see in the advertisements .
Let me begin , in constructing this strange argument , with a paper published in the latest edition of Archives of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine .
It provides empirical support for the contention that children who watch more television eat more of the foods it advertises .
" Each hour increase in television viewing , " it found , " was associated with an additional 167 kilocalories per day . "
Most of these extra calories were contained in junk foods : fizzy drinks , crisps , biscuits , sweets , burgers and chicken nuggets .
Watching television , the paper reported , " is also inversely associated with intake of fruit and vegetables " .
There is no longer any serious debate about what a TV diet does to your body .
A government survey published last month shows that the proportion of children in English secondary schools who are clinically obese has almost doubled in 10 years .
Today , 27 % of girls and 24 % of boys between 11 and 15 years old suffer from this condition , which means they are far more likely to contract diabetes and to die before the age of 50 .
But the more interesting question is what this diet might do to your mind .
There are now scores of studies suggesting that it hurts the brain as much as it hurts the heart and the pancreas .
Among the many proposed associations is a link between bad food and violent or antisocial behaviour .
The most spectacular results were those reported in the Journal of Nutritional and Environmental Medicine in 1997 .
The researchers had conducted a double - blind , controlled experiment in a jail for chronic offenders aged between 13 and 17 .
Many of the boys there were deficient in certain nutrients .
They consumed , on average , only 63 % of the iron , 42 % of the magnesium , 39 % of the zinc , 39 % of the vitamin B12 and 34 % of the folate in the US government 's recommended daily allowance .
The researchers treated half the inmates with capsules containing the missing nutrients , and half with placebos .
They also counselled all the prisoners in the trial about improving their diets .
The number of violent incidents caused by inmates in the control group ( those taking the placebos ) fell by 56 % , and in the experimental group by 80 % .
But among the inmates in the placebo group who refused to improve their diets , there was no reduction .
The researchers also wired their subjects to an electroencephalograph to record brainwave patterns , and found a major decrease in abnormalities after 13 weeks on supplements .
A similar paper , published in 2002 in the British Journal of Psychiatry , found that among young adult prisoners given supplements of the vitamins , minerals and fatty acids in which they were deficient , disciplinary offences fell by 26 % in the experimental group , and not at all in the control group .
Researchers in Finland found that all 68 of the violent offenders they tested during another study suffered from reactive hypoglycaemia : an abnormal tolerance of glucose caused by an excessive consumption of sugar , carbohydrates and stimulants such as caffeine .
In March this year the lead author of the 2002 report , Bernard Gesch , told the Ecologist magazine that " having a bad diet is now a better predictor of future violence than past violent behaviour ...
Likewise , a diagnosis of psychopathy , generally perceived as being a better predictor than a criminal past , is still miles behind what you can predict just from looking at what a person eats . "
Why should a link between diet and behaviour be surprising ?
Quite aside from the physiological effects of eating too much sugar ( apparent to anyone who has attended a children 's party ) , the brain , whose function depends on precise biochemical processes , can't work properly with insufficient raw materials .
The most important of these appear to be unsaturated fatty acids ( especially the omega 3 types ) , zinc , magnesium , iron , folate and the B vitamins , which happen to be those in which the prisoners in the 1997 study were most deficient .
A report published at the end of last year by the pressure group Sustain explained what appear to be clear links between deteriorating diets and the growth of depression , behavioural problems , Alzheimer 's and other forms of mental illness .
Sixty per cent of the dry weight of the brain is fat , which is " unique in the body for being predominantly composed of highly unsaturated fatty acids " .
Zinc and magnesium affect both its metabolism of lipids and its production of neurotransmitters - the chemicals which permit the nerve cells to communicate with each other .
The more junk you eat , the less room you have for foods which contain the chemicals the brain needs .
This is not to suggest that food advertisers are solely responsible for the decline in the nutrients we consume .
As Graham Harvey 's new book We Want Real Food shows , industrial farming , dependent on artificial fertilisers , has greatly reduced the mineral content of vegetables , while the quality of meat and milk has also declined .
Nor do these findings suggest that a poor diet is the sole cause of crime and antisocial behaviour .
But the studies I have read suggest that any government that claims to take crime seriously should start hitting the advertisers .
Instead , our government sits back while the television regulator , Ofcom , canoodles with the food industry .
While drawing up its plans to control junk food adverts , Ofcom held 29 meetings with food producers and advertisers and just four with health and consumer groups .
The results can be seen in the consultation document it published .
It proposes to do nothing about adverts among programmes made for children over nine and nothing about the adverts the younger children watch most often .
Which ?
reports that the most popular ITV programmes among two - to nine - year - olds are Dancing on Ice , Coronation Street and Emmerdale , but Ofcom plans to regulate only the programmes made specifically for the under - nines .
It claims that tougher rules would cost the industry too much .
To sustain the share values of the commercial broadcasters , Ofcom is prepared to sacrifice the physical and psychological wellbeing of our children .
At the European level , the collusion is even more obvious .
Last week , Viviane Reding , the European media commissioner , spoke to a group of broadcasters about her plans to allow product placement in European TV programmes ( this means that the advertisers would be allowed to promote their wares during , rather than just between , the programmes ) .
She complained that her proposal had been attacked by the European parliament .
" You have to fight if you want to keep it , " she told the TV executives .
" I would like to make it very clear that I need your support in this . "
I spent much of last week trying to discover whether the Home Office is taking the research into the links between diet and crime seriously .
In the past , it has insisted that further studies are needed , while failing to fund them .
First my request was met with incredulity , then I was stonewalled .
Tough on crime .
To hell with the causes of crime .

It 's an important question .
Consider the implications .
If we had an answer , we could quantify the effectiveness of school .
We could judge the quality of books , articles , and blog posts .
And we could find new ways for startups to create value .
Merriam - Webster defines learning as " gaining knowledge or understanding of or skill in by study , instruction , or experience . "
Unfortunately , this definition is non-actionable .
As such , I 'd like to propose a new working definition
You 've learned something if you can answer a question that you could not have answered previously .
Before we proceed , a couple of caveats .
First , this model only works for cognitive learning .
That means things like muscle memory are out .
Second , this model treats actions as implicit questions .
For example , if we learn how to drive a nail then we 've answered the implicit question " How do I use a hammer ? "
I 've challenged several people to find an example that breaks my model .
So far no one has succeeded .
Even if there is some corner case that breaks the model , I think it 's pretty safe to say that it holds for 99 and 44/100 % of cases .
The implications here are huge .
I 'll start with books and blogging , and then I 'll tackle school and entrepreneurship .
Good ( non-fiction ) books answer questions .
Often , but not always , the questions answered are right in the title .
Glancing over at my bookshelf , I see the following
Punished by Rewards : The Trouble with Gold Stars , Incentive Plans , A's , Praise , and Other Bribes .
The question here is easy to spot :
What is the trouble with gold stars , incentive plans , etc . ?
War Is a Force That Gives Us Meaning .
Again , there is a clear implicit question :
How does war give us meaning and what are the implications for the individual and society ?
What Is Calculus About ?
Self - explanatory .
As a rule of thumb , the clearer the question the better the book .
Which perhaps explains why most textbooks are so poor .
Next to me is a copy of a textbook called Marketing .
This answers no question .
Or if it does , it 's a trivial and ill - formed question like , " What the deal with marketing , yo ? ? ? "
So if you write a blog that answers no questions , does that mean you 're stupid and your blog sucks ?
Not necessarily .
In The Age of the Essay , Paul Graham writes that
An essay you publish ought to tell the reader something he did n't already know .
But what you tell him does n't matter , so long as it's interesting .
I 'm sometimes accused of meandering .
In defend - a- position writing that would be a flaw . [...]
But that 's not what you 're trying to do in an essay .
An essay is supposed to be a search for truth .
It would be suspicious if it did n't meander .
Certainly true .
But I suspect that what makes the best of Paul 's essays so good is that they do answer interesting questions .
And while they often meander , the meanderings add interest precisely because they introduce further interesting questions .
But enough about writing .
What about school , yo ??
So you do your homework .
But have you learned ?
And you go to lecture .
But have you learned ?
And you get your `A ' .
But have you learned ?
Can I answer a question I could not have answered previously ?
But if the goal is n't to learn , no need to ask yourself these questions .
Or any questions for that matter .
( And if you think about it , I think you 'll see that working harder does n't mean learning more . )

Helen : i bet readers will ask at some point , the dichotomy between good and bad learning
Well , my theory is that information only becomes useful or non-useful because of the questions it answers .
Like say , for example , you learn what Britney Spears ate for breakfast .
Certainly you 've learned a new fact .
But perhaps there are more useful facts ( or ideas or theories ) we could have learned .
How do we know ?
The problem is there is n't really any way to compare two facts directly .
After all , they 're facts .
The only way one can say that one fact is more important than another is because it answers a more important question .
So if learning what Britney Spears ate for breakfast can be said to be trivial , it 's only because the only question we can answer there is , " What did Britney Spears eat for breakfast ? "
If facts , theories , and ideas are the atoms of human thought , then questions are the glue that binds them together .
Information with no intuitive model connecting it is useless or gets forgotten or both .
That 's why you read a book like All Marketers are Liars and it 's seared into your brain .
But then you open a textbook called Communication and you 're asleep by page three .
Instead of grouping facts and theories by the questions they answer , textbooks group facts by how `similar ' they seem .
This actively thwarts the sensemaking layer of human cognition , preventing us from transforming information into understanding .
If you 've ever read through a textbook that seemed like a list of unconnected facts , it probably was .
Which is a problem , since being well educated is a function of the questions you can answer , not the facts that you know .
There is this common misconception that we 've entered the information age , implying that information is somehow intrinsically valuable .
Nothing could be further from the truth .
The driving factor of the last half - century has n't been information , but information - technology .
What is IT ?
Information - technology applies technology to information to answer questions that would n't be answerable by looking at raw data alone .
For a full theory of applying technology to information to answer questions , check out Bret Victor 's essay Magic Ink .
It is one of the more insightful articles on software design ever penned .
The basic premise here is that web entrepreneurs should exploit their medium to answer the user 's questions .
Incidentally , Paul Graham takes this one step by advising entrepreneurs to treat the business idea as a question .
The initial idea is just a starting point -- not a blueprint , but a question . [...]
Treating a startup idea as a question changes what you 're looking for .
If an idea is a blueprint , it has to be right .
But if it 's a question , it can be wrong , so long as it's wrong in a way that leads to more ideas .
One last point before we 're done .
So who gets to decide if your question is answered ?
To borrow some logic from Seth Godin at Gel 2006 , if you think your question has been answered , it 's been answered .
Other people will try to convince you that they think they 've answered your question .
I DON'T CARE if you think you 've answered my question .
If I do n't think you 've answered my question , you have n't answered my question .
Is it just me , or are the interviews you see on television getting worse and worse ?
There are exceptionally good interviewers , of course ( such as Bill Moyers ) .
Bad interviews are the norm , however .
This is a shame , because most bad interviews could be cured if only the interviewers would follow a few basic rules
Before I go further , I should make it clear that my frustration is with interviews that are serious attempts to discuss a topic with a guest in order to inform or entertain the audience .
I am excluding from this critique interviews on comedy shows ( such as Jon Stewart or Stephen Colbert ) , where the interviewer is expected to interject his or her personality with more gusto or even to toy with the guest .
Without further ado , here are 10 basic rules for conducting effective interviews :
1 . The interviewer needs to shut up and let the guest talk .
How often is it that an interviewer just can’t hold back and ends up dominating the interview , failing to allow the guest a fair chance to talk ?
I ’ve often watched interviews by Charlie Rose that remind me of this point .
Although Charlie books some terrific guests and does some excellent work , he is one of those interviewers who is often incapable of staying out of the way .
Many interviews end up being “ about Charlie . ”
In the legal field , the trick to effective direct examination of a witness is to ask brief questions that allow the witness to “ bloom ” in front of the jury .
If successful , the lawyer asking the questions almost seems invisible .
Many television interviewers have much to learn in this regard .
2 . Even if the interviewer knows the topic well ( usually they do n’t know the topic nearly as well as their guest ) , let the guest talk about it .
Get out of the way of the guest and let the guest actually have the necessary contiguous blocks of time in order to strut his or her stuff .
Those guests are experts at what you called them on the show to talk about .
Truly , if they were worthy of being on your show , they are capable of filling those relatively few minutes of time .
3 . Allow the guest an opportunity to put his or her best foot forward .
How often do you see an over - eager interviewer jumping in to interrupt the guest ?
Really , I do n’t care if the interviewer knows a lot of things about the topic .
I generally would rather hear it from the guest .
I do n’t want to hear the interviewer paraphrasing or summarizing the guest ’s own book in front of the guest .
I ’d much rather hear the guest do that .
Sometimes , of course , an interviewer has no intent on letting the guest actually express a view point .
Many Bill O’Reilly interviews are cases in point .
4 . Do n’t put words in the mouth of the guest and then , without allowing a guest to respond , ask the guest an unrelated question .
How often have you heard this technique : “ As we all know , President Bush is really doing a great job over in Iraq , now tell me , who is the odds on choice for next president of the United States ? ”
In a courtroom , the proper objection would be “ compound question . ”
5 . The interviewer should n’t spend time trying to convince me that they are a somebody by talking about who they know or how much they know .
If an interviewer brings that guest on your show , the interviewer should keep him or her the focus of the interview .
It ’s incredible how often a veteran interviewer will assume that the show is about the interviewer , rather than the guest .
I know this is getting somewhat redundant with the previous points , but it is amazing how often the guest is treated like an ornament rather than the reason for the show .
TV guests should be treated like guests we have over to our homes .
We all know how rude it would be to invite someone over for dinner , but then to monopolize the entire conversation with only our own opinions .
6 . Do n’t rush the interview .
This is often done because of the “ need ” for commercial breaks .
This need for commercial breaks is often caused , however , by the failure of the host to shut up and let the guest get to it ( see the previous rules ) .
Therefore , keep the introduction short , then turn to the guest and let her tell her story .
7 . Be prepared .
I suspect that much of the reason that so many interviewers waste time in interviews is that they have n’t really read the guest ’s book or they have n’t really taken the time to view the guest ’s new movie .
It appears that many interviewers think they can get away with a few questions put together by the show ’s staff , but there is no comparison to an interviewer who has really taken the time to understand the topic prior to conducting an interview .
8 . Do some serious cross-examination , but only after you have allowed the guest to put his or her best foot forward .
Make the guest clarify vague points .
Challenge the guest to provide evidence for his or her conclusions .
Point out sources of bias .
In order to do these things , of course , one must be prepared for the interview ( see the previous point ) .
9 . Do n’t limit your choice of guests to those who have fringe viewpoints .
Yes , fringe viewpoint always make for “ interesting ” interviews .
Perhaps “ interesting ” is not the right word , however .
Perhaps the right word is “ antagonizing . ”
Most network news interviewers think they have covered the whole spectrum of thought when they pick someone from the far right and someone from the far left to talk past each other for three minutes .
How much more useful it would be for news programs to pick thoughtful people of various moderate viewpoints , people who would be willing to recognize and meaningfully discuss points other than the ones they themselves advocate .
Guests with moderate viewpoints have the potential of actually engaging with each other in an interview .
10 . Carefully listen to the guest .
If you ’ve invited somebody of substance on your show , you will eventually learn something when they speak .
Therefore , do n’t just run down your list of questions written out by your staff .
If you actively listen to your guest , you will have an opportunity to see a gem of a conversation emerge , something your audience will treasure long after the show is over .
Firing Idiots !
There I was , sitting at work on another boring afternoon .
Then BAM !!
One of my fellow office workers proves how useless they are ... again .
You know their type .
They need to have their hand held whenever something goes wrong .
Without going into details for fear of getting into trouble and losing my job , why can't some people solve problems by themselves ?
They immediately and directly bother the most technical and productive people to figure out trivia issues that they should quickly figure out for themselves .
And when they do have a real difficult problem that involves analysis and thinking , they give up without seriously trying to solve the problem first .
They are also not even able to explain their problems in any useful way either .
I think as soon as they hit a problem that they have never encountered before , their brains turn off and work comes to a complete halt until they are rescued .
It is getting more and more painful for me to deal with stupid people who should know better , because they have college degrees and several years of experience .
I can understand new employees , especially young kids straight out of college , having these types of problems , but these issues happen almost everyday even with senior employees that have lots more experience than me .
Do n't managers see the uselessness , counter - productivity , and extreme slowness in accomplishing basic tasks from certain individuals in their teams ?
I am beginning to think that managers are blind to these problems ; because they either do not care , are not looking at their people as the source of their problems , think some productivity is better than none especially if hiring a replacement is too difficult , or think firing someone is not worth the hassle in a large corporation .
As a result , I wish I could fire idiots .
Right there on the spot .
Would n't it be nice to say , " You 're a useless and unproductive idiot !
You 're fired ! "
The company that I work for would be so much better off for it .
Morale would be higher .

People with high cholesterol live the longest .
This statement seems so incredible that it takes a long time to clear one´s brainwashed mind to fully understand its importance .
Yet the fact that people with high cholesterol live the longest emerges clearly from many scientific papers .
Consider the finding of Dr. Harlan Krumholz of the Department of Cardiovascular Medicine at Yale University , who reported in 1994 that old people with low cholesterol died twice as often from a heart attack as did old people with a high cholesterol .
1
Supporters of the cholesterol campaign consistently ignore his observation , or consider it as a rare exception , produced by chance among a huge number of studies finding the opposite .
But it is not an exception ; there are now a large number of findings that contradict the lipid hypothesis .
To be more specific , most studies of old people have shown that high cholesterol is not a risk factor for coronary heart disease .
This was the result of my search in the Medline database for studies addressing that question .
2
Eleven studies of old people came up with that result , and a further seven studies found that high cholesterol did not predict all - cause mortality either .
Now consider that more than 90 % of all cardiovascular disease is seen in people above age 60 also and that almost all studies have found that high cholesterol is not a risk factor for women .
2
This means that high cholesterol is only a risk factor for less than 5 % of those who die from a heart attack .
But there is more comfort for those who have high cholesterol ; six of the studies found that total mortality was inversely associated with either total or LDL - cholesterol , or both .
This means that it is actually much better to have high than to have low cholesterol if you want to live to be very old .
High Cholesterol Protects Against Infection
Many studies have found that low cholesterol is in certain respects worse than high cholesterol .
For instance , in 19 large studies of more than 68,000 deaths , reviewed by Professor David R. Jacobs and his co-workers from the Division of Epidemiology at the University of Minnesota , low cholesterol predicted an increased risk of dying from gastrointestinal and respiratory diseases .
3
Most gastrointestinal and respiratory diseases have an infectious origin .
Therefore , a relevant question is whether it is the infection that lowers cholesterol or the low cholesterol that predisposes to infection ?
To answer this question Professor Jacobs and his group , together with Dr. Carlos Iribarren , followed more than 100,000 healthy individuals in the San Francisco area for fifteen years .
At the end of the study those who had low cholesterol at the start of the study had more often been admitted to the hospital because of an infectious disease .
4,5
This finding cannot be explained away with the argument that the infection had caused cholesterol to go down , because how could low cholesterol , recorded when these people were without any evidence of infection , be caused by a disease they had not yet encountered ?
Is n´t it more likely that low cholesterol in some way made them more vulnerable to infection , or that high cholesterol protected those who did not become infected ?
Much evidence exists to support that interpretation .
Low Cholesterol and HIV / AIDS
Young , unmarried men with a previous sexually transmitted disease or liver disease run a much greater risk of becoming infected with HIV virus than other people .
The Minnesota researchers , now led by Dr. Ami Claxton , followed such individuals for 7 - 8 years .
After having excluded those who became HIV - positive during the first four years , they ended up with a group of 2446 men .
At the end of the study , 140 of these people tested positive for HIV ; those who had low cholesterol at the beginning of the study were twice as likely to test postitive for HIV compared with those with the highest cholesterol .
6
Similar results come from a study of the MRFIT screenees , including more than 300,000 young and middle - aged men , which found that 16 years after the first cholesterol analysis the number of men whose cholesterol was lower than 160 and who had died from AIDS was four times higher than the number of men who had died from AIDS with a cholesterol above 240.7
Cholesterol and Chronic Heart Failure
Heart disease may lead to a weakening of the heart muscle .
A weak heart means that less blood and therefore less oxygen is delivered to the arteries .
To compensate for the decreased power , the heart beat goes up , but in severe heart failure this is not sufficient .
Patients with severe heart failure become short of breath because too little oxygen is delivered to the tissues , the pressure in their veins increases because the heart cannot deliver the blood away from the heart with sufficient power , and they become edematous , meaning that fluid accumulates in the legs and in serious cases also in the lungs and other parts of the body .
This condition is called congestive or chronic heart failure .
There are many indications that bacteria or other microorganisms play an important role in chronic heart failure .
For instance , patients with severe chronic heart failure have high levels of endotoxin and various types of cytokines in their blood .
Endotoxin , also named lipopolysaccharide , is the most toxic substance produced by Gram - negative bacteria such as Escherichia coli , Klebsiella , Salmonella , Serratia and Pseudomonas .
Cytokines are hormones secreted by white blood cells in their battle with microorganisms ; high levels of cytokines in the blood indicate that inflammatory processes are going on somewhere in the body .
The role of infections in chronic heart failure has been studied by Dr. Mathias Rauchhaus and his team at the Medical Department , Martin - Luther - University in Halle , Germany ( Universitätsklinik und Poliklinik für Innere Medizin III , Martin - Luther - Universität , Halle ) .
They found that the strongest predictor of death for patients with chronic heart failure was the concentration of cytokines in the blood , in particular in patients with heart failure due to coronary heart disease .
8
To explain their finding they suggested that bacteria from the gut may more easily penetrate into the tissues when the pressure in the abdominal veins is increased because of heart failure .
In accordance with this theory , they found more endotoxin in the blood of patients with congestive heart failure and edema than in patients with non-congestive heart failure without edema , and endotoxin concentrations decreased significantly when the heart ’s function was improved by medical treatment .
9
A simple way to test the functional state of the immune system is to inject antigens from microorganisms that most people have been exposed to , under the skin .
If the immune system is normal , an induration ( hard spot ) will appear about 48 hours later at the place of the injection .
If the induration is very small , with a diameter of less than a few millimeters , this indicates the presence of “ anergy , ” a reduction in or failure of response to recognize antigens .
In accordance , anergy has been found associated with an increased risk of infection and mortality in healthy elderly individuals , in surgical patients and in heart transplant patients .
10
Dr. Donna Vredevoe and her group from the School of Nursery and the School of Medicine , University of California at Los Angeles tested more than 200 patients with severe heart failure with five different antigens and followed them for twelve months .
The cause of heart failure was coronary heart disease in half of them and other types of heart disease ( such as congenital or infectious valvular heart disease , various cardiomyopathies and endocarditis ) in the rest .
Almost half of all the patients were anergic , and those who were anergic and had coronary heart disease had a much higher mortality than the rest .10
Now to the salient point : to their surprise the researchers found that mortality was higher , not only in the patients with anergy , but also in the patients with the lowest lipid values , including total cholesterol , LDL - cholesterol and HDL - cholesterol as well as triglycerides .
The latter finding was confirmed by Dr. Rauchhaus , this time in co-operation with researchers at several German and British university hospitals .
They found that the risk of dying for patients with chronic heart failure was strongly and inversely associated with total cholesterol , LDL - cholesterol and also triglycerides ; those with high lipid values lived much longer than those with low values .
11,12
Other researchers have made similar observations .
The largest study has been performed by Professor Gregg C. Fonorow and his team at the UCLA Department of Medicine and Cardiomyopathy Center in Los Angeles.13
The study , led by Dr. Tamara Horwich , included more than a thousand patients with severe heart failure .
After five years 62 percent of the patients with cholesterol below 129 mg/l had died , but only half as many of the patients with cholesterol above 223 mg/l .
When proponents of the cholesterol hypothesis are confronted with findings showing a bad outcome associated with low cholesterol–and there are many such observations –they usually argue that severely ill patients are often malnourished , and malnourishment is therefore said to cause low cholesterol .
However , the mortality of the patients in this study was independent of their degree of nourishment ; low cholesterol predicted early mortality whether the patients were malnourished or not .
Smith - Lemli-Opitz Syndrome
As discussed in The Cholesterol Myths ( see sidebar ) , much evidence supports the theory that people born with very high cholesterol , so - called familial hypercholesterolemia , are protected against infection .
But if inborn high cholesterol protects against infections , inborn low cholesterol should have the opposite effect .
Indeed , this seems to be true .
Children with the Smith - Lemli - Opitz syndrome have very low cholesterol because the enzyme that is necessary for the last step in the body ’s synthesis of cholesterol does not function properly .
Most children with this syndrome are either stillborn or they die early because of serious malformations of the central nervous system .
Those who survive are imbecile , they have extremely low cholesterol and suffer from frequent and severe infections .
However , if their diet is supplemented with pure cholesterol or extra eggs , their cholesterol goes up and their bouts of infection become less serious and less frequent .
14
Laboratory Evidence
Laboratory studies are crucial for learning more about the mechanisms by which the lipids exert their protective function .
One of the first to study this phenomenon was Dr Sucharit Bhakdi from the Institute of Medical Microbiology , University of Giessen ( Institut für Medizinsche Mikrobiologie , Justus - Liebig - Universität Gießen ) , Germany along with his team of researchers from various institutions in Germany and Denmark .15
Staphylococcus aureus α- toxin is the most toxic substance produced by strains of the disease - promoting bacteria called staphylococci .
It is able to destroy a wide variety of human cells , including red blood cells .
For instance , if minute amounts of the toxin are added to a test tube with red blood cells dissolved in 0.9 percent saline , the blood is hemolyzed , that is the membranes of the red blood cells burst and hemoglobin from the interior of the red blood cells leaks out into the solvent .
Dr. Bhakdi and his team mixed purified α- toxin with human serum ( the fluid in which the blood cells reside ) and saw that 90 percent of its hemolyzing effect disappeared .
By various complicated methods they identified the protective substance as LDL , the carrier of the so - called bad cholesterol .
In accordance , no hemolysis occurred when they mixed α- toxin with purified human LDL , whereas HDL or other plasma constituents were ineffective in this respect .
Dr. Willy Flegel and his co-workers at the Department of Transfusion Medicine , University of Ulm , and the Institute of Immunology and Genetics at the German Cancer Research Center in Heidelberg , Germany ( DRK - Blutspendezentrale und Abteilung für Transfusionsmedizin , Universität Ulm , und Deutsches Krebsforschungszentrum , Heidelberg ) studied endotoxin in another way .
16 As mentioned , one of the effects of endotoxin is that white blood cells are stimulated to produce cytokines .
The German researchers found that the cytokine - stimulating effect of endotoxin on the white blood cells disappeared almost completely if the endotoxin was mixed with human serum for 24 hours before they added the white blood cells to the test tubes .
In a subsequent study17 they found that purified LDL from patients with familial hypercholesterolemia had the same inhibitory effect as the serum .
LDL may not only bind and inactivate dangerous bacterial toxins ; it seems to have a direct beneficial influence on the immune system also , possibly explaining the observed relationship between low cholesterol and various chronic diseases .
This was the starting point for a study by Professor Matthew Muldoon and his team at the University of Pittsburgh , Pennsylvania .
They studied healthy young and middle - aged men and found that the total number of white blood cells and the number of various types of white blood cells were significantly lower in the men with LDL - cholesterol below 160 mg / dl ( mean 88.3 mg/l ) , than in men with LDL - cholesterol above 160 mg/l ( mean 185.5 mg/l ) .18
The researchers cautiously concluded that there were immune system differences between men with low and high cholesterol , but that it was too early to state whether these differences had any importance for human health .
Now , seven years later with many of the results discussed here , we are allowed to state that the immune - supporting properties of LDL - cholesterol do indeed play an important role in human health .
Animal Experiments
The immune systems in various mammals including human beings have many similarities .
Therefore , it is interesting to see what experiments with rats and mice can tell us .
Professor Kenneth Feingold at the Department of Medicine , University of California , San Francisco , and his group have published several interesting results from such research .
In one of them they lowered LDL - cholesterol in rats by giving them either a drug that prevents the liver from secreting lipoproteins , or a drug that increases their disappearance .
In both models , injection of endotoxin was followed by a much higher mortality in the low - cholesterol rats compared with normal rats .
The high mortality was not due to the drugs because , if the drug - treated animals were injected with lipoproteins just before the injection of endotoxin , their mortality was reduced to normal .19
Dr. Mihai Netea and his team from the Departments of Internal and Nuclear Medicine at the University Hospital in Nijmegen , The Netherlands , injected purified endotoxin into normal mice , and into mice with familial hypercholesterolemia that had LDL - cholesterol four times higher than normal .
Whereas all normal mice died , they had to inject eight times as much endotoxin to kill the mice with familial hypercholesterolemia .
In another experiment they injected live bacteria and found that twice as many mice with familial hypercholesterolemia survived compared with normal mice .
20
Other Protecting Lipids
As seen from the above , many of the roles played by LDL - cholesterol are shared by HDL .
This should not be too surprising considering that high HDL - cholesterol is associated with cardiovascular health and longevity .
But there is more .
Triglycerides , molecules consisting of three fatty acids linked to glycerol , are insoluble in water and are therefore carried through the blood inside lipoproteins , just as cholesterol .
All lipoproteins carry triglycerides , but most of them are carried by a lipoprotein named VLDL ( very low - density lipoprotein ) and by chylomicrons , a mixture of emulsified triglycerides appearing in large amounts after a fat - rich meal , particularly in the blood that flows from the gut to the liver .
For many years it has been known that sepsis , a life - threatening condition caused by bacterial growth in the blood , is associated with a high level of triglycerides .
The serious symptoms of sepsis are due to endotoxin , most often produced by gut bacteria .
In a number of studies , Professor Hobart W. Harris at the Surgical Research Laboratory at San Francisco General Hospital and his team found that solutions rich in triglycerides but with practically no cholesterol were able to protect experimental animals from the toxic effects of endotoxin and they concluded that the high level of triglycerides seen in sepsis is a normal immune response to infection .
21 Usually the bacteria responsible for sepsis come from the gut .
It is therefore fortunate that the blood draining the gut is especially rich in triglycerides .
Exceptions
So far , animal experiments have confirmed the hypothesis that high cholesterol protects against infection , at least against infections caused by bacteria .
In a similar experiment using injections of Candida albicans , a common fungus , Dr. Netea and his team found that mice with familial hypercholesterolemia died more easily than normal mice .
22 Serious infections caused by Candida albicans are rare in normal human beings ; however , they are mainly seen in patients treated with immunosuppressive drugs , but the finding shows that we need more knowledge in this area .
However , the many findings mentioned above indicate that the protective effects of the blood lipids against infections in human beings seem to be greater than any possible adverse effects .
Cholesterol as a Risk Factor
Most studies of young and middle - aged men have found high cholesterol to be a risk factor for coronary heart disease , seemingly a contradiction to the idea that high cholesterol is protective .
Why is high cholesterol a risk factor in young and middle - aged men ?
A likely explanation is that men of that age are often in the midst of their professional career .
High cholesterol may therefore reflect mental stress , a well - known cause of high cholesterol and also a risk factor for heart disease .
Again , high cholesterol is not necessarily the direct cause but may only be a marker .
High cholesterol in young and middle - aged men could , for instance , reflect the body ’s need for more cholesterol because cholesterol is the building material of many stress hormones .
Any possible protective effect of high cholesterol may therefore be counteracted by the negative influence of a stressful life on the vascular system .
Response to Injury
In 1976 one of the most promising theories about the cause of atherosclerosis was the Response - to - Injury Hypothesis , presented by Russell Ross , a professor of pathology , and John Glomset , a professor of biochemistry and medicine at the Medical School , University of Washington in Seattle .23,24
They suggested that atherosclerosis is the consequence of an inflammatory process , where the first step is a localized injury to the thin layer of cells lining the inside of the arteries , the intima .
The injury causes inflammation and the raised plaques that form are simply healing lesions .
Their idea is not new .
In 1911 , two American pathologists from the Pathological Laboratories , University of Pittsburgh , Pennsylvania , Oskar Klotz and M.F. Manning , published a summary of their studies of the human arteries and concluded that “ there is every indication that the production of tissue in the intima is the result of a direct irritation of that tissue by the presence of infection or toxins or the stimulation by the products of a primary degeneration in that layer . ” 25 Other researchers have presented similar theories .
26
Researchers have proposed many potential causes of vascular injury , including mechanical stress , exposure to tobacco fumes , high LDL - cholesterol , oxidized cholesterol , homocysteine , the metabolic consequences of diabetes , iron overload , copper deficiency , deficiencies of vitamins A and D , consumption of trans fatty acids , microorganisms and many more .
With one exception , there is evidence to support roles for all of these factors , but the degree to which each of them participates remains uncertain .
The exception is of course LDL - cholesterol .
Much research allows us to exclude high LDL - cholesterol from the list .
Whether we look directly with the naked eye at the inside of the arteries at autopsy , or we do it indirectly in living people using x-rays , ultrasound or electron beams , no association worth mentioning has ever been found between the amount of lipid in the blood and the degree of atherosclerosis in the arteries .
Also , whether cholesterol goes up or down , by itself or due to medical intervention , the changes of cholesterol have never been followed by parallel changes in the atherosclerotic plaques ; there is no dose - response .
Proponents of the cholesterol campaign often claim that the trials indeed have found dose - response , but here they refer to calculations between the mean changes of the different trials with the outcome of the whole treatment group .
However , true dose - response demands that the individual changes of the putative causal factor are followed by parallel , individual changes of the disease outcome , and this has never occurred in the trials where researchers have calculated true dose - response .
A detailed discussion of the many factors accused of harming the arterial endothelium is beyond the scope of this article .
However , the protective role of the blood lipids against infections obviously demands a closer look at the alleged role of one of the alleged causes , the microorganisms .
Is Atherosclerosis an Infectious Disease ?
For many years scientists have suspected that viruses and bacteria , in particular cytomegalovirus and Chlamydia pneumonia ( also named TWAR bacteria ) participate in the development of atherosclerosis .
Research within this area has exploded during the last decade and by January 2004 , at least 200 reviews of the issue have been published in medical journals .
Due to the widespread preoccupation with cholesterol and other lipids , there has been little general interest in the subject , however , and few doctors know much about it .
Here I shall mention some of the most interesting findings .
26
Electron microscopy , immunofluorescence microscopy and other advanced techniques have allowed us to detect microorganisms and their DNA in the atherosclerotic lesions in a large proportion of patients .
Bacterial toxins and cytokines , hormones secreted by the white blood cells during infections , are seen more often in the blood from patients with recent heart disease and stroke , in particular during and after an acute cardiovascular event , and some of them are strong predictors of cardiovascular disease .
The same is valid for bacterial and viral antibodies , and a protein secreted by the liver during infections , named C- reactive protein ( CRP ) , is a much stronger risk factor for coronary heart disease than cholesterol .
Clinical evidence also supports this theory .
During the weeks preceding an acute cardiovascular attack many patients have had a bacterial or viral infection .
For instance , Dr. Armin J. Grau from the Department of Neurology at the University of Heidelberg and his team asked 166 patients with acute stroke , 166 patients hospitalized for other neurological diseases and 166 healthy individuals matched individually for age and sex about recent infectious disease .
Within the first week before the stroke , 37 of the stroke patients , but only 14 of the control individuals had had an infectious disease .
In half of the patients the infection was of bacterial origin , in the other half of viral origin.27
Similar observations have been made by many others , for patients with acute myocardial infarction ( heart attack ) .
For instance , Dr. Kimmo J. Mattila at the Department of Medicine , Helsinki University Hospital , Finland , found that 11 of 40 male patients with an acute heart attack before age 50 had an influenza - like infection with fever within 36 hours prior to admittance to hospital , but only 4 out of 41 patients with chronic coronary disease ( such as recurrent angina or pervious myocardial infarction ) and 4 out of 40 control individuals without chronic disease randomly selected from the general population .
28
Attempts have been made to prevent cardiovascular disease by treatment with antibiotics .
In five trials treatment of patients with coronary heart disease using azithromyzin or roxithromyzin , antibiotics that are effective against Chlamydia pneumonia , yielded successful results ; a total of 104 cardiovascular events occurred among the 412 non-treated patients , but only 61 events among the 410 patients in the treatment groups .
28a-e
In one further trial a significant decreased progression of atherosclerosis in the carotid arteries occurred with antibiotic treatment .
28 f However , in four other trials , 30 a -d one of which included more than 7000 patients , 28d antibiotic treatment had no significant effect .
The reason for these inconsistent results may be that the treatment was too short ( in one of the trials treatment lasted only five days ) .
Also , Chlamydia pneumonia , the TWAR bacteria , can only propagate inside human cells and when located in white blood cells they are resistant to antibiotics .
31 Treatment may also have been ineffective because the antibiotics used have no effect on viruses .
In this connection it is interesting to mention a controlled trial performed by Dr. Enrique Gurfinkel and his team from Fundación Favaloro in Buenos Aires , Argentina .32
They vaccinated half of 301 patients with coronary heart disease against influenza , a viral disease .
After six months 8 percent of the control patients had died , but only 2 percent of the vaccinated patients .
It is worth mentioning that this effect was much better than that achieved by any statin trial , and in a much shorter time .
Does High Cholesterol Protect Against Cardiovascular Disease ?
Apparently , microorganisms play a role in cardiovascular disease .
They may be one of the factors that start the process by injuring the arterial endothelium .
A secondary role may be inferred from the association between acute cardiovascular disease and infection .
The infectious agent may preferably become located in parts of the arterial walls that have been previously damaged by other agents , initiating local coagulation and the creation of a thrombus ( clot ) and in this way cause obstruction of the blood flow .
But if so , high cholesterol may protect against cardiovascular disease instead of being the cause !
In any case , the diet - heart idea , with its demonizing of high cholesterol , is obviously in conflict with the idea that high cholesterol protects against infections .
Both ideas can not be true .
Let me summarize the many facts that conflict with the idea that high cholesterol is bad .
If high cholesterol were the most important cause of atherosclerosis , people with high cholesterol should be more atherosclerotic than people with low cholesterol .
But as you know by now this is very far from the truth .
If high cholesterol were the most important cause of atherosclerosis , lowering of cholesterol should influence the atherosclerotic process in proportion to the degree of its lowering .
But as you know by now , this does not happen .
If high cholesterol were the most important cause of cardiovascular disease , it should be a risk factor in all populations , in both sexes , at all ages , in all disease categories , and for both heart disease and stroke .
But as you know by now , this is not the case
I have only two arguments for the idea that high cholesterol is good for the blood vessels , but in contrast to the arguments claiming the opposite they are very strong .
The first one stems from the statin trials .
If high cholesterol were the most important cause of cardiovascular disease , the greatest effect of statin treatment should have been seen in patients with the highest cholesterol , and in patients whose cholesterol was lowered the most .
Lack of dose - response cannot be attributed to the knowledge that the statins have other effects on plaque stabilization , as this would not have masked the effect of cholesterol - lowering considering the pronounced lowering that was achieved .
On the contrary , if a drug that effectively lowers the concentration of a molecule assumed to be harmful to the cardiovascular system and at the same time exerts several beneficial effects on the same system , a pronounced dose - response should be seen .
On the other hand , if high cholesterol has a protective function , as suggested , its lowering would counterbalance the beneficial effects of the statins and thus work against a dose - response , which would be more in accord with the results from the various trials .
I have already mentioned my second argument , but it ca n’t be said too often :
High cholesterol is associated with longevity in old people .
It is difficult to explain away the fact that during the period of life in which most cardiovascular disease occurs and from which most people die ( and most of us die from cardiovascular disease ) , high cholesterol occurs most often in people with the lowest mortality .
How is it possible that high cholesterol is harmful to the artery walls and causes fatal coronary heart disease , the commonest cause of death , if those whose cholesterol is the highest , live longer than those whose cholesterol is low ?
To the public and the scientific community I say , “ Wake up ! ”

Risk Factor
There is one risk factor that is known to be certain to cause death .
It is such a strong risk factor that it has a 100 percent mortality rate .
Thus I can guarantee that if we stop this risk factor , which would take no great research and cost nothing in monetary terms , within a century human deaths would be completely eliminated .
This risk factor is called “ Life . ”

Familial Hypercholesterolemia – Not as Risky as You May Think
Many doctors believe that most patients with familial hypercholesterolemia ( FH ) die from CHD at a young age .
Obviously , they do not know the surprising finding of the Scientific Steering Committee at the Department of Public Health and Primary Care at Radcliffe Infirmary in Oxford , England .
For several years , these researchers followed more than 500 FH patients between the ages of 20 and 74 and compared patient mortality during this period with that of the general population .
During a three - to four - year period , six of 214 FH patients below age 40 died from CHD .
This may not seem particularly frightening but as it is rare to die from CHD before the age of 40 , the risk for these FH patients was almost 100 times that of the general population .
During a four - to five - year period , eight of 237 FH patients between ages 40 and 59 died , which was five times more than the general population .
But during a similar period of time , only one of 75 FH patients between the ages of 60 and 74 died from CHD , when the expected number was two .
If these results are typical for FH , you could say that between ages 20 and 59 , about 3 percent of the patients die from CHD , and between ages 60 and 74 , less than 2 percent die , in both cases during a period of 3 - 4 years .
The authors stressed that the patients had been referred because of a personal or family history of premature vascular disease and therefore were at a particularly high risk for CHD .
Most patients with FH in the general population are unrecognized and untreated .
Had the patients studied been representative for all FH patients , their prognosis would probably have been even better .
This view was recently confirmed by Dr. Eric Sijbrands and his coworkers from various medical departments in Amsterdam and Leiden , Netherlands .
Out of a large group they found three individuals with very high cholesterol .
A genetic analysis confirmed the diagnosis of FH and by tracing their family members backward in time , they came up with a total of 412 individuals .
The coronary and total mortality of these members were compared with the mortality of the general Dutch population .
The striking finding was that those who lived during the 19th and early 20th century had normal mortality and lived a normal life span .
In fact , those living in the 19th century had a lower mortality than the general population .
After 1915 the mortality rose to a maximum between 1935 and 1964 , but even at the peak , mortality was less than twice as high as in the general population .
Again , very high cholesterol levels alone do not lead to a heart attack .
In fact , high cholesterol may even be protective against other diseases .
This was the conclusion of Dr. Sijbrands and his colleagues .
As support they cited the fact that genetically modified mice with high cholesterol are protected against severe bacterial infections .
“ Doctor , do n’t be afraid because of my high cholesterol . ”
These were the words of a 36 - year - old lawyer who visited me for the first time for a health examination .
And indeed , his cholesterol was high , over 400 mg/dl .
“ My father ’s cholesterol was even higher , ” he added .
“ But he lived happily until he died at age 79 from cancer .
And his brother , who also had FH , died at age 83 .
None of them ever complained of any heart problems . ”
My “ patient ” is now 53 , his brother is 56 and his cousin 61 .
All of them have extremely high cholesterol values , but none of them has any heart troubles , and none of them has ever taken cholesterol - lowering drugs .
So , if you happen to have FH , do n’t be too anxious .
Your chances of surviving are pretty good , even surviving to old age .

" What good fortune for those in power that people do not think " - Adolf Hitler , as quoted by Joachim Fest .
Is it still possible in today 's Germany to escape the realization that without the mistreatment of children , without a form of child - rearing based on violence to inculcate blind obedience , there would not have been a Hitler and his followers ?
And thus not millions of murdered victims either ?
Probably every thinking person in the post - war period has wondered at some time or other how it could have happened that a human being devised a gigantic machinery of death and found millions of helpers to set it in motion .
Yet the monster Adolf Hitler , murderer of millions , master of destruction and organized insanity , did not come into the world as a monster .
He was not sent to earth by the devil , as some people think , nor was he sent by heaven to " bring order " to Germany , to give the country the autobahn and rescue it from its economic crisis , as many others still believe .
Neither was he born with " destructive drives " , because there are no such things .
Our biological mission is to preserve life , not to destroy It .
Human destructiveness
Is never inborn , and inherited traits are neither good nor evil .
How they develop depends on one ’s character , which is formed
In the course of one 's life , and the nature of which depends , in turn , on the experiences one has , above all , in childhood and adolescence , and on the decisions one makes as an adult .
Like every other child , Hitler was born innocent , only to be raised , as were many children at the time , in a destructive fashion by his parents and later to make himself into a monster .
He was the survivor of a machinery of annihilation that in turn - of - the - century Germany was called " child - rearing " and that I call " the concealed concentration camp of childhood , " which is never allowed to be recognized for what it is .
I have described in detail how he made this concealed horror manifest in his Third Reich in my book For Your Own Good : Hidden cruelty in Child - Rearing and the Roots of Violence ( Farrar Straus Giroux , 1983 ) and In my other books , for example , Banished Knowledge and The Untouched Key ( both published by Doubleday ) .
There the reader will also find a detailed line of reasoning to support everything which , for reasons of space , I can only allude to here in a very abridged way .
In order not to die , all mistreated children must totally repress the mistreatment , deprivation , and bewilderment they have undergone because otherwise the child 's organism would n't be able to cope with the magnitude of the pain suffered .
Only as adults do they have other possibilities for dealing with their feelings .
If they do n't make use of these possibilities , then what was once the life - saving function of repression can be transformed Into a dangerous destructive , and self - destructive force .
In the careers of despots such as Hitler and Stalin , their suppressed fantasies of revenge can lead to indescribable atrocities .
This phenomenon does n't exist anywhere in the entire animal kingdom , for no animal is trained by its parents to deny its nature completely in order to become a " well - behaved " animal - only human beings act In such a destructive way .
According to the reports of Nazi criminals ( and also of soldiers who volunteered to fight in Vietnam ) , their unconscious programming to be violent began in every case with a brutal upbringing that demanded absolute obedience and expressed total contempt for the child .
I know of no example of this which is so well - documented and which demonstrates so clearly the consequences of the psychological murder of children - bringing along with it a form of collective blindness - than the fateful success of Adolf Hitler .
The Führer once told his secretary that during one of the regular beatings given him by his father he was able to stop crying , to feel nothing , and even to count the thirty - two blows he received .
In this way , by totally denying his pain , his feelings of powerlessness , and his despair - in other words , by denying the truth - Hitler made himself into a master of violence and of contempt for human beings .
The result was a very primitive person , incapable of any empathy for other people .
He was mercilessly and constantly driven to new destructive acts by his latent feelings of hatred and revenge .
After millions had been forced to die for this reason , those feelings still haunted him in his sleep .
Hermann Rauschning reports nocturnal paroxysms of screaming on the Führer ’s part , along with " inexplicable counting " , which I trace back to the counting he did during the beatings of his childhood .
Hitler did not invent fascism ; he found it , like so many of his contemporaries ) prefigured in the totalitarian regime of his family .
The National Socialist version of fascism , however , does bear unmistakable traces of Hitler ’s childhood .
But his early experience was by no means an exception .
Thus , neither Gerhart Hauptmann nor Martin Heidegger nor many other celebrated intellects of the day were able to see through Hitler ’s madness .
To do so , they would have had to be able to see through the madness of their own upbringing .
Hitler could make Europe and the world into the battlefield of his childhood because in the Germany of that time there were millions of people who had experienced the same kind of upbringing he had .
Although not necessarily conscious of the fact , they took the following principles to be self - evident :
Not life but order and obedience are the highest values .
Only by means of violence can order be created and preserved .
Creativity ( embodied in the child ) represents a danger for the adult and must be destroyed .
Obeying one ’s father absolutely is the highest law .
Disobedience and criticism are unthinkable because they are punished with beatings or the threat of death .
The living , vital child must be turned as early as possible into an obedient robot , a slave .
Undesirable feelings and real needs must therefore be suppressed as vigorously as possible .
Mothers must never protect their children from punishment by the father but after each incidence of torture must preach to them to honor and love their parents .
Fortunately , there were persons now and again with whom a child could find refuge from this totalitarian regime , and perhaps even experience love , respect , and protection .
On the basis of these good experiences , even simply on the basis of the comparison they provided , a child could at least pass inward judgment on the cruelty endured and not want to inflict it in turn later on .
But when there were no witnesses to come to the rescue , the child had no choice in this bizarre scenario but to stifle every natural reflex such as anger or even laughter , and to practice absolute obedience daily in order to keep the father 's menacing behavior within bearable limits .
It was this kind of early character training that Hitler was later able to exploit .
In strict accordance with this system of child - rearing he then developed his Nazi ideology , which had the following practical consequences :
The will of the Führer is the highest law .
The Führer will forcibly create order and make Germany into the paradise of the Aryans , the master race .
Those who submit like robots to his orders will be rewarded .
Whoever dares to offer criticism will be sent to a concentration camp .
Jews and gypsies must be annihilated - men , women and children .
The disabled and mentally ill are likewise to be put to death .
Poles and Russians are fit to become useful slaves .
Free art is dangerous and " degenerate " ; like every other form of free creativity , It must be persecuted .
Without the numerous documentary films that attest to the frenzied acclaim Hitler received , no one today would believe that a madman with this ideology of contempt for human beings could generate so much enthusiasm .
How was it at all possible that Hitler found such an immense number of followers ?
By promising his people a solution to all their problems and by offering them a scapegoat ?
Certainly .
But that alone would not have been enough .
In order to use untold numbers of people as marionettes , he had to make his promises in the style of the domineering , violent father most of his followers knew , feared , and admired .
From the history of human sacrifice - from cannibalism to the Aztecs - we can learn how some religions have sanctified such acts in order to exonerate parents ' crimes against their children .
Whoever reads this history with open eyes is struck again and again by the same pattern : " If I do to others what was once done to me , then I do n't need to feel all the pain I would otherwise have to experience .
If I put everything in ideological or religious packaging and repeat all the lies those around me have been taught to believe , I will have many followers .
If , in addition , I - like Hitler - make use of my acting talent and imitate the manner of the threatening father whom almost everyone once believed blindly and absolutely and whom everyone feared , then I 'll be able to find countless helpers for every conceivable crime - all the more easily , the more absurd the crime . "
The famous Milgram experiment , in which participants complied with instructions given by an authority figure to administer electric shocks of increasing intensity to other participants , has proved this very convincingly .
For many adults , formerly obedient children , are just waiting for a legal form of discharge of the rage they pent up decades earlier .
In the mistreatment of their own children , known as " child - rearing , " or in wars and genocide , society offers them this discharge and the culturally specific label to go with it .
What point is there for us today in learning about Hitler and his history ?
For me , the main point is this : our knowledge will serve as a warning against our blindness and encourage us to give it up once and for all and to struggle against collective repression .
This is what I do consistently in all my books in order to help people understand the psychodynamics of the mistreatment of children and its immeasurable danger for society , as demonstrated by Hitler 's case .
My explanations are by no means intended to suggest pity for a man as merciless as Hitler .
it was in large part owing to Hitler and his history that I became aware of the dangers of our traditional morality .
We are exhorted to honor our parents and never question them no matter what they have done .
Yet when I realize that millions of human beings had to die so that Adolf Hitler could keep his repression of childhood trauma intact , that millions were subjected to humiliation in concentration camps so that he never had to recognize how he had once been humiliated , then I believe that one can't point out these connections often enough in order to shed light on this unconscious production of evil .
How should young people be expected to recognize and reject inhumanity and crime if these continue to be disguised instead of being pointed out as plainly as possible ?
Only when young people are permitted to know exactly what happened and how it could happen , only if they do n't allow anything to stifle their curiosity and are not afraid of the truth , can they free themselves from the burden placed upon them by their forebears ' blindness .
If Hitler 's name
Is no longer taboo in Germany , then these findings will also be able to bring new knowledge to light and create a new stimulus to understanding .
The greatest obstacle
In this regard is to deny the mistreatment one suffered as a child and to defend oneself against it at the expense of others : of children , of subordinates of partners , or of voters .
As recently as 1997 , more than half of the parents in West Germany were in favor of corporal punishment as a means of bringing up children - in spite of the many years of effort on the part of the Child Protection League to enlighten the public .
Where does this persistent lack of awareness stem from ?
Why do n’t these parents know that physical or - as the case may be - psychological punishment constitutes degradation and mistreatment of children and always , sooner or later , has destructive consequences , whether visible or concealed ?
Why do n't they know that with their demonstrably false claim that striking children is absolutely necessary and completely harmless they are affirming , preserving , and perpetuating a destructive tradition ?
They do n't know this because they are familiar from their own experience only with this form of child - rearing and had to learn at an early age to regard it as normal and harmless .
In their eyes , violent methods are the only effective corrective for a child ’s behavior .
For this reason , they construct complicated theories to explain Nazi Germany 's murder of millions .
That seems easier to them than to experience the pain and degradation they once felt at being beaten as children even though this could unlock the door to awareness , an awareness that would protect their children from mistreatment and themselves from their blindness as parents and voters .
If they are in government , then their awareness would perhaps also save entire nations from wars and other senseless sacrifices .
Countless human beings have already been killed in wars whose instigators did n't want to realize they were carrying dynamite which they were constantly trying to get rid of at the expense of other people in order to take revenge for old , highly personal wounds .
Faced with even the merest possibility of a nuclear war , we must not allow ourselves to ignore this knowledge any longer .
And yet we do just that : innumerable experts and officials occupy themselves daily and hourly with the consequences of child abuse without being able to know and see these consequences for what they are .
Even the most macabre childhood does n't exonerate a criminal from the guilt that consists in his destruction of life .
As an adult he has the opportunity of confronting his childhood , of not denying the horror he endured then , of experiencing the hatred that was repressed and understanding its justification .
Hatred experienced consciously
Is only a feeling , and feelings do n't kill .
But destructive actions blindly directed at ersatz objects are deeds which can cost human beings their lives and for which the perpetrator must bear the blame .
Perhaps our grandchildren will be able to say ; " What good fortune that we were n't beaten like our grandparents and now are able to see things much more clearly than they did .
If being beaten in childhood had been harmless , they would n't have been blind to Hitler 's contempt for human beings ; they would have seen through it immediately and rejected it , as our children do when confronted with acts of cruelty .
Children who are permitted to defend themselves do n't become destructive .
It Is evident that destructiveness is not the inevitable fate of humankind , for the loving treatment of children could banish it from the world .
The " destructive drive " slumbers in children who were once mistreated and who later do n't want to know what happened to them in their past .
We ourselves have no need to strike our defenseless children ; we can't even imagine doing that , even when we 're tired and have no patience for their questions .
After all , there are so many other ways to treat children that are truly productive , respectful , and not destructive .
It is just as impossible for us to imagine having been fascinated by a Hitler .
People who were treated with respect as children , who were n't drilled to become robots with the aid of mistreatment , will never want to die out of " faithfulness to the Führer " or send thousands of human beings to Stalingrad against all reason just because some madman planned it .
But Hitler 's generals stood at attention
In the Fürher ’s headquarters , and all counter - arguments dissolved into fear and mental paralysis or , on the other hand , into enthusiasm when they heard him ( the father ) speak .
This disastrous political blindness that cost millions of people their lives proves conclusively what our grandparents so hotly denied : that in every case , physical as well as psychological abuse of the child is not only harmful but highly dangerous .
Not only for the individual but under certain circumstances for whole nations .
My First DMCA Takedown
That did n't take long .

Here 's the NFL 's demand ( not very informative ) .
Researchers have for the first time ’ watched ’ in real time single molecules of catalyst participating in a reaction at a solid - liquid interface .
The work presents unique information into the way that certain reactions occur at the single - molecule level and could provide new insights into the design of catalysts .
Johannes Elemans of Radboud University Nijmegen in the Netherlands and colleagues used scanning tunneling microscopy ( STM ) to observe porphyrin molecules catalyse the oxidation of an alkene to an epoxide .
STM works by scanning an ultra - sharp metal tip across a surface .
When a voltage is applied between the tip and the surface , electrons tunnel between the two , the tunneling current being proportional to the distance between the tip and surface features .
In this way molecular features on the surface can be mapped .
Elemans and his team deposited a layer of manganese porphyrins - large , flat organic molecules possessing a single manganese atom at the centre - onto a gold surface .
The researchers noticed that in the presence of molecular oxygen , the characteristics of adjacent pairs of porphyrin molecules changed - showing up as clear bright spots in the microscope , with each molecule evidently acquiring a single atom of oxygen .
When an alkene is introduced to the system the porphyrins transfer the oxygen to the alkene to form an epoxide , leaving the porphyrin to participate in another cycle of catalysis .
The researchers were able to take STM ’ snapshots ’ of the reaction throughout the process .
The team postulates that by binding to the gold surface , the manganese centre of porphyrin becomes reduced and is able to split molecular oxygen into two atoms , which become distributed between pairs of adjacent porphyrins and are then available for catalytic transfer to the alkene .
In a commentary accompanying the research , Simon Higgins and Richard Nichols of the University of Liverpool , UK , say that the ability of Elemans ’ team to capture high - resolution snapshots of these events at the molecular level represents a breakthrough that offers ’ new molecular - level insights concerning the mechanism of this reaction . ’
They add , ’ It is clearly exciting that catalytic reactions on surfaces can be imaged under ambient laboratory conditions . ’
Higgins and Nichols point out , however , that to follow other such reactions in real time , the rate and turnover of the reactions must tally with the maximum rate that images can be obtained by STM .
’ This consideration is likely to limit the number of ambient reactions that can be meaningfully studied with this technique , at least at this stage , ’ they say .

The next shuttle flight will not be until at least next March
Engineers need to find a solution to the foam debris problem which re-emerged during Discovery 's launch .
Seven members of an oversight panel also say Nasa 's latest shuttle efforts were tainted by some of the problems that caused the Columbia disaster .
The official heading the team looking at the issue said it would take until early next year at least to find a fix .
Nasa did n't look in detail at foam shedding from the tank for 113 flights - and shame on us
Dr Mike Griffin , Nasa administrator
" From an overall standpoint we think really March 4th is the time frame we are looking at , " said Bill Gerstenmaier , Nasa 's new head of space operations and the official overseeing the foam fix .
" The teams are making very good progress .
But we 're still not complete by any stretch of the imagination . "
Tank changes
Nasa chief Michael Griffin told journalists at a press briefing in Washington that there had been complacency in the agency in the past .
But that there was now a new culture at Nasa .
" For good or ill - and obviously , it was for ill , a poor choice of words on my part - we in Nasa did n't look in detail at foam shedding from the tank for 113 flights - and shame on us , " Dr Griffin said .
Shuttle Atlantis will have to wait for its moment in the limelight
A 1lb ( 450g ) chunk of insulation foam peeled off the Pal ramp area of the tank during launch on 26 July .
The issue is important because it was just such a piece of insulation that was shed from space shuttle Columbia 's tank in during its launch in 2003 .
The foam punched a hole in Columbia 's left wing , allowing super - heated gases to enter the vehicle as it attempted re-entry into Earth 's atmosphere 16 days later .
The shuttle broke up , killing seven astronauts .
Minority report
Seven members of an oversight panel said Nasa had not learned key lessons that had emerged from the Columbia disaster .
Their " minority report " was contained within the final report by the 26 - member Return to Flight task group appointed to evaluate how the US space agency meets the recommendations by the Columbia Accident Investigation Board ( Caib ) .
So much emphasis was placed on trying to meet unrealistic launch dates that some safety improvements were skipped , said the seven members .
" We expected that Nasa leadership would set high standards for post - Columbia work ... we were , overall , disappointed , " the panellists wrote in the report .
The seven critics included a former shuttle astronaut , former undersecretary of the Navy , a former congressional budget office director , former moon rocket engineer , a retired nuclear engineer and two university professors .
Dr Griffin said that he was " changing the game " on thinking regarding the shuttle 's useage by Nasa ahead of its September 2010 retirement .
It was originally calculated that about 28 further shuttle flights would be needed to complete the International Space Station .
That prediction was later reduced to about 15 .
Now , Dr Griffin said , Nasa was " not trying to get a specific number of flights out of the shuttle system " .
He added : " The United States has a commitment to its partners to complete the station .
We believe that , absent of major problems , we ... can essentially complete assembly of the station with the shuttle fleet in the time that we have remaining . "
Space shuttle Discovery blasted off from Kennedy Space Center , near Cape Canaveral in Florida , on 26 July .
Reader Hanji alerts us to a hack pulled off when Randall Munroe , author of the popular webcomic XKCD , spoke at MIT by invitation of the Lab for Computer Science .
MIT hackers dropped hundreds of labelled playpen balls onto the audience from hatches in the ceiling .
The labels bore XKCD 's logo as well as the recently discovered 16 - byte AACS processing key .
At another point in Munroe 's talk he was stalked by remote - controlled mechanical velociraptors ; but fortunately he had been supplied with a squirt gun full of grape juice .
Che Guevara fans are preparing to commemorate one more anniversary of the revolutionarys death , which took place thirty - eight years ago at the Yuro ravine in Bolivia .
It s an appropriate time to address ten myths that keep Guevaras cult alive .
The last time I visited the Museum of Modern Art in New York , an American student wearing a Che Guevara T - Shirt and a beret caught my eye ( the fact that Nicole Kidman happened to walk in at that very moment may have had something to do with my noticing him ) .
I asked him politely what exactly he admired so much about that man .
Here are the ten reasons he mentioned and my response .
1.HE WAS AGAINST CAPITALISM .
In fact , Guevara was for state capitalism .
He opposed the wage labor system of appropriating surplus value ( in Marxist jargon ) only when it came to private corporations .
But he turned the appropriation of the workers  surplus value into a state system .
One example of this is the forced labor camps he supported , starting with Guanahacabibes in 1961 .
2. HE MADE CUBA INDEPENDENT .
In fact , he engineered the colonization of Cuba by a foreign power .
He was instrumental in turning Cuba into a temporary beachhead of Soviet nuclear power ( he sealed the deal in Yalta ) .
As the person responsible for the industrialization of Cuba he failed to end the countrys dependency on sugar .
3. HE STOOD FOR SOCIAL JUSTICE .
In fact , he helped ruin the economy by diverting resources to industries that ended up in failure and reduced the sugar harvest , Cubas mainstay , by half in two years .
Rationing started under his stewardship of the islands economy .
4. HE STOOD UP TO MOSCOW .
In fact , he obeyed Moscow until Moscow decided to ask for something in return for its massive transfers of money to Havana .
In 1965 he criticized the Kremlin because it had adopted what he termed the law of value .
He then turned to China on the eve of the Cultural Revolution , one of the horror stories of the twentieth century .
He simply switched allegiances within the totalitarian camp .
5. HE CONNECTED WITH THE PEASANTS .
In fact , he died precisely because he never connected with them .
 The peasant masses dont help us at all ,  he wrote in his Bolivian diary before he was captured an apt way to describe his journey through the Bolivian countryside trying to stir up a revolution that could not even enlist the help of Bolivian Communists ( who were realistic enough to note that peasants did not want revolution in 1967 ; they had already had one in 1952 ) .
6. HE WAS A GUERRILLA GENIUS .
With the exception of Cuba , every guerrilla effort he helped set up failed pitifully .
After the triumph of the Cuban revolution , Guevara set up revolutionary armies in Nicaragua , the Dominican Republic , Panama , and Haiti , all of which were crushed .
He later persuaded Jorge Ricardo Masetti to lead a fatal incursion into that country from Bolivia .
Guevaras role in the Congo in 1965 was both tragic and comical .
He allied himself with Pierre Mulele and Laurent Kabila , two butchers , but got entangled in so many disagreements with the latter and relations between Cuban and Congolese fighters were so strained that he had to flee .
Finally , his incursion in Bolivia ended up in his death , which his followers are commemorating this Sunday .
7. HE RESPECTED HUMAN DIGNITY .
In fact , he had a habit of taking other peoples property .
He told his followers to rob banks ( the struggling masses agree to rob banks because none of them has a penny in them ) and as soon as the Batista regime collapsed he occupied a mansion and made it his own a case of expeditious revolutionary eminent domain .
8. HIS ADVENTURES WERE A CELEBRATION OF LIFE .
Instead , they were an orgy of death .
He executed many innocent people in Santa Clara , in central Cuba , where his column was based in the last stage of the armed struggle .
After the triumph of the revolution , he was in charge of  La Cabaña prison for half a year .
He ordered the execution of hundreds of prisoners former Batista men , journalists , businessmen , and others .
A few witnesses , including Javier Arzuaga , who was the chaplain of  La Cabaña , and José Vilasuso , who was a member of the body in charge of the summary judicial process , recently gave me their painful testimonies .
9. HE WAS A VISIONARY .
His vision of Latin America was actually quite blurred .
Take , for instance , his view that the guerrillas had to take to the countryside because that is where the struggling masses lived .
In fact , since the 1960s , most peasants have peacefully deserted the countryside in part because of the failure of land reform , which has hindered the development of a property - based agriculture and economies of scale with absurd regulations forbidding all sorts of private arrangements .
10 . HE WAS RIGHT ABOUT THE UNITED STATES .
He predicted Cuba would surpass the GDP per capita of the U.S. by 1980 .
Today , Cubas economy can barely survive thanks to Venezuelas oil subsidy ( about 100,000 barrels a day ) , a form of international alms that does not speak too well of the regimes dignity .
The US has had mixed results from its missile tests
Poland has confirmed the US wants to negotiate the use of its territory to build part of its missile defence base .
On Sunday , the US asked permission from the Czech Republic and received the backing of Czech PM Mirek Topolanek .
Washington says it needs interceptor missiles in Europe to stop attacks by states like Iran or North Korea .
It hopes to build a radar station in the Czech Republic and to site interceptors in Poland .
Poland 's Deputy Foreign Minister Witold Waszczykowski confirmed that Washington has approached Warsaw over the project and said : " We are now waiting for firm proposals . "
It is very doubtful that elements of the national US missile defence system in eastern Europe were aimed at Iranian missiles
Lt Gen Vladimir Popovkin ,
Russian space forces
But Moscow insists that the installation of US missiles in countries close to its western border would change the strategic balance in Europe .
Lt Gen Vladimir Popovkin , commander of Russia 's space forces , said Moscow would interpret the move as a military threat .
" Our analysis shows that the deployment of a radar station in the Czech Republic and a counter - missile position in Poland are an obvious threat to us .
" It is very doubtful that elements of the national US missile defence system in eastern Europe were aimed at Iranian missiles , as has been stated , " he said .
Moscow has warned of " negative consequences " if Prague agrees to host the missile system .
Political issues
Mr Topolanek , the Czech prime minister , has welcomed the US request .
" We are convinced that a possible deployment of the radar station on our territory is in our interest , " he said at the weekend .
" It will increase security of the Czech Republic and Europe . "
However , Mr Topolanek could face a struggle having the plans approved by both houses of the country 's parliament .
His three - party , centre - right governing coalition recently won a vote of confidence , but controls just 100 of 200 seats in the lower house .
There is domestic opposition to the scheme in the Czech Republic , with reports that 200 protesters rallied against the missile defence plans in Prague on Monday .
The US has already built missile interceptor sites in Alaska and in California , but says it needs to expand into Europe to counter growing threats from further afield .

＃判決文を読んでいない（最高裁のWebが激込み…）状態で推測ベースで書くのも気が引けるのですが…。
で、いわゆる 「カラオケ法理」というのは、「著作物の利用」が行われていることが前提の下で、いくつかの条件（管理性、誘因性、有償性など）が整った場合には、直接利用者（だけ）ではなく、環境の提供側が（も）侵害の主体となる、という考え方（「侵害者は誰か」が論点）です。
したがって、 「カラオケ法理」をベースに論を展開するのであれば、「今後新たに○○という行為が著作権侵害に該当しうる」という論理展開にはなりえません。
＃もちろん、「個人 」 が「公衆」となるが故に私的使用の枠外となり、結果著作権侵害となる行為もあるわけですが、これは「カラオケ法理」の外の話（行為の主体が確定した上での、単純な著作権法の当てはめ）です。
概観としては 、

にもかかわらず、今回の判決で著作権侵害の恐れがある行為が拡大される、とコメント欄やトラックバック（さらに本記事にリンクを張っている２ちゃんやスラド）で誤解している方が多々いらっしゃる、というのが「誤解を広める」と私が主張しているベースです。
＃現にalbさんも「全インターネットは違法」と勘違いされていますし。
なお今回の事案に関して付言すると、「公衆が利用することを目的として設置された自動複製機」を用いた複製は私的使用に含まれません（著作権法第３０条第１項第１号）ので、「レコードの著作物」を「携帯電話」へ複製することを「容易化」するシステムを誰もが利用可能な状況にあるのであれば、それを利用する行為も利用させる行為も複製権の侵害に当たります。
＃携帯電話に個人がコンテンツを入力することは現状困難であり、だからこそMYUTAのようなサービスが成立するのでしょうが、そうれあればあるほど「自動複製機である」という主張が通りやすくなります。
＃またここでいう「公衆」は、「複製したものを利用できるのが公衆」でなく「複製機を利用できるのが公衆」です。したがって、記事中に引用されている判決の考え方は、法適用的には明らかに正しい。
その一方で 、ftpやメール送信などは、通常の記録媒体（FD,CD,DVD,USBメモリなど）の代わりにサーバーを使うに過ぎませんので「容易化」とは言い難く、さらに「著作権侵害以外の真っ当な使い方」をいくらでも説明できるので「複製機」ともいえない可能性すらあるため、その役務提供全体をとらえて「複製権の侵害」と主張することは極めて困難と考えられます。
＃取り扱ったデータを個々に見れば、それが著作権の侵害に当たることはあり得ると思います。
また、ftpなどにおける公衆送信権侵害については、もっぱらその目的で利用されていることを管理者が認知している状況でなければ、管理者が主体とみなすことは困難です（ファイル・ローグ事件の判例を参照ください）。
したがって、報道ベースの情報から想定されうる副作用は極めて限定的であるにもかかわらず、著作権法の解釈の基本を示さず、かつ知財の専門家という属性を知らしめた上で、「副作用が大きすぎる」「この判決では、（略：役務を限定していない、という趣旨）ようなので、影響は広範囲です」と無用の混乱をあおる行為は、極めて無責任と私は考えます。
最後に、私もネットワーク上のサービスに対する今回の判決の影響範囲を見積もることは極めて重要だと考えています。ただ、そのために必要なのは、「どのような条件が積み重なった結果として今回の結論に至ったのか」という（判決文をベースにした）冷静な分析であり、この記事のように判決分も読まずに無用の心配の種をまき散らす存在は迷惑でしかありません。
Flying into my home city of Tucson , Arizona late one night in November , I was impressed by how rigid a grid the city ’s layout is .
Tucson is one of America ’s planned cities , and from the sky , it ’s easy to see that Tucson ’s designers succeeded in creating a city in which everything is laid out according to a precise plan ( figure 1 ) .
Article Continues Below
Figure 1
I was returning home from London , which in contrast is far from a rigid grid .
London is spirals , circles , tangets , and is often seemingly spontaneous in its design ( figure 2 ) .
Figure 2
Because I ’d been thinking about this article for some time , the aerial view of these cities struck me as an apt metaphor for grid design on the web .
With today ’s technologies and techniques , we are free to create grid designs — or we can choose to break out of grids completely .
That such choice can empower a web designer is unquestionable : the true challenge lies in the way we bring ourselves to “ lose small mind ” and think outside the grid .
Sense and the city #section2
If we extend the urban - planning metaphor to web design , there are very interesting parallels .
Grid - based design can be extraordinarily useful in creating sites that are predictable , easily navigated , and visually appealing .
Grids are really good at helping designers to plan where things go , and easy for site visitors to use ( figure 3 ) .
Figure 3 : Ryan Brill
On the plus side , Tucson certainly is easy to get around in ; you need n’t have much more than a basic sense of direction or a street map .
Residents provide directions to their homes by giving cues based on the grid : “ I ’m at the southwest corner of Campbell Avenue and Prince Road . ”
Public roadways and transportation typically run north to south or east to west , making it easy to navigate the town .
On the other hand , Tucson ’s designers planned for only a certain amount of growth , and this has caused innumerable problems in maintaining the city ’s ease of navigation and usability as the city grew beyond its planned limits .
Furthermore , the constraints of Tucson ’s grid do not encourage the emergence of alternative neighborhoods and communities .
Many residents of Tucson will agree that the city lacks a vibrant center — or many unique communities — as a result , and that when those isolated spots do exist , they ’re easy to get to , but people are n’t motivated to get out and find them .
London , unlike Tucson , is a maze .
I know Londoners who carry around a London A - Z guidebook to help them navigate !
The city ’s transportation system is so challenging that would - be cab drivers must pass a test demonstrating that they possess “ The Knowledge ” in order to drive traditional black cabs .
The city ’s organic growth has n’t exactly made it the easiest place to navigate .
But in London , wonderful enclaves and interesting areas have emerged and neighborhoods with distinct flavor exist everywhere — and it can certainly be said that there are n’t just one or two central areas of cultural , community interests , but many .
While navigation is perhaps more difficult , there are more alternatives , and people are therefore more motivated and able to become involved in the city ’s offerings .
When examining deconstructed and spontaneous designs , the metaphor persists .
How are people to navigate spirals and winding alleyways with ease ?
On the other hand , compelling visual work can result from breaking out of the rigid system that the Web ’s design and development environment has , to date , retained .
In figure 4 , you can easily see how breaking down the rigid confines of grid layouts challenges designers to maintain ease of use while creating designs that look different from what we ’re so accustomed to seeing .

Coding the grid fantastic #section3
It ’s fascinating to me , as a person who tends to be a bit more code - centric than design - capable , to see how cemented to code our designs have been .
I believe it ’s been the constraints of the table - based layout that have kept us in visual gridlock for so long ( figure 5 ) .
Add that to an only - now emerging understanding of CSS layout and it ’s easy to figure out the reasons why .
Figure 5 : k10k
Table layouts are great for grid designs .
The markup itself reproduces a specific grid , and the tendency is for us to just fill up the boxes with the images , type , and interface elements that make up our design ( figure 6 ) .
If we do create a deconstructed or spontaneous design with any visual complexity , we have to use a lot of images within the document to achieve the results , making documents weighty and overly complicating the markup .
Figure 6 : Weightshift
There are some advantages to table - based grids , but , as with the urban - planning metaphor , a strength can also become a weakness .
Table - based grids allow us to ensure that all the cells within it work in tandem .
Want all columns to stretch to the same size ?
We do n’t even think about how — it ’s the natural behavior of tables .
Want to apply even spacing between cells ?
Again , it ’s a no-brainer .
Of course , what if you do n’t want this one - size - fits all result ?
The answer is a painful one : you ca n’t have it .
CSS changes all that , and this is why I theorize , along with many others , that we ’ve not yet learned to design for the web .
What we ’re just beginning to understand — particularly those of us who come to CSS layouts after years of working with tables — is that the visual model for CSS is far more conducive to breaking out of the grid and designing for discrete , semantic elements .
Perfect , no , for despite the gains made possible by CSS , we lose things too .
Stretching columns is a decidedly problematic issue in CSS design , and cell spacing is too .
The CSS visual model is all lines and boxes .
That ’s the stuff of grids , right ?
Well sure , if we want it to be .
This is where the fundamental difference is .
CSS allows us to take a box — any box — and do with it what we want , independent of its surrounding boxes ( Figure 7 ) .
Figure 7
We can use a position property or float the box , and we can add lightweight images to element backgrounds .
So while we ’re still working with boxes , we can present those boxes in numerous visual as well as technically efficient ways .
This includes grids , but also allows far more efficient creation of non-grid designs , as you can see in Dave Shea ’s Blood Lust , one of the designs he created for the CSS Zen Garden ( figure 8 ) .
Figure 9 shows the boxes that created the deconstructed grid design for Blood Lust , again demonstrating the way CSS allows us to create deconstructed grids using boxes that are related to , but independent of , one another .
Figure 9
As long as we understand what we can do to or with a box , our ability to break out of the underlying grid that ’s held us captive for so long becomes far clearer .
Consider this design ( figure 10 ) , which can be considered highly deconstructed , even spontaneous :
And the underlying boxes positioned using CSS :
Figure 11
Not only has the underlying markup become leaner , but the CSS is downright easy for any designer familiar with CSS layout .
Yet , the presentation on - screen is unusual and rich , and shows that a non -grid design can be compelling and usable , too .
Into the great wide open#section4
The beauty and challenge of working with modern layouts is that now we have options .
With CSS , we have a means of creating manageable , lightweight , visually rich designs that can be grid designs if we want them to be .
But we can also easily deconstruct the grid or dispense with it entirely .
This opens up a world of opportunity for the contemporary web designer .
But the remaining challenge is to think in terms of these options rather than falling back on grid designs just because they ’re familiar .
For those of us coming out of years of table - based layouts , the challenge is an especially difficult one .
For many veteran web designers , changing the way we think about presenting our content without tables means shifting out of the underlying system we used for so long .
For some , this comes easily , but for the vast majority of us , it ’s difficult to make the leap .
Part of the answer lies in educating ourselves about the way CSS and browser models work , but part of the answer lies in being willing to leave conventions behind .
There is a new kid on the block , and her name is “ I ’ve never designed with a table in my career . ”
To her , our old ways often seem strange and confining , and it is within this generation that we will most likely see more departures from what design conventions have emerged in the past decade .
The web is maturing , our approaches to it changing , our opportunities for innovation and creativity more apparent than ever before .
We ’re not limited to a planned city ; we can create unique designs and have them work well .
As a combined force , the empowered veteran and today ’s spontaneous youth inspire a provocative notion that the way the web looks today is nothing like the way it ’s going to look tomorrow .
And for the most part , I ’m sure you ’ll agree that ’s a very good thing .

Sadly , i missed the “ modesty pool jump . ”
I was not on hand when a gaggle of students at Ave Maria University in Naples , Florida , leapt fully clothed into their campus natatorium , so as to protest the rampant ungodliness of today ’s bathing attire .
I was absent , too , when Ave Maria ’s Ch astity Team hosted its first - ever fashion show .
I will need forevermore to satisfy myself with club founder Stephanie Smith ’s tantalizing preshow promise , “ It ’s not going to be frumpy stuff , ” for I visited Ave Maria — one of the nation ’s newest , and perhaps most reactionary , Catholic universities — on a quotidian week in late autumn .
The school mascot — Jax , a wrinkly English bulldog who often wears a blue blanket emblazoned “ Marines ” — was roistering about amid a succession of little prefab buildings , and the Ave Maria basketball squad was shambling back from the gym , looking battered .
“ What was the score ? ” I asked one player , a short , pudgy youth still in his game jersey .
“ One hundred twenty - six to thirty - seven , ” he said between drags on his cigarette .
“ Pray for us .
Pray for us . ”
The whole scene might have been charming in its ultra-silliness were it not for the fact that the Naples campus of Ave Maria , which now boasts 400 students , is only the bud of the huge vision imagined by a billionaire Catholic hardliner .
Tom Monaghan — who founded Domino ’s Pizza in 1965 , then sold it 33 years later , for $ 1 billion — has given generously to antiabortion groups and has recently made headlines with his pledge to help bankroll the long - shot presidential campaign of Sam Brownback , the Kansas Republican who is the Senate ’s most fervent pro-lifer .
But Monaghan , now 70 , sees his principal mission and legacy as founding Catholic schools .
In 2000 , he opened Ave Maria School of Law near the Domino ’s headquarters in Ann Arbor , Michigan .
Three years later he launched the school that I visited , using a former retirement home as a temporary campus , and is spending $ 400 million to construct his dream — a sort of right - wing Notre Dame University designed for 6,000 students that will , this fall , become the permanent home of all Ave Maria undergrads .
( The law school may relocate there , too , but not before 2009 . )
Now only partially built , the future Ave Maria University sits amid a flat , swampy , and desolate expanse of tomato fields and orange groves 30 miles northeast of Naples .
A brawny , 100 - foot - tall , arching Gothic oratory is already rising , soon to be flanked by the nation ’s largest crucifix and encircled by an entire Catholic community , Ave Maria Town , which will welcome 25,000 residents .
In keeping with the tenor of Naples , where the average home costs $ 1.95 million and Republicans outnumber Democrats by nearly 4 - to - 1 , the town will not be a hive of spartan monks ’ cells .
Rather , it will feature a mix of “ affordable ” $ 175,000 town houses , $ 665,000 condos , and far more palatial Corinthian - columned manses equipped with lavish swimming pools .
The golf course will be “ championship ” caliber , and the retail core will be at once walkable and pious .
“ Our plan , ” Monaghan told a gathering of Catholics last year ( sending constitutional lawyers into a kerfuffle ) , “ is that no adult material will appear on the town ’s cable system , and the pharmacy will not sell contraceptives . ”
Essentially , Monaghan plans to draw a line in the sand against a trend he deems evil .
Even as the rapidly growing church lists right worldwide and a few rock - ribbed Catholic orders — most notably Opus Dei — are surging , American Catholics are becoming ever more progressive .
Thirty - seven percent favor an easing of the church ’s abortion policies , according to a recent cnn / USA Today / Gallup Poll , and fifty - five percent support the ordination of women .
Meanwhile , several Catholic universities — among them Holy Cross and St. Scholastica — have gone so far as to play host to the dread Vagina Monologues .
Monaghan ’s campaign may be a first in Catholic history .
For centuries , the church ’s schools have always been headed up by a religious order — the Benedictines , for instance , or the Jesuits .
Monaghan , though , is stealing a page from Protestant evangelicals such as Pat Robertson and Jerry Falwell and invoking a decidedly corporate structure .
“ I ’m a businessman , ” he ’s pronounced .
“ I get to the bottom line … .
And the bottom line is to help people get to heaven . ”
To conservatives , Monaghan is a deep - pocketed savior .
Florida governor Jeb Bush , a converted Catholic , made Ave Maria Town a special tax district like Disney World , giving the self - appointed Board of Supervisors ( run by Monaghan ’s development partner ) wideonging powers and exempting the town from state and local laws .
John DiIulio Jr. , once George W. Bush ’s director of faith - based initiatives , is on the university ’s board of regents , and Pope Benedict XVI — who has bemoaned the “ dictatorship of relativism ” — sees great hope in Monaghan ’s school .
A former student of the pope , Reverend Joseph Fessio , is the provost there , and when Fessio visited Rome recently , he reported that the pope asked , “ How ’s Ave Maria ? ”
It ’s a question that few people can answer .
The university insists that all interviews — with Monaghan , students , or faculty — be arranged through a PR office .
When I sent in my request , noting that I ’m a believing Catholic , I got the cold shoulder .
“ Why should I grant interviews to someone who ’s going to kick the shit out of us ? ” publicist Rob Falls asked me .
He added , “ The campus is private . ”
And so I trespassed in silence , mostly , until one Saturday evening when I saw a procession of students wandering the temporary campus , saying the rosary .
I fell in behind them , my voice high and plaintive in prayer .
And soon I was sitting in the student center , scribbling notes as four of my co-petitioners crowded around me , monitored — and then interrupted — by a lean , crew - cut young man with a lantern jaw , who rushed the table .
“ Whoa , whoa , whoa , ” this student said , identifying himself as a resident assistant .
“ Is this , like , an interview ?
With the media ?
You ca n’t say anything to him — that ’s official policy . ”
So we ventured off campus , to Applebee’s .
“ The first time i ever kissed a guy , ” a gentle , soft - spoken Ave Maria freshman named Mersadis said over her mozzarella sticks , “ I thought it was disgusting .
And now I do n’t want another guy to kiss me before marriage . ”
She took a sip of her iced tea , then continued .
“ In high school , I found myself looking at every girl and asking , ‘ Has she given up her virginity ?
Is she still pure ? ’
Here , I ’ve stopped asking .
I know everyone is . ”
Beside me sat a stern and erudite priest - in - training , a freshman named Aaron .
“ Here at Ave Maria , we follow the teachings of the magisterium , ” he intoned , meaning that students regard the pope ’s guidance as infallible .
“ We have not prostituted ourselves … .
Other Catholic schools — and the rest of America — have embraced modernism and the culture of death .
They have given wholehearted support to the death penalty , abortion , and euthanasia .
The value of the human person is now entirely relative . ”
Aaron argued that the United States can only be saved from moral perdition if it , like Ave Maria , embraces the magisterium as supreme .
“ We do n’t believe in the separation of church and state , ” he said , “ and this country should orient itself toward Christ .
The foundation of Western civilization rests on Christendom , which means that America owes its existence to the Catholic Church . ”
But Catholicism , as Aaron sees it , has been straying ever since the early 1960s , when Pope John XXIII convened the Second Vatican Council of bishops to update and humanize the church .
Revising cobwebby doctrine , the council acknowledged that other denominations and religions also offered “ sanctification ” and “ truth . ”
And Vatican II radically altered the standard Mass .
Prayers became shorter and simpler — and , as conservatives see it , a lax , unholy relativism gnawed its way into the church ’s holiest rite .
Where once the priest blessed the Eucharist in Latin , with his back to the congregation , he now faces his parishioners and speaks in the local tongue .
“ The offertory in the new Mass , ” griped Aaron ’s friend , an energetic and sandy - haired youth named Mike , “ is essentially a Jewish table grace . ”
A student at Florida Gulf Coast University , Mike has a fiancee at Ave Maria , and every weekend , when he pays her a chaste visit , he shuttles her two hours east to Miami , so that together they can take in a rarity not even offered on the Ave Maria campus : a Tridentine Mass , which uses the Latin and ancient prayers of the pre-Vatican II service .
Quoting a 19th - century theologian , Frederick Faber , Mike called the ceremony , with its wafting incense and quietude , “ the most beautiful thing this side of heaven . ”
Mostly , though , Mike ’s faith seemed dismissive in spirit .
He was disdainful of “ those dissenting Catholics .
They ’re just going to contracept themselves out of existence , ” he snickered .
Aaron , meanwhile , spoke of Ave Maria with a smug , William F. Buckleyesque swagger .
He called it “ the bulwark of orthodoxy .
And if you are devout , ” he added , “ the calling of celibacy is not a problem … .
Christ did not marry Mary Magdalene and all that hogwash . ”
Not everyone at ave maria shares Aaron ’s self - certainty and resistance to change .
In fact , one student tracked me down outside a dorm and in urgent , secretive tones said , “ Do n’t use my name , but I saw you talking to Aaron , and you should know that most people here think he has very extreme views on modernism . ”
To Aaron ’s chagrin , modern Masses take place often at Ave Maria , and indeed on the weekend I visited , four Franciscan friars from New York were there , barefoot and clad in simple gray robes as they treated students to a nonstop 40 - hour retreat that looked very much like a pajama party love - in .
The friars were strumming winsome and lyrical folk music on their guitars and getting hip in their homilies , depicting Christ as a survivalist paintball player , and unleashing rap riffs : “ You gotta go with the Jesus flow / All of us gotta know . ”
One brother twisted low , hips swiveling , as , prayerfully , he sang , “ I want to see - eee - eee you . ”
The students all swayed , barefoot themselves and ardent , like so many ecstatic pilgrims at a Grateful Dead concert , before a six - foot - tall , wooden , Ikea- ish structure — a “ burning bush ” appointed with candles .
And for a moment I thought , hopefully , that they were getting subversive and channeling a looser - limbed Catholicism , a faith not based on persnickety rule - mongering but on a generosity of spirit — the sort that historian Thomas Cahill believes suffused the Catholic Church in its early , most formative years .
Cahill is a graying don of liberal Catholicism , and in his new book , Mysteries of the Middle Ages , he depicts his spiritual forebears as social revolutionaries who laid the groundwork for modern feminism by exalting women such as Hildegard of Bingen , a mystic nun .
He calls the Franciscans , who commit themselves to aiding the poor , “ the world ’s first hippies ” — and it is his version of Catholicism that sings to me .
I am with St. Martin de Porres when he argues that the precept of charity trumps that of obedience .
Sitting in Stella Maris Chapel , wondered if that Catholicism was somehow thriving at Ave Maria beneath Tom Monaghan ’s radar .
I soon discovered that it most decidedly is not .
The students are far too controlled for that to happen .
They are forbidden to live off campus , unable to take any elective courses during their first two years , barred from having TVs in their rooms , and ( according to the student handbook ) subject to fines if they listen to “ any music which is sacrilegious , obscene or violent . ”
One Ave Maria adjunct music professor , Lan Lam , told me , “ They seem very sheltered , very polite .
It ’s as if they do n’t know how to act up . ”
The celebrants of the burning bush were , I learned , not radical lefties but rather Franciscan Friars of the Renewal — that is , affiliates of an obscure , newly minted conservative branch of the order .
“ I thank God for Bill Clinton , ” preached a friar / priest named Father Juniper , “ because he led me to pray more , by disrespecting the sanctity of human life and the sacredness of marriage . ”
Juniper ’s spiritual brother , David , told a long , complex story about “ rescuing ” a pregnant woman outside an abortion clinic .
The woman , he said , fled out to the sidewalk after her abortion was already in progress , and he kept talking about the pins that , he said , were protruding from the woman ’s uterus .
He described his rushing her to the hospital , through New York City , as a hilarious high - action chase scene .
“ But , sir , ” he told a police officer in frantic , pinched tones , “ we ’ve got this girl with us who ’s got sticks in her uterus ! ”
I left the chapel .
On the walkway outside , I crossed paths with Lantern Jaw , the sober RA who ’d hassled me earlier .
He was looking very Secret Service now , in a crisp black suit , so I ducked away .
I went to the library .
The New Yorker was there on the periodical rack , along with the Weekly Standard , the American Conservative , and Human Life Review , but I leafed through Ave Maria ’s campus paper , the Angelus .
University president Nicholas J. Healy Jr. writes a column for each issue .
In one he calls Islam “ a hostile and aggressive religion , ” and goes on to lament a “ widespread loss of the Christian moral vision , ” most evident in Europe , where “ birth rates far below replacement levels have already allowed millions of Muslims from North Africa and the Middle East to …heavily influence the political agenda . ”
When I stepped outside , finally , I was relieved to find four rowdy guys huddled around the blue glimmer of a cell - phone screen , their mesh shorts drooping , their baseball caps askew and backward .
“ This shit is fuu- ucked up , ” crowed one of them .
I approached , thinking that maybe at last I ’d located the wild heart of Ave Maria .
“ So , ” I said , “ are there any parties on campus tonight ? ”
“ Yeah , there ’s a kegger over in Dorm 32 . ” “ Really ? ” I rejoiced .
But of course they were simply messing with me .
“ Dude , we ’re Catholics , ” said one .
“ We ’ve got a lot of studying to do tomorrow .
We ’re going to bed . ”
The next morning , i set out on my bicycle toward Ave Maria Town , the future site of the university .
It was a long ride from Naples — and a journey into a different economy .
When I detoured into the town of Immokalee , just six miles from the new Ave Maria , the houses lining the road were decrepit and had peeling paint , and the businesses on the main drag — La Michoacana , El Paraiso Restaurant — had bars on the windows .
Immokalee is the hub of southwest Florida ’s agriculture industry , and during growing season upward of 35,000 people live here .
The residents are migrant laborers , most of them from Mexico , Guatemala , and Haiti , and often they ’re housed miles from town , in trailers chockablock with bunk beds .
One Justice Department official has called Immokalee “ ground zero for modern slavery . ”
His agency has successfully prosecuted six cases of involuntary servitude involving Immokalee - area workers in the past decade .
A local advocacy group , the Coalition of Immokalee Workers , has earned the ardent support of Catholic groups such as Pax Christi .
But when I visited ciw ‘s offices , it was clear that their relations with Ave Maria were icy .
No one there would speak on the record about Monaghan ’s project .
I rode on toward Ave Maria Town , anticipating a pleasant , if cloistered , new urbanist mecca .
On the development ’s website , avemaria.com , it says that the community “ has been designed to human scale .
Street networks , distinctive character , and environmental sustainability are integral to its planning . ”
One future resident , construction manager Darryl Klein , who has six children , had told me earlier that he ’d moved his family from South Carolina because Ave Maria represented “ the ideal American community .
It ’ll be a place where you know your neighbors .
We ’ll be around like - minded people .
The kids that play with my kids — they ’ll go to the same church as us .
And we ’ll be accepted . ”
I came around a curve in the road and saw the steel skeleton of the oratory rising out of nowhere , giant and irrefutable above the flat orange groves .
The concrete shells of the university buildings surrounding it were gray blobs in the distance .
I turned right , following a phalanx of construction rigs — at a distance because I ’d been denied a tour of the town , too .
Then , as I neared the security gate , I saw my moment .
The guards , not hearing a motor , were looking away , so I bent low and pedaled all - out for the holy land .
For roughly a quarter - mile I was in the clear .
But then a security truck pulled up beside me , its yellow roof lights aglow and fluttering .
“ Who are you with ? ” said the guard , sternly .
“ I ’m just , like , on a training ride , ” I said .
A few seconds later I was back on the road to Naples .
I visited the makeshift ave maria campus one more time , on a quiet Tuesday evening , when I went back to the library to leaf through a book that many regard as the manifesto for Catholic educators :
The Idea of a University , written by Cardinal John Henry Newman in 1852 .
The church “ fears no knowledge , ” Newman says , “ but she purifies all ; she represses no element of our nature , but cultivates the whole . ”
Elsewhere , Newman writes , “ I wish the intellect to range with the utmost freedom . ”
Soon after I jotted down these words , there was a rustling behind me : Someone was stepping in through the library door , and I turned to look .
Lantern Jaw .
For a second , our eyes locked .
And then , not two minutes later , a dapper student security guard in a black tie was stooping beside my study carrel and speaking in murmurous tones : “ I ’m sorry , sir , but … ”
I ’d read about Ave Maria ’s uniformed forces earlier , in the Angelus , where the school ’s director of physical plant and security , Thomas Minick , was quoted saying that , in their vigilance , his boys were “ no different than the 18 - and 19 - year - old Marines , sailors , and Army centurions who are guarding posts all around the world for the military . ”
I did not have a fighting chance .
And so , without protest , I let the guard escort me outside , to my bike .
Then I rode away through the dark .
Ave Maria was behind me , a bright island of light in Naples ’ endless archipelago of separate , gated , green - grass communities , and I thought of the students sequestered there .
I imagined them all huddled together , far from the rest of the world , in fear of their God .
And I did pray for them , yes .
And for my church .

In this issue :
The problem with bad security is that it looks just like good security .
You ca n’t tell the difference by looking at the finished product .
Both make the same security claims ; both have the same functionality .
Both might even use the same algorithms : triple - DES , 1024 - bit RSA , etc .
Both might use the same protocols , implement the same standards , and have been endorsed by the same industry groups .
Yet one is secure and the other is insecure .
Many cryptographers have likened this situation to the pharmaceutical industry before regulation .
The parallels are many : vendors can make any claims they want , consumers do n’t have the expertise to judge the accuracy of those claims , and there ’s no real liability on the part of the vendors ( read the license you agree to when you buy a software security product ) .
This is not to say that there are no good cryptography products on the market .
There are .
There are vendors that try to create good products and to be honest in their advertising .
And there are vendors that believe they have good products when they do n’t , but they ’re just not skilled enough to tell the difference .
And there are vendors that are just out to make a quick buck , and honestly do n’t care if their product is good or not .
Most products seem to fall into the middle category : well - meaning but insecure .
I ’ve talked about the reason in previous CRYPTO - GRAM essays , but I ’ll summarize : anyone can create a cryptography product that he himself cannot break .
This means that a well - meaning person comes up with a new idea , or at least an idea that he has never heard of , cannot break it , and believes that he just discovered the magic elixir to cure all security problems .
And even if there ’s no magic elixir , the difficulty of creating secure products combined with the ease of making mistakes makes bad cryptography the rule .
The term we use for bad cryptography products is “ snake oil , ” which was the turn - of - the - century American term for quack medicine .
It brings to mind traveling medicine shows , and hawkers selling their special magic elixir that would cure any ailment you could imagine .
For example , here is a paragraph from the most recent snake - oil advertisement I received in e-mail : “ Encryptor 4.0 uses a unique in - house developed incremental base shift algorithm .
Decryption is practically impossible , even if someone manages to reverse engineer our program to obtain the algorithm , the decryption of a file depends on the exact password ( encryption key ) .
Even if someone is guessing the encryption key the file will only be decrypted correctly if the encryption key is 100 percent correct .
See the IMPORTANT WARNING on our Web site http://ten4.com/encryptor.”
I checked the Web site ; the odds that this product is any good are negligible .
Elsewhere I ’ve talked about building strong security products , using tried - and - true mathematics , and generally being conservative .
Here I want to talk about some of the common snake - oil warning signs , and how you can pre-judge products from their advertising claims .
These warning signs are not foolproof , but they ’re pretty good .
Warning Sign # 1 : Pseudo - mathematical gobbledygook .
In the quote above , notice the “ unique in - house developed incremental base shift algorithm . ”
Does anyone have any idea what that means ?
Are there any academic papers that discuss this concept ?
Long noun chains do n’t automatically imply security .
Meganet < http://www.meganet.com/> has a beauty on their Web site : “ The base of VME is a Virtual Matrix , a matrix of binary values which is infinity in size in theory and therefore have no redundant value .
The data to be encrypted is compared to the data in the Virtual Matrix .
Once a match is found , a set of pointers that indicate how to navigate inside the Virtual Matrix is created .
That set of pointers ( which is worthless unless pointing to the right Virtual Matrix ) is then further encrypted in dozens other algorithms in different stages to create an avalanche effect .
The result is an encrypted file that even if decrypted is completely meaningless since the decrypted data is not the actual data but rather a set of pointers .
Considering that each session of VME has a unique different Virtual Matrix and that the data pattern within the Virtual Matrix is completely random and non-redundant , there is no way to derive the data out of the pointer set . ”
This makes no sense , even to an expert .
US Data Security < http://www.usdsi.com> has another beauty : “ From a mathematical point of view , the TTM algorithm is intuitively natural and less cumbersome to use than methods that are number - theory based . ”
SuperKrypt < http://www.superkrypt.com/>
tries to impress with an acronym : “ SuperKrypt products utilize the DNGT bulk encryption method , ” whatever that is .
And Cennoid < http://www.cennoid.com> just does n’t understand what it ’s talking about : “ Since key length and key structure vary and since the encryption engine does not use any mathematical algorithms , reverse engineering is impossible and guessing is not an option . ”
The point here is that , like medicine , cryptography is a science .
It has a body of knowledge , and researchers are constantly improving that body of knowledge : designing new security methods , breaking existing security methods , building theoretical foundations , etc .
Someone who obviously does not speak the language of cryptography is not conversant with the literature , and is much less likely to have invented something good .
It ’s as if your doctor started talking about “ energy waves and healing vibrations . ”
You ’d worry .
Warning Sign # 2 : New mathematics .
Every couple of years , some mathematician looks over at cryptography , says something like , “ oh , that ’s easy , ” and proceeds to create an encryption algorithm out of whatever he has been working on .
Invariably it is lousy .
Beware cryptography based on new paradigms or new areas of mathematics : chaos theory , neural networks , coding theory , zeta functions .
Cryptography is hard ; the odds that someone without any experience in the field can revolutionize it are small .
And if someone does , let the academic community have a few years to understand it before buying products based on it .
Warning Sign # 3 : Proprietary cryptography .
I promise not to start another tirade about the problems of proprietary cryptography .
I just include it here as a warning sign .
So when a company like GenioUSA < http://www.geniousa.com/genio/>
refuses to divulge what algorithm they ’re using ( they claim it ’s “ world class secret key encryption , ” whatever that means ) , you should think twice before using their product ( it ’s completely broken , by the way ) .
Another company , Crypt-o - Text < http://www.savard.com/crypt-o-text/>, promises a “ complex proprietary encryption algorithm ” and that “ there is absolutely no way to determine what password was used by examining the encrypted text . ”
It was completely broken in an InfoWorld review .
This kind of thing is n’t exclusive to small companies .
Axent once tried to pass XOR off as a real encryption algorithm .
It was n’t until someone peeked inside the compiled code that we discovered it .
Any company that wo n’t discuss its algorithms or protocols has something to hide .
There ’s no other possible reason .
( And do n’t let them tell you that it is patent - pending ; as soon as they file the patent , they can discuss the technology .
If they ’re still working on the patent , tell them to come back after they can make their technology public . )
Warning Sign # 4 : Extreme cluelessness .
Some companies make such weird claims that it ’s obvious that they do n’t understand the field .
TriStrata says this about their encryption algorithm : “ Since TriStrata ’s encryption scheme is so simple and of such low computational complexity , the client portion can reside on a wide range of systems — from a server to a portable PC . ”
Do n’t they realize that every encryption algorithm is small enough to fit on a portable PC , that DES and RSA and SHA can fit on an 8 - bit smart card , and that you can implement some of the AES candidates in 17 clock cycles per byte or a few thousand gates ?
GenioUSA talks about why they do n’t use public - key cryptography in their product ) : “ Public Key encryption is exactly that , you are not the only party involved in the generation , integrity , and security of all the keys / passwords used to encrypt your e-mail , documents , and files .
Public key encryption is great technology to use to exchange things with anyone you wo n’t trust with your secret key ( s ) and / or ca n’t exchange secret key ( s ) with .
We quote one sentence from a well known
Web page , ‘ All known public key cryptosystems , however , are subject to shortcut attacks and must therefore use keys ten or more times the lengths of those discussed here to achieve the an [ sic ] equivalent level of security . ' ”
So what ?
This company just does n’t get it .
Warning Sign # 5 : Ridiculous key lengths .
Jaws Technology < http://www.jawstech.com/> boasts :
“ Thanks to the JAWS L5 algorithm ’s statistically unbreakable 4096 bit key , the safety of your most valued data files is ensured . ”
Meganet takes the ridiculous a step further < http://www.meganet.com/>:
“ 1 million bit symmetric keys —
The market offer ’s [ sic ] 40 - 160 bit only ! ! ”
Longer key lengths are better , but only up to a point .
AES will have 128 - bit , 192 - bit , and 256 - bit key lengths .
This is far longer than needed for the foreseeable future .
In fact , we cannot even imagine a world where 256 - bit brute force searches are possible .
It requires some fundamental breakthroughs in physics and our understanding of the universe .
For public - key cryptography , 2048 - bit keys have same sort of property ; longer is meaningless .
Think of this as a sub-example of Warning Sign # 4 : if the company does n’t understand keys , do you really want them to design your security product ?
Warning Sign # 6 : One - time pads .
One - time pads do n’t make sense for mass - market encryption products .
They may work in pencil - and - paper spy scenarios , they may work on the U.S. - Russia teletype hotline , but they do n’t work for you .
Most companies that claim they have a one - time pad actually do not .
They have something they think is a one - time pad .
A true one - time pad is provably secure ( against certain attacks ) , but is also unusable .
Elementrix , now defunct , announced a one - time pad product a few years ago , and refused to recant when it was shown that it was no such thing .
Ciphile Software < http://www.ciphile.com> just tries to pretend : “ Original Absolute Privacy – Level3 is an automated pseudo one - time pad generator with very sophisticated and powerful augmenting features . ”
Whatever that means .
More recently , TriStrata < http://www.tristrata.com> jumped on the world ’s cryptography stage by announcing that they had a one - time pad .
Since then , they ’ve been thoroughly trounced by anyone with a grain of cryptographic sense and have deleted the phrase from their Web site .
At least they ’ve exhibited learning behavior .
Ultimate Privacy < http://www.ultimateprivacy.com> might actually use a one - time pad ( although they claim to use Blowfish , too , which worries me ) :
“ The one time pad is a private key method of encryption , and requires the safe and secure distribution of the pad material , which serves as the key in our solution .
The security of the key distribution comes down to how secure you want to be — for communicating point - to - point with one other person , we suggest a face - to - face hand - off of the pad material . ”
Remember that you need to hand off the same volume of bits as the message you want to send , otherwise you do n’t have a one - time pad anymore .
Warning Sign # 7 : Unsubstantiated claims .
Jaws Technologies says this about its new encryption technology : “ This scientifically acclaimed encryption product is the world ’s strongest commercially available software of its kind . ”
Acclaimed by who ?
The Web site does n’t say .
World ’s strongest by what comparison ?
Nothing .
UBE98 , at < http://www.parkie.ndirect.co.uk/>, stands for “ unbreakable encryption , ” or at least it did before someone took a day to break it .
Its Web site makes the same sort of ridiculous claims : “ One of the Strongest Encryptions available in the UK in a program that everyone will understand how to use ! ” Wow. SenCrypt < http://www.ionmarketing.com/> is advertised to be “ the most secure cryptographic algorithm known to mankind . ”
Double wow .
Some companies claim “ military - grade ” security .
This is a meaningless term .
There ’s no such standard .
And at least in the U.S. , military cryptography is not available for non-government purposes ( although government contractors can get it for classified contracts ) .
Other companies make claims about other algorithms that are “ broken , ” without giving details .
Or that public - key cryptography is useless .
Do n’t believe any of this stuff .
If the claim seems far - fetched , it probably is .
If a company claims that their products have been reviewed by cryptographers , ask for names .
Ask for a copy of the review .
Counterpane Systems reviews many products , and our clients can give out the reviews if they choose .
Warning Sign # 8 : Security proofs .
There are two kinds of snake - oil proofs .
The first are real mathematical proofs that do n’t say anything about real security .
The second are fake proofs .
Meganet claims to have a proof that their VME algorithm is as secure as a one - time pad .
Their “ proof ” is to explain how a one - time pad works , add the magic spell “ VME has the same phenomenon behavior patterns , hence proves to be equally strong and unbreakable as OTP , ” and then give the results of some statistical tests .
This is not a proof .
It is n’t even close .
More subtle are actual provably secure systems .
They do exist .
Last summer , IBM made a big press splash about their provably secure system , which they claimed would revolutionize the cryptography landscape .
( See < http://www.schneier.com/…> for a discussion . )
Since then , the system has disappeared .
It ’s great research , but mathematical proofs have little to do with actual product security .
Warning Sign # 9 : Cracking contests .
I wrote about this at length last December : < http://www.schneier.com/…>.
For now , suffice it to say that cracking contests are no guarantee of security , and often mean that the designers do n’t understand what it means to show that a product is secure .
Conclusion : Separating the Good from the Bad
These snake - oil warning signs are neither necessary nor sufficient criteria for separating the good cryptography from the snake oil .
Just as there could be insecure products that do n’t trigger any of these nine warning signs , there could be secure products that look very much like snake oil .
But most people do n’t have the time , patience , or expertise to perform the kind of analysis necessary to make an educated determination .
In the absence of a Food - and - Drug - Administration - like body to regulate cryptography , the only thing a reasonable person can do is to use warning signs like these as guides .

The U.S. has new interim cryptography export regulations .
The Department of Commerce issued new interim regulations on encryption export controls on December 31 , 1998 .
Products with DES can now be freely exported .
( Of course , we all know that DES can be broken in 21 hours by a bunch of amateurs , and a lot faster by professionals . )
Products with any key length can be exported to insurance companies , medical end-users , and online merchants ( only for buying and selling goods ) , under the current exception available for banks .
Corporations can export to their subsidiaries for “ internal company proprietary use ” ; some of this extends to partners of American companies .
Some of the licensing requirements on export of key escrow / key recovery systems have been removed .
These new regulations , announced in September , are targeted towards large corporations .
Restrictions on the exports of strong encryption used for private , non-commercial reasons is still strictly limited .
Comments on the rules are due March 1 , 1998 .
A copy of the rules is available at :
http://www.epic.org/crypto/export_controls/…
France reversed its long - standing position as being one of the most anti-cryptography countries in the world .
On January 19 , Prime Minister Lionel Jospin announced the French government is relaxing its current restrictive policy on encryption .
Under the new policy , a key escrow system of “ Trusted Third Parties ” will no longer be required for domestic use , the 1996 law requiring TTPs will not be implemented , and users will be able to use up to 128 - bit encryption without restrictions until a new law which eliminates all restrictions is enacted .
Rah rah .

In addition to adding a unique processor ID ( see below ) to its Pentium III chip , Intel is adding a hardware random number generator .
This is excellent news .
I know nothing about how it works ( or even if it is any good ) , but using techniques such as Yarrow , we can take even a mediocre hardware random number generator and turn it into something that is good for cryptographic applications .
There ’s a new Word - based virus named Caligula .
Caligula steals a user ’s PGP key ring and sends it to the creators ’ FTP site .
According to Network Associates ( owners of PGP , having bought it in 1997 ) , this does n’t compromise PGP security because the key ring file is useless without the passphrase .
This seems a bit optimistic ; once the private key ring is known , PGP ’s security level goes from unbreakable to that of a standard hashed passphrase .
And most people choose lousy passphrases .

Sun ’s Scott McNealy announced that we all have no privacy anyway , and might as well get used to it .
All the more troubling , Sun is a member of the Online Privacy Alliance .
With an attitude like McNealy ’s , is it hard to believe that “ an industry coalition that seeks to head off government regulation of online consumer privacy in favor of an industry self - regulation approach ” has my best interests at heart ?

SECRET POWER is an excellent book about project Echelon , the NSA ’s secret program designed to eavesdrop on pretty much every piece of communication in the world .
The book is n’t available in the U.S. ( Amazon.com never heard of it , and I got my copy from a friend in New Zealand ) , but CovertAction Quarterly has an excellent article on the topic by the author :
http://www.caq.com/caq59/CAQ59GlobalSnoop.html

“ Breaking Up Is Hard To Do : Modeling Security Threats for Smart Cards ”
B. Schneier and A. Shostack , First USENIX Symposium on Smart Cards , USENIX Press , to appear .
Smart card systems differ from conventional computer systems in that different aspects of the system are not under a single trust boundary .
The processor , I/O , data , programs , and network may be controlled by different , and hostile , parties .
We discuss the security ramifications of these “ splits ” in trust , showing that they are fundamental to a proper understanding of the security of systems that include smart cards .
http://www.schneier.com/paper-smart-card-threats.html
WinXFiles < http://www.pepsoft.com/wxf/intro.html> is an image viewer that claims security .
Quoting from the Web site , “ WinXFiles ( tm ) with its attractive tabbed - dialog interface features secure encryption to prevent unauthorized access of all type ( sic ) of files and particularly of your image collection . ”
While it may have an attractive interface , it is anything but secure .
WinXFiles obscures the password and stores it in the header of the encrypted file .
It obscures the password by adding it ( modulo 256 ) to the output of a pseudorandom number generator .
The PRNG is seeded with one byte derived from the password ( simply the sum of the characters in the password modulo 255 ) .
The PRNG itself is also laughably weak ; it generates two bytes at a time by adding and subtracting the offset from the seed byte , respectively .
Perhaps the scariest thing about the encryption is the high ratings it got from reviewers :
http://www.pepsoft.com/wxf/reviews.html.
( This work was done by Mike Stay and Casimir , a French hacker whose exploits have been reported by Joe Peschel .
Thanks to Mike Stay for writing this up . )
Among cryptography product companies , “ Have you had a meeting with Lew Giles ? ” is code for “ Has the NSA asked you to secretly weaken your product ? ”
Giles has been known to visit companies and request that they add back doors to their products so that the NSA could break the encryption .
The deal went something like this : Giles offered you preferential treatment for export if you would add a back door .
The back door could be subtle enough that it would n’t show up in the design , and only be obvious if someone analyzed the binary code .
It could be something that would easily be viewed as a mistake if someone learned about it .
Maybe you could weaken your random number generator , or leak a few key bits in a header .
Anything that would let the NSA decrypt the ciphertext without it looking like the crypto was broken .
In return you would be able to export your products .
But you and he would have to come up with some kind of cover story as to why you could export what was normally unexportable encryption , something that would allay any suspicion .
Giles was supposedly very smooth .
He would try a variety of tactics to make you go along with this plan .
Sometimes he would meet with just the engineers — no management — to try and circumvent potential problems .
I ’ve heard this story from several cryptography companies , large and small .
None of them were willing to talk on the record .
All were visited at least two years ago ; most were visited by Giles .
None agreed to this bargain .
( Presumably those who did would be unwilling to admit even talking to the NSA . )
And all of these stories are at least two years old ; I have no idea if Giles is still employed by the NSA , if he is still doing this kind of thing , or in fact if anyone is still doing this kind of thing .
None of this should be surprising .
The NSA seems to have done whatever it could to add trap - doors into cryptography products .
They completely subverted the Swiss company CryptoAG , for example , and for at least half a century have been intercepting and decrypting the top - secret documents of most of the world ’s governments .
( The URL for this absolutely fascinating story is < http://mediafilter.org/caq/cryptogate>.)
This kind of thing happens in Canada , too .
One name I ’ve heard is Norm Weijer ; a couple of years ago he visited several Canadian crypto companies .
One person tells the story of submitting his product to Norm for export approval .
The product used a number of different proprietary algorithms , all weakened to 40 - bit .
The word came back , unofficially of course , that if he would get rid of the proprietary algorithms and replace them with 56 - bit DES , they could get export approval .
Presumably using their existing DES crackers was easier than building unique crackers for this particular product .
Last month Intel Corp. announced that its new processor chips would come equipped with ID numbers , a unique serial number burned into the chip during manufacture .
Intel said that this ID number will help facilitate e-commerce , prevent fraud and promote digital content protection .
Unfortunately , it does n’t do any of these things .
To see the problem , consider this analogy : Imagine that every person was issued a unique identification number on a national ID card .
A person would have to show this card in order to engage in commerce , get medical care , whatever .
Such a system works , provided that the merchant , doctor , or whoever can examine the card and verify that it has n’t been forged .
Now imagine that the merchants were not allowed to examine the card .
They had to ask the person for his ID number , and then accept whatever number the person responded with .
This system is only secure if you trust what the person says .
The same problem exists with the Intel scheme .
Yes , the processor number is unique and cannot be changed , but the software that queries the processor is not trusted .
If a remote Web site queries a processor ID , it has no way of knowing whether the number it gets back is a real ID or a forged ID .
Likewise , if a piece of software queries its processor ’s ID , it has no way of knowing whether the number it gets back is the real ID or whether a patch in the operating system trapped the call and responded with a fake ID .
Because Intel did n’t bother creating a secure way to query the ID , it will be easy to break the security .
As a cryptographer , I cannot design a secure system to validate identification , enforce copy protection , or secure e-commerce using a processor ID .
It does n’t help .
It ’s just too easy to hack the software that queries the hardware .
This kind of system puts us in the same position we were in when the government announced the Clipper chip :
Those who are engaged in illicit activities will subvert the system , while those who do n’t know any better will find their privacy violated .
I predict that patches that randomize the ID number will be available on hacker Web sites within days of the new chips hitting the streets .
The only positive usage for processor IDs is the one usage that Intel said they would not do : stolen processor tracking .
Pentium II chips are so valuable that trucks are hijacked on the highways , sometimes resulting in drivers being killed .
A database of stolen processor IDs would drop the market for stolen CPUs to zero : board manufacturers , computer companies , resellers and customers could simply query the database to ensure that their particular CPU was n’t stolen .
( This is the primary usage for automobile VINs . )
This same system could be used to prevent manufacturers from overclocking their CPUs — running them faster than Intel rated them for — another thing that Intel would love to prevent .
The real question is whether computers are a dangerous technology , and need to be individually tracked like handguns and automobiles .
During the Cold War many Eastern European countries required mimeograph machines to be individually licensed ; I have a hard time believing that computers need the same sorts of controls .

Since I wrote the above essay , there have been some developments .
Intel announced that the Pentium III would be shipped with the feature turned off .
This does n’t help one bit .
Intel has also dropped rumors about a secure protocol running in tamper - resistant software that will query the ID number in a secure manner .
This does n’t make sense : there ’s no such thing as tamper resistant software ( ask anyone who breaks copy protection schemes as a hobby ) and the real worry is the unauthorized protocols that will query , or hide , the ID number .
Also , people have pointed out that there are other unique ID numbers on your computer : Ethernet cards , hard drive serial numbers , etc .
This is true , and could be a problem , but Intel intends to use its ID number as a surveillance feature .

Subj : Side Channel Attacks
When I build a computer system , hardware and software , to solve some problem , I only need to ensure that there exists some reasonable set of circumstances under which it does what it ’s supposed to do .
If a client mounts a standard PC in an enclosure with 150 - degree heat , or cuts off power to it at unpredictable times , or whatever , and then they bitch at me that it broke , I can blame them .
After all , I never claimed it would work under those conditions .
When I build a security system , I need to ensure that there does not exist any reasonable set of circumstances under which it does not do what it ’s not supposed to do , as well .
If my smart card leaks information when it ’s operated out of spec , well , I ca n’t blame the customer for operating it out of spec , can I ? 🙂
The dichotomy is deep .
In one case , we need only ensure that exists X : Y ( X ) = T , where Y ( X ) means “ property Y holds true under circumstances X . ”
In the other case , we must ensure that notexists X : Y ( X ) = F , or equivalently forall X : Y ( X ) = T .
Most computers and software are designed to fit the first case .
In this case , the solution to the discovery of a buffer overflow is to tell the user not to do that — or if they must do that , to expand the buffer .
In the second case , the solution is to check bounds carefully .
The result : when software designed for the first environment is pressed into service in the second , it ’s full of holes .
The same is true of hardware , and even hardware design methodologies .
From : Bob Geiger < geiger@areaplg2.corp.mot.com >
Subj : Internet attacks
One of the important points is how the Internet changes the standard attack cost / distance model .
Given a value of X it would take an attacker Y dollars to break into my physical world stuff .
The farther the attacker must travel in physical space the higher the cost to him .
So unless you have the Hope Diamond in your basement you can probably assume criminals will be drawn from a limited pool .
Furthermore they actually have to purchase tools and the threat of being caught ( or shot ) is a real one .
Now in the Internet this cost / distance ratio is gone .
Suddenly anyone , anywhere , can attack your systems .
Furthermore the availability of free tools limits the investment required , and the difficulty in tracking down attackers compounds the problem .
Another problem is that when it becomes easy and relatively risk free to poke around so many systems information deemed of limited value may add up to help in breaking into much more valuable systems .
So we end up needing a far , far greater level of security as related to system value than in “ physical space . ”
I think many people have a hard time understanding this difference and this is why warnings on Internet security are sometimes viewed as alarmist .

Contracts range from short - term design evaluations and expert opinions to multi-year development efforts .
The job description is simple :
Make the customers believe that Disneyland is “ a magic kingdom where life is a fairy tale and dreams really do come true . ”
But at the end of the workday , many of the people who work at the “ Happiest Place on Earth ” sleep on air mattresses , in by - the - week motel rooms and in apartments shared with other families .
“ I ’ve been at this motel since 1997 , ” said Derrick , a Disney security guard who pays $ 209 a week in rent .
He spoke to me Thursday night while standing in the doorway of the room he shares with two elderly aunts at Arena Inn and Suites in Anaheim , about a mile from his job .
Derrick said he would jump at a chance to live in a housing development proposed for a site across the street from his motel .
As proposed , 15 % of the 1,500 condos and apartments would be for low - income tenants such as Derrick , who earns $ 12 an hour .
But his employer is doing everything in its power to crush the project .

First , Disney challenged the right of a council member to cast a vote on the housing because she intends to open a wine bar in the area and might have a conflict of interest .
With the council member abstaining , a 2 - 2 split killed the development .
The developer appealed , and last week Disney rolled out the heavy artillery , suing the city over an environmental study that had cleared the way for the project .
“ We feel we have no other choice but to pursue this legal action to protect this vital area , ” said Ed Grier , president of the Disneyland Resort .
The big cheeses insist that having several thousand of their own employees -- or anyone else ’s -- live in the Anaheim Resort Area would dim the prospects for generating more business , jobs and taxes .
When Mayor Curt Pringle pitched a hybrid of hotel and residential units , some of them for low - income tenants , Disney screamed from the top of the Matterhorn .
Allowing people to live so close to the kingdom would set a “ dangerous precedent , ” said a Disney spokesman .
Yeah , Mickey could get mugged on his way to Downtown Disney .
Scott Darrell , who runs a nonprofit affordable - housing agency called the Kennedy Commission , ca n’t understand why Disney is so opposed to the project .

“ There ’s already housing there , ” said Darrell .
There ’s a mobile home park where the 1,500 residential units would be , and just down Haster Street are several dozen apartments .
Disney argues those were built in an earlier era , but new development should be all about tourism .
And besides , Disney is thinking of building a third park -- oh thank heavens , finally ! -- and would n’t want any normal activity in the vicinity , like their own employees walking home from work .
Maybe Disney should just lock them all on the premises at night and let them sleep in the Haunted Mansion or the Enchanted Tiki Room .
To be fair , I think Disney has some reasonable arguments , despite the odious attempts to make City Hall do its bidding .
Maybe a 1,500 - unit mini-city , with several thousand residents , should be a few miles down the road .
But instead of trying to torpedo housing proposals , Disney could earn a few PR points by leading the way in making sure that working stiffs like the ones it employs have a few more options .
Disney Resorts gave $ 11 million to community causes in 2006 ( companywide profits were $ 1.7 billion in the last quarter alone ) , but none of it was for housing - related services .
Why not throw a few bucks in the direction of the Orange County agencies that are in the business of finding housing solutions , such as the Kennedy Commission ?

Among the 100 largest cities in the country , Anaheim was dead last in income growth between 1990 and 2000 , according to Eric Altman .
He ’s with the Orange County Communities Organized for Responsible Development and said the combination of low wages in the hospitality business and extremely high real estate prices help make for widespread poverty in Orange County .
I met Altman and Cesar Covarrubias , of the Kennedy Commission , at the site of the doomed 1,500 - unit housing development .
At noon Wednesday , four women from the Peacock Suites Hotel ’s housekeeping department walked by on their way to lunch , and we asked about their living arrangements .
They said they make $ 7 an hour , and all but one of them shares an apartment with members of another family .
In one case , seven people live in a two - bedroom that costs $ 1,585 a month , and in another , eight people share a two - bedroom at $ 1,125 a month .
I later spoke by phone to a hotel switchboard operator who said that for 20 years she commuted from Riverside to the Hilton Anaheim , sometimes spending four hours on the road .
Advertisement
“ I can tell you , there ’s nothing cheaper than the Inland Empire , ” said Lori Condinus , who is on leave from the hotel to work for the union representing hospitality employees .
Her one - bedroom apartment is $ 750 , but the commute has taken years off her life .
“ I just find it odd that corporate America will say it ’s fine that you come and work here and help us prosper , but doggone it , you ca n’t live here .
And now they ’ve gone so far as to sue the city to make sure that we do n’t live here . ”
On my way to Anaheim on Thursday night , I spoke by phone to a woman who works in security at Disneyland and lives with seven family members -- including a nephew who also works at Disney -- in two motel rooms .

When I got to town I met up with Eddie , a Disneyland Hotel bellman who lives with his wife and children , and his parents .
Eddie took me to see two friends who work at the same hotel .
Pedro and his wife live in a $ 950 one - bedroom with two teen - agers .
He makes about $ 11 an hour , and his wife makes minimum wage in a cookie factory .
Sometimes , Pedro said , he goes without the medicine he needs for a thyroid condition .
A few blocks away , directly across the street from the housing development that ’s been scuttled , Antonio lives with his wife and 19 - year - old son in a $ 900 one - bedroom .
After 15 years working banquets at the Disneyland Hotel , he makes $ 11.27 an hour and fears he ’ll lose this apartment if and when Disney builds its third theme park .
“ The rent is 70 % of my salary , ” said Antonio , whose wife and son also work .
Antonio himself cleans a house in Costa Mesa on one of his two days off .
“ My wife wants a two - bedroom , but I ca n’t afford it .
My son needs privacy .
He needs his own room .
But I ca n’t afford it . ”
Advertisement
Eddie asked Antonio to show me his envelopes , and Antonio removed several small white envelopes from his wallet .
One had his mother ’s name on it .
One had the name of the bank where he took out a loan to buy his son ’s computer .
One said “ Rent . ”
One said “ luz ” for lights , or electricity .
He puts money in each of them throughout the month as it comes in , so he wo n’t come up short .
“ I know a house near here where 18 people live , ” Antonio said .
“ When am I going to get a house ?
It ’s a dream that will never happen . ”

Japanese attitudes towards smoking are a bit different than here in America .
I was taught that it is considered rude to smoke out in public in Japan , since you are polluting other peoples ' space , but it is polite to smoke indoors , even if there are non-smokers present , as long as it is in an enclosed area where the smoke can't escape out into the public .
Even after living in Japan for a while , I still wonder if my Japanese teachers ( who were nonsmokers ) were just making this up , or whether such attitudes really exist , I still can't tell .
I remember a funny story from a few years ago , the Prime Minister ( Nakasone , I think ) was a chain smoker , one of his idiosyncracies was the elaborate antique lacquerware smoking set he kept on his desk .
An anti-smoking group accused the Prime Minister of setting a bad example for children , he responded that he would henceforth set an example by smoking as much possible .
People in Japan feel free to smoke anywhere at all , and non-smoking zones are pretty rare .
There has been considerable government resistance to establishing any sort of anti-smoking rules or anti-smoking publicity .
This is largely because the Japanese Government owns 65 % of Japan Tobacco and part of every tobacco purchase goes directly into the Japanese Treasury .
Some people even speculate that the Government encourages smoking because it reduces the average lifespan , killing off elderly people who would otherwise be drawing a pension , saving the taxpayers a fortune .
But those attitudes are changing .
Before I left on my trip to Japan , I heard that Chiyoda - ku passed a law completely prohibiting smoking in public , and on the public sidewalks in particular .
The rationale was that Chiyoda - ku has extremely crowded sidewalks in areas like Akihabara , and smoking caused a danger to others , lit cigarettes could injure people or burn holes in their clothing .
Of course that 's merely a propaganda point to give everyone a good reason to cooperate .
I was skeptical that such an anti-smoking campaign could be successful .
But one day I got off the train in Akihabara , I was just about to light up , and then I noticed signs painted on the ground at every street corner , declaring that a No Smoking order was in effect everywhere in Chiyoda - ku .
Nobody was smoking outside the train station , which is a pretty unusual thing .
I stopped at a Police koban and asked if it was true , that smoking was completely prohibited everywhere in Chiyoda - ku .
The policeman said you can not smoke on the street , but there are a couple of places where smoking was still allowed indoors .
And he directed me to a place where smoking was permitted , I call it " the Smokatorium .
" After you walk through the double - door airlock entrance , the first thing you notice about the Smokatorium is the overpowering density of cigarette smoke , and that every single person is smoking .
Everyone is drinking coffee and smoking , talking on the phone and smoking , reading a book and smoking , but everyone is actively smoking , and they leave immediately when they 've finished smoking .
The premise of the Smokatorium is that it's a room with vending machines , you 're encouraged to buy a can of soda or coffee to help defray the expense of providing a smoking lounge .
The smoke is so intense that you could n't possibly stay there longer than it takes to smoke a cigarette , and then you leave .
Each table has a huge air vent built into the tabletop , you flick your ashes into the air intake , and it sucks the smoke out of the air too .
The air currents are quite strong inside the room , but the wind was full of stale smoke .
I thought it would be less smoky to stand close to the air intake , but quite the contrary , all the room 's smoke was rushing right past me into the vent .
After smoking a cigarette , staying inside the Smokatorium for just a minute or two , I felt quite ill like I 'd been suffocating for lack of oxygen , my clothes reeked of smoke , I wanted to take a bath and change my clothes .
Perhaps this was the whole point of the Smokatorium , negative reinforcement .
And the negative reinforcement is right up in your face .
Covering the walls of the Smokatorium are anti-smoking posters , I saw one and immediately burst into laughter at the silly infographic - style images .
I 've posted a couple of those graphics in this story , and you can inspect the entire poster by clicking on the image below .
The reason I call this place the Smokatorium is because it reminds me of the old Judge Dredd comic strip .
In the future world of MegaCity , tobacco possession is totally illegal outside the Smokatorium .
If you want to smoke , you must go to the Smokatorium , where you are issued a bubble helmet , it 's like a space suit helmet but it has a little hole in the faceplate where you can insert a cigarette .
You exhale into the interior of the helmet and the smoke is blown out a vent into the room .
The room is so thick with smoke that you can barely see , so everyone gets fresh air from their helmet 's oxygen tank , and nobody has to breathe secondhand smoke .
In a comic strip I remember , someone is arrested and charged with possession of tobacco outside the Smokatorium , so Judge Dredd sentences him to an extremely stiff penalty , one minute inside the Smokatorium without a helmet .
Ever since I smoked a cigarette at the Akihabara Smokatorium , every time I smoke , I have the sensation that my nostrils and lungs are burning .
So I decided to quit smoking completely .
I 'm wearing a nicotine patch right now , this is my 3rd day of no smoking .
If I ever feel like I want a smoke , and I need to motivate myself to stay clean , I 'll just think about the couple of minutes I spent inside the Smokatorium without a helmet .
So the other day I 'm using an ATM , and while I 'm tapping IN my PIN number , trying to perform an obfuscating contemporary dance with my fingers so it looks like I 'm typing different numbers to the ones I 'm actually using , my eyes momentarily alight on the top of the cashpoint and I notice it is n't a cashpoint at all .
Not officially , anyway .
It 's been renamed The Hole in the Wall .
Right there on the machine itself .
Barclays has taken the unofficial , slang name for the ATM , and legitimised it .
It is co-opting the language of the people .
It is trying to pretend it is " one of us " .
It can piss off .
It gets worse .
Next to the door , there 's a sign reading " Through these doors walk the nicest people in the world " - which strikes you as monumentally nauseating , until you realise it 's a little gag : beneath , in smaller lettering , it says something along the lines of " . . . as voted by their mums " .
Tee hee , Barclays !
Tee hee !
When I get home , I do a bit of Googling and discover this japery has been going on for a while ; I just had n't noticed until now .
Apparently , it 's all part of a re-branding exercise .
Barclays felt it was perceived as being too stuffy , too formal , so it decided to replace traditional banking jargon with chummy , colloquial language .
The ATM became The Hole in the Wall the customer service desk has a sign saying Can I Help ?
over it , and the Bureau de Change has been rechristened Travel Money .
Why leave it at that ?
If you 're hell - bent on making your bank look and sound like a simpleton , a desk labelled Travel Money is still a bit too formal .
Why not call it Oooh !
Look at the Funny Foreign Banknotes !
instead ?
And accompany it with a doodle of a French onion - seller riding a bike , with a little black beret on his head and a baguette up his arse and a speech bubble saying , " Zut Alors !
Here is where you gettez les Francs ! "
Actually , why still call yourself a bank at all ?
" Bank " sounds boring .
Call yourself " Barclays Money Circus " instead .
Do n't know about you , but I feel like vomiting myself inside out whenever big businesses try to cute themselves up this way - all lower case brand names and twee little jokes and overuse of the words " you " and " my " and " we " and " us " as though we 're a bunch of cuddly - wuddly pals and hey , we 're all in this crazy world together , so let 's have some fun with it , right guys ?
It 's the modern equivalent of someone who uses multiple exclamation marks to denote how ZANY !!!!!
they are .
It 's desperate .
Anyway , one solution is to come up with new colloquial terminology they can't co-opt .
Sod The Hole in the Wall .
They 've absorbed that one .
Let 's start calling ATMs Coinshitters instead .
See how long it takes Barclays to start using that .
My guess is quite a while .
Researchers cruising for creatures that live in the deepest parts of the Pacific Ocean found a new species of sea anemone living in the unlikeliest of habitats – the carcass of a dead whale .
A marine biologist would say that discovering a new sea anemone is n't so unusual .
But finding one that calls a dead whale home is what sets this new creature apart .
Since the scientists who initially found these animals were n't sea anemone specialists , they sent the 10 specimens they collected to Meg Daly , an assistant professor of evolution , ecology and organismal biology at Ohio State University .
Daly runs one of the very few laboratories in the world equipped to study sea anemones .
“ These creatures were so cool simply because we knew that no sea anemone had ever been found on a whale fall , ” she said .
Once a whale dies , its carcass sinks to the bottom of the ocean .
Scientists call this a “ whale fall . ”
The anemones that Daly received once lived on the bones of a dead whale some 1.8 miles ( 3,000 meters ) below sea level in a region of the Pacific Ocean called Monterey Canyon , roughly 25 miles off the coast of Monterey , Calif .
All of the specimens currently in Daly 's collection came from this whale fall .
The anemone , given the scientific name Anthosactis pearseae – there is no English name for it – is small and white and roughly cube - shaped .
It 's about the size of a human molar , and even looks like a tooth with small tentacles on one side .
advertisement
Daly and Luciana Gusmão , a doctoral student in Daly 's laboratory , describe A. pearseae in detail in a recent issue of the Journal of Natural History .
The two assigned the anemone to the genus Anthosactis primarily due to the roughly uniform length of A. pearseae 's tentacles – a characteristic common to this group of about seven sea anemones .
“ We tend to differentiate Anthosactis species from other groups of sea anemones by a variety of traits , rather than any one unique attribute , ” Daly said .
She and Gusmão named A. pearseae after Vicki Pearse , the naturalist who first collected the specimens during a cruise of the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute 's research vessel the Western Flyer .
Pearse is a research associate at the Institute of Marine Sciences at the University of Santa Cruz .
It 's customary to name a newly discovered plant or animal species after the person who found it , or after the place where it was discovered .
Collecting deep - sea creatures is a tedious process that involves a lot of high - tech equipment like underwater video cameras attached to remotely operated vehicles ( ROVs ) .
Deep sea ROVs are also equipped with robotic arms and suction devices that are used to collect species .
advertisement
“ It 's like a submarine that 's manned from the surface , ” said Daly , who plans to head to Monterey Canyon later this year in hopes of finding more dead whales with A. pearseae roosting on the bones .
A successful trip could answer some of Daly 's lingering questions about the species itself and , more broadly , may provide clues on how human activities affect this unique , seemingly removed ecosystem .
“ The thing about these communities is that they seem so ephemeral and so unplanned , ” Daly said .
“ A whale dies where it dies , and its carcass lands wherever .
But these are actually some of the most stable deep sea communities .
“ A better understanding of deep - sea populations may shed light on how humans drive ecological change , whether it 's through whaling or global climate change , ” she said , and also pointed out that there are now far fewer major whale migrations along the California coast .
While the flesh of a dead whale decomposes within weeks , the bones can last anywhere from 60 to 100 years .
“ As that happens , the bacteria that break down the bones release sulfur , ” Daly said .
“ A whole community of aquatic creatures uses that sulfur to make energy , much like plants convert light into energy . ”
Daly does n't know much about A. pearseae beyond its physical description .
She and Gusmão are n't sure how old the creatures are , and say that sea anemones can live for hundreds of years .
Nor are they sure how A. pearseae reproduce ( each anemone may have male and female sex organs ) , or if it lives exclusively on whale carcasses .
“ So far , a single dead whale is the only place where we 've found these anemones , ” Daly said .
She and Gusmão plan to include A. pearseae in a long - term evolutionary study of genetic relationships among sea anemones .
A. pearseae belongs to an extremely diverse group of anemones , Daly said , and comparing the anemones ' genetic sequences may clue the researchers in to how the different species evolved over time .
Supreme Court Paves Way For Corporations To Vote Posted by Pile ( 7261 views ) [ E - Mail link ]
Ok , that may be a bit facetious but we 're all into this new age of media teasers ...
In what we consider here at BSAlert , the ever - increasing influence of corporations and PACs , the Supreme Court loosened restrictions Monday on corporate and union - funded television ads that air close to elections , weakening a key provision of a landmark campaign finance law .
What this means is that whoever has the most money , as usual , will exert the most influence , and as we all know , the groups with the most money are always the ones who are looking out the most for the American People ( tm ) .
The court , split 5 - 4 , upheld an appeals court ruling that an anti-abortion group should have been allowed to air ads during the final two months before the 2004 elections .
The law unreasonably limits speech and violates the group 's First Amendment rights , the court said .
The decision could lead to a bigger role for corporations , unions and other interest groups in the 2008 presidential and congressional elections .
The case involved advertisements that Wisconsin Right to Life was prevented from broadcasting .
The ads asked voters to contact the state 's two senators , Democrats Russ Feingold and Herb Kohl , and urge them not to filibuster President Bush 's judicial nominees .
Feingold , a co-author of the campaign finance law , was up for re-election in 2004 .
The provision in question was aimed at preventing the airing of issue ads that cast candidates in positive or negative lights while stopping short of explicitly calling for their election or defeat .
Sponsors of such ads have contended they are exempt from certain limits on contributions in federal elections .

今回は「FxCop」を紹介しよう。これはコードを分析して.NETの規約に準拠しているかどうかを自動的に調べるツールで，Microsoftが開発したものだ。同社が運営するGotDotNetのWebサイトから入手できる（該当サイト）。
最近FxCopは，多くの関心と支持を得るようになってきた。何人かの開発者はこのツールが好きで，その出力結果を福音のように受け入れている。しかし，私はまだそれほどまでには好きになったわけではない。
その理由は技術的な問題ではなく，ツールが出すアドバイスを無条件に受け入れることには賛成しかねるからだ。私はプログラミングの標準規約を適用することに反対はしない。FxCopが適用する標準をカスタマイズできるようになっていることには好ましく思っている。コーディングの標準はコードのメンテナンスを容易にするだけではない。エラーも減らすし，FxCopのような自動チェック・ツールは，そうした標準規約をより簡単に実装できるようにしてくれる。
しかし，私は10年以上前に，同じようなツールを経験しているのだ。その昔，私が働いていた会社は，コードを調べるための自動チェック・ツールを売っていた。今となっては時代遅れなプログラム言語が対象だったが，それは一応うまく動いた。けれども，いくつかの問題があった。私のその時の経験を基に，FxCopのよい点と悪い点を見ていこう。
コンパイル後のアセンブリがチェック対象
FxCopはカスタマイズ可能なルール・セットを備えている。そのルールは少々分かりにくいが，非常に強力なエンジンによって適用される。コード分析エンジンに限っていえば，FxCopは同種製品で最高のものだ。
実際 ，Microsoftも社内でこのエンジンを使っている。ルールについていえば，「ドッグ・フーディング」（ドッグ・フードを食べること）に時間をかければ，よりよくなっていくだろう。すべてのソフトウエアはバグや設計上の問題を抱えている。ドッグ・フーディングとは，自社製品のソフトウエアがどのくらいうまく動くかを知るために，自社でその未完成のソフトを使い込むことである。Microsoftの社員はいつも同社のアプリケーションのベータ版を使っている。正式なリリースの前に徹底的にテストするためだ。FxCopはプログラム開発向けのツールで，Microsoft社内でたくさん利用されている。
昔，自動標準チェッカは単独でソース・コードをチェックしていた。その結果，ほとんどの標準チェッカはソース・コード内の問題を見つけることを主眼としていた。FxCopは，ソース・ファイルではなく，コンパイルされた.NETのアセンブリをチェックする点で，ほかの標準チェッカとは異なる。このアプローチには長所と短所がある。
長所は，ソース・ファイルではなく，そのアセンブリをチェックするので，.NET開発者はVisual C#.NET ，Visual Basic.NET ， Visual C++.NETのアセンブリを，1つのツールで扱えることだ。Microsoftの開発者は各言語の文法に合わせてルール・セットを作る必要がなく，FxCop1つだけで済み，ツールを開発するのに必要な時間とコストを削減できることになる。さらにFxCopはアセンブリを対象にしているので，実行環境に存在する問題を発見できる。別のいい方をすると，スペリングの間違いだけを探すのではないということだ。それは例えば，メモリー管理やセキュリティに関連する問題のような，もっとたくさんの重大な問題を発見する。こうしたタイプのチェックを容易に実行できるように，FxCopはルール・セットをカスタマイズできるように作られている。FxCopのエンジンがアセンブリを評価するときに使う個々のルールを，インポートしたり，有効/無効にしたりできるのである。
短所は，FxCopがソース・コードではなくコンパイル済みのコードを対象に動作するために，発見した問題がソース・コード上のどこにあるのかをピンポイントで指摘できないことである。FxCopは多くの場合に，問題があるソース・ファイルは指摘するものの，そのソース・ファイルのどこに問題があるのかまでは指摘しない。さらにFxCopは対象の実行ファイルしかロードしないので，ソース・ファイルがどこにあるのかも分からないかもしれない。その結果，FxCopがプロジェクトのソース・ファイルへのリンクを出力しようとする場合，そのプロジェクトがデフォルトの場所，つまりMy Documents \Visual Studio Projectsディレクトリにあるものとする。ところが，多くの開発者はもう少し複雑なディレクトリ構成を使っている。FxCopは問題点を解説したページへの有益なリンクも持っているが，問題の発見と解決は開発者に任せられている。こうした状況は，今後このツールがVisual Studio .NETと統合され，拡張されれば変わることだろう。
多くの自動標準チェッカと同様に，FxCopは名付け規則に関しては野心的だ。私は自分のコードでは，ローカル変数と関数の引数名には首尾一貫してハンガリアン記法を使っている。Microsoftの.NETの名付け規則の中には，ハンガリアン記法は.NETプロジェクト内では使うべきではないという文章がある（該当サイト）。そのため私のコードに対してFxCopを使うと，多くの「エラー」が表示される。実際はそれらはエラーではなく，どちらかといえば規則への不適合だ。
Microsoftがハンガリアン記法を許すように，FxCopのデフォルト・ルールを変えるとは期待していない。私がいいたいのは，FxCopやそのほかの自動標準チェッカを使う場合は，あなたのコードにとって何が最適かという点に関して，他人の意見に従うことが不可欠になる。そのツールが出したアドバイスを自分がどう実装するかをよくよく考える準備をしておくことだ。
アドバイスを盲目的に適用するのは危険
あなたのコードを実際にメンテナンスする手助けをするわけではないのに，ツールが出すアドバイスを盲目的に適用すると，その問題は解決するかもしれないが，同じくらい別の問題を引き起こす可能性がある。実際の例を見てみよう。
先ほど述べたように，私は以前，標準チェッカを使っていた。私は百万行以上に及ぶシステムを開発しているときに，ほかの開発者が担当する関数領域と名前の衝突を起こさないようにするため，厳格な名付け規則に従わなければならなかった。しかし，システムのほかの部分とデータを交換する際には，そのデータの転送元の名前空間によってそれを追跡した。そのデータを転送元に返す場合には特にそうだ。というのは，データの転送元の名前空間にデータを返す前に，そのデータを絶対に変更しないようにしたかったからである。
われわれが自動標準チェッカをそのプロジェクトに持ち込んだときには，そのシステムは既に何年もの間使われていて，われわれの名前空間を認識できるようにプログラムされていた。そのチェッカは，例えばループの制御変数名に「i」を使った領域に，フラグを立てることがよくあった。もちろん「i」が名前空間と結び付けられていなかったからだ。この標準チェッカは，われわれのソース・ファイル内の変数に，故意にほかの関数の接頭辞を使った領域にもフラグを立てた。そのため，先に書いたようなデータを追跡できた。
われわれはこのツールを長年使っていたので，これらのフラグをノイズとして認識していたが，マネージャにはその標準チェッカが出した結果のノイズと実際の問題の違いを理解できなかった。名前空間に関するフラグはノイズというカテゴリに分類されることが多い。しかし「問題」の数を50％は減らしたいと思っているマネージャにとっては，そういうものがメイン・ターゲットになるのだ。
そこでそのマネージャは，ループ制御変数「i」などの変数名を変える仕事を，経験の浅い開発者にやらせた。こうした変更の実装とテスト作業に同社は余分なコストを費やした。このマネージャは経験の浅い開発者に，ほかの領域の接頭辞を持つ変数の名前も変えさせた。それはその会社にさらにもっと多くの費用を払わせることになった。
ほ ぼ1年後に，次のリリースの時期がきた。今度のリリースは何人か新しく雇った開発者に任された。この開発者たちは，彼らの名前空間内にある変数に，実はほかの関数のプロパティが格納されていることを知らなかった。想像がつくと思うが，その混乱はさらに新しい追加コストが発生する結果になった。
私を責めないでほしい。自動標準チェッカを使ったのは間違いではなかった。それは本物のエラーも見つけた。ノイズの多くをきちんと説明できる経験を積んだわれわれや聞く耳を持ったマネージャたちは，そのプロジェクトの大部分を不必要に変更しなかった。さらにわれわれはその標準チェッカの開発者に対して，自分たちが経験したノイズのいくつかについて伝えたので，その自動ツールのその後のリリースでは対応してくれた。
同じようにFxCopもノイズをレポートすることがある。FxCopはまだバージョン1.3で，今も開発中であり，Microsoftもこのツールがもっと使いものになるようにそれを拡張し続けている。
結論としては，FxCopやほかのどんな自動標準チェッカが出すアドバイスも，そのまま盲目的に受け入れてはいけないということだ。そんなことをしたら，自分のコードを不必要に書き換えて，時間とお金を浪費させることになるかもしれない。FxCopの目標は，コードの中にある問題にすべき事柄に関したレポートを出すツールを提供することだと，Microsoftはいっている。合理的な理由のあるそれぞれの潜在的な問題には信頼性のレベルが付けられている。この自動チェッカは経験を積んだ開発者が認識できるようなことをすべて判断できるというわけではない。
Visual Studio 2005 と 同Express Editionのこと
最後にレドモンド（ 米Microsoftの本社）からの最大の話題についてお知らせしておこう。「 Visual Studio 2005 」 （開発コード 名Whidbey）のベータ1がリリースされた（既報）。これにはVisual Studio 2005のフル機能が実装されており，先に公開された6つの「 Visual Studio 2005 Express Edition」のベータ1と同等の機能が利用できる（既報）。
Express Editionは特定用途に向けた ，Visual Studio 2005 のサブセットである。例えば，SQL
Server 2005 Express Edition はMicrosoft SQL Server Desktop Engine（MSDE）をベースにしており，データベース機能を提供する。SQL
Server 2005 Express Editionは無償で，ほかの5つの低価格のExpressパッケージと連携しており，Web開発またはデスクトップ開発のどちらか一方を対象としている。
Web開発用に はVisual Web Developer 2005 Express Editionが用意されている。これは，複数のプログラム言語を扱えるツールで，WebアプリケーションやXML
Webサービスを開発できる。もう一方のデスクトップ開発については，各.NET対応言語ごとに異なるExpressパッケージがある。Web開発と違って，デスクトップ開発向けのExpressパッケージでは，どれか1つの言語しか使えない。
多分ご存知だと思うが ，Visual Studio 2005 は.NET
Framework 2.0をベースに作られている。そのうち.NET
Frameworkの新バージョンについてご紹介するつもりだ。Visual Studio 2005ベータ1がリリースされたということは，.NET
Framework 2.0が1年以内に出荷されることを意味する。
Objects have not failed

( Opening remarks by Guy L. Steele Jr. , November 6 , 2002 )
Objects have clearly succeeded .
Here is some practical evidence : According to the most recent 2002 North American Developer Survey by Evans Data Corporation , over half the developers surveyed are using Java .
About 1/7 of developers surveyed are using C#. Roughly half of those also use Java , so the fraction of surveyed developers using one or both is about 3/ 5 .
The numbers for both languages are expected to increase next year .
Over 1/5 of developers surveyed are using Enterprise Java Beans ; almost 2/5 are using COM + ; and nearly 2/3 are using JavaScript ( which at least tries to be object - oriented ) .
The main strengths of object - oriented programming are that it encourages the abstraction and encapsulation of state , and that objects are a good model for most entities in the real world .
Thirty years ago , most programming was procedural in nature .
The unit of programming was the procedure , the subroutine , the function , the algorithm .
Data declarations tended to be strewn about and were not abstracted .
An array of integers might be any of several conceptual data structures , and it was not always apparent which of the many procedures accepting an integer array argument were actually intended to apply to that particular array .
So it was necessary to document data structures fairly carefully , outside the programming language in comments , for example .
Object - oriented programming clusters data with code that is appropriate and relevant to that data .
The trade - off is that sometimes it is difficult to grasp and to envision entire algorithms , because the fragments of an algorithm are spread out among the many methods associated with various object types .
So in object - oriented programming it is necessary to document methods fairly carefully , in comments , perhaps , but also in interface declarations .
Fred Brooks , in Chapter 9 of The Mythical Man-Month , said this :
Show me your flowchart and conceal your tables , and I shall continue to be mystified .
Show me your tables , and I wo n't usually need your flowchart ; it 'll be obvious .
That was in 1975 .
Eric Raymond , in The Cathedral and the Bazaar , paraphrased Brooks ' remark into more modern language :
Show me your code and conceal your data structures , and I shall continue to be mystified .
Show me your data structures , and I wo n't usually need your code ; it 'll be obvious .
That was in 1997 , and Raymond was discussing a project coded in C , a procedural language .
But for an object - oriented language , I think this aphorism should be reversed , with a twist :
Show me your interfaces , the contracts for your methods , and I wo n't usually need your field declarations and class hierarchy ; they 'll be irrelevant .
I think , however , that practitioners of both procedural and object - oriented languages can agree on Raymond 's related point :
Smart data structures and dumb code works a lot better than the other way around .
This is especially true for object - oriented languages , where data structures can be smart by virtue of the fact that they can encapsulate the relevant snippets of " dumb code . "
Big classes with little methods that 's the way to go !
The Scheme programming language was born from an attempt in 1975 to explicate object - oriented programming in terms that Gerry Sussman and I could understand .
In particular , we wanted to restate Carl Hewitt 's theory of actors in words of one syllable , so to speak .
One of the conclusions that we reached was that " object " need not be a primitive notion in a programming language ; one can build objects and their behavior from little more than assignable value cells and good old lambda expressions .
Moreover , most of the objects in Hewitt 's theory were stateless and unchanging once created ; for those , lambda expressions alone were sufficient .
That was a useful theoretical observation and not original with us , though Scheme did help to spread the word but it was not a good guide to designing practical programming languages .
Soon both Scheme and Common Lisp felt the pressure to graft on facilities to make it easy , not merely possible , to program in an object - oriented style .
A major source of this pressure was the displacement of character streams by windows as a model of terminal - screen interaction this was made practical and desirable by the advent of high - resolution bit - mapped displays but programmers quickly grasped the value of object - oriented programming for other purposes .
As I observed 20 - odd years ago in my paper Lambda : The Ultimate Declarative , part of the value of object - oriented programming is that while it may be difficult to add a new method interface to a mature set of classes at least , using an ordinary text editor , as was common practice then and still is today because many individual method declarations must typically be coded , inheritance notwithstanding , and inserted into each relevant class , whereas it is comparatively easy to create a new class of object , a new data type .
Procedural programming is just the opposite , the dual ; it 's easy to add a new procedure , but it can be difficult and time - consuming to introduce a new data type into a mature set of procedures because code must be inserted into each relevant procedure .
The question is , then in today 's practice , is it more common to introduce new universal methods or new universal data types as a system is maintained ?
( I say " universal " to mean something that is widely used throughout a system .
A universal method , such as equal or toString , is supported by many types of object , and a universal data type , such as String or Vector , must support most universal methods . )
I assert that new universal object types arise more frequently than new universal methods this is a consequence of Raymond 's " smart data , dumb code " principle and this is one reason that object - oriented programming has proved to be so successful :
It reduces the effort of program maintenance when working with inadequate program development tools .
Another weakness of procedural and functional programming is that their viewpoint assumes a process by which " inputs " are transformed into " outputs " ; there is equal concern for correctness and for termination ( and proofs thereof ) .
But as we have connected millions of computers to form the Internet and the World Wide Web , as we have caused large independent sets of state to interact I am speaking of databases , automated sensors , mobile devices , and ( most of all ) people in this highly interactive , distributed setting , the procedural and functional models have failed , another reason why objects have become the dominant model .
Ongoing behavior , not completion , is now of primary interest .
Indeed , object - oriented programming had its origins in efforts to simulate the ongoing behavior of interacting real - world entities thus the programming language SIMULA was born .
Now , objects do n't solve all the problems of programming .
For example , they do n't provide polymorphic type abstraction ( that is , generic types ) .
They do n't provide syntactic abstraction ( that is , macros ) .
Procedural programming still has its place in the coding of methods .
But to say that objects have failed because they do n't solve all possible problems is like saying carbohydrates have failed because you can't live on pure sugar .
Object - oriented programming is like money , as the old joke has it :
It 's not everything , but it 's way ahead of whatever 's in second place .
If you are an idealist , you may be disappointed with the current state of the object - oriented programming art .
The ongoing evolution of object - oriented programming has not reached completion and perhaps never will .
I do not claim that Java or C# is the apotheosis of object - oriented programming languages .
As for C++ well , it reminds me of the Soviet - era labor joke : " They pretend to pay us , and we pretend to work . "
C++ pretends to provide an object - oriented data model , C++ programmers pretend to respect it , and everyone pretends that the code will work .
The actual data model of C++ is exactly that of C , a single two - dimensional array of bits , eight by four billion , and all the syntactic sugar of C++ fundamentally cannot mask the gaping holes in its object model left by the cast operator and unconstrained address arithmetic .
If , several years ago , with C++ at its most popular , with Smalltalk in decline and Squeak yet to appear , you had come to me , O worthy opponents , and proclaimed that objects had failed , I might well have agreed .
But now that Java has become mainstream , popularizing not only object - oriented programming but related technologies such as garbage collection and remote method invocation , and now that the utility of object - oriented programming has been seconded by the sincere flattery of C# , we may now confidently assert that objects most certainly have not failed .
Some tourists , amateur photographers , even would - be filmmakers hoping to make it big on YouTube could soon be forced to obtain a city permit and $ 1 million in liability insurance before taking pictures or filming on city property , including sidewalks .
New rules being considered by the Mayor ’s Office of Film , Theater and Broadcasting would require any group of two or more people who want to use a camera in a single public location for more than a half hour to get a city permit and insurance .
The same requirements would apply to any group of five or more people who plan to use a tripod in a public location for more than 10 minutes , including the time it takes to set up the equipment .
Julianne Cho , assistant commissioner of the film office , said the rules were not intended to apply to families on vacation or amateur filmmakers or photographers .
As part of its efforts to recruit tech - savvy users from around the world , the Vancouver Police Department 's tech crimes division has set its sights on Second Life .
It will be the first police force in the world to establish an official presence in the virtual world .
According to a report by the Vancouver Sun , members of the division will be on hand ( in the form of buxom female avatars , apparently ) to conduct a recruitment seminar in the virtual world on Thursday , May 31st .
Though the VPD 's efforts will initially center on recruitment , the tech crimes division 's Kevin McQuiggan suggests that the force 's presence in the virtual world may eventually broaden in scope :
It 's important for us , as an organization , to keep abreast of modern technology – both from an educational standpoint and an outreach standpoint , and from an investigative standpoint .
Is it too early to start posting look - outs on street corners ?
Maybe .
But seeing as how Second Life
users can sometimes find even Linden 's own interventions overly restrictive , it will be interesting to see how they react to the presence of an actual police force , regardless of how benign its initial intentions .

Thirty nine people said to have ' disappeared ' in US custody
" Six human rights groups released Wednesday a list of 39 people they believe have been secretly imprisoned by the United States and whose whereabouts are unknown and called on the Bush administration to abandon secret detentions , " according to advance copy of an article to run in Thursday 's New York Times .
Files Reuters : " Six human rights groups urged the U.S. government on Thursday to name and explain the whereabouts of 39 people they said were believed to have been held in U.S. custody and " disappeared . "
Excerpts follow .
The groups , including Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch , said they filed a U.S. federal lawsuit under the Freedom of Information
Act seeking information about the 39 people it terms " ghost prisoners " in the U.S. " war on terror . "
" Since the end of Latin America 's dirty wars , the world has rejected the use of ' disappearances ' as a fundamental violation of international law , " Professor Meg Satterthwaite of the Center for Human Rights and Global Justice at New York University 's School of Law said in a statement .
The report said suspects ' relatives , including children as young as seven , had been held in secret detention on occasion .
In September , U.S. President George W. Bush acknowledged the CIA had interrogated dozens of suspects at secret overseas locations and said 14 of those held had been sent to the U.S. military prison at Guantanamo Bay . "

Not long ago I read Richard Kiyosaki ’s Rich Dad , Poor Dad .
Aside from all of the other valuable things in the book , possibly the most valuable thing I got from it is an appropriate definition of “ wealthy ” .
I ’ll put it in my own words .
Being wealthy is defined as owning enough income generating assets to support your standard of living without having to work as someone else ’s employee .
That is , wealthy has nothing to do with how much money you are paid by an employer .
In fact , regardless of how much money you make , I would argue that if your sole source of income is your paycheck , then you are not wealthy , you are “ merely ” middle class .
Wealth is much more than how much your paycheck is .
Money is not wealth .
Money is an intellectual representation of the value of work and property .
If your money is generated by work , then it is not sustainable independent of an employer .
If your money is generated by property , it is .
If you look up the definition of the word “ wealthy ” , you do n’t find , until you work your way through a bunch of other definitions , one that speaks to how much money you have .
And none that I could find say anything about how much money you are paid , but all speak to what you own or have .
So , why does the Left spend so much time characterizing those who earn high incomes as “ rich ” or “ wealthy ” ?
Well , I suspect that it has much to do with two things .
Truly wealthy people have spent a lot of time and effort on reducing their real income to avoid income taxes
The Left likes to redistribute wealth and item 1 has left them with folks who earn wages as a focus for their redistribution schemes .
So , the point of all this ?
Change your definition of wealthy and then re-evaluate every time you hear someone on the left talk about the evil rich or wealthy .
They are really talking , generally , about someone with a high wage , not someone who is actually wealthy .
Second point .
I highly recommend aspiring to being wealthy rather than highly paid .
When Dell put up its IdeaStorm community - feedback site , the company was surprised by the strong response in favor of shipping personal computers with Linux .
The PC company then announced that it would offer Ubuntu Linux on select systems , and as of yesterday , they are taking orders .
Ubuntu Linux is now available on the XPS 410n high - end desktop system at $ 849 ( compared with $ 899 for the same machine with Windows installed ) , the E520n desktop at $ 599 , and the E1505n notebook at $ 599 .
For now , the Ubuntu systems will only be available to customers in the United States .
Availability is expected " in the coming weeks " according to an announcement given on May 1 , but Dell.com lists a shipping time of three to five days .
The Dell Linux XPS 410n will have the same hardware as its Windows - based brother : an Intel Core 2 Duo E4300 with 1GB of RAM and a 250 GB SATA hard drive .
They will come with the standard Ubuntu distribution , which includes a whole plethora of free applications such as the Firefox web browser , and OpenOffice.org productivity suite , but no " crapware . "
Dell plans on including partial open - source or closed - source drivers if there is no equivalent open - source drivers for the hardware , which includes Intel wireless networking cards and Conexant internal modems .
Dell is recommending that Linux users purchase Dell printers that support PostScript printing .
Dell spokeswoman Anne Camden told
Ars that on average , prices for the E520n desktop and E1505n notebook will be about $ 50 less than comparably - equipped offerings with Windows , although one does note that it is possible to buy a E520 desktop with Windows Vista installed for as little as $ 369 ( it is n't yet clear how configurable the Linux options will be ) .
The E520s are considered " entry - level " desktops , while the XPS 410 is a higher - end model targeted at gamers and enthusiasts .
So it turns out that not including Windows saves the consumer $ 50 from the regular list price .
This amount is not too far off from what a large OEM like Dell would pay for a volume discount for Windows Vista Home Basic ( the regular OEM price is about $ 95 ) .
Many value PC sellers try to make up for the cost of a Windows license by bundling demo and trial versions of software such as AOL ( affectionately known as " crapware " ) , for which they receive money from software companies looking to increase their distribution levels .
Dell is no exception to this practice , although on their web site it allows customers to select the option of not including various applications .
Better yet , Camden also told Ars that Dell is going to include a special " deinstaller " application on its PCs in the future that will make it easier for new users to uninstall unwanted applications .
Still , one has to admit that purchasing a Dell with Windows and then downloading a free copy of Ubuntu would be more value for money , assuming that the Windows license was worth more than $ 50 to the consumer : Linux fans may disagree on that last part .
The issue of Linux installs brings back memories of discussions about the " Windows Tax " that have been going on ever since Windows was first preinstalled with computers .
Back before Microsoft got into antitrust trouble , the company often sold discounted bundling licenses that required payment for every computer sold , regardless of whether or not it came with Windows ( or any operating system ) installed .
The company was forced to sign a consent decree that ended such practices , and it was only because of that legal action that it became fiscally realistic to sell computers with alternative operating systems .
Eric Raymond once famously predicted that when the price of PCs dropped to below $ 300 that Microsoft would " cease to exist " because nobody would pay an extra one - third of the cost of a computer in order to get Windows .
That did n't happen , largely because of the price incentives given by software companies as described above .
Whether or not Linux bundling will put pressure on Microsoft 's OEM pricing remains to be seen , but it can't hurt .
A team of researchers led by professor Hideo Hosono of the Tokyo Institute of Technology has developed a new type of alumina cement that conducts electricity like metal by altering the crystal structure at the nano level .
Ordinary alumina cement made from a lime - alumina compound ( C12A7 ) has a crystal structure consisting of asymmetric cages , making it a poor conductor of electricity .
But by sealing the alumina cement compound along with titanium inside a glass tube and heating it to 1,100 degrees Celsius , the researchers were able to create a homogenized , symmetrical cage structure that conducts electricity like metal .
Results indicate the cement 's electrical conductivity is on par with that of manganese at room temperature .
Moreover , like other metals , the cement 's conductivity increases as its temperature decreases .
The researchers say that forming the cement into thin membranes would make it nearly transparent , making it an ideal substitute material for rare metals such as indium , which is used in plasma and liquid - crystal displays .
In addition to being cheaper than rare metals , the cement would make an environmentally - friendly alternative because its ingredients are more readily available .
The Tokyo Institute of Technology worked with researchers from Osaka Prefecture University , the Institute of Physical and Chemical Research ( RIKEN ) , and the Japan Synchrotron Radiation Research Institute ( SPring - 8 ) to develop the cement .
The results are published in the April 11 edition of Nano Letters .

WEB EXCLUSIVE - Extended Interview
Honeybee populations in more than 20 states have mysteriously crashed .
May Berenbaum , of the University of Illinois at Urbana - Champaign , studies " colony collapse disorder " and its consequences .
There was a major decline in bee populations 20 years ago .
Why is this more troubling ?
In the '80s the cause was clear : the accidental introduction of a parasitic mite that saps honeybees of vitality .
This time , the bees are simply disappearing .
There are no dead bodies .
It 's as if they 're not coming home .
Among the hypotheses is that their navigation system is perturbed .
Honeybees have an incredibly sophisticated system for finding floral nectar and pollen sources , providing directions to their nest mates to promising nectar and pollen sources , recruiting them to these sources , and having everybody come home safely .
And that 's not what appears to be happening .
What could be causing this ?
Name something and it's been suspected .
A British paper [ suggested ] that cellphone transmission is interfering with bee navigation .
There 's absolutely no evidence for it .
People have also suggested jet contrails , wireless Internet , changes in the earth 's magnetic field .
More plausibly , high - fructose corn syrup , used to supplement honeybee diets , is not nutritionally very complete and has been shown to influence behavior .
Some new pesticides that are known to affect behavior are in wider use , and those may be a factor .
People are also suggesting a sort of multiple stress disorder .
Is this really a crisis ?
It 's a crisis on top of a crisis .
[ It had previously been projected that ] commercial beekeeping [ might ] cease to exist in the United States by 2035 — and that was before colony collapse disorder .
And we can't count on wild pollinators because we 've so altered the landscape that many are no longer viable .
It 's not just about running out of honey ?
Honey is trivial compared with the importance of pollination .
The two - billion - dollar almond industry in California depends entirely on honeybees .
Blueberries , melons , squashes — all kinds of crops rely heavily on honeybees .
Over three - quarters of flowering plants — the foundations for most terrestrial food chains — depend on [ honeybees and other animal ] pollinators .
Yet we know pathetically little about most of them .
Why can't we just pollinate these flowers ourselves ?
First of all , we 're talking about thousands of acres .
Secondly , flowers are very complicated .
They 're designed to keep out inappropriate visitors .
They do n't want any visitor to be able to take pollen away , so it 's not a simple problem of dusting an orchard with pollen and hoping it gets to tiny stigmatic surface of the flower where it needs to go in order to fertilize the female cells .
This is probably the wrong question , but are n't bees a little scary ?
They 're scary in that they have no business being so smart .
They 're organized and capable of unbelievable feats , such as communicating exact locations to their nest mates by orienting to polarized light and the sun .
I can't drive to Decatur without MapQuest , and these bees find their way over much vaster distances .
Honeybees air - condition their homes , know when more foragers are needed , know when more nurses are needed .
I 'll offer my theory about their disappearance : Honeybees know something we do n't know and they 're getting out .
I like the theory that visitors from another planet have decided they were going to abduct the smartest organisms on the planet , and they 've picked the honeybees .
More generally , you 've mused on how intertwined human affairs are with bugs in one of your books , Bugs in the System .
How has the fate of human societies depended on bugs in the past ?
The outcome of more wars has depended on insects than all the weapons combined .
Insects as vectors of disease — typhus , malaria , yellow fever .
Often armies are defeated not by brilliant generals , but by disease - carrying insects .
Napoleon 's attempt at conquest of Russia was a complete bust in large part because of the staggering losses to typhus .
Typhus played a role in probably 90 percent of the troop loss .
So but for the body louse , they'd be speaking French now in Moscow .
You 've also written several books of popular essays about entomology .
How can there be so much to write about bugs ?
Well , there 's a million of 'em .
Talk about job security .
And frankly , they interact with people in more different ways than any other group of organisms .
Even culture , symbols — metamorphosis , this transcendent theme in literature around the world .
It 's been argued that pyramids are basically deified dung pats , that they are inspired by scarab beetles , who emerge from dung pats after this period of quiescence .
We 're just surrounded by insect symbols , we make use of insects , wars have been fought over insect products .
A silk thread can sustain a greater weight than a steel cable of comparable dimensions .
This is insect spit !
Basically , it 's caterpillar spit .
I do n't like bugs at all .
When most people study these bugs , do they get over their aversion ?
That 's one reason I teach a course here we call " general education , " a course for nonscientists .
I do n't expect people to become entomologists or even necessarily to love bugs , but at least to think before reflexively stepping on them .
They are just capable of the most amazing things , and many of the things that they do we could n't survive on this planet without them doing .
Waste disposal — it 's a dirty job , someone 's got to do it .
Without insects , this world would be a filthy place .
They 're about the only things that can break down dead bodies and take care of dung .
So these things , we just take them for granted .
They 're small , therefore they 're insignificant .
But frankly , tiny diamonds are n't insignificant .
Download " Averaging Gradius " QuickTime Movie Running Time : 2:57 Filesize : 26.4 Megs
Origins of the Project
Averaging gameplay , an idea which started from this discussion , sounds pretty straight forward - looking at how different players handle similar situations in a video game .
What are the average actions that these players perform ?
What makes their run-through unique ?
What works best ?
How do people handle Bowser ?
What path do most racers take in Gran Turismo ?
What order do people take down bosses in Mega Man 2 ?
How do people react to the The Sorrow in Metal Gear Solid 3 ?
The problem with these examples , and games like them , is that there 's no easy way to compare the data .
The player is usually free to move where and when they want .
How do you find a way to analyze that , to draw any measurable parallels , when each player can move to completely different parts of the level at will ?
The answer is to choose a game which locks down those variables , to prevent that freedom of choice .
How about Gradius , for the NES ?
Gradius , an auto - scrolling shoot 'em up , is programmed so that the stage automatically scrolls at a fixed rate .
With the stage constant , that allows us to compare how the player interacts with the AI and how , retroactively , the AI responds to that .
After I created a demo video as a proof - of - concept ( which consisted of me playing a short section of the game several times ) I invited people to send me gameplay recordings .
I ended up with 15 different submissions , including my own .
The participants include all three main contributors of The New Gamer ( G. Turner , D. Riley and myself ) , Nullsleep ( you may know of his chiptunes at 8 bitpeoples ) , four personal friends of mine , three members of the shmups.com boards and four from Insert Credit .
It is this selection of ' Level 1 ' runs that was used for the " averaging " .
End Results
So what did it accomplish ?
What does the video show ?
Is it more than just a colorful kit - bashing of people playing Gradius ?!
What first caught my eye when compiling the video , which came as a complete shock , was that the end boss was n't set on a absolute path !
Instead , it responds and reacts to the player 's actions .
Now perhaps this is n't a surprise to all those Gradius pros out there , but I was pretty impressed to see that sort of action from such an old game .
In one of the tracks , the boss actually sits at the bottom of the screen , waiting to respond to the player 's next move .
The average time taken to kill the end level boss was 20.055 seconds , with the fastest player finishing him off in a mere 10.01 seconds .
Six people finished the boss off at nearly identical moments .
It would seem that the boss , bored with the player , actually self - destructs after 27 seconds .
Beyond the almost perfectly synchronized explosions , further proof of this self - destruction can be found in the videos : no 10,000 point bonus ( given to players when the boss is defeated ) was awarded to these six players and , in a few of the runs , the boss detonated when there was n't a single bullet near it .
The infamous volcano sequence ( which caused more problems and death with the crowd of submitters than even the end boss ) certainly shows that the most common tactic is to park your ship in or around the top corner and blast away !
Only two people did not go with this method : the red Vic Viper which sits underneath the lip of the volcano , and a blue one which actually floats in the middle of the action and yet never fires one shot .
Three people were not daring enough to go for the 5000 point bonus , and of the rest , most grabbed the bonus when the pathway through the mountain was the safest , when both exits were effective escape routes .
There were two people , however , who grabbed it right away and one who waited for the very last moment to touch it ( and allowed the screen to scroll him into the points . )
The average person prefers the Laser , at 2 to 1 odds ; not so much the Double as only 2 people used it .
Everyone used the Missile .
Shields ( marked as a ' ? ' on the HUD ) seemed to be actively avoided by some , as though it was a sign of bad form , and only a third of the crowd equipped it .
Instead , most activated a second Option , that little glowy ball that follows the Vic Viper and fires , and it was this crowd who finished off the boss faster .
There was a single person who had both the shields and two Options ( at the cost of lasers . )
One person paused ( thanks Mr. Riley , I needed the extra editing work ) .
But I found even the more pointless things incredibly interesting ( and telling ) , like seeing when each person pressed the start button to skip the title screen from scrolling in , or watching as each Vic Viper , in sequence , would take out the red ships flying in a wave pattern , to leave behind power - ups in an almost perfect sine wave sequence .
I love how the little mech - like gunpods together emerge from off screen , as a bright , white mass , and slowly break apart into a rainbow of mech clones .
Technical Garbage
Creating the video actually ended up to be a much more laborious task than I had expected .
If you are n't actually interested in the process of creating this video , feel free to skip ahead to the next section ...
So now that the cowards have left , let 's continue .
Originally I had intended on simply layering all of the submitted gameplay videos , tinting them a variety of colors to help the viewer differentiate one Vic Viper from the next , and be done with it .
Visually the ' average gameplay ' is represented pretty well , as the each of the Vic Vipers collide and sum up , they produce brighter and brighter whites .
It worked great in my demo .
What I had n't counted on was that the many layers of mountains and trees , since they are obviously present in each of the gameplay videos identically , would stack up and culminate as an over - saturated mass of white .
My first method of addressing the problem was simple .
Too simple in fact .
Instead of allowing all 15 tracks to add their hues up , only two of the fifteen were given this privilege , the rest merely laid on top without effecting saturation .
This fixed the stage " white out " but introduced two new problems .
One , the effects were , to put it bluntly , ugly .
Secondly , it betrayed the goal of the project , namely averaging .
With two of the fifteen tracks being treated completely different than the rest of the project , it meant that those two tracks were inherently special .
They interacted with the other gameplay videos in a different manner than the rest .
It might have been a simple fix , but it was unacceptable .
My second solution , which sounds simple , ended up being amazingly complex but , fortunately , very successful .
I needed to fix to original problem - the over - saturation of the mountains and trees .
The obvious answer : create a ' plate ' that would cover over the blown out stage graphics .
You know , if someone had just made a Game Genie code to remove all the enemies from the game , it would have been very easy !
Or maybe if I knew how to hack a NES rom .
But no , my fix had to been done in post - production !
There are always more headaches in post .
Eventually , after some work , I got a video track that was just mountains and trees .
I ended up combining a few different Gradius runs and keying out some colors to remove the Vic Viper , bullets , enemies , and all those other unwanted sprites .
With my plate finished I could combine all the gameplay videos any way I wanted and just use the plate to cover over any ill effects that it might have on the stage graphics .
Now that I could complete the project the way I wanted to visually , it was time to tackle the sound .
A third setup was used to layer the audio tracks .
I wanted to retain all the laser blasts , ship explosions , power - up tings and the other various sound effects , but I also had to keep the sounds from become too shrill .
To that end , the gameplay audio tracks are each barely inaudible on their own , but when added up they create a fabulous sound .
The final version sounds to me like it was recorded in a room where all 15 games were being played at once .
The final version also includes an additional layer of music to heighten the score and some of the more vital ( and special ) sound effects are punched up a notch .
A fourth and final ( phew ) project was created to layer all the HUDs .
The end result , while not very helpful in understanding who has what power - ups , at least hints at what power - ups are popular , with its ever changing hues of purple and blue .
The final product is a combination of those three secondary tracks plus the fifteen tinted Gradius runs , totaling about 43 gigs of uncompressed video .
Final Thoughts
The main goal was to present this idea of averaged gameplay in a way that people could digest .
If the end product was n't both entertaining and informative then what is the point ?
Entertainment ?
Well , that 's of course up to the individual , but personally , the final video surpassed all my expectations .
I could watch the opening seconds of the stage repeatedly as the moment when all the various Vic Vipers splinter apart is just so mesmerizing .
In terms of information , it 's there if you look for it .
Statistically there 's plenty to discover , my earlier examples are a small taste of what you can conclude from watching the video .
But there 's also a lot to find that just cannot be easily expressed in text .
Watching how different players react to a spray of bullets ; seeing how some go on the offensive and attack nearly all enemies while others fire less and dodge more ; looking when certain people retreat to the back edge of the screen and when they charge forward ; monitoring the enemies as they are destroyed , slowly peeling back the layers of color , possibly leaving a mostly transparent ghost to escape off the left side of the screen .
There 's a lot to be said about how people play Gradius , at least a small group of us anyhow .

How Specialist Town Lost His Benefits
Joshua Kors
A six - month investigation has uncovered multiple cases in which soldiers wounded in Iraq are suspiciously diagnosed as having a personality disorder , then prevented from collecting benefits .
The conditions of their discharge have infuriated many in the military community , including the injured soldiers and their families , veterans ’ rights groups , even military officials required to process these dismissals .
They say the military is purposely misdiagnosing soldiers like Town and that it ’s doing so for one reason : to cheat them out of a lifetime of disability and medical benefits , thereby saving billions in expenses .

A continental crash that raised one of the biggest mountain chains in the Earth ’s history may be responsible for the explosive diversification of animals more than 500 million years ago .
Sediments washed from the mountains – dubbed the Transgondwanan Supermountain – added vital nutrients to the ocean , opening new evolutionary opportunities , says Rick Squire , now at Monash University in Clayton , Victoria , Australia .
The rapid proliferation of animals that occurred at that time is one of evolution ’s biggest enigmas .
Life had remained simple and largely single - celled for nearly three billion years , until the multi-celled Ediacara fauna evolved , 575 million years ago .
Most major groups of animals evolved during a second radiation , called the Cambrian explosion , from 530 to 510 million years ago .
The mystery of what suddenly kick - started animal evolution has been a topic of hot debate among experts .

Block war
Rising oxygen levels were clearly vital , but may not have been the only factor , Squire argues .
Other suggestions include changes in the Earth ’s orbit or exceptionally rapid motion of the continental plates on the Earth ’s surface .
Yet those candidates did not occur at the right time , Squire says .
He suggests the trigger was the collision of a series of three large continental blocks roughly corresponding to Arabia , India , and Antarctica – with the eastern edge of Africa from 650 to 515 million years ago .
The drawn - out continental impact raised a vast 1000 - kilometres - wide mountain range that stretched for more than 8000 kilometres along the equator on the ancient land mass known as Gondwana .
Heavy rains typically fall along the equator , which would have produced a high level of erosion – it was before the evolution of land plants .
Squire ’s research group has traced the resulting offshore sediment deposits around the world , and say they eventually amounted to more than 100 million cubic kilometres – enough to cover the entire US up to 10 kilometres deep .
( The Petra cliffs of Jordan are a good example of such sediment deposits , and is famed for structures carved into the stone ) .
Protective shells
Minerals in the sediments then dissolved , releasing chemicals essential for life , including phosphorous , iron , calcium , and bicarbonate ions .
By the time India collided with Africa 580 million years ago , “ the mountains got to the crucial size , [ releasing ] enough nutrients into the ocean ” that Ediacara animals could evolve , Squire told New Scientist .
Big deposits of phosphate – a critical nutrient – accumulated , he says .
Then Antarctica collided with Africa near the start of the Cambrian explosion , raising more mountains and releasing more sediment .
From 543 to 515 million years ago the concentration of calcium tripled .
Animals from trilobites to bivalves used the calcium to build protective carbonate shells , which first appeared during that period , Squire says .
There may be no single explanation , says Mary Droser at the University of California at Riverside , US , who was not involved in the research .
“ Oxygen clearly goes across the board , ” but the Ediacara was extraordinarily complex time physically , chemically and biologically .
It is “ not going to be simple ” to explain , she says .

In August 2005 , the US congress passed an act that has the main goal of increasing the amount of time people spend in daylight , therefore decreasing their energy consumption .
This act , dubbed the Energy Policy Act of 2006 , will come into effect a few weeks from now .
DST will now start 3 weeks earlier on March 11 and will end one week later then it used to on Nov. 4th .
What does this mean for most of you ?
More time under the sun .
And what does this mean for us , The system and network administrators of the world ?
Trouble , all sorts of trouble , especially for those of us who are currently supporting large windows 2000 environments and are running any versions of Exchange / Outlook previous to version 2007 on their domain .
As a result of this new DST ruling , system administrators in affected countries will have to work extra hours to set up a bunch of updates / registry hacks on their networks so that their environment can keep up with the new time adjustment .
To help you guys out with this very unpleasant task , here are a few links that should help you get started the right way .
Have you noticed that there is n't any links telling about how to patch an Exchange 2000 server ?
The reason for this is that since the product has entered in its extended support phase on the 10th of january , Microsoft will not be giving out this patch to anyone unless they are ready to shell out $ 4000 or have signed an extended support contract with them .
By doing this , Microsoft will be forcing a lot of people to migrate their old exchange mailing infrastructure to a newer one , taking advantage of the situation to make a few bucks .
Depressing is n't it ?
As an alpha nerd , Harper Robertson naturally thinks her high school is kickwump -- a word her class coined .
She would n’t be prouder if it had the top - ranked football team on planet Earth , which it most decidedly does n’t and never will .
“ I knew I was going to a nerdy high school when I realized that the only elective was Java programming , ” she said .
If you could set foot on Harper ’s campus -- you ca n’t -- you ’d see what she loves about it .
It ’s a school for teens who never fit into the traditional classroom because they were too high - achieving , too driven , too intellectually curious or all of the above ; youths who were lumped under the general heading of “ gifted , ” although the gift did n’t always come with instructions for assembly .
Now students say they have a school where they belong : the EPGY Online High School , part of what may be the oldest online learning program in the world , Stanford University ’s Education Program for Gifted Youth .

The Stanford program intertwines two uneven threads in modern education : online learning and differentiated instruction for the gifted .
As it turns out , it ’s a natural marriage , and one that underscores the potential for computers to help break down the one - size - fits - all paradigm of many U.S. schools .
Ray Ravaglia , a co-founder of Online High , calls traditional pedagogy the “ Panama Canal theory of education , ” which holds that all students must rise with their class until it reaches the top of the lock , at which point they float forward in unison .
There , those on top stay high and dry -- and bored .
Those at the bottom drown , educationally speaking .
“ We feel that all kids need to learn at their own rate , ” said Janet Keating , the head of Online High .
With the technology now available , “ I finally understand that we can do this . ”
Online High began last September with 30 students , and officials hope to expand it to around 100 in the fall .
Admission is based on a variety of factors , including grades , test scores , samples of student work and interviews .
Next year ’s tuition for full - time students is $ 12,000 .

Harper logs on from her home in Half Moon Bay , just south of San Francisco .
Jake Scheps goes to class in his bedroom in Van Nuys , emerging periodically for food , exercise and music .
Matthew Bunday taps in from Minnetonka , Minn .
Their classmates , with whom they gather by video conference most days , live in such cities as London , Hong Kong and Seoul .
“ As long as I have an Internet connection , I ’m good , ” said Harper , who dropped out of a traditional high school after one semester , feeling that it had almost nothing to teach her .
Her family is moving from California to England next year , but there will be no need to change schools .
Although online schools are not unique , Stanford ’s tries hard to reproduce many of the trappings of a traditional high school .
There is a student government , a student newspaper , a yearbook and clubs .
These include the Google Earth Society , the Philosophy Club and the Culinary Club , in which students try out recipes and discuss them online .
There ’s also talk about starting a garage band .
Of course , the garage would be virtual .

The online education program has its origins in the early 1960s .
Before there was an Internet , before there were PCs , Stanford scientists set out to determine whether computers , which at the time were building - size behemoths , could be used to train budding mathematicians .
At one point , according to Ravaglia , this involved a convoluted melding of computers , film strips and teletype technology to deliver curriculum in images and print .
By the late ‘ 60s , this proto - techno - tutoring had evolved into a program for the deaf , linking a central server at Stanford to teletype machines in schools for deaf students across the country .
“ I like to say that five years before the beginning of the Internet , we were doing a nationally distributed , computer - based education system , ” said Ravaglia , who arrived at Stanford as an undergrad in 1983 and never left .

The prototype for today ’s online school began when Stanford received a grant from the National Science Foundation to continue its work by creating an online Advanced Placement course in calculus for gifted middle and high school students .
At the end of the course , 12 of the 13 students received scores of 4 or 5 -- the highest scores possible -- on the AP test .
“ It was n’t that these kids had abilities that put them over the moon , ” said Ravaglia .
Rather , he said , their success demonstrated that “ structured , systematic presentation of the material , regular milestones and expectations , and somebody to talk to when you had questions -- that ’s all that was really needed . ”
The distance learning program gradually expanded and today offers nearly 40 courses , most in math and science as a supplement to high school , but also in expository writing and music theory .
The math courses take students from elementary school classes through university - level courses such as Real Analysis , Point - Set Topology and Axiomatic Set Theory .
But the typical course makes no effort to replicate the classroom .
Students work on their own time and at their own pace on prepared online lessons , which can include “ canned ” lectures but rarely feature live interaction .
Advertisement
The Online High School uses similar formats in some math and science classes but tends to make greater use of video conferencing to create virtual classrooms , in which students interact with one another and with the teacher .
In fact , “ interactive ” barely begins to describe an Online High class .
Take Jeff Scarborough ’s class , a rigorous social science course called “ Democracy , Freedom and the Rule of Law , ” which is required for all students .
As class begins , students log on and see a list , running down the left side of their screens , of everyone present .
As Scarborough starts the class , his face pops up on a small video screen in the upper left - hand corner .
The bulk of the screen is a virtual whiteboard , on which Scarborough presents the points of the lesson , changing them to reflect the discussion as the class unfolds .
Advertisement
And the discussion -- today , it ’s about John Dewey ’s “ Liberalism and Social Action ” and F.A. Hayek ’s “ The Constitution of Liberty ” -- is lively .
As Scarborough speaks , little hand icons pop up next to student ’s names , meaning they have their hands raised to talk .
As he calls on students , their video images replace his .
The talk is quick and sharp , ranging over the meaning of liberty , the ancillary meaning of freedom and the question of whether political liberty is naturally occurring .
It is heady stuff , a lot to absorb .
But that ’s not all that ’s going on .
On top of reading Scarborough ’s notes on the screen and listening to him and their classmates speaking , the students maintain a running conversation of instant messages , which pop up near the bottom of the screen .
It ’s like students passing notes in class , except that this is sanctioned -- mostly .
Occasionally , when the messages spin off into nonstop puns or other forms of nonacademic amusement , Scarborough has to issue a warning to focus on the class material .
Mostly , though , these are 21st century students who seem capable of doing five things at once .
Their teachers are not convinced that intelligence alone explains why the students are thriving , as most seem to do .

“ They do n’t possess any genetic type of smarts that other kids do n’t have , ” said Marc Sanders , head of the school ’s math department , who teaches university - level math in some classes , even though some of the students are barely out of middle school .
What they have , he said , is a love of learning .
For many parents , the school is a dream come true .
Some had been home - schooling their children but were reaching the limits of what they could offer them .
Others had their children in traditional schools .
Online High has its limitations .
It does not offer art , drama , dance or musical performance classes or , obviously , physical education .
It did n’t offer a foreign language this year , although there are plans for that in the future .

Students are left to their own devices on those fronts .
Some have turned to their neighborhood schools .
Aaron Kahn , who lives in San Jose , said the principal of a nearby school seemed happy to accommodate him .
He takes AP French , AP statistics and wind ensemble .
Others have n’t been so lucky ; some school districts have been reluctant to allow students to enroll for one or two classes .
Some parents worried initially that their children would n’t have satisfying social lives in an online high school .
So far , that has not been the case .
Some students have made close bonds with their online classmates -- in some cases , they say , among the closest relationships they ’ve ever had in school .
There is much instant messaging and e-mailing throughout the day , in and out of class , and some students have traveled to get together .
Oddly enough , it has come to feel like a school -- right down to its own traditions and goofy slang .
Kickwump , for instance .
Advertisement
Harper says that students were studying the Gilded Age in American History and were reading about the Mugwump Party .
Translating it into modern slang , they came up with kickwump .
“ So , if something is really cool , we now say , ‘ That is so kickwump , ’ except we abbreviate it to kw , because we ’re speaking online . ”

Welcome Customer ,
Let the world know what you know !
Armed units from the private security firm Blackwater USA opened fire in Baghdad streets twice in two days last week .
It triggered a standoff between the security contractors and Iraqi forces , a reminder that the war in Iraq may be remembered mostly in our history books for empowering and building America 's first modern mercenary army .
There are an estimated 20,000 to 30,000 armed security contractors working in Iraq , although there are no official figures and some estimates run much higher .
Security contractors are not counted as part of the coalition forces .
When the number of private mercenary fighters is added to other civilian military " contractors " who carry out logistical support activities such as food preparation , the number rises to about 126,000 .
" We got 126,000 contractors over there , some of them making more than the secretary of defense , " said House defense appropriations subcommittee Chairman John Murtha ( D. , Pa. ) .
" How in the hell do you justify that ? "
The privatization of war hands an incentive to American corporations , many with tremendous political clout , to keep us mired down in Iraq .
But even more disturbing is the steady rise of this modern Praetorian Guard .
The Praetorian Guard in ancient Rome was a paramilitary force that defied legal constraints , made violence part of the political discourse , and eventually plunged the Roman Republic into tyranny and despotism .
Despotic movements need paramilitary forces that operate outside the law , forces that sow fear among potential opponents , and are capable of physically silencing those branded by their leaders as traitors .
And in the wrong hands , a Blackwater could well become that force .
American taxpayers have so far handed a staggering $ 4 billion to " armed security " companies in Iraq such as Blackwater , according to House Oversight and Government Reform Committee Chairman Rep. Henry Waxman ( D. , Calif . ) .
Tens of billions more have been paid to companies that provide logistical support .
Rep. Jan Schakowsky ( D. , Ill. ) of the House Intelligence Committee estimates that 40 cents of every dollar spent on the occupation has gone to war contractors .
It is unlikely that any of these corporations will push for an early withdrawal .
The profits are too lucrative .
Mercenary forces like Blackwater operate beyond civilian and military law .
They are covered by a 2004 edict passed by American occupation authorities in Iraq that immunizes all civilian contractors in Iraq from prosecution .
SCROLL TO CONTINUE WITH CONTENT Never Miss a Beat .

Blackwater , barely a decade old , has migrated from Iraq to set up operations in the United States and nine other countries .
It trains Afghan security forces and has established a base a few miles from the Iranian border .
The huge contracts from the war - including $ 750 million from the State Department since 2004 - have allowed Blackwater to amass a fleet of more than 20 aircraft , including helicopter gunships .
Jeremy Scahill , the author of Blackwater : The Rise of the World 's Most Powerful Mercenary Army , points out that Blackwater has also constructed " the world 's largest private military facility - a 7,000 - acre compound near the Great Dismal Swamp of North Carolina . "
Blackwater also recently opened a facility in Illinois ( " Blackwater North " ) and , despite local opposition , is moving ahead with plans to build another huge training base near San Diego .
The company recently announced it was creating a private intelligence branch called " Total Intelligence . "
Erik Prince , who founded and runs Blackwater , is a man who appears to have little time for the niceties of democracy .
He has close ties with the radical Christian Right and the Bush White House .
He champions his company as a patriotic extension of the U.S. military .
His employees , in an act as cynical as it is dishonest , take an oath of loyalty to the Constitution .
But what he and his allies have built is a mercenary army , paid for with government money , which operates outside the law and without constitutional constraint .
Mercenary units are a vital instrument in the hands of despotic movements .
Communist and fascist movements during the last century each built rogue paramilitary forces .
And the appearance of Blackwater fighters , heavily armed and wearing their trademark black uniforms , patrolling the streets of New Orleans in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina , may be a grim taste of the future .
In New Orleans Blackwater charged the government $ 240,000 a day .
" ' It can not happen here ' is always wrong , " the philosopher Karl Popper wrote .
" A dictatorship can happen anywhere . "
The word contractor helps launder the fear and threat out of a more accurate term : " paramilitary force . "
We 're not supposed to have such forces in the United States , but we now do .
And if we have them , we have a potential threat to democracy .
On U.S. soil , Blackwater so far has shown few signs of being an out - and - out rogue retainer army , though they looked the part in New Orleans .
But were this country to become even a little less stable , outfits like Blackwater might see a heyday .
If the United States falls into a period of instability caused by another catastrophic terrorist attack , an economic meltdown that triggers social unrest , or a series of environmental disasters , such paramilitary forces , protected and assisted by fellow ideologues in the police and military , could ruthlessly abolish what is left of our eroding democracy .
War , with the huge profits it hands to corporations , and to right - wing interests such as the Christian Right , could become a permanent condition .
And the thugs with automatic weapons , black uniforms and wraparound sunglasses who appeared on the streets in New Orleans could appear on our streets .
In the years Mr. Kevorkian spent in prison , little has changed legally in this realm across the country .
Oregon remains the only state with a law in which a terminally ill patient can ask a doctor to prescribe a lethal amount of medication under certain circumstances .
Since 1998 , 292 people have died under the terms of Oregon ’s Death With Dignity Act .

Other states , including Vermont , have rejected such proposals , and national advocates for assisted suicide said they would be watching California ’s bill next week with particular concern .
“ If it does n’t pass there , that will be a pretty good sign to us that no legislative body will pass it , ” said Barbara Lee , the president of Compassion & Choices , a group based in Denver and Portland that supports assisted suicide .
Mr. Kevorkian was tried four times in the deaths of ill people before being convicted in 1999 of giving a fatal injection to Thomas Youk , a 52 - year - old man who had Lou Gehrig ’s disease .
He was sentenced to 10 to 25 years .
The main evidence against him was a tape showing the injection that Mr. Kevorkian had taken to “ 60 Minutes , ” the CBS News program that broadcast it at the time along with an interview in which Mr. Kevorkian challenged the law enforcement authorities to try him .
Outside the prison on Friday , Mr. Kevorkian briefly embraced Mike Wallace , the “ 60 Minutes ” correspondent who taped a new interview with him on Friday .
It is to be broadcast on Sunday evening .
Mr. Kevorkian , the same gaunt , white - haired figure familiar to many , smiled and quietly told reporters that leaving prison was “ one of the high points of life . ”
His lawyers have said he is ill , suffering from hepatitis C . He will live with friends in Michigan .
Russ Marlan , a spokesman for the state ’s Department of Corrections , said the conditions of Mr. Kevorkian ’s parole did not preclude his speaking broadly in support of the notion of assisted suicide , but barred him from helping anyone directly .
Mr. Kevorkian ’s friends welcomed his return , calling him a caring leader who had aided the wishes of the terminally ill and who , in return , had been grossly abused by the legal system .
They had little patience with national advocates now distancing themselves from Mr. Kevorkian .

The Browns are moving into 10 Downing Street
Brown at Number 10
Posing outside 10 Downing Street with his wife Sarah , the man who has been Mr Blair 's chancellor since 1997 said : " Let the work of change begin . "
He said his priorities were education , health and restoring trust in politics and promised to " try my utmost " .
Mr Blair has stood down as MP for Sedgefield after 24 years to become a Middle East peace envoy .
A Cabinet reshuffle is expected on Thursday .
Standing ovation
Long - time ally Alistair Darling is tipped to replace Mr Brown as chancellor .
BBC political editor Nick Robinson said it was likely that Environment Secretary David Miliband would be promoted to foreign secretary .
I will try my utmost .
This is my promise to all of the people of Britain
Gordon Brown , prime minister
The Gordon Brown story
In full : Brown 's No 10 words
Before entering 10 Downing Street , Mr Brown said : " This will be a new government with new priorities .
And I have been privileged to have been granted the great opportunity to serve my country .
" And at all times I will be strong in purpose , steadfast in will , resolute in action in the service of what matters to the British people , meeting the concerns and aspirations of our whole country . "
Reshuffle
Mr Brown promised to lead a government of " all the talents " and said his " mission " was to provide " the best of chances for everyone " .

No 10 for first time as prime minister
Day at - a- glance Nick Robinson 's view
" If we can fulfil the potential and realise the talents of all our people then I 'm absolutely sure that Britain can be the great global success story of this century , " he told reporters in Downing Street .
Then , quoting his school motto , he said : " I will try my utmost .
This is my promise to all of the people of Britain .
And now let the work of change begin . "
Mr Brown is thought likely to carry out the bulk of his Cabinet reshuffle on Thursday , but it has already emerged that Margaret Beckett is leaving her post of foreign secretary .
Ms Hewitt , who has elderly parents in Australia , said she was quitting the government for " personal reasons " .
Election demand
Baroness Amos , leader of the House of Lords , is leaving the Cabinet , the BBC has learned .
Conservative leader David Cameron congratulated Mr Brown on becoming prime minister , but demanded he hold an immediate general election .
He said : " Gordon Brown does n't have the mandate , he was n't elected as prime minister , and he should go to the country . "
Mr Brown spent 57 minutes inside Buckingham Palace in a private audience with the Queen - more than double Mr Blair 's 28 minutes .
Mr Brown , 56 , becomes the 11th prime minister of the Queen 's reign .
I am truly sorry for the dangers they face today

Why is Blair going ?
Sketch : Blair 's finale
He became Labour leader unopposed on Sunday after potential rivals had failed to gain enough support to mount a challenge .
Earlier , Mr Blair was earlier given an emotional standing ovation by MPs .
He admitted he had " never pretended to be a great House of Commons man " but he paid tribute to the " noble " work of MPs and - in his final words to Parliament - said : " I wish everyone , friend or foe , well and that is that , the end . "
Mr Blair travelled by train to Sedgefield , in the north - east of England , where he said farewell to local party members after 24 years as their MP .
He will take up a new job as a peace envoy for the " quartet " of the UN , America , EU and Russia .

As they left Downing Street the Blair family - including their four children - posed for the media .
Mr Blair said nothing as they got in the car , but wife Cherie smiled and waved at the press and said she would not " miss " them .
Conservative leader David Cameron hailed Mr Blair 's " remarkable achievement " in being prime minister for 10 years , praising peace in Northern Ireland and Mr Blair 's work in the developing world which he said will " endure " .
He wished him " every success for whatever he does in the future " .

Mr Blair thanked Mr Cameron for his tributes and said although he could not wish the Tory leader well politically , " personally I wish both him and his family very well indeed " .
Liberal Democrat leader Sir Menzies Campbell said that , despite their political disagreements , Mr Blair had been " unfailingly courteous " and extended his party 's best wishes to the outgoing prime minister and his family .
The World 's First Computer Animation And Effects In Film :
Many of us think of the movie  Tron as the the first film to use computer animation or effects in any form .
But the technology goes back a lot further than 1982 , when Tron was released .
Here are some notable milestones in computer animation and effects in film :
First Computer Rendering :
Arguably the first movie ever to use computers to create a visual effect ( a 2D rotating structure on one level of the underground lab ) was The Andromeda Strain , in 1971 .
The effect was extremely advanced for its time , with work by Douglas Trumbull ( who also worked on  2001 : A Space Odyssey ) , James Shourt , and Albert Whitlock ( who worked on the Alfred Hitchcock film  The Birds ) .
Worlds First  True Computer Animation :
The short film  The Hunger ( 1974 ) from the National Film Board Of Canada is notable as the first computer animation to be nominated for an Academy Award ( as best short film ) .
The 2 dimensional 11 minute feature about world hunger was the first to use computers to fill in  the action between key cels drawn by a human artist .
Because a computer actually created  the animation depicted in the images , this is the worlds first example of " true " computer animation .
Follow the links to watch a clip of the movie .

First Animation In Film Using 3D CGI :
The first film to use 3D computer - generated images to create an animation was the movie  Futureworld , in 1976 .
The movie featured computer generated images of a hand and face .
The hand was a digitized  version of the left hand of Edwin Catmull , who later co-founded Pixar Animation Studios .
The groundbreaking CGI effects in the movie were later awarded a Scientific and Engineering Academy Award in 1994 .
First 3D Animation

First Computer Generated Character
In Film :
There is some debate as to who brought us the first CGI character .
Some believe the polyhedron character  Bit in Tron qualifies for this honor .
But because of the characters limited range of controls and animation , some insist that  Bit does not qualify as a true character .
Others insist the first CGI character animation was featured in the movie Young Sherlock Holmes in 1985 .
The character was depicted as a stained glass figure come to life , and was actually engineered by Pixar , who were known more for their animated short  Luxo , Jr.  in their early days .
You will probably not be surprised to learn that the first movie to use 3D computer animation was the iconic film Star Wars , in 1977 .
A 3D wireframe view of the Death Star trench was depicted as a training aid for rebel pilots .
The animation was quite basic , and did not have any kind of textures or shading applied to the walls of the trench .
Again , though , it was quite an innovation for its time .

In Japan , the codes did not become mainstream until the largest cellphone companies started loading the code readers on all new phones a few years ago .
Now , millions of people have the capability built into their phones , and businesses , in turn , are using them all over — on billboards , street signs , published materials and even food packaging .
Image
In the late 1990s , several dozen start - up companies tried to create devices that would scan print content and ads and then reveal extra information to the reader .
But consumers balked at using a special device only to interact with publications .
But now the time seems right for cellphones , ubiquitous and increasingly sold with cameras , to be pressed into service as the scanners .
“ There are three things you tend to carry — your keys , your wallet and your phone , ” said Rishad Tobaccowala , chief executive of Denuo , a unit of the Publicis Groupe that focuses on emerging and future technologies .
“ I can see something in advertising in one place , scan it with my phone and recall it later when I am shopping .
Or , imagine , I can buy it using my phone . ”
About a third of the 84 million households with cellphones in the United States have phones that have cameras on them , according to Forrester Research , and that number is expected to grow as consumers replace their phones .
But few people with those phones have downloaded the software to read the codes .
In Japan , some highway billboards have codes large enough for passing motorists to read them with their phones .
Hospitals put them on prescriptions , allowing pharmacies to instantly scan the medical information rather than read it .
Supermarkets stick them on meat and egg packaging to give expiration dates and even the names of the farmers who produced them .
One of the most popular uses in Japan has been paperless airline tickets .
About 10 percent of the people who take domestic flights of All Nippon Airways now use the codes on their cellphones instead of printed tickets .

Saudi King Abdullah , whose country is a close US ally , on Wednesday slammed the " illegitimate foreign occupation " of Iraq in an opening speech to the annual Arab summit in Riyadh .
" In beloved Iraq , blood is being shed among brothers in the shadow of an illegitimate foreign occupation , and ugly sectarianism threatens civil war , " Abdullah said .
He also said that Arab nations , which are planning to revive a five - year - old Middle East peace plan at the summit , would not allow any foreign force to decide the future of the region .
In the past , Saudi leaders including Foreign Minister Prince Saud al - Faisal have often criticized US policy in Iraq but have never described its presence there as " illegitimate . "
If Arab leaders recover trust in each other and regain their credibility , " the winds of hope will blow on the nation , and then , we will not allow forces from outside the region to determine the future of the region , and only the flag of Arabism will be raised on Arab soil , " Abdullah said .
Arab foreign ministers meeting ahead of the summit agreed on Monday to call for an amendment of Iraq 's 2005 constitution to give Sunni Arabs a greater share of power in the war - ravaged country and prevent its breakup .

But Iraqi Foreign Minister Hoshyar Zebari responded by saying the government did not need a " diktat " from the Arabs on how to amend its constitution and boost national reconciliation .
The Iraqi government has initiated moves to review a de-Baathification law in a bid to woo former members of the regime of executed dictator Saddam Hussein back into politics and government jobs .
Under a controversial de-Baathification law , tens of thousands of members of Iraq 's former ruling Baath party were stripped of their posts in government , at universities and in business after the 2003 US - led invasion .
The law has been a major source of grievance for the minority Sunnis , who have waged a deadly insurgency against US troops and the Shiite - led American - backed government in Baghdad .
Iraq 's once - ruling Sunnis also want an amendment of the constitution , which they fear leaves their central regions without natural resources and Iraq 's oil wealth in the hands of the governing Shiites and the autonomous Kurds .

It shows that the two countries are closely followed by the United States and North Korea .
The poll asked 28,000 people in 27 countries to rate a dozen countries plus the EU in terms of whether they have a positive or negative influence .
Canada , Japan and the EU are viewed most positively in the survey .
' Traditional divides '
In January , the BBC World Service revealed polling results that suggested most people think the US has a mainly negative influence in the world - and that the numbers had increased significantly in the last couple of years .
This latest GlobeScan survey , mostly of the same people , confirms those findings .
But it also suggests that two countries are viewed even more negatively - first Israel , and then Iran .
North Korea is just behind the US .
Israel , of course , has long provoked sharp international reactions , and last year was involved in a controversial war in Lebanon .
Iran and North Korea have both been at the centre of international disputes over their nuclear programmes .

Canada , Japan , and the EU are viewed most positively , perhaps because they have all taken less high - profile roles in the world 's recent confrontations .
India is one country in the survey that seems to have improved its standing in the last year .
In general , opinion seems to divide along the traditional fault lines of international politics .
Israel is viewed most negatively in the Muslim countries of the Middle East , although also in Europe .
Iran is viewed most positively in the Muslim world .
Japan is generally viewed positively , except in China and South Korea .
The EU similarly gets good marks , except most notably in Turkey , and also in parts of the Middle East .
Leahy says he will subpoena Rove WASHINGTON ( CNN ) -- Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy , D - Vermont , said Wednesday that he will subpoena Karl Rove to appear before his panel regarding the Bush administration 's firing of eight U.S. attorneys , if the White House deputy chief of staff does not do so voluntarily .
" He can appear voluntarily if he wants , " Leahy said of Rove in an interview with CNN Anchor Wolf Blitzer .
" If he does n't , I will subpoena him . "
Leahy added , " The attorney general said , ' Well , there are some staff people or lower level people -- I am not sure whether I want to allow them to testify or not . '
I said , ' Frankly , Mr. attorney general , it 's not your decision , it 's mine and the committee's . '
We will have some subpoenas . "

Taser stun-guns are already controversial , in the hands of cops and G.I.s .
Now imagine a whole field of the electric weapons — out of human hands , entirely .
Taser International recently rolled out its Taser Remote Area Denial ( TRAD ) system — a networked series of sensors and stun - gun projectiles that promises to " observe , warn , incapacitate and retain intruders " from afar .
Today , security teams have to be deployed to stop an intruder , when one is detected hoping over a fence or slipping through a gate .
But that response takes time , and " exposes our forces to risk . "
What the TRAD provides , its makers say , is " a delay and arrest capability at key locations that can be employed instantly upon threat alert and assessment . "
An array of TRADs — or a " TASERNET , " in company lingo — provides " the capabilities of visual observation and oversight coupled with the ability to engage and incapacitate targets remotely .
The things are " ideal for protecting high value facilities or operations such as checkpoints , command centers , depots , aircraft insertions , and spec ops , as well as fixed installations such as embassies , air fields , utility facilities , pipelines , etc . "
A simple user interface allows the operator to see , track , and identify targets with specific target designators indicating whether each target is a “ friend ” or “ foe . ”
The TASERNET application displays visual information from TRAD imagers as well as oversight cameras integrated with a graphic representation of targets positions and designations .
Once an engagement decision is made ( either by the operator or the system depending on user selected settings ) , the
TASERNET program selects the specific TRAD units best suited for engagement and transmits fire authorization .
The TRAD unit will then arrest the targeted individuals by providing complete incapacitation .
Commands can be issued to the targeted individuals over th TASERNET
system and the triggered TRAD unit can be reengaged by the operator as needed to restrain the targeted individuals until response teams can take the targeted individuals into custody .
And if , after their robo - shocks , those individuals in custody start to get unruly … well , there are always the old - school stun guns .
UPDATE : Via Gizmodo , check out this Taser and TRAD promotional video .

What drug is the narrator on , anyway ?

Two emails hit our inbox in 2007 :
Hi All -
Just wanted to send you a quick email and warn you about using hand sanitizers wtih your young kids .
We have been using that with Sydney in place of hand washing for convience sake .
Today she told me she was going up to her room to get a toy , while I was downstairs feeding Griffin , and after taking longer then it should I called for her .
When she did n’t answer I knew she was up to something and the bathroom door was closed .
She got into the hand sanitizer and had ingested some of it .
There was n’t a large amount missing from the bottle but I could smell it on her breath .
Within approx . 10 min. she was all glassy eyed and wobbly in her feet .
As the minutes passed , she continued to get worse and got to the point where she could n’t even stand up or walk , it was awful !!
I called poison control immediately and they told me to take her to the ER right away due to the alcohol level in hand sanitizers .
As we were driving there her speech became slurred and harder to understand and her eyes looked awful .
They admitted her and did urine and blood tests and it turns out that her blood alcohol level was .10 — which is legally drunk .
It turns out that the hand sanitizers ( Purell ) have 62 % alcohol in them and the dr. compared it to her drinking something that is 120 proof .
We had a VERY scary afternoon but thankfully she is ok .
We were in the ER until this evening , after spending the whole afternoon there , so they could monitor her and make sure her blood sugars were stable .
They said that someone her size would only need to have 3 squirts of it to get to the point of being .10 blood level .
She has always wanted to lick her hands after we use it and we have warned her that it is dangerous and something that kids ca n’t do or they will end up in the hospital .
Needless to say , we are going to go back to washing hands with soap and water because it is way to risky and scary to use this stuff seeing how little a child needs to be affected by it .
We asked about long term affected with the liver , brain , etc and the dr. said we have nothing to worry about but we need to get rid of all the hand sanitizer in the house .
Just wanted to let you all know so you can learn from our lesson and not have to go through something as scary as this …
Ok .
I do n’t know where to begin because the last 2 days of my life have been such a blur .
Yesterday ,
My youngest daughter Halle who is 4 , was rushed to the emergancy room by her father for being severely lethargic and incoherent .
He was called to her school by the school secretary for being “ very VERY sick . ”
He told me that when he arrived that Halle was barely sitting in the chair .
She could n’t hold her own head up and when he looked into her eyes , she could n’t focus them .
He immediately called me after he scooped her up and rushed her to the ER .
When we got there , they ran blood test after blood test and did x-rays , every test imaginable .
Her white blood cell count was normal , nothing was out of the ordinary .
The ER doctor told us that he had done everything that he could do so he was sending her to Saint Francis for further test .
Right when we were leaving in the ambulance , her teacher had come to the ER and after questioning Halle ’s classmates , we found out that she had licked hand sanitizer off her hand .
Hand sanitizer , of all things .
But it makes sense .
These days they have all kinds of differents scents and when you have a curious child , they are going to put all kinds of things in their mouths .
When we arrived at Saint Francis , we told the ER doctor there to check her blood alcohol level , which , yes we did get weird looks from it but they did it .
The results were her blood alcohol level was 85 % and this was 6 hours after we first took her .
Theres no telling what it would have been if we would have tested it at the first ER .
Since then , her school and a few surrounding schools have taken this out of the classrooms of all the lower grade classes but whats to stop middle and high schoolers too ?
After doing research off the internet , we have found out that it only takes 3 squirts of the stuff to be fatal in a toddler .
For her blood alcohol level to be so high was to compare someone her size to drinking something 120 proof .
So please PLEASE do n’t disregard this because I do n’t ever want anyone to go thru what
my family and I have gone thru .
Today was a little better but not much .
Please send this to everyone you know that has children or are having children .
It does n’t matter what age .
I just want people to know the
dangers of this .
Thank you
Lacey Butler and family

They feel that 24 - hour internet access is hampering students ' academic performance and overall personality development .
Students have unlimited free access to the internet in their hostel rooms to help with coursework and research but many of them use it to download movies , play games and chat online instead .
The institute says students are losing social skills by chatting online
The press relations officer for IIT Bombay , Aruna Thosar - Dixit , told the BBC website this was having an adverse effect on their academics and social habits .
The ban was an attempt at correcting that , she said .
Students say while the reasons for doing so maybe right , the way they are going about it is wrong and the move is proving to be counter - productive .
Extra-curricular
Ms Thosar - Dixit said they were beginning to see a drop in attendance during morning lectures and a noticeable decline in students ' participation in extra-curricular activities .
" In the morning the students would not be fresh and attentive and their socialising patterns were changing as they preferred to sit in their rooms and surf the net rather than interact with their mates .
" Academics are of primary importance for us but we also want our students to have a well - rounded personality . "
Ms Thosar - Dixit said students would not have access to the internet in their hostel rooms between 2300 and 1230 but could log on in the library or their departmental laboratories where access will be uninterrupted .
The dean of students affairs , Prakash Gopalan , said one only had to look at the hard drive of any of the students ' computers to see that bad content dominated over good .
" In the end , this is the Indian taxpayers ' money as well as the IIT 's network and we have an obligation to ensure that it is not misused , " he said .
If I get up at two in the morning and feel that I am in the mood to do some course work , then I would find it very difficult to get up , get dressed and go to the library
Abir , IIT student
He also said he has had both positive and negative reactions to the decision .
" I 've had parents who have called and e-mailed me saying that I 've done the right thing , " he said .
" One student said to me on the first night the net was disconnected , they all came out and called us all sorts of names but soon pulled out guitars and enjoyed chatting with each other until late in the night . "
' Crippling choice '
Mr Gopalan says he is open to all suggestions and the decision will be reviewed after a month .
Final year engineering student Abir Bhowmick said it is a rather rash and impulsive decision because he feels " crippled " without the internet .
High - flyers like the CEO of Infosys Technologies attended the institute
" It is only at night that all of us are awake and focussed on whatever it is that we are doing , whether it is playing games or working on some research paper , " he said .
" If I get up at two in the morning and feel that I am in the mood to do some course work , then I would find it very difficult to get up , get dressed and go to the library , " he said .
Another final year student , Ankit Jain , said he understood that authorities were trying to do something right but feels that the way they are going about it is wrong .
" A person who wants to sit in his or her room will do so no matter what you do .
Banning the internet at night only hampers our work , " he said .
Top of the class
The IITs are India 's top engineering institutes where the best brains in the country are chosen to pursue their studies after a rigorous selection process .
The facilities offered here are top - notch and there are very few engineering institutes in India that offer unlimited access to internet in hostels at all times for all days of the year .
Many of India 's top entrepreneurs , such as software major Infosys chief Nandan Nilekani , and telecom company Bharti's chairman , Sunil Mittal , are IIT alumni .
There are seven IITs based in Bombay , Madras , Kanpur , Kharagpur , Guwahati , Roorkee and Delhi .
IIT Madras put limits on internet usage more than a year now .
Students do not have any net access in their hostel rooms from 0100 to 0500 .
Their dean of students affairs , Professor V G Idichandy , said they had similar issues as those faced by IIT Bombay then and a committee set up to review the situation decided to impose the net ban .
" It is working well for us now , " he said , " From personal experience I can tell you that I have two morning lectures beginning at 0800 and attendance is always 95 % . "
IIT Delhi says it is " watching " how the decision pans out in IIT Bombay , will wait for the month - end review and then decide whether they want to impose such a ban on their campus .
IITs in Kanpur and Khragpur say it is up to the students to exercise self - restraint and have chosen to leave them to their own devices .
Private Jets and Business Aircraft
Two Unusual Very Light Jets
As very light jets start to become more widespread , we came across two that have their own very unique characteristics .
One of them has been around for almost 50 years , the other one is due for first deliveries in 2008 .
Both of them have military and civilian guises .
Yes , there is actually an aircraft out there , which has all the machismo , looks and performance of a military plane but is available as an executive jet !
While there are several very light jets at various stages of development , the ATG Javelin ( pictured left ) will be the exotic sports car of the VLJ world .
This two seater is designed to perform and handle like a jet fighter , with a 9,000 fpm rate of climb and a top speed of 540 ktas .
It will be sold as both an airforce jet trainer and as a civilian jet .
To provide it 's performance characteristics the Javelin has state of the art avionics , is built with advanced composite materials and has two Williams FJ - 33 jet engines providing 1,800 pounds of thrust each .
As is typical with VLJs it has a range of about 1,000 nm .
The development model of the ATG Javelin fist took to the sky in September 2005 , and it's FAA certification and first deliveries are eagerly anticipated in 2008 .
If you 're interested in buying one outright , the price is about $ 2.8 m .
We have n't heard of any plans to put them in fractional programs as yet , but will be on the watchout as these launch .
Tagged as one of the most affordable light business jets ever made , the MS 760 Paris Jet ( pictured right ) has been around for almost half a century .
It was unveiled at the Aeronautique Navale 's public competition for a new jet trainer in the early 50s as the MS - 755 Fleuret .
It saw service in the French , Brazilian and Argentinian armed forces , amongst others , and was finally retired from the French Navy in 1997 .
Now over 30 of these planes have been restored in the US and given modern avionics systems in a light business jet category all its own .
The fully updated MS 760 is powered by two Turbomeca Marbore VI engines delivering 1,058 lbs of thrust and a top speed of 375 ktas .
With total seating for four in an all glass cockpit , it can take you over 1,000 miles or about 3 hours of flying .
The MS 760 is restored by Your Aircraft Source and is available under a fractional program from JetSet Inc based out of Toronto and Orlando .
The fractional ownership provides 25 hours of flying time for $ 60,000 , with monthly fees of $ 1,100 and hourly fees of $ 1,100 .
You can read a broad overview of fractional ownership in our article " Fractional Jets Overview " .

In a packed hearing room at the Food and Drug Administration last week , a panel of cardiac experts met to consider what was obviously an important question :
Has one of the most popular treatments for heart disease in fact been killing some of the patients it is meant to help ?
Three years ago , doctors began using a new device called a drug - coated stent — a tiny metal tube — to keep blocked heart arteries open .
It cost a lot more than an uncoated stent , but because it seemed to be far more effective , it quickly began to dominate the stent market .
Last year , Johnson & Johnson and Boston Scientific together sold more than one million drug - coated stents .
They have become a primary treatment for this country ’s No. 1 cause of death .
In recent months , though , researchers found a disturbing pattern .
People with a drug - coated stent seemed unusually vulnerable to blood clots in later years .
The new stents solved one problem , but they may have created another .
So the F.D.A. summoned its cardiology advisers to review the evidence .
After listening to testimony , they concluded that for healthier patients with simple forms of heart disease , the benefits of drug - coated stents appeared to outweigh the risks .
The picture was less clear for people with diabetes , multiple blocked arteries or other complications .
In the end , the panel concluded that doctors and patients needed to be aware of the risks and that researchers should continue collecting data .
The entire affair — from the invention of the new stent to the willingness to reconsider it — was in many ways an impressive display of American medicine .
Anti-Kerry group slapped with largest - ever election law fine Michael Roston
Published : Thursday March 1 , 2007 Print This Email This
The day after Senator John Kerry confronted a financier of one group that smeared him in the 2004 election , the Federal Election Commission reached its largest ever settlement on a fine for another group that attacked the Vietnam veteran in the last presidential race .
Today 's edition of Roll Call is reporting that the Progress for America Voter Fund has been slapped with a $ 750,000 fine .
Roll Call 's Matthew Murray writes that the settlement was reached by the Progress for America Voter Fund and the Federal Election Commission yesterday .
The conservative group raised $ 45 million from prominent Republican donors in the 2004 election cycle and spent $ 30 million on advertising during the race .
At issue were advertisements from the Progress for America Voter Fund that questioned Senator Kerry 's ability to lead the military .
These ads fell outside the range of what is permissible for a " 527 " non-partisan organizations that may not work to " influence the selection , nomination , election , or appointment of any individual to public office or office in a political organization . 
" Through its public statements , activities , and solicitations for contributions , PFA - VF clearly established that it was a Federal political committee during the 2004 campaign ,  Murray quotes the agency as concluding .
Progress for America 's legal counsel told CNN that the FEC is coming up short in offering uniform regulations for such groups .
" Despite Congressional pressure to impose some set of rules or provide guidance for so called ' 527 ' groups , the FEC still refuses to do so , " Benjamin Ginsburg said .
Yesterday , RAW STORY reported on Senator Kerry 's confrontation with Sam Fox , a Bush administration nominee to be ambassador to Belgium , who provided $ 50,000 to the Swift Boat Veterans for Truth , another 527 group .
In December that group and two liberal organizations were collectively fined $ 630,000 , in contrast to yesterday 's $ 750,000 fine for a single organization .
The full Roll Call story can be accessed at the paper 's website by subscribers .
An excerpt is provided below .
#
The agency fined the Progress for America Voter Fund $ 750,000 after determining that the group had functioned like a political action committee without registering to become one .
 This settlement demonstrates once again that the commission is serious about enforcing the campaign finance law ,  said Robert Lenhard , the FECs Democratic - nominated chairman .
 It should now be clear to organizations that want to be active in the 2008 cycle that the activities we saw in this case are prohibited under the law . 
Progress for America raised roughly $ 45 million during the 2004 cycle from Alexander Spanos , Bob Perry , T. Boone Pickens and other prominent Republican donors .
The group , which ranked fourth in size among 527s that cycle , used the money to purchase more than $ 30 million worth of radio , television , direct mail and Internet advertising  some of it questioning Kerrys ability to lead the military .
Such ads may have been allowed , according to the commissions ruling Wednesday , but only if the group had registered as a political action committee .
Every now and then , a series of images comes along and just blows your mind .
I could n’t stop laughing , and then just kind of staring amazement at the micro scale “ cooking ” going on here ~ my friend is calling them Freebase Pancakes .
How one even comes up with a concept such as this amazes me .

LEONARDO DA VINCI ’S 15th - century vision of mechanical flight apparently never included fixed wings assisted by propellers or jet engines .
His chief inspiration was birds , reflected in drawings of a flying machine fashioned to stay aloft by flapping its wings .
More than 500 years later , WowWee , a robotics and entertainment products company , shares that vision .
Next month , it plans to release a mass - produced , functional ornithopter , a device that flies in birdlike fashion — in this case , a radio - controlled toy that mechanically flaps its Mylar wings .
The inspiration — besides Leonardo ’s work — is an insect , said Sean Frawley , the 22 - year - old inventor of the toy , the FlyTech Dragonfly .
“ People have been experimenting all around the world with these kinds of things , ” Mr. Frawley , an aerospace engineering graduate of Embry - Riddle Aeronautical University in Daytona Beach , Fla. , and project manager for WowWee , said in a telephone interview from the company ’s office in Hong Kong .

Independent Jewish Voices will publish an open letter on the Guardian 's Comment is Free website calling for a freer debate about the Middle East within the Jewish community .
Among the more than 130 signatories are Stephen Fry , Harold Pinter , Mike Leigh , Jenny Diski and Nicole Farhi , as well as leading academics such as Eric Hobsbawm and Susie Orbach .
" We come together in the belief that the broad spectrum of opinion among the Jewish population of this country is not reflected by those institutions which claim authority to represent the Jewish community as a whole , " the letter says .
Jewish leaders in Britain , it argues " put support for the policies of an occupying power above the human rights of an occupied people " in conflict with Jewish principles of justice and compassion .
The statement does not name the institutions it is criticising .
But one signatory , Brian Klug , an Oxford philosopher , writing an accompanying article on Comment is Free , singles out the Board of Deputies of British Jews for calling itself " the voice of British Jewry " while devoting " much of the time and resources of its international division to the defence of Israel " .
Mr Klug also criticises Britain 's chief rabbi , Sir Jonathan Sacks , for telling a pro-Israeli rally in London last year : " Israel , you make us proud . "
" Others felt roughly the opposite emotion , " Mr Klug writes .
The emergence of the group , which calls itself a " network of individuals " and can be found at www.ijv.org.uk comes at a time of ferment over attitudes towards Israel , stoked by the war in Lebanon and the bloodshed in the occupied territories .
The question of whether radical opposition to Israeli policies necessarily amounts to anti-Semitism is central to the debate .
The row was brought to a head in recent weeks by the resignation of board members of the Institute of Jewish Policy Research ( IJPR ) after it emerged that its director , Antony Lerman , had voiced support for the merging of Israel with the Palestinian territories into a single bi-national federation and a repeal of the " law of return " giving the right of anyone of Jewish descent to Israeli citizenship .
Stanley Kalms , the former head of the Dixons Group , stepped down as the IJPR 's honorary vice president , saying Mr Lerman 's views made his position " untenable " .
Writing in the Jewish Chronicle , Lord Kalms called his views " dangerous and unacceptable " and " contrary to my concept of the role of the diaspora - to support the State of Israel , warts and all " .
The row has brought furious exchanges to the Jewish Chronicle 's letter pages .
" Some of our biggest mailbags lately have been prompted by prominent Jewish public figures voicing dissenting views of Israel , which typically provokes angry rebukes from other members of the community , " David Rowan , the editor , said .
A parallel struggle is under way in the US where the American Jewish Committee published an article accusing liberal Jews such as the historian Tony Judt of fuelling anti-Semitism by questioning Israel 's right to exist .
The essay by Alvin Rosenfeld said that " one of the most distressing features of the new anti-Semitism " was " the participation of Jews alongside it " .
Prof Judt told the New York Times : " The link between anti-Zionism and anti-Semitism is newly created . "
He feared the two would become so conflated that references to anti-Semitism and the Holocaust would be seen as " just a political defence of Israeli policy " .

Last month , news of an E. coli infection that originated in a bag of fresh spinach packaged by Natural Selections Foods , kicked off a nationwide frenzy .
More than 180 people became sick from eating spinach , 97 of whom were hospitalized .
One person died .
The company in question is in total meltdown , and growers around the country are redoubling their efforts to make sure that every leaf is clean and pure .
At the first notice of problems , five different companies immediately announced a recall , as did merchants around the country .
Baggers started shipping salad with greens other than spinach .
Grocery stores immediately switched vendors .
Once it became clear that Natural Selection of Northern California was the culprit , distributors started making contracts with Southern California and Canadian companies .
Consumers stayed away in droves , and parents around the country did an about - face on their opinions of spinach .
This is one of the benefits of the information age , when word gets out to hundreds of millions in a matter of minutes .
The response was a marvel of how markets can work .
A valuable product said to bring health suddenly becomes a source of sickness and within hours , people not only stop eating it ; it is n't even available for purchase !
Compare the response time with the way governments at all levels responded to Katrina , for example .
The story might have ended there , as the groceries isolated the source of the problem and the baggers turned their attention to the farmers and the farmers looked more carefully into the irrigation and fertilizer sources and otherwise sought to fix the problem .
And why would n't they ?
They are all in business to make money .
You can only make money by selling things that people want , and this much is absolutely certain : people do n't want spinach that makes them sick .
But then , and inevitably , the government got involved .
The FDA echo chamber started issuing recalls .
Then , incredibly , the FBI got involved , as if we were talking about thugs and criminals and terrorists rather than bad soil or a mistake at the company .
Criminal prosecutors began giving ominous warnings about how " certain spinach growers and distributors may not have taken all necessary or appropriate steps to ensure their spinach was safe . "
Then the search warrants came .
The FBI said " we 're definitely looking into the possibility that there was a criminal violation of federal environmental laws " that took place .
So you can go to the FBI site and see news of how they are arresting people for supporting terrorists , hunting down the nation 's most wanted cop killers , breaking up violent gangs , hunting down art thieves , and also muscling spinach baggers .
Has the government never heard of the difference between civil and criminal law ?
To place this in the category of criminal law means that instead of fines and reimbursements or , at worst , punitive damage payments in the case of negligence , the people being investigated are implicitly threatened with jail and other forms of violence .
Does n't it seem that the bureaucratic class is drawn to the latter forms of enforcement ?
For this to be a criminal case implies that the grocers , baggers , or farmers involved in this problem are seeking to harm people through nefarious tactics , or otherwise seeking to profit by making people sick .
This is ridiculous .
Also ridiculous is the idea that the FDA and the FBI need to be involved in regulating and punishing people in business for failing to serve the interests of consumers .
The truth is that the people who buy and sell are far more interested in the wellbeing of the public than lifetime bureaucrats who have no professional stake in the outcome of the enterprising process than the man in the moon .
Their one and only interest is protecting their power and position .
Increasingly , they seize on any and every headline to whip up public frenzy .
This is government in the Bush age , in which every turn of events becomes a matter for federal goon squads to crack skulls .
People often claim that the government used 9/11 as an excuse to do what they wanted to do in any case , which was to trample on the Constitution 's protections against violations of our personal liberty .
Not only is that true ; the government is now using even the smallest and most petty excuses to do the same .
But you might say : at what cost ?
What is the big deal as to whether the FDA and the FBI are involved in the great spinach case or not ?
Surely the only result will be that merchants will become more careful about guarding the health of consumers .
Actually , I do n't think that is a foregone conclusion .
Many more people die per day on government highways than became sick in this spinach scare , and I see no hysteria to prosecute road builders or bureaucrats at the Transportation Department .
Far from protecting people , the government has a special skill associated with perpetually endangering people such as American soldiers in hostile foreign lands , not to speak of civilians .
It is not at all obvious that government has the interests of our health at heart when it regulates and controls us .
There is also an ideological cost here .
Whenever government demonizes merchants , it encourages the view that we must be forever on the lookout for dishonest business people who are seeking to make us sick , and from whom only the great civil servants in government can protect us .
These sorts of investigations actually encourage the view that free enterprise is a source of danger and a health hazard rather than our source of service and health enhancement .
After all , a century ago , people would have found it to be nothing short of a miracle that greens could survive a cross-country trek and land on your dining table in pretty much the same state as when they were picked .
There is also a cost to freedom itself .
We are being conditioned to believe that for every problem , there is a government answer , and nothing lies outside its purview and expertise .
Even mild cases of food poisoning merit a nation - wide investigation and crackdown on bad guys , who , we are encouraged to believe , are always in the private sector and never in the public sector .
Well , when it comes to the choice between a totalitarian state and the possibility of some rotten spinach , I 'll take the latter .
Inca Leapt Canyons With Fiber Bridges
MIT Students Plan to Stretch 60 - Foot - Long Fiber Bridge Between Campus Buildings
Conquistadors from Spain came , they saw , and they were astonished .
They had never seen anything in Europe like the bridges of Peru .
Chroniclers wrote that the Spanish soldiers stood in awe and fear before the spans of braided fiber cables suspended across deep gorges in the Andes , narrow walkways sagging and swaying and looking so frail .
Yet the suspension bridges were familiar and vital links in the vast empire of the Inca , as they had been to Andean cultures for hundreds of years before the arrival of the Spanish in 1532 .
The people had not developed the stone arch or wheeled vehicles , but they were accomplished in the use of natural fibers for textiles , boats , sling weapons — even keeping inventories by a prewriting system of knots .
So bridges made of fiber ropes , some as thick as a man 's torso , were the technological solution to the problem of road building in rugged terrain .
By some estimates , at least 200 such suspension bridges spanned river gorges in the 16th century .
One of the last of these , over the Apurimac River , inspired Thornton Wilder 's novel " The Bridge of San Luis Rey . "
Although scholars have studied the Inca road system 's importance in forging and controlling the pre-Columbian empire , John A. Ochsendorf of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology here said , " Historians and archaeologists have neglected the role of bridges . "
Ochsendorf 's research on Inca suspension bridges , begun while he was an undergraduate at Cornell University , illustrates an engineering university 's approach to archaeology , combining materials science and experimentation with the traditional fieldwork of observing and dating artifacts .
Other universities conduct research in archaeological materials , but it has long been a specialty at MIT .
Students here are introduced to the multidisciplinary investigation of ancient technologies as applied in transforming resources into cultural hallmarks from household pottery to grand pyramids .
In a course called " materials in human experience , " students are making a 60 - foot - long fiber bridge in the Peruvian style .
On Saturday , they plan to stretch the bridge across a dry basin between two campus buildings .
In recent years , MIT archaeologists and scientists have joined forces in studies of early Peruvian ceramics , balsa rafts , and metal alloys ; Egyptian glass and Roman concrete ; and also the casting of bronze bells in Mexico .
They discovered that Ecuadoreans , traveling by sea , introduced metallurgy to western Mexico .
They even found how Mexicans added bits of morning - glory plants , which contain sulfur , in processing natural rubber into bouncing balls .
" Mexicans discovered vulcanization 3,500 years before Goodyear , " said Dorothy Hosler , an MIT professor of archaeology and ancient technology .
" The Spanish had never seen anything that bounced like the rubber balls of Mexico . "
Heather Lechtman , an archaeologist of ancient technology who helped develop the MIT program , said that in learning " how objects were made , what they were made of and how they were used , we see people making decisions at various stages , and the choices involve engineering as well as culture . "
From this perspective , she said , the choices are not always based only on what works well , but also are guided by ideological and aesthetic criteria .
In the casting of early Mexican bells , attention was given to their ringing tone and their color ; an unusually large amount of arsenic was added to copper to make the bronze shine like silver .
" If people use materials in different ways in different societies , that tells you something about those people , " Lechtman said .
In the case of the Peruvian bridges , the builders relied on a technology well suited to the problem and their resources .
The Spanish themselves demonstrated how appropriate the Peruvian technique was .
Ochsendorf , a specialist in early architecture and engineering , said the colonial government tried many times to erect European arch bridges across the canyons , and each attempt ended in fiasco until iron and steel were applied to bridge building .
The Peruvians , knowing nothing of the arch or iron metallurgy , instead relied on what they knew best , fibers from cotton , grasses , and saplings , and llama and alpaca wool .
The Inca suspension bridges achieved clear spans of at least 150 feet , probably much greater .
This was a longer span than any European masonry bridges at the time .
The longest Roman bridge in Spain had a maximum span between supports of 95 feet .
And none of these European bridges had to stretch across deep canyons .
The Peruvians apparently invented their fiber bridges independently of outside influences , Ochsendorf said , but these bridges were neither the first of their kind in the world nor the inspiration for the modern suspension bridge like the George Washington and Verrazano - Narrows Bridges in New York and the Golden Gate in San Francisco .
In a recent research paper , Ochsendorf wrote : " The Inca were the only ancient American civilization to develop suspension bridges .
Similar bridges existed in other mountainous regions of the world , most notably in the Himalayas and in ancient China , where iron chain suspension bridges existed in the 3rd century B.C. "
The first of the modern versions was erected in Britain in the late 18th century , the beginning of the Industrial Revolution .
The longest one today connects two islands in Japan , with a span of more than 6,000 feet from tower to supporting tower .
These bridges are really " hanging roadways , " Ochsendorf said , to provide a fairly level surface for wheeled traffic .
In his authoritative 1984 book , " The Inka Road System , " John Hyslop , who was an official of the Institute of Andean Research and associated with the American Museum of Natural History , compiled descriptions of the Inca bridges recorded by early travelers .
Garcilasco de la Vega , in 1604 , reported on the cable - making techniques .
The fibers , he wrote , were braided into ropes of the length necessary for the bridge .
Three of these ropes were woven together to make a larger rope , and three of them were again braided to make a still larger rope , and so on .
The thick cables were pulled across the river with small ropes and attached to stone abutments on each side .
If you are planning a trip overseas , whether for business or pleasure then you will probably need a visa especially if you intend to stay for an extended period .
Sometime in the past when you required a visa , you had to visit the consulate or the embassy .
That visit would need weeks of applying , planning , and a lot of documentation .
You did all this , and there was no guarantee that you would get the visa .
But in recent times more countries are adopting electronic visas .
There more than twenty four countries that use electronic visa travel authorization to give access their country , Australia have visa waiver program for some countries .
Can Operating Systems tell if they 're running in a Virtual Machine ?
Saturday , October 28 , 2006
Or , do androids know they 're dreaming of electric sheep ...
There was some recent news on Windows Vista EULA restrictions relating to Virtual Machines .
Vista Home Editions are n't allowed to be run inside a Virtual Machine , and Vista Ultimate in a VM will restrict access to applications which use DRM .
We 're still waiting for clarification from Microsoft , but it seems like the popular interpretations are basically right .
This raises the question - is this a EULA restriction , or is it going to be enforced .
Can it be enforced ?
Can an operating system tell if it 's running in a Virtual Machine ?
That 's really two questions :
Can Operating Systems currently detect if they 're running in a VM ?
Will Operating Systems always be able to detect if they 're running in a VM ?
Well , I only know what I read .
Let me know if you disagree ...
Can Operating Systems currently detect if they 're running in a VM ?
Yes , they can .
Right now they do it through a couple of techniques - direct hardware fingerprinting and inferred hardware fingerprinting .
Direct hardware fingerprinting is pretty straightforward .
Virtual Machines have predictable hardware profiles , so you can just query for " virtual hardware " that 's only available in VM's and can't easily be changed .
The Virtual PC Guy describes this approach here :
The easiest way to detect that you are inside of a virtual machine is by using ' hardware fingerprinting ' - where you look for hardware that is always present inside of a given virtual machine .
In the case of Microsoft virtual machines - a clear indicator is if the motherboard is made by Microsoft ...
[ WMI Script to check the motherboard vendor ]
If the motherboard is made by " Microsoft Corporation " then you are inside of one of our virtual machines .
The inferred hardware fingerprinting approach is a bit more dodgy .
It works by making direct machine level calls to the virtualized CPU that will reveal if the CPU is real or virtual .
Some of these call instructions that the VMM 's do n't currently support .
Others make system calls that will only succeed on specific virtual hardware , usually because of special machine calls the VM 's implement to allow communication with the host OS and optimize use of host OS resources ( e.g. the Virtual Machine Additions for Virtual PC / Virtual Server , or VMWare 's VMware Command Line Tools ) .
This kind of stuff is pretty slick , but it makes " undocumented system calls " look boring .
Here are some examples of indirect hardware fingerprinting :
A program on CodeProject that can detect if it is running in either VPC or VMWare .
More information on detecting the VMWare host through the presence of special IO ports implemented as system calls
The Red Pill approach , which exploits the fact that the interrupt descriptor table registor ( IDTR ) is relocated by VMM's .
It writes to the IDTR via an SIDT instruction , the reads from the ITDR .
If the values do n't match , the code is executing in a VM .
Of course , this approach is subject to the whims of each VMM release , and it may vary from host OS to host OS .
These two approaches remind me of the two ways to target CSS to different browsers - ask them nicely , or beat it out of them .
Will Operating Systems always be able to detect if they 're running in a VM ?
Of course , that 's not a question I can answer with certainty until I can get my hands on a flux capacitor and 1.21 gigawatts .
That wo n't keep me from speculating , though ...
Let 's step back a second and think about whether or not we want Operating Systems to know if they 're running in a virtual environment .
In the context of the recent Vista EULA flap , we might want to say no - the EULA restriction is stupid , and it's a good thing that they can't enforce it .
But let 's talk about The Blue Pill .
It 's a theoretical malware application of VM technology in which a rootkit consumes the host operating system and runs as a hypervisor ( a hardware virtual machine manager ) .
Once it 's done that , it can do whatever it wants without the operating system knowing it 's been compromised :
The idea behind Blue Pill is simple : your operating system swallows the Blue Pill and it awakes inside the Matrix controlled by the ultra thin Blue Pill hypervisor .
This all happens on - the - fly ( i.e. without restarting the system ) and there is no performance penalty and all the devices , like graphics card , are fully accessible to the operating system , which is now executing inside virtual machine .
This is all possible thanks to the latest virtualization technology from AMD called SVM / Pacifica . [ via invisiblethings.blogspot.com ]
It 's mesmerizing and scary at the same time , kind of like BooBah .
There 's some doubt as to whether it 's code or just talk at this point :
However , there is great doubt throughout computer security circles as to whether blue pill is real or a mere stunt , since details and a working sample of the source code have not been made available , contravening the industry wide standard of full disclosure .
[ via Wikipedia ]
Regardless , the concept has been validated .
Microsoft Research and a group from University of Michigan proposed SubVirt ( pdf ) , a VMM rootkit , in May 2006 .
Their paper is a fascinating schizophrenic game of cat and mouse : well , you could detect this by blah , but then we could zhoop , and even if you flurped we could just breeble .
The SubVirt rootkit does n't take advantage of hypervisor technology and requires a reboot , but on the other hand it seems to be more mature .
We built VMBRs ( Virtual Machine Based Rootkits ) based on two available virtual - machine monitors , including one for which source code was unavailable .
On today ’s x86 systems , VMBRs are capable of running a target OS with few visual differences or performance effects that would alert the user to the presence of a VMBR .
In fact , one of the authors accidentally used a machine which had been infected by our proof - of concept VMBR without realizing that he was using a compromised system !
[ Subvirt paper pdf ]
The point remains , though - we probably want our operating systems to know if they 're running on virtual machines .
It sounds like they should always be able to do that .
Anthony Liguori , and IBM software engineer who has worked on the Xen hypervisor for two years , says :
Hardware virtualization requires a technique know as " trap and emulation " .
The idea is that the hardware traps certain instructions and the VMM emulates those instructions in such a way as to make the software believe it is running in a virtual machine .
Software emulation implies that these instructions take much longer to complete when executed under a VMM then on normal hardware .
This fact is what can be used to detect the presence of a VMM . [ via virtualization .info ]
You may have noticed that I jumped from talking about software VMM's ( VMWare , VirtualPC ) to both software and hardware VM rootkits .
From what I 've read , it looks like this is going to be a cat and mouse game , but the VM rootkits will always need to deal with the timing issues that Anthony mentioned .
The SubVirt authors discussed this , too :
A VMBR adds CPU overhead to trap and emulate privileged instructions , as well as to run any malicious services .
These timing differences can be noticed by software running in the virtual machine by comparing the running time of benchmarks against wall - clock time .
A VMBR can make the detector ’s task more difficult by slowing down the time returned by the system clock , but the detector can overcome this by using a clock that can be read without interference from the VMBR ( e.g. , the user ’s wristwatch ) .
[ Subvirt paper pdf ]
Well , I hope we can do better than wristwatch checks .
I 'd hope that an OS could check the time of day once an hour and notice a 1 % drag due to VM hosting , or at least pick it up over the course of a full day .
Not great , but at least it'd be detectable .
There 's one more secret weapon against bad VMM's .
It 's probably the best defense , but you probably are n't going to like it .
I 'm talking about the TPM , the Trusted Platform Module .
Microsoft 's Next Generation Secure Computing Base Digital Rights Management ( DRM ) technology ( called Palladium back when Vista was Longhorn ) ran on the TPM .
Trusted computing works by using a hardware crypto chip which verifies hardware and software loaded by the hypervisor ( which runs above the hardware virtualization layer , which runs above the good old CPU's ... sheesh , this is getting complicated ... ) .
It 's as if an OS running on a Trusted Computing platform was using HTTPS ( SSL ) to talk to hardware and trusted software like DRM software , but with much stronger crypto .
That 's a good thing from the point of view of safeguarding against rootkits .
It 's bad news if you want to use software that works by virtualizing hardware ( such as virtual soundcards which record streaming music like TotalRecorder , or virtual DVD drives which let you read ISO images like Daemon Tools or Alcohol 120 ) .
It 's also bad news if you want full access to DRM protected content , since DRM processing protected by a TPM is quite a bit more robust than the flimsy DRM stuff they 're using today .
DRM 'd media running on a Trusted platform could be sent from disk to soundcard with the same kind of anti-tampering assurance you 'd expect when you connect to your bank 's website across the big , bad internet .
Hmm .
Well , we 've got a little while to think this through , since it 's mostly been removed from Vista and wo n't ship until future versions of Windows .
Researchers have known for decades that certain neurodegenerative diseases , such as mad cow disease or its human equivalent , Cruetzfeldt - Jakob disease , result from a kind of infectious protein called a prion .
Remarkably , in recent years researchers also have discovered non-pathogenic prions that play beneficial roles in biology , and prions even may act as essential elements in learning and memory .
But although prions have received a great deal of scrutiny , scientists still do n't understand many of the most fundamental mechanisms of how prions form , replicate and cross from one species to another .
Now , through studying non-toxic yeast prions , scientists at Whitehead Institute have discovered small but critical regions within prions that determine much of their behavior .
" These findings provide a new framework for us to begin exploring properties of prion biology that , up until now , have proven difficult to investigate , " says Whitehead Member and MIT Professor of Biology Susan Lindquist , senior author on the paper , which will appear in the May 9 online issue of Nature .
Proteins are the cell 's workhorses , and they need to fold into complex and precise shapes to do their jobs .
Prions are proteins that start out normally , but then at some point misfold - - rather like an origami swan that comes out looking and acting instead like a vulture .
But prions have another characteristic that enables them to wreak havoc .
They recruit other , properly folded proteins into misforming along with them , a process Lindquist calls a " conformational cascade . "
In many organisms , this conformational cascade creates long fibers called amyloids .
( The brains of animals that have died from prion infections are literally packed with amyloid clumps . )
In order to glean insights into the mechanics that enable amyloid formation , Peter Tessier , a postdoctoral scientist in Lindquist 's lab , used peptide arrays -- glass slides covered with thousands of tiny protein fragments .
Traditionally , these arrays are used for finding binding sites within well - behaved proteins .
Here , Tessier designed the arrays so that he could observe protein folding and amyloid formation in real time .
Tessier covered the array with peptides from baker 's yeast and then added prion protein to the array , also from the same yeast species .
He found that a small cluster of peptides recruited the prion proteins to misfold into an amyloid structure .
This region of the protein , which Tessier called a " recognition element , " constitutes about 10 percent of the prion .
Tessier repeated this experiment with peptides and a prion taken from pathogenic fungi .
The results were the same .

Both prions also maintained a rigid species barrier .
The baker 's yeast prion could not recruit peptides from the pathogenic fungi cells , and vice versa .
To further verify these results , Tessier accessed a synthetic yeast prion , one that another research group had assembled from pieces of both the baker 's yeast and the pathogenic fungi prion .
Earlier studies had shown that this synthetic prion could cross the species barrier but did not identify the mechanism .
Tessier found that this synthetic prion contained two recognition elements , one for baker 's yeast and one for pathogenic fungi .
When the prion was placed with peptide fragments from baker 's yeast , the baker 's yeast recognition element was activated , and likewise for the pathogenic fungi .
Even more striking , Tessier could activate different recognition elements by manipulating environmental conditions , such as temperature .
For example , when he conducted the experiment at 4 degrees Celsius , the baker 's yeast recognition element switched on .
At 37 degrees Celsius , the pathogenic fungi element was activated .
In other words , temperature alone could dictate which yeast species the prion could infect .
Additionally , the prion 's behavior could be altered by subtle alterations in the recognition element 's amino acid sequence .
While this prion is a laboratory construct not found in nature , these findings provide researchers with a new way to approach old questions , such as why some prion diseases can jump from one species to another but others can't .
Tessier and Lindquist say it is likely that natural prions contain more than one recognition element , and recognition elements can slide into a neighboring region .
Many external factors can determine which recognition element is activated , in turn influencing the downstream behavior of the prion .
" These findings are remarkable for two reasons , " says Lindquist , who is also an investigator for Howard Hughes Medical Institute .
" For one thing , this is the first time that these peptide arrays have been used to study protein folding .
We 've taken this platform to a whole new level .
Also , we 've seen just one small part of this prion inducing proteins to fold .
This is an entirely new concept . "
Earlier research from the Lindquist lab , published in Nature in 2005 , identified the amino acid regions where prions connect with one another to form amyloids .
Those interaction regions turn out to be the same regions Tessier identified as recognition elements -- further confirmation that these regions are key to prion activity .
Tessier and his colleagues plan to further investigate this process in mammalian prions , such as those responsible for mad cow and Cruetzfeldt - Jakob diseases , as well as in other non-prion proteins that can also form amyloid structures .
Biometric ID cards will include fingerprints , plus eye or facial scans
Immigration minister Liam Byrne told ITV1's
The Sunday Edition the proposals were being " looked at " .
Under existing plans every passport applicant over 16 will have details - including fingerprints - added to a National Identity register from 2008 .
But there was concern youngsters could use passports without biometric details up to the age of 20 , said Mr Byrne .
This could happen if they are issued a child passport between the ages of 11 and 15 , which would be valid for five years .
Both the Conservative and Liberal Democrat parties called the idea " sinister " .
Ministers should not be surprised if public resistance becomes ever more vocal
Nick Clegg , Liberal Democrats
Officials at the Identity and Passport Service ( IPS ) had proposed the fingerprint database , said Mr Byrne .
But he added that no final decision had yet been made on whether to go ahead with the idea .
" The challenge that officials have been asked to find an answer to , is how do you make sure that people who are 16 and over have got biometric details recorded in their passports ? " he told the programme .
' Arrogance '
Shadow home secretary David Davis said the proposal " borders on the sinister " and added it showed the government was trying to end the presumption of innocence .
" This government is clearly determined to enforce major changes in the relationship between the citizen and the state in a way never seen before . "
" The determination to build a surveillance state behind the backs of the British people is becoming increasingly sinister , " said Liberal Democrat home affairs spokesman Nick Clegg said .
" It is a measure of ministerial arrogance that plans are being laid to fingerprint children as young as 11 without having a public debate first .
" As millions of British citizens discover that they will have to pay through the nose for the privilege of being included in a range of government databases , ministers should not be surprised if public resistance becomes ever more vocal . "
Parental consent
Last month the opposition parties expressed anger that all fingerprints collected for ID cards would be cross-checked against prints from 900,000 unsolved crimes .
And campaigners have long battled fingerprinting of children in schools , a practice they estimate happens in about 3,500 establishments .
From this month guidelines from privacy watchdog the Information Commissioner will urge schools to get parental consent before taking biometric data .
But under the Data Protection
Act schools do not have to seek parental consent , and calls to outlaw the controversial practice have been rejected by the government .
On Monday campaign group Leave Them Kids Alone will launch a list of 10 questions it recommends all parents ask of their child 's school , if biometric systems are being considered or introduced .
Campaigner David Clouter said they feared " normalising " the practice in schools would lessen resistance to pressure for the fingerprinting of younger and younger children .
" Whatever the reason , it is an infringement of a person 's civil liberties , " he said .

DIGG THIS
If you ’ve been around long enough , you ’ve lived through moments — there were a couple of striking ones in the Vietnam era — when all the collective , practical wisdom of pundits and policy makers about what is possible in this world seems to fall away and suddenly the previously inconceivable enters the mainstream .
The next thing you know , it ’s a commonplace and everybody is proudly ready to take credit for making it so .
That was the case when it came to the issue of the impeachment of Richard Nixon back in 1973 .
Will it , in the near future , be true again when it comes to George W. Bush ( and Dick Cheney ) ?
In the last years , impeachment has been the all - American solution that could not speak its name in the vicinity of Washington DC or anywhere in the mainstream media , even as support for it grew among Americans generally .
But we may be at the edge of a new moment , judging by the ever - unfolding Mark Foley affair , the ensuing turmoil in the Republican Party , the muffling of the presidential voice , the latest polls , and even a threatened reversal in oil prices .
So it seems the perfect moment at Tomdispatch for David Swanson , who last wrote about “ trophy photos ” in Iraq , but has put his prodigious energies into the issue of impeachment , to take up the subject .

Impeachment Anyone ? : The Case for Taking the Tape Off Our Mouths
By David Swanson
This piece is based on seven new books on impeachment , all briefly discussed in a final note .
Never before has the system of government established by the U.S. Constitution been as seriously threatened ; never before has the built - in remedy for the sort of threat we face been as badly needed ; never before have we had as good an opportunity to use that remedy exactly as it was intended .
Congress has never impeached a President and removed him from office .
Once , with Richard M. Nixon , impeachment proceedings forced a resignation .
Twice , with Andrew Johnson and Bill Clinton , impeachment proceedings led to acquittals .
On a few other occasions , Congressional efforts to advance articles of impeachment have had legal and political results .
These have always benefited the political party that advanced impeachment .
This was even true in the case of the Republicans ’ unpopular impeachment of Clinton , during which the Republicans lost far fewer seats than the norm for a majority party at that point in its tenure .
Two years later , they lost seats in the Senate , which had acquitted , but maintained their strength in the House , with representatives who had led the impeachment charge winning big .
( This point — little noted but important indeed — was made to me recently by John Nichols , author of the forthcoming book , The Genius of Impeachment . )
In every past case , impeachment efforts were driven by members of Congress or other Washington political players , sometimes with support from the media .
The public got behind Nixon ’s impeachment , but only after the proceedings had revealed massive presidential crimes .
The public never got behind Clinton ’s impeachment , despite saturation news coverage and widespread support among political power players .
In the case of George W. Bush ’s impeachment , with the media and both parties in Congress opposed to it , public support is just about all there is — so far .
In past cases , impeachment has either focused on trivial offenses or on crimes that were serious but not tied to the administration ’s major foreign policy decisions or to policies in which Congress was complicit .
Clinton was impeached for lying under oath about his sex life — clearly a crime but not bribery , treason , or a “ high crime or misdemeanor ” ( an old British phrase meaning an abuse of the political system by a high office holder ) , and so not actually an impeachable offense .
Nixon was nearly impeached for obstruction of justice , warrantless spying , refusing to produce information subpoenaed by Congress , lying to the public , and other abuses of power , but not for his secret and illegal bombing of Cambodia .
For all the reasons Nixon was nearly impeached , George W. Bush could be impeached too .
He has openly engaged in illegal , unconstitutional , warrantless spying , and — while Congress has not yet used subpoenas —
Bush has obstructed its investigations , refused to comply with Freedom of Information Act requests , and broken a variety of laws in the course of exacting retribution against whistleblowers , producing false reports , and establishing a regime of secrecy of a sort that Nixon could only dream about .
Bush has lied to the public about the warrantless spying program at the National Security Agency ( NSA ) , the war in Iraq , the kinds of warnings he was given before hurricane Katrina arrived , and numerous other issues .
While Nixon made secret audio tapes in the White House which , when discovered , doubled as evidence , this time there is video — of Bush being warned prior to Katrina and claiming he was not warned , of Bush assuring us he was not engaged in warrantless spying and brazenly asserting that he will continue to spy without warrants , of Bush warning us about Iraq ’s weapons of mass destruction as well as Saddam ’s supposed ties to the 9/11 attacks and of Bush claiming he did no such thing , of Bush claiming the U.S. does not condone torture and of the torture victims .
Bush ’s administration has even bribed journalists and manufactured phony news stories at home as well as in Iraq in order to deceive the public .
Congressman John Conyers has introduced bills to censure both the President and Vice President Cheney for their refusal to turn over information , while Senator Russ Feingold has introduced a bill to censure Bush for his illegal spying programs .
But charging Bush with such Nixonian offenses would only scrape the surface of the criminal record that is motivating the popular movement for impeachment — and impeachment was always meant to be a popular movement .
The drafters of the Constitution placed impeachment in the hands of the House of Representatives because they considered that body — with its members facing reelection every two years — closest to the people .
In theory , a democratic system with impeachment at its heart creates an obvious conflict in the wake of any ( honest and credible ) presidential election .
How could the people ’s representatives impeach , and ask the Senate to consider removing from office , a president whom the people have just elected ?
In practice at present , quite a different conflict takes center stage : How can a Congress complicit in many of this President ’s criminal acts be asked to impeach him ?
Perhaps by focusing on crimes Congress was not complicit in , by allowing Congressional representatives to plead ignorance or remorse , and by electing new representatives better tuned to the present will of the people .
And how do we get the media to cover investigations of crimes the media too have been complicit in ?
Same answer ( minus , of course , the elections ) .
Let ’s begin by considering the case for impeaching and removing from office George W. Bush and Dick Cheney .
Quite a few organizations and individuals have , in fact , already drafted articles of impeachment .
Though no two lists are the same , there is a great deal of overlap .
There are some crimes that appear on almost every list and that seem to be driving the public demand for accountability .
Many of the best lists are in recently published and forthcoming books .
( See note at end of article . )
Impeachment for What ?
Every list of impeachable offenses includes tangential references to other impeachable offenses .
The list seems inexhaustible , but here ’s a quick run-down of the main possible charges :
The illegal war in Iraq is at or near the top of everyone ’s list .
Sometimes , the emphasis is on the illegality of an aggressive war ; sometimes , on the fraud used to sell the war to Congress and the public ; sometimes , on the absence of a proper Congressional declaration of war .
Lying to Congress is a felony .
Lying to the public is an impeachable offense — and one brought against Nixon .
Initiating an aggressive war is the highest crime under treaties that are part of international and U.S. law .
Launching a war without proper Congressional approval is a violation of the War Powers Act of 1973 .
Misusing government funds to launch a war is a separate crime , committed by Bush when he ordered troops moved to Iraq and began bombing raids prior to Congress ’s dubious authorization to use force .
On some lists are the various war crimes that have accompanied the war , including the targeting of civilians , journalists , hospitals , and ambulances , the use of antipersonnel weapons in densely settled urban areas , and the use of illegal weapons , including white phosphorous , depleted uranium , and a new version of napalm used in Mark 77 firebombs .
High on most lists are also unlawful detentions and torture .
The arbitrary detention of Americans , of legal residents , and of non-Americans without due process , without charge , and without access to counsel is illegal under U.S. and international law , and unconstitutional as well .
In case anyone doubted this fact , the Supreme Court recently ruled on it .
The highest body in our judicial branch of government has essentially declared Bush a criminal , and yet Congress recently acted , through the Military Commissions
Act of 2006 , to provide the President with retroactive immunity for some of his acts in these areas .
Bush has authorized the torture of thousands of captives , resulting in some cases in death , and sought to evade responsibility by redefining acts commonly considered torture out of the category of torture .
He has agreed to let suspects be kidnapped off the streets of cities in other countries , allowed prisoners to be hidden from the International Committee of the Red Cross , shipped people under U.S. control to third nations or a network of secret U.S. prisons to be tortured .
The Constitution , international treaties that are part of U.S. law , and other U.S. laws ban torture .
When , in the McCain Amendment to a Department of Defense bill last January , Congress redundantly re-banned torture , the President signed the bill but added a signing statement explaining that he would not obey it .
On every impeachment list as well is the illegal National Security Agency spying to which Bush has publicly ( and proudly ) confessed , and which a federal court has ruled criminal .
Yet , to this day , it goes on unchecked .
Bush lied to the public and Congress about his illegal spying programs for years .
Congress has passed bills cutting off funding for the programs , but Bush countermanded these with signing statements .
The spying , done without recourse to the secret FISA court set up in 1978 for exactly this purpose , is also in blatant violation of the FISA Act of 1978 , of the Fourth Amendment , and — according to Congressman John Conyers ’ report , George W. Bush versus the U.S. Constitution — of the Stored Communications Act of 1986 and the Communications Act of 1934 .
Congressman Conyers also cites Bush for violating the National Security Act and for failing to keep all members of the House and Senate Intelligence Committees “ fully and currently informed ” of intelligence activities , such as the warrantless surveillance programs .
On nearly every list of impeachable offenses is the President ’s failure to protect New Orleans from Hurricane Katrina .
Over a period of years , the administration undermined the city ’s protection .
In the days prior to the storm ’s arrival , Bush was warned about just what might happen .
Yet prior to the storm — and for days after it hit — he did nothing ; the unqualified cronies he had put in charge of the Federal Emergency Management Agency did nothing ; and the National Guard members from Louisiana , Mississippi and other states of the southeast whom he had dispatched to Iraq could not be called upon to help .
Thousands of Americans died preventable deaths and a city was ruined , not so much by a storm as by the non-response to it .
Even now , people who lost their homes in the Katrina debacle are being told there are no funds available to help them .
The Constitution requires that the President “ take care that the laws be faithfully executed . ” Former Congresswoman and Judiciary Committee Member Elizabeth Holtzman in her new book , The Impeachment of George W. Bush , argues that Bush ’s neglect of New Orleans ( and other presidential duties ) violated this responsibility and so constitute high crimes and misdemeanors .
Holtzman puts into this category as well the administration ’s failure to provide U.S. troops in Iraq with proper body armor , and the failure of the President and his top officials to plan for the occupation of Iraq .
In their book , The Case for Impeachment , Dave Lindorff and Barbara Olshansky make a similar argument about Bush ’s failure to attempt to prevent the attacks of September 11 , 2001 and his obstruction of investigations into those crimes ( as do Dennis Loo and Peter Phillips in their book Impeach the President ) .
The same two books , along with the Bush Crimes Commission in its “ verdict , ” also suggest that , by denying the existence of , enacting policies that increase , and failing to work to decrease global warming , Bush has committed perhaps the most serious offense possible — in the words of Loo and Phillips , “ placing oil - industry profits over the long - term survival of the human race and the viability of the planet . ”
The Bush Crimes Commission finds the President ’s imposition of abstinence - only policies on countries being ravaged by AIDS to be a serious crime against humanity .
Loo and Phillips charge Bush with “ violating the constitutional principle of separation of church and state through the interlinking of theocratic ideologies in the decision - making process of the U.S. government . ”
Three of the recent books on impeachment include as an impeachable offense Bush ’s use of signing statements to announce his refusal to obey hundreds of laws passed by Congress .
The American Bar Association has found the practice unconstitutional .
It is , in fact , an open threat to the rule of law .
An official censure by Congress would do nothing to compel the President to obey laws he chooses not to obey .
Impeachment would do nothing .
Only impeachment followed by removal from office will cure this cancer on the American political system .
The current situation is exactly what the authors of the Constitution had in mind when they made impeachment and removal from office the means of protection against tyranny .
Holtzman includes in her roster of impeachable offenses the selective and misleading leaking of classified information , especially on supposed Iraqi weapons of mass destruction ( which Bush himself was directly involved in ) to advance a dishonest case for war .
Lindorff and Olshansky also include the leaking of CIA agent Valerie Plame ’s identity .
Conyers cites violations of the following related laws : 1 ) Federal requirements concerning the leaking and misuse of intelligence , including failing to enforce an executive order that requires the disciplining of those who leak classified information , whether intentionally or not ;
2 ) Federal laws forbidding retaliation against whistle - blowers of various sorts , an example being the demotion of Bunnatine Greenhouse , the chief contracting officer at the Army Corps of Engineers , who exposed secret , no - bid contracts awarded to Kellogg , Brown & Root , a subsidiary of Halliburton ; 3 ) Federal regulations and ethical requirements governing conflicts of interest , including the briefing of then - Attorney General John Ashcroft on an FBI investigation of possible misconduct by Karl Rove , even though Mr. Rove had previously received nearly $ 750,000 in fees for political work on Mr. Ashcroft ’s campaigns .
Loo and Phillips — rightly I think — bring up a number of offenses not found on most lists , including :
“ Usurping the American people ’s right to know the truth about governmental actions through the systematic use of propaganda and disinformation ” ;
“ Overthrowing Haiti ’s democratically elected president , Jean - Bertrand Aristide , and installing a highly repressive regime ” in his place ;
Hiding government decisions from public and congressional view “ by a willful subversion of the Freedom of Information Act . ”
I would add one item not yet found on anybody ’s list : the passage by Congress of the Military Commissions
Act of 2006 that retroactively and unconstitutionally legalizes various Bush administration acts involving torture and illegal detention , and the passage of other bills doing the same on a number of the crimes listed above .
Impeachment is not a criminal process .
Legalizing impeachable offenses does not make them less impeachable .
But proposing and lobbying to legalize illegal impeachable offenses are themselves additional impeachable offenses .
What Would It Take for Impeachment to Happen ?
Believe it or not , the impeachment of George W. Bush and Dick Cheney is perfectly possible , although a number of factors will have to come together for it to happen .
The public will is already there , and this is quite remarkable given the lack of action in Congress or mention in the mainstream media .
The polling that has been done on impeachment is dramatic .
The Washington Post finds that a third of the country wants Bush not just impeached but also removed from office .
Zogby finds that , by a margin of 53 % to 42 % , Americans want Congress to impeach President Bush if he lied about the war in Iraq .
When Americans were asked , “ What 2 or 3 specific changes would have to take place in order to improve your trust in government today ? ” the winner by far was “ personnel changes / impeachment proceedings . ”
When Pennsylvanians were asked whether they would be likely to vote for a congressional candidate who “ supports having impeachment proceedings against President Bush , ” 84.9 % of Democrats said yes , while 7.0 % said no .
Among Independents , 49.3 % said yes , while 40.6 % said no .
The Republican National Committee got spooked this past summer and felt obliged to announce that impeachment would be good for Republicans in the coming elections .
This claim is made without a shred of evidence , either in history or in present polling .
Nothing excites non-Republicans today like impeachment , and “ Vote for us or we ’ll go to jail ” is a lousy slogan .
The Democratic base is aching for Democrats in Congress to get some spine and stand up to the criminals who are throwing away one of the most brilliant creations of the eighteenth century : our Constitution .
Instead , Leader Nancy Pelosi has ordered Democrats in Congress to stay away from impeachment — though she did say that they would hold hearings and see where they went … if the Democrats win a majority in the House of Representatives .
To voters who are paying attention , the “ let ’s hold investigations and see where they go ” approach looks disingenuous , given how many impeachable offenses are already public knowledge .
I ’ve heard reports from dozens of Congressional representatives , in both parties , who refused to sign onto Conyers ’ bill for an investigation , and not once has anyone argued that there is too little evidence .
The argument always focuses on the “ extreme ” nature of impeachment or the political agenda behind impeachment .
As a result , the Democrats are , for the most part , steering clear even of talk of future investigations .
Quietly , however , Democrats do acknowledge that impeachment is coming .
Following the triumphal 1972 election of Richard Nixon , had you raised the topic of impeachment , Democrats in Washington would have dismissed it as impossible .
Today , on the other hand , they dismiss it as unacceptable — at least pre-election .
When former director of the NSA , Lt. Gen. William Odom , suggested impeaching Bush last week at a forum on Iraq organized by progressive Democratic Congress members , the ensuing silence and shuffling in seats suggested a strong desire by our representatives to dive under the table .
They resisted that urge and changed the subject .
They did not , however , argue against impeachment .
A lot of activists imagine that there is a conflict between working on impeachment and working on the upcoming elections .
They fail to see raising impeachment as one way to win those elections .
I would argue that holding a large rally for impeachment , as we did in Charlotte , North Carolina last Saturday , does more to help defeat Republicans than does funding the campaigns of any number of milquetoast Democrats who will use the money to run uninspiring ads that excite nobody .
If Democrats could stop worrying for a minute about energizing the Republican base and converting Republicans , they might be able to look at the potential impeachment has to excite and turn out their own base .
This is an off - year election .
It will be won by turnout — and by fighting suppression , fraud , and theft .
To the extent that the elections are about something as significant as impeachment , candidates and citizens will be more likely to fight for stolen votes .
If the Democratic incumbents all stood for impeachment now , the Democrats would win a majority in a landslide .
In fact , they might even persuade the necessary fifteen Republicans to join them and impeach Bush and Cheney pre-election .
Rep. Ron Paul has spoken up for impeachment .
Only fourteen more are needed , and there is no law that says Republicans ca n’t put their country ahead of George W. Bush .
That fact will become increasingly important if the Democrats do not win a majority or do not fight when their elections are stolen .
For now , impeachment advocates find themselves in the situation of trying to push the Democrats to talk about impeachment for their own good .
After the election , come what may , citizen activists will find themselves with time on their hands for at least a few months until the next election cycle begins .
During this window , leading into the next Congress , the American public will either force impeachment on Washington or allow the slide toward fascism to continue .
This moment in our history presents an opportunity for the first time for a popular presidential impeachment , an impeachment imposed on the government by the people .
Impeachment and removal , followed later by indictment and conviction , will be a long struggle .
( It will , sadly , slow Congress down for a while in its work of destroying the world . )
But it is needed to restore the U.S. Constitution as well as international law , and to establish a standard of accountability for the launching of aggressive wars .
So , while the process may need to begin with crimes that Congress has been less complicit in , such as the use of signing statements , it must end with the offenses our world cannot well survive if they are repeated .
The first subpoena sent to the White House will be refused , of course , and the conflict will develop from that point .
Democrats and any Republicans of conscience should be prepared for that and have a plan that will see us through to George Bush ’s removal from office for the highest of high crimes and misdemeanors .
Note on Bush and Books : The New Impeachment Literature
The fact that a sizeable collection of books exists on the subject of impeaching George W. Bush is a phenomenon worthy of comment in itself .
Some of the offenses committed by Bush and Cheney have been reported first — and sometimes only — in books as was the case with James Risen ’s State of War : The Secret History of the C.I.A. and the Bush Administration and Philippe Sands ’ Lawless World : America and the Making and Breaking of Global Rules .
The books that follow , all exploring where U.S. citizens must take that evidence , constitute a field of reporting that has yet to make an appearance in a major American newspaper or on a major American television network .
Books ( and the internet ) are now the first draft of history as well as the last , since the other news media have abandoned the field .
Yet the analysis in these books is not only largely in agreement but readily comprehensible by anyone with an elementary school education , no less a reporter , and there is no reason to imagine that the views expressed could not be effectively expressed on television or in a newspaper .
The Best of Tom Engelhardt
Warsaw , Poland ( AFP ) - Poland 's deputy education minister called for the influential evolutionary theories of Charles Darwin not to be taught in the country 's schools , branding them ' lies . '
' The theory of evolution is a lie , an error that we have legalised as a common truth , ' Miroslaw Orzechowski , the deputy minister in the country 's right - wing coalition government , was quoted as saying by the Gazeta Wyborcza daily Saturday .
Orzechowski said the theory was ' a feeble idea of an aged non-believer , ' who had come up with it ' perhaps because he was a vegetarian and lacked fire inside him . '
The evolution theory of the 19th - century British naturalist holds that existing animals and plants are the result of natural selection which eliminated inferior species gradually over time .
This conflicts with the ' creationist ' theory that God created all life on the planet in a finite number .

« Social Security Reform Thursday : Week Sixty - Nine -- Taxes On Benefits .
| WILLisms.com | Trivia Tidbit Of The Day : Part 406 -- Looking For The Increasingly Rare Union Label . » Trivia Tidbit Of The Day : Part 405 -- Energy Alternatives .
Policies Have Consequences - Popular Mechanics has some facts on ethanol versus regular gasoline : A gallon of E85 has an energy content of about 80,000 BTU , compared to gasoline 's 124,800 BTU .
So about 1.56 gal. of E85 takes you as far as 1 gal. of gas .
So , ethanol gives you poorer gas mileage .
Awesome .
I noticed this phenomenon firsthand while traveling extensively by vehicle in the Midwest throughout 2006 .
And it takes more energy to produce ethanol than gasoline .
And is more expensive : Corn farmers have done a good job of disguising the fact that it still takes more than a gallon of fossil fuel - - 29 % more is the best estimate -- to make a gallon of ethanol .
In addition , various mandates requiring the use of ethanol significantly increased gasoline prices last summer and led to spot shortages because ethanol can't be carried through pipelines and requires special blending plants .
James Glassman , an economist with J.P. Morgan Chase , notes that expensive ethanol was a big factor in the sticker shock consumers encountered at the pump this summer .
" We 'd probably have retail gasoline prices between $ 2.30 and $ 2.40 a gallon if not for ethanol , " he told The Wall Street Journal last June , when pump prices were topping $ 3 a gallon .
So , could ethanol replace petroleum - based gasoline entirely ?
Nope , not really :
One acre of corn can produce 300 gal. of ethanol per growing season .
So , in order to replace that 200 billion gal . of petroleum products , American farmers would need to dedicate 675 million acres , or 71 percent of the nation 's 938 million acres of farmland , to growing feedstock .
Clearly , ethanol alone wo n't kick our fossil fuel dependence -- unless we want to replace our oil imports with food imports .
That 's a lot of acres .
Too many acres , really , to allow for " energy independence " or the elimination of foreign oil , without disastrous Mao-esque externalities .
Visiting with staffers from various ( typically unsuccessful ) Senate , House , and Gubernatorial campaigns throughout the Midwest in 2006 , I heard a similar refrain again and again : " Minnesota is the next Saudi Arabia . "
" Iowa is like Saudi Arabia for corn . "
" Missouri will be the Saudi Arabia of ethanol . "
" Wisconsin is like Saudi Arabia for alternative fuels . "
" Illinois has as much energy as Saudi Arabia , but in corn and soy rather than oil . "
And so on .
When I would hear this line , everywhere I went , I admit now to bursting out laughing spontaneously , and sometimes the laughing may have been taken as rudeness .
Sometimes a dose of startling reality can come off as rudeness , though , when it shatters evangelical levels of false idol worship ( corn / ethanol being the idol ) .
Credit for the idol analogy goes to Jerry Taylor of the Cato Institute : " Right now ethanol is the closest thing to a state religion in this country , " said Jerry Taylor , a senior fellow at the Cato Institute in Washington .
" It 's a bipartisan conviction . "
But Taylor estimated that federal and state alternative fuel tax subsidies are in the $ 6 billion to $ 7 billion a year range - about $ 1 for each gallon of ethanol produced .
" Most people think the ethanol program reduces fuel prices ; it doesn't , " Taylor said .
When it comes to ethanol , what on earth is the point ?
It costs more , powers less , and does n't eliminate foreign sources of energy .
Popular Mechanics also has a highly engaging graphic on the differences between and among various energy sources ( .pdf ) , for a trip from New York to California .
Here are just two of them :
It would be interesting to determine the true costs of ethanol subsidies , including what this means for consumer food prices , including the corrosive toll on vehicle innards , including how many billions of dollars in ethanol handouts could have been used to reduce tax rates , and so on .
What I do know -- anecdotally - speaking -- is that it cost me more to fill up in the Midwest than in Texas in 2006 , and I had to fill up more often , because of all of the ethanol added to Midwest gas .
UPDATE ( Jan. 26 , 2006 ) -- Busting up some myths on ethanol .
Myth : Ethanol reduces air pollution .
A review of the literature by Australian academic Robert Niven found that , when evaporative emissions are taken into account , E10 ( fuel that 's 10 percent ethanol and 90 percent gasoline , the standard mix ) increases emissions of total hydrocarbons , nonmethane organic compounds , and air toxics compared to conventional gasoline .
The result is greater concentrations of photochemical smog and toxic compounds .
Myth : Ethanol reduces greenhouse gas emissions .
At best , E10 reduces greenhouse gas emissions by from zero to 5 percent ; pure ethanol by 12 percent .
The International Energy Agency , however , estimates that it costs about $ 250 to reduce a ton of greenhouse gases this way , or more than 10 times what Yale economist William Nordhaus thinks is economically sensible given the economics of climate change .
Ethanol as an anti-warming policy is what academics refer to as " crazy talk . "
Simply astounding , this ethanol snake oil craze .

Posted by Will Franklin · 25 January 2007 03:47 PM
What people do n't understand is that crops are simply natural solar power plants of rotten efficiency .
An average solar cell converts maybe 15 % of the sunlight directly to usable energy .
A really good one can get to 30 % .
A leaf converts , at best 3 to 6 % of the sunlight to plant mass .
Of course not all of this plant mass is the corn used to make ethanol , so that efficiency number is much lower .
At least by half ( 2 to 3 % ) .
And there is the oil sued up to make corn .
And inefficencies in the conversion of corn to ethonol ( not all the corn is converted ) .
But let 's just be optimistic and say 2 % .
Someday someone will wake up and realize that ripping out corn fields and replacing them with solar panels would be , at a minimum , 5 times more efficient .
Probably more like 20 times more efficient , i.e. energy generated per acre of farmland .
would be 5 to 20 times higher by placing solar collectors rather than growing corn .
And solar energy is becoming steadily cheaper and more efficient over time .
For example , quantum dot solar cells show the promise of converting infrared energy directly into electricity as well .
Cost per Kwh is decreasing by about 10 % per year , as has been for a long time .
Increasing corn 's ability to convert sunlight to usable energy is probably never going to catch up
This is why I love your blog - it makes me feel less crazy , at least for a couple of minutes each day .

Your reference to Jerry Taylor 's comment starts leading us to the source of the fascination with Ethanol .
This is a political movement driven by our US Congress and endorsed by the MSM and therefore gobbled up by a sizable portion of the population .
And , of course , the Midwest is on - board because it could create an economic boom in that part of the country .
Congress will offer a political solution , not the best technical solution .
After all , we are not exactly dealing dealing with scientists and engineers , we are dealing with lawyers and professional politicians , trying to get re-elected .
Big D , I agree with you , solar power , wind power , wave power , and other forms of energy generation make more sense .
Mother Nature provides us with all the energy we need here on earth , we just have to learn to convert it .
I am not a fan of corn base fuel , tried some in the gas tank , the creamy style clogs the fuel injectors .

Why let logic and reason get in the way of a good political feeding frenzy ?
Posted by : Dan Patterson at January 28 , 2007 08:32 AM
There are so many reasons John McCain should not be President .
But an interaction with a reporter today on his Not - So - Straight Talk bus pretty much confirmed it .
McCain was stumped by a very simple question — a question that can be answered with a modicum of research .
He was stumped by a question that can mean the difference between life and death .
He was stumped by a question that every responsible adult in American should know the answer to .
He does n’t know if condoms can help stop the spread of HIV .
Seriously :
Q : “ What about grants for sex education in the United States ?
Should they include instructions about using contraceptives ?
Or should it be Bush ’s policy , which is just abstinence ? ” Mr. McCain : ( Long pause ) “ Ahhh .
I think I support the president ’s policy . ”
Q : “ So no contraception , no counseling on contraception .
Just abstinence .
Do you think contraceptives help stop the spread of HIV ? ” Mr. McCain : ( Long pause )
“ You ’ve stumped me . ” Q : “ I mean , I think you ’d probably agree it probably does help stop it ? ” Mr. McCain : ( Laughs )
“ Are we on the Straight Talk express ?
I ’m not informed enough on it .
Let me find out .
You know , I ’m sure I ’ve taken a position on it on the past .
I have to find out what my position was .
Brian , would you find out what my position is on contraception – I ’m sure I ’m opposed to government spending on it , I ’m sure I support the president ’s policies on it . ”
Q : “ But you would agree that condoms do stop the spread of sexually transmitted diseases .
Would you say : ‘ No , we ’re not going to distribute them , ’ knowing that ? ” Mr. McCain : ( Twelve - second pause )
“ Get me Coburn ’s thing , ask Weaver to get me Coburn ’s paper that he just gave me in the last couple of days .
I ’ve never gotten into these issues before . ”
Could John McCain be this much of an idiot ?
Could he be so stupid about basic health policy ?
Could he be so beholden to the theocrats that he would n’t answer such an obvious question ?
Whatever the answer , John McCain should n’t be President .

I 'd imagine that there 's a lot involved with bringing a new person into this world .
No , no -- I do n't mean that part , I mean the whole paperwork side of things .
There 's Social Security to set up , a .name domain to register , birth certificate , insurance -- especially insurance .
With all those people feigning pregnancy and labor just to get a stay at the hospital and a complimentary " It 's a Boy ! " balloon , insurers need to be extra certain that childbirth claim resulted in a real child .
As the recent father of twin babies , Philip B. was relieved to learn that his employer 's benefit provider , Sun Life Canada , made the insurance process really simple .
Adding the little ones on the plan required no more than a phone call to provide birth dates , names , and that sort of thing .
All seemed so easy , until the customer service rep realized what Philip was trying to do : " I 'm sorry sir , but we need a different birth date for each of your kids . "
" Uhh , er , " Philip stuttered , rather puzzled , " they 're twins ?
They were both born on the seventh of May , so they actually do have the same birth date . "
" Oh yes , I understand , " she said , " but our system cannot handle two people with the same last name born in the same month of the same year on the same plan . "
Philip 's jaw dropped .
He inquired some more with the CSR to try understand how such a technical limitation could occur .
It turns out that a new version of their software was installed that tracked each person 's budget based on their last name , plan number , and month / year of birth .
Hence , having two people born in the same month and year on one plan would cause all claims to be booked against one of the two 's budget , risking a premature budget exhaustion .
We can only hope that , by now , Sun Life has corrected their new insurance system to account for the unfathomable concept of twins .
But as of this day , for insurance purposes , Philip 's kids are born a month apart , one on April 7 and the other on May 7 .
That , apparently , is much more fathomable .
... from Haiti
McCain 1994
One of the reasons why people are convinced , why many of these experts are convinced , that this situation is one which is increasingly difficult to solve , is because of the fact that we were there once before .
The right course of action is to make preparations as quickly as possible to bring our people home .
It does not mean as soon as order is restored to Haiti , it does n't mean as soon as Democracy is flourishing in Haiti , it does n't mean as soon as we 've established a viable nation in Haiti , as soon as possible means as soon as we can get out of Haiti without losing any American lives .
Now there may be different interpretations of this Resolution on the other side but it is my view and I want to make it clear and I think the majority of the American people 's view that as soon as possible means as soon as possible .
Exactly what those words state .
The Haitians were to police themselves but the cooperation that was to prevent mission creep has not materialized and U.S. troops have assumed a greater and greater responsibility for policing Haiti .
We all see on CNN what they are doing .
Day by day their mission expands .
American military personnel have been tasked with preventing looting , stopping Haitian on Haitian violence , protecting private property and arresting attaches .
... from Somalia
McCain 1993
Mr. President , there is no reason for the United States of America to remain in Somalia .
The American people want them home , I believe that the majority of Congress wants them home , and to set an artificial date of March 31 or even February 1st , in my view , is not acceptable .
The criteria should be to bring them home as rapidly and safely as possible .
An evolution , which I think could be completed in a matter of weeks .
Mr. President , our continued military presence in Somalia allows another situation to arise which could then lead to the wounding , killing , or capture of the of American fighting men and women .
We should do all in our power to avoid that .
Date certain , Mr. President , are not the criteria here .
What 's the criteria and what should be the criteria is our immediate , orderly withdrawal from Somalia .
And if we do n't do that , and other Americans die , other Americans are wounded , other Americans are captured , because we stayed too long , longer than necessary , then I would say that the responsibilities for that lie with the Congress of the United States who did not excercise their authority under the Constitution of the United States and mandate that they be brought home as quickly and safely as possible .
But the mission which the American people supported and this Congress supported , in an overwhelming resolution , has been accomplished .
The American people did not support the goals of nation - building , peacemaking , law and order and certainly not warlord funding .
For us to get into nation - building , law and order , etc , I think is a tragic and terrible mistake .
But the argument that somehow the United States would suffer a loss to our prestige and our viability , as far as the No. 1 superpower in the world , I think , is baloney .
The fact is , what can hurt our prestige , Mr. President , I 'll tell you what can hurt our viability , as the world 's superpower , and that is , if we inmesh ourselves in a drawn - out situation , which entails the loss of American lives , more debaucles like the one we saw with the failed mission to capture Aidid 's lieutenants , using American forces , and that then will be what hurts our prestige .
Look at the tragedy in Beirut , Mr. President , 240 young Marines lost their lives , but we got out .
Now is the time for us to get out of Somalia , as rapidly and as promptly and as safely as possible .
Anybody want to transcribe these so I can post the transcripts ?

The Beauty of Perl 6 Parameter Passing
Perl 6 is not finished , but you can already play with it .
I hope this article will encourage you to try it .
Begin by installing Pugs , a Perl 6 compiler implemented in Haskell .
Note that you will also need Haskell ( see directions in the Pugs INSTALL file for how to get it ) .
Of course , Pugs is not finished .
It could n’t be .
The Perl 6 design is still in progress .
However , Pugs still has many key features that are going to turn our favorite language into something even greater .
A Simple Script
I ’m about to take a big risk .
I ’m going to show you a script that performs Newton ’s method .
Please do n’t give up before you get started .
Sir Isaac Newton was a noted computer scientist and sometime astronomer , physicist , and mathematician , as the communications of the ACM once described him .
He and others developed a fairly simple way of finding square roots .
It goes like this :
#!/usr /bin/pugs use v6 ; my Num $ target = 9 ; my Num $ guess = $ target ; while ( abs ( $ guess * * 2 - $ target ) > 0.005 ) { $ guess += ( $ target - $ guess * * 2 ) / ( 2 * $ guess ) ; say $ guess ; }
This version always finds the square root of 9 , which conveniently is 3 .
This aids testing because I do n’t have to remember a more interesting square root , for example , the square root of 2 .
When I run this , the output is :
5 3.4 3.0235294117647058823529411764705882352941 3.0000915541313801785305561913481345845731
The last number is the square root of 9 accurate to three decimal places .
Here ’s what ’s going on .
Once Pugs is installed , you can use it in a shebang line ( on Unix or Cygwin , at least ) .
Otherwise , invoke the script through pugs as you would for perl :
$ pugs newton
To let Perl 6 know that I want Perl 6 and not Perl 5 , I type use v6 ; .
In Perl 6 , the basic primitive types are still scalar , array , and hash .
There are also more types of scalars .
In this case , I ’m using the floating - point type Num for both the target ( the number whose square root I want ) and the guess ( which I hope will improve until it is the square root of the target ) .
I can use this syntax in Perl 5 .
In Perl 6 it will be the norm ( or so I hope ) .
I ’ve used my to limit the scope of the variables just as in Perl 5 .
Newton ’s method always needs a guess .
Without explaining , I ’ll say that for square roots the guess makes little difference .
To make it easy , I guessed the number itself .
Obviously , that ’s not a good guess , but it works eventually .
The while loop goes until the square of the guess is close to the target .
How close is up to me .
I chose .005 to give about three places of accuracy .
Inside the loop , the code improves the guess at each step using Newton ’s formula .
I wo n’t explain it at all .
( I ’ve resisted the strong temptation from my math - teacher days to explain a lot more .
Be glad I resisted .
But if you are curious , consult a calculus textbook .
Or better yet , send me email .
I ’d love to say more ! )
I ’ll present a more general form of the method soon , which may jog the memories of the calculus lovers in the audience , or not .
Finally , at the end of each iteration , I used say to print the answer .
This beats writing : print " $ guess
" ; .
Except for using say and declaring the type of the numbers to be Num , there ’s not much to separate the above script from one I might have written in Perl 5 .
That ’s okay .
It ’s about to get more Perl 6ish .
An Exporting Module
While it ’s fine to have a script that finds square roots , it would be better to generalize this in a couple of ways .
One good change is to make it a module so that others can share it .
Another is to turn loose the power of Newton and look for other kinds of roots , like cube roots and other even more exotic ones .
First , I ’ll turn the script above into a module that exports a newton sub .
Then , I ’ll tackle generalizing the method .
When I ’m finished , I want to be able to use the module like this :
#!/usr /bin/pugs use Newton ; my $ answer = newton ( 4 ) ; say $ answer ;
Because say is so helpful , I could combine the last two statements :
say " { newton ( 4 ) } " ;
That ’s right , strings will run code if you put it in braces .
The module , Newton . pm , looks like this :
package Newton ; use v6 ; sub newton ( Num $ target ) is export { my Num $ guess = $ target ; while ( abs ( $ guess * * 2 - $ target ) > 0.005 ) { $ guess += ( $ target - $ guess * * 2 ) / ( 2 * $ guess ) ; } return $ guess ; }
Here begins the familiar package declaration borrowed from Perl 5 .
( In Perl 6 itself , package identifies Perl 5 source code .
The v6 module lets you run some Perl 6 code in Perl 5 programs . )
Immediately following is use v6 ; , just as in the original script .
Declaring subs in Perl 6 does n’t have to be any different than in Perl 5 , but it should be .
This one says it takes a numeric variable called target .
Such genuine prototypes allow for Perl 6 to report compilation errors when you call a sub with the wrong arguments .
That single step will move Perl 6 onto the list of possible languages for a lot of large - scale application development shops .
At the end of the declaration , just before the opening brace for the body , I included is export .
This puts newton into the namespace of whoever uses the module ( at least , if they use the module in the normal way ; they could explicitly decline to take imports ) .
There is no need to explicitly use Exporter and set up @EXPORT or its friends .
The rest of the code is the same , except that it returns the answer and no longer proclaims its guess at each iteration .
Assigning Defaults
Adding genuine , compiler - enforced parameters to sub declarations is a giant leap forward for Perl .
For many people , that particular looseness in Perl 5 keeps it out of any discussions about what language to use for a project .
I experienced this unfortunate reality firsthand in my last job .
There ’s a lot more to declarations in Perl 6 , though .
Suppose I want to give the caller control over the accuracy of the method , yet I want to provide a sensible default if that caller does n’t want to think of a good one .
I might write :
package Newton ; use v6 ; sub newton ( Num $ target , Num : $epsilon = 0.005 , # note the colon Bool : $ verbose = 0 , ) is export { my Num $ guess = $ target ; while ( abs ( $ guess * * 2 - $ target ) > $ epsilon ) { $ guess += ( $ target - $ guess * * 2 ) / ( 2 * $ guess ) ; say $ guess if $ verbose ; } return $ guess ; }
Here I ’ve introduced two new optional parameters : $ verbose , for whether to print at each step ( the default is to keep quiet ) and $ epsilon , the Greek letter we math types often use for tolerances .
While the caller might use this exactly as before , she now has options .
She might say :
my $ answer = newton ( 165 , verbose => 1 , epsilon => .00005 ) ;
This gives extra accuracy and prints the values at each iteration ( which prints the value of the last iteration twice : once in the loop and again in the driving script ) .
Note that the named parameters may appear in any order .
Making Assumptions
Finally , Newton ’s method can find roots for more things than just squares .
To make this general requires a bit more work and some extra math ( which I ’ll again brush under the rug ) .
It is easy enough to supply the function for which you want roots .
For example , the squaring function could be :
sub f( Num $ x ) { $ x **2 }
Then , in the update line of the loop , write :
$ guess += ( $ target - f( $guess ) ) / ( 2 * $ guess ) ;
Changing f would change the roots you seek .
The problem is on the far side of the division symbol .
2 * $ guess depends on the function ( it ’s the first derivative , for those who care ) .
I could require the caller to provide this , as in :
sub fprime ( Num $ x ) { 2 * $ x }
Then the update would be :
$ guess += ( $ target - f( $guess ) ) / fprime ( $ guess ) ;
There are two problems with this approach .
First , you need a way for the caller to pass those functions into the sub .
That ’s actually pretty easy ; just add parameters of type Code to the list :
sub newton ( Num $ target , Code $f , Code $ fprime , Num : $epsilon = 0.005 , Bool : $ verbose = 0 , ) is export {
The second problem is that the caller may not know how to calculate $ fprime .
Perhaps
I should make calculus a prerequisite for using the module , but that just might scare away a few potential users .
I want to provide a default , but the default depends on what the function is .
If I knew what $f was , I could estimate $ fprime for users .
Perl 6 provides precisely this ability .
Here ’s the final module , a bit at a time :
package Newton ; use v6 ;
That ’s nothing new .
sub approxfprime ( Code $f , Num $ x ) { my Num $ delta = 0.1 ; return ( $ f ( $x + $ delta ) - $ f ( $x - $ delta ) ) / ( 2 * $ delta ) ; }
For those who care ( surely at least one person does ) , this is a second - order centered difference .
For those who do n’t , its an approximation suitable for use in the newton sub .
It takes a function and a number and returns an estimate of the value needed for division .
sub newton ( Num $ target , Code $f , Code : $ fprime = &approxfprime.assuming ( f => $ f ) , Num : $epsilon = 0.0005 , Bool : $ verbose = 0 , ) returns Num is export { my Num $ guess = $ target / 2 ; while ( abs ( $f ( $ guess ) - $ target ) > $ epsilon ) { $ guess += ( $ target - $ f( $ guess ) ) / $ fprime ( $ guess ) ; say $ guess if $ verbose ; } return $ guess ; }
A script using this program could be as simple as :
#!/usr /bin/pugs use Newton ; sub f( Num $ x ) { return $ x** 3 } say " { newton ( 8 , \&f , verbose => 1 , epsilon => .00005 ) } " ;
Note that the caller must supply the function f .
The one in the example is for cube roots .
If the caller provides the derivative as fprime , I use it .
Otherwise , as in the example , I use approxfprime .
Whereas a caller - supplied fprime would take one number and return another , approxfprime needs a number and a function .
The function needed is the one the caller passed to newton .
How do you pass it on ?
Currying — that is , supplying one or more of the parameters of a function once , then using the simplified version after that .
In Perl 6 , you can obtain a reference to a sub by placing the sub sigil & in front of the function ’s name ( providing it is in scope ) .
To curry , add .assuming to the end of that and supply values for one or more arguments in parentheses .
All of this is harder to talk about than to do :
Code :$ fprime = &approxfprime.assuming ( f => $ f ) ,
This code means that the caller might supply a value .
If this is the case , use it .
Otherwise , use approxfprime with the caller ’s function in place of f .
Conclusion
Perl 6 calling conventions are extremely well designed .
Not only do they allow compile - time parameter checking , they also allow named parameters with or without complex defaults , even including curried default functions .
This is going to be very powerful .
In fact , with Pugs , it already is .
There is a slightly more detailed version of the example from this article in the examples / algorithms / directory of the Pugs distribution .
It ’s called Newton.pm .
Disclaimer
As much as it pains me to say it , if you need heavy duty numerics , do n’t code in pure Perl .
Rather , use FORTRAN , C , or Perl with PDL .
And be careful .
Numerics is full of unexpected gotchas , which lead to poor performance or outright incorrect results .
Unfortunately , Newton ’s method , in the general case , is notoriously risky .
When in doubt about numerics , do as I do and consult a professional in the field .

Protesters came from all over the country
Organisers say the majority of local people are opposed to US plans .
They say Prime Minister Romano Prodi has ignored strong local objections .
Mr Prodi is going ahead with a plan agreed by his pro-US predecessor , Silvio Berlusconi .
Despite fears of possible violence , the march passed off peacefully .
Schools normally opened on Saturday were closed , and the US embassy warned Americans to avoid the city , as Mr Prodi appealed for protestors to avoid violence .
Vicenza 's mayor had feared the march would be infiltrated by left - wing radicals from other EU states intent on causing violence .
In Genoa six years ago clashes between police and anti-globalisation protesters during a G8 summit resulted in one death and many injuries , as well as serious damage .
Organisers said 100,000 people attended the Vicenza march , while police put the number at 40,000 .
Ministers banned
Marchers carried banners reading " America , No Thanks " and " Bases Go Home " , and waved rainbow - coloured peace flags .
" There is no reason to have this base here , " said Antonio Faitta , 25 , who travelled from Genoa for the protest .
Special trains and buses from various parts of Italy arrived in Vicenza for the march .
People want to impose with violence a base that nobody wants
Local man
Many of them had been chartered by leftist parties and the Greens , members of Mr Prodi 's ruling coalition , although the prime minister had banned ministers from attending the march .
The BBC's David Willey in Rome says the centre - left government is embarrassingly split between those who want to respect the decision of the previous centre - right coalition to agree to Washington 's request , and those who would like to see the Americans out .
Thousands set off from the town 's railway station with banners such as " No To The Bases " and " America No Thanks " .
" We love our town and we want to protect it , " a local protester told the BBC .
" Other people want to impose with violence a base that nobody wants . "
Transfer from Germany
The Americans established a military presence in Vicenza more than half a century ago .
President George W Bush wants to strengthen the base , the headquarters of the 173rd Airborne Brigade , by transferring from Germany to Italy another 2,000 US soldiers .
This would bring the total number of US troops stationed in Vicenza to nearly 5,000 .
The base provides over 1,000 jobs to locals in Vicenza and injects millions of dollars into the local economy .
A withdrawal could have serious local economic consequences .
Brain scans have shown that Woody has suffered no lasting damage
Medical staff at Leeds General Infirmary had tried in vain to resuscitate two - week - old Woody Lander .
He was handed over to parents Jon and Karen Lander so they could say goodbye .
After half an hour the couple heard the boy cough and doctors started his heart .
Now 14 months old , Woody has been given a clean bill of health .
Mr Lander , 34 , a civil servant from Farsley , Leeds , had been travelling with his 32 - year - old wife to his parents ' house in Norfolk in December 2005 when they noticed their child turn white and cold .
Woody was rushed to the emergency ward at Leeds General Infirmary where he had a heart attack .
It was later discovered he had a blocked aorta .
The doctors said they had never heard of anyone coming round after 30 minutes of apparent lifelessness
Jon Lander , Woody 's father
Mr Lander said : " We were in bits .
After what seemed like an eternity the doctor came out and said ' I think we have done all we can ' .
" They reached the cut - off point for resuscitation and said ' that 's it ' and handed Woody to us to say goodbye .
" They started taking tubes out and that 's when he started twitching .
" They managed to get his heart going and he came back to life in front of us . "
Consultant paediatric cardiologist Dr Mike Blackburn , who was one of the team treating the child , said : " Woody 's case is a real exception .
" After attempting to resuscitate him for so long , we would normally expect the worst .
" But we were able to successfully resuscitate Woody after contact with his mother .
" Truly miraculously , he was fit enough for surgery and it is amazing to see how well he is today . "
Full recovery
Brain scans have now shown no lasting damage and the Landers have been told their son can expect to lead a full and active life .
Mr Lander said : " We still do n't know how it happened .
We just know he 's a little miracle .
" The doctors said they had never heard of anyone coming round after 30 minutes of apparent lifelessness , let alone a young baby .
" But the people at the hospital were unbelievable and they made the miracle happen . "
Mr Lander is hoping to thank Leeds General Hospital by running in the Leeds 10 k Run for All , set up by fund - raiser and terminal cancer sufferer Jane Tomlinson , later this year .
He is raising cash for the Children 's Heart Surgery Fund at the hospital .

Contrary to the argument made by most immigration opponents , it seems that immigration actually raises wages for workers as a whole :
Immigration has a positive impact on the U.S. economy and boosts wages for the vast majority of native workers , though there are “ small negative effects ” on the earnings of the least - skilled Americans , according to a report the White House issued yesterday .
The report , a review of economic research prepared by the president ’s Council of Economic Advisers , concludes that foreign - born workers have accounted for about half of labor force growth in the past decade , fueling overall economic output , creating jobs and increasing earnings for native - born workers by as much as $ 80 billion a year .
Immigrants and their children also have a “ modest positive influence ” on government spending , the report says , contributing about $ 80,000 more per person in tax dollars over the long run than they claim in government benefits and services .
The report directly challenges attacks on President Bush ‘s proposal to overhaul immigration laws .
His measure would link beefed - up border security and a crackdown on employers who hire illegal immigrants to provisions granting legal status to the 12 million illegal immigrants already in the country .
It would also create a guest - worker program sought by business and shift the emphasis of immigration policy from family ties to job skills and education .
(….)
Foreign - born workers make up 15 percent of the U.S. labor force , with large concentrations at the top and bottom of the education scale , the report says .
For example , immigrants make up 36 percent of workers who lack a high - school diploma and 41 percent of scientists with doctoral degrees .
As many of us know , there are a good few immigrant business owners and entrepreneurs who move to the US get to apply for a special kind of visa that you can learn more about through this article here .
So clearly the US government understands and appreciates those that have the skillsets that benefit the US economy .
But that idea does n’t always translate to the general population .
As a group , immigrants earn 77 cents on the dollar compared with native workers , though that gap largely disappears among college graduates .
More than 90 percent of native workers benefit from the influx of low - wage labor because immigrants take jobs that complement higher - paid native workers rather than competing with them , according to the report .
For example , [ Council of Economic Advisers Chairman Edwin P. ]
Lazear said , immigrant roofers lower costs for contractors and home - builders , creating jobs for plumbers and electricians and lowering the price of houses for consumers .

The narrow , cobbled streets of Cordoba in southern Spain are no place for a car , but a Spanish entrepreneur wants to change that .
The cars have a top speed of about 20mph
He points to a sleek , curvy little number .
" It 's a wonderful car , a marvellous car , " says Mr Romeo with used - car salesman relish .
" It 's noiseless .
It 's very safe .
It 's reliable .
This model is the two - seater .
I love the cars . "
But Mr Romeo is not selling cars , he is renting them .
And he is not talking about Porsches or Lamborghinis .
Instead , he is renting Gems , or Global Electric Motorcars .
Half a dozen of the vehicles are scattered throughout the garage , plugged into the mains .
They are charging up for a day of work on Cordoba 's busy streets .
One charge is usually good for about 50 miles ( 80 km ) .
Gems are made in the US by a division of Daimler - Chrysler .
They have a flowing , curvilinear design reminiscent of an Apple eMac computer , or a Volkswagen Beetle .
Blob attack
Objects with that kind of shape have picked up their own moniker - blobjects .
Alfredo Romeo has been taken with the idea of blobjects ever since he heard technology guru Bruce Sterling discuss them in a speech .
Cordoba is a city of the senses .
There are streets where it truly smells like flowers .
We have a great climate here , too
Laura Rodriguez , Blobject
The Spanish entrepreneur loved the name .
He felt it matched his vision for what personal transportation might be like in the future .
When he teamed up with two old school friends to launch the electric car rental business , he decided to name the company Blobject .
The company rents the electric cars to tourists in Cordoba , as a safe , convenient , and environmentally friendly way to see the town .
It costs about US$ 50 ( £ 28 ) for a two - hour rental .
The Gems turn heads as they cruise along the city streets .
The cars have a top speed of about 20 mph ( 32 Km / h ) , so scooters whip right by you .
But Mr Romeo contends that slow is better for sight - seeing anyway .
And besides , he says , there are the extras .
Open source autos
Each Blobject car comes with a touch - screen computer system mounted in the dash .
Through a USB port , you can plug in a flash drive containing information on Cordoba in Spanish , English or French .
The Gems can be hired for US $ 50 for a two - hour rental
When you pass a certain landmark , the computer then knows to display the appropriate text , audio and video information about that landmark on the screen .
The computer system is based on open source software developed by a company in Seville , Spain .
As with any open source software , anyone can improve and change Blobject 's code , as long as those improvements and changes are shared with others .
Mr Romeo insisted on using open source .
Not only was it cheaper , he says , but it also allowed him to better customise his product .
" With proprietary software , innovation comes from the people in marketing , " he says .
" But with open source , innovation comes from the guy who is really in the market .
It comes from someone who knows the city . "
Communist funding
Blobject 's cars have other customised features as well .
It 's a communism that moves logically toward something that is very different than what it used to be
Paco Tejada , local government official
" Cordoba is a city of the senses .
There are streets where it truly smells like flowers .
We have a great climate here , too .
In a closed car , you could n't experience any of that . "
Not everyone is taken with the electric cars .
The city 's taxi drivers call them " caracoles " , which is Spanish for snails .
As they pass , the taxis lean on their horns .
They would probably yell obscenities at you , if they were not going by so quickly .
But the local government is behind the Blobject effort .
It has given the company some money , and has set aside special parking places for the electric cars around Cordoba 's main tourist sites .
" They are focusing on an important sector to the city - tourism , " says Paco Tejada , the local government official in charge of tourism .
" It seemed to us like an important entrepreneurial initiative . "
That may seem like typical government talk .
But Cordoba 's city government is controlled by the Communist party .
When I point out that funding entrepreneurial projects does not sound very communist , Mr Tejada is amused .
" Well , it 's the communism of the future , " he says laughing .
" It 's a communism that moves logically toward something that is very different than what it used to be . "
Alfredo Romeo is moving ahead as well .
He has opened a second Blobject office in Seville .
And he has just taken delivery of some new additions to his fleet .
They are four - seater electric cars .
" The sedan model , " he calls them .
" You know , for the whole family . "

We ’ve looked at what we think makes us happy at work but does n’t .
We ’ve looked at what actually does work .
But what actively makes people unhappy at work ?
What are the most important things to avoid ?
Let ’s take a look at that .
Bad management
In the case where a board cant figure out to depose self - obsessed , autocratic and power - hungry managers , well probably se in the future that these leaders will be deposed by their own employees , who will leave for better workplaces with better leaders and leadership values , that create a better space for the employees personal goals and life visions to unfold .
This will leave the managers who use hierarchical leadership , control systems and autocratic leadership values without significant access to getting employees .
Ie . a leadership with no followers , which is both pathetic and useless .
Bad relations between employees and their managers is the single greatest cause of workplace unhappiness .
Indeed , the majority of employees who quit do so because of their immediate manager Bad leaders underestimate the value of happiness at work , and are often unhappy themselves .
Good leaders , on the other hand , enjoy their work , enjoy the people they work with and actively focus on making themselves and their employees happy at work .
– Alfred Josefsen , CEO of Irma
You tell ’em , Alfred !
Bad leaders lose their employees to good leaders and are left to practice their autocratic , power - obsessed leadership style on no - one .
That ’s leadership Darwinism .
That ’s survival of the happiest .
One company has taken this to its logical conclusion , and have implemented two practices , which together virtually eliminate bad leadership .
At Semco , a company of 3.000 people based in Sao Paulo , Brazil , all leaders are evaluated by their employees twice a year .
Each leader gets a total score between 0 and 100 , and all scores are posted for all employees to see .
And here ’s the kicker : Employee are free to choose their own bosses .
This creates an enormous pressure on leaders to constantly improve , and also means that bad leaders who fail to heed their employees ’ feedback quickly find themselves without followers .
Old vs. new leadership
So what kind of leader makes people happy at work ?
It ’s really not that complicated .
A good leader :
Likes her people
Has time for her employees
Listens to and understands her people
Praises and gives feedback
Is happy in her job and makes her employees happy too
Again , it ’s about relations between people .
This is good news and bad news .
Good news because it means that what leaders need to do to make their employees happy at work is not complicated .
The bad news is that we used to think that good leaders :
Made fast decisions
Cut to the chase
Aportioned resources
Made plans and follows up
Those are two quite different skillsets .
They can be combined , but many people excel in one or the other , and most leaders today have become leaders because of their competence in the old ???
skillset .
Also , the skills needed to make people happy at work are highly personal  in many people they are ingrained rather than learned , making it hard for leaders to migrate from the old leadership style to the new one .
But now leaders face pressure to create an innovative and creative culture .
To allow employees to realize their full potential .
To motivate rather than command .
To coach rather than control .
All of which is possible only when employees are happy at work , meaning leaders must learn a new leadership style .
At the same time , there ’s very little established education or training available in the new leadership style .
Few MBA programs focus on the new style of leadership .
So I say : Let ’s cut our leaders and managers some slack .
Many of them are trying .
Let ’s not forget that this is new for everyone , them too .
However , managers who do n’t ultimately get it , need to go .
Nothing is more toxic to a happy workplace than a leader who makes his people unhappy but is allowed to keep his position anyway .
Stress and overwork
I used to work at a company with a strong overwork ???
culture .
After two years obsessing about getting in at 7 , leaving at 7 ( and then working even more from home ) , my wife had a baby .
I took a week off , then felt justified in limiting my work to 40 hours for the next couple of months ( due to my lack of sleep and need to help around the house ) .
In that two - month period I realized I accomplished exactly as much and was exactly as busy as I was when I worked ~ 60 hours / week .
From then on , I was in at 8 , out at 5 , aside from the occasional large project , and I completely stopped working at home .
I was never happier , more organized or more successful in that job .
With this peace of mind and free time , I was able to invest a few hours in learning the GTD ( Getting Things Done ) system , learning more about my field and getting more involved in professional and community organizations .
( This may have averaged about 3 hours / week at the max . )
All that I learned in this time enabled me to get a new job and a significantly higher salary .
Meanwhile , when I talk to employees at the old company , they re bragging about the 75 - hour workweeks and discussing which anti-anxiety meds they take .
( Comment on positivesharing.com )
Today ’s work environment is one of near - constant busy - ness .
Nobody has an empty in - tray these days .
Very few of us can clear the desk ??? and then go home .
Instead there ’s always one more thing we could do , and many of us feel , or indeed are , permanently behind .
This leads to people working longer hours and stressing more because they feel inadequate .
And make no mistake :
Too much stress makes people sick , and in extreme cases it is lethal .
The japanese even have a word for it : Karoshi .
Death by overwork .
The interesting thing is also that stress makes people less efficient , so they get less work done , fall further behind , and become even more stressed .
That ’s a vicious cycle right there .
I remain convinced that most of us , a few supermen and - women excepted , accomplish only a little more in 60 , 80 or 100 hours a week than we do in 40 .
And while we may get more work done in 80 hours than in 40 , there ’s also a cost .
We get :
Less creativity , because it ’s easier to be creative when you ’re relaxed
Worse relations with co-workers because we ’re too busy to connect with people
Less time with friends and family , which recharges the batteries and gives you new thoughts and ideas
Less openness to new ideas – there ’s no time !
Less happiness at work – because of all of the above
Or as one top executive puts it :
You can always find reasons to work .
There will always be one more thing to do .
But when people dont take time out , they stop being productive .
They stop being happy , and that affects the morale of everyone around them .

Bureaucracy
An august 2000 survey of 1.100 american employees from various organizations concluded that organizational red tape , cumbersome work rules , and tangled processes take up an extraordinary amount of time .
On average , workplace bureaucracy steals 9.4 hours from the weekly schedule .
For one in five people , more than 16 hours per week go down the bureaucracy drain .
Furthermore , there is a clear correlation between workplaces with more bureaucracy and workplaces people want to leave .
In other words : People flee organizations burdened with red tape .

As CEO of Oticon , Lars Kolind went on a war against bureaucracy in the company .
This turned Oticon around from a marginal player to the world ’s leading manufacturer of hearing aids .
In his excellent book  The Second Cycle , Winning the War Against Bureaucracy ???
Kolind writes :
As organizations grow larger , older and more successful , they introduce more management layers , more departments , more procedures , plans , budgets , reports , meetings , traditions and the like .
This leads to management developing its own agenda , increasingly detached from employees and customers .
It becomes more important to win awards than to care for customers and employees .
Management loses touch with the business , which becomes increasingly complacent and even arrogant .
This all leads to less action , slower action and no action outside the well - known patterns .
Red tape kills the soul .
There you are , an employee with a plan or a great idea , and the corporate rule book is holding you back against common sense and everything you know to be right .
That kind of thing makes people desperately unhappy at work .
Bullying
It was like a cloud of evil had descended on the factory .
Everyone was afraid of this evil .
I knew that I was being harassed and bullied , I felt like I was being forced in to resigning .
Every reasonable step I took to resolve my situation was refused or worse I was totally ignored , all the time my treatment seemed to get harsher , I was given totally menial tasks , which when complained about would result in me being given physically impossible tasks .
To cut a long story short I eventually suffered a breakdown .
This not only devastated me but all my family too .
( Source : http://www.bullyonline.org/cases/case12.htm)
Bullying is fortunately fairly rare , but when it happens the effects are devastating .
People break down mentally and physically , and can take years to recover .
Power games
That whole  Who people see me have lunch with is more important than what I actually do ??? and  Getting ahead is more important than getting results ???
mentality makes most people desparately unhappy at work .
It ’s true that some people flourish under these conditions , especially those with a more political mindset .
But most people only notice that the wrong behavior and the wrong attitudes are being rewarded .
In the end employees stop caring , and they stop being happy at work .

Tail recursion in REBOL
REBOL 1.0 is properly tail recursive .
Proper tail recursion is usually easy to achieve in most languages , but in REBOL it surprisingly difficult .
Here is a short description of the problem and solution .
-----
A quick intro to the language
REBOL has been characterized as `like Lisp but without the parenthesis ' or ` the result of Ousterhout meeting Sussman in a dark alley ' .
Like Lisp , REBOL uses prefix notation ; however , REBOL 's notation is unbracketed , making it much closer to the `Polish notation ' developed by Jan Lukasiewicz in the 1920's .
In order to provide an unbracketed notation , REBOL requires that all functions have fixed `arity ' .
No function takes optional or unlimited numbers of arguments ( there are mechanisms available to work around this limitation ) .
When REBOL encounters a function during evaluation , it assumes that the function will be applied to subsequent arguments .
A special quoting mechanism indicates that a function is to be passed as an argument rather than invoked .
REBOL supports a `pseudo - infix notation ' for mathematical operators .
Infix operators are binary , and there is a simple syntactic translation that converts infix to prefix .
REBOL 's infix notation is evaluated left - to - right ; there are no standard `rules of precedence ' .
Because REBOL supports infix notation , order of evaluation for infix operators may be controlled by parenthesis .
Parenthesis are not specific to the infix operators , they can be used anywhere else as well , but the prefix notation of REBOL makes them superfluous ( to the interpreter , at least .
The user may want to parenthesize some expressions in order to make them more readable . )
A typical REBOL expression may look like this :
floor random expt 2 x length foo
Which would be roughly equivalent to the lisp form :
( floor ( random ( expt 2 x ) ) ( length foo ) )
Evaluation would proceed as follows :
FLOOR takes two arguments , recursively find the first argument ...
RANDOM takes one argument , recursively find it ... EXPT takes two arguments , recursively find the first ... 2 is atomic , return it Get second arg for EXPT x is a variable , ( assume for this example x equals 16 ) Apply EXPT to 2 and 16 yielding 65536 , return this ....
Apply RANDOM to 65536 getting back ????
Get second argument to FLOOR ... LENGTH takes one argument ....
FOO is not a function , return it ....
Apply LENGTH to value of FOO .....
Apply FLOOR to the random number and result of length .
Expressions may be concatenated in order to execute them sequentially .
Again , no special syntax is necessary .
A function that is the result of a computation will not automatically be applied .
To illustrate this , suppose `make - adder ' is a function that takes an integer and returns a function that adds that integer to an argument .
The REBOL expression
MAKE - ADDER 3
would evaluate to a function , but the expression
MAKE - ADDER 3 4
would NOT apply that function .
Rather , this expression would be treated as a sequence of two expressions :
The call to make - adder ( the result of which would be discarded ) and the self - evaluating expression ` 4 ' .
The primitive function ` DO ' may be used to invoke a computed function on an argument .
-----
Blocks
A `block ' in REBOL is indicated by square brackets around an expression or series of expressions .
A block is a delayed evaluation ( a thunk ) .
It is lexically scoped , and not memoized .
Because blocks delay evaluation , there is no need for special forms within the language .
For instance , a `when ' function could be written as
my - when : func [ pred consequences ] [ if pred do consequences ]
The DO primitive , when applied to a block , forces execution of the block .
Why tail recursion is important in REBOL
Since blocks are thunks , all user - defined control constructs are written in continuation - passing style .
Without proper tail - recursion , user - defined control constructs will blow out the stack .
One possible solution is to have a plethora of primitive control constructs ( if , when , while , until , loop , repeat , etc . )
The drawback of this method is that each new control construct must be written in C , and care must be taken to preserve the language semantics ( for instance , one must be careful to ensure lexical scoping ) .
A properly tail - recursive implementation is more flexible for the user .
Unfortunately , making REBOL properly tail recursive is quite difficult .
Let us explore the problem by writing a toy rebol interpreter in Scheme .
( define ( eval - sequence block env ) ( if ( empty - block ? block ) block ( multiple - value - bind ( value remainder ) ( eval - 1 block env ) ;; **** ( if ( null ? remainder ) value ( eval - sequence remainder env ) ) ) ) ) ( define ( eval - 1 block env ) ( let ( ( token ( car block ) ) ) ( cond ( ( quoted ? token ) ( values ( unquote token ) ( cdr block ) ) ) ( ( assignment ? token ) ( eval - assignment token ( cdr block ) env ) ) ( ( block ? token ) ( values ( make - closure token env ) ( cdr block ) ) ( else ( let ( ( value ( lookup token env ) ) ) ( if ( or ( fquoted ? token ) ( not ( procedure ? value ) ) ) ( values value ( cdr block ) ) ( eval - arguments value ( cdr block ) env ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ( define ( eval - arguments function block env ) ( eval - arguments - 1 function block env ( arity function ) '( ) ) ) ( define ( eval - arguments - 1 function block env arity arglist ) ( cond ( ( zero? arity ) ( values ( apply function ( reverse arglist ) ) block ) ) ( ( empty - block ? block ) ( error " Too few arguments . " ) ) ; ; ; fexpr processing would go here ( else ( multiple - value - bind ( value remainder ) ( eval - 1 block env ) ( eval - arguments - 1 function remainder env ( - 1+ arity ) ( cons value arglist ) ) ) ) ) )
Note the line with asterisks .
When evaluating a sequence of expressions in a block , we recursively evaluate the first expression in the sequence obtaining its value and the `remaining ' part of the block .
We do n't know how much of the block will remain because we will `eat ' arguments from the block incrementally .
We only know that if there are any elements left , then we should continue evaluation of the block rather than return the value .
If this were a scheme interpreter , we would have a simple solution :
( define ( eval - sequence sequence env ) ;; scheme version ( cond ( ( empty - sequence ? sequence ) nil ) ( ( at- last-element ? sequence ) ( eval ( car sequence ) env ) ) ;; tail recurse ( t ( eval ( car sequence ) env ) ( eval - sequence ( cdr sequence ) env ) ) ) )
We would tail - recurse onto eval when we reach the last element .
Again , we cannot do this in REBOL because we cannot write an `at - last - element ? ' function .
-----
The solution
The solution seems obvious in retrospect , but it took several weeks before I could convince myself that I was n't just missing something trivial .
I tried reorganizing the code , passing back flags , etc . Finally I pulled out the big guns and considered the denotational semantics of the language .
Tail recursion comes down to this : when recursively invoking the interpreter , do not create `trivial ' continuations .
A trivial continuation is the `identity ' function , i.e. , it simply returns the value handed to it .
How does one find the trivial continuations ?
Convert the function to `continuation - passing style ' to make the continuations explicit , then eta-reduce any continuation that you can .
So a properly tail - recursive program is one in which the continuation - passing - style has been eta-reduced .
Here 's the cps version of a Rebol interpreter in Scheme :
( define ( eval - sequence block env k ) ( if ( empty - block ? block ) block ( eval - 1 block env ( lambda ( value more ) ( eval - sequence more env k ) ) ( lambda ( value ) ( k value ) ) ; ***** ) ) ) ( define ( eval - 1 block env k - more k- last ) ( define ( return value ) ( if ( null ? ( cdr block ) ) ( k - last value ) ( k - more value ( cdr block ) ) ) ) ( let ( ( token ( car block ) ) ) ( cond ( ( quoted ? token ) ( return ( unquote token ) ) ) ( ( assignment ? token ) ( eval - assignment token ( cdr block ) env k- more k- last ) ) ( ( block ? token ) ( return ( make - closure token env ) ) ) ( else ( let ( ( value ( lookup token env ) ) ) ( if ( or ( fquoted ? token ) ( not ( procedure ? value ) ) ) ( return value ) ( eval - arguments value ( cdr block ) env k- more k- last ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ( define ( eval - arguments function block env k - more k- last ) ( eval - arguments - 1 function block env ( arity function ) '( ) k- more k- last ) ) ( define ( eval - arguments - 1 function block env arity arglist k - more k- last ) ( cond ( ( zero? arity ) ( apply function ( reverse arglist ) ( if ( empty - block ? block ) k - last k- more ) ) ) ( ( empty - block ? block ) ( error " Too few arguments . " ) ) ; ; ; fexpr processing would go here ( else ( eval - 1 block env ( lambda ( last - arg ) ( eval - arguments - 1 function NIL NIL ( 1- arity ) ( cons last - arg arglist ) NIL k- last ) ) ( lambda ( arg more ) ( eval - arguments - 1 function more env ( 1 - arity ) ( cons arg arglist ) k- more k- last ) ) ) ) ) )
Again , note the line with asterisks .
This is the problematic continuation .
It is trivial in that it simply passes its argument back to its caller , so it could be written as :
( define ( eval - sequence block env k ) ( if ( empty - block ? block ) block ( eval - 1 block env ( lambda ( value more ) ( eval - sequence more env k ) ) k ; eta-reduction of ( lambda ( value ) ( k value ) ) ) ) )
This version of the interpreter will be properly tail recursive .
There is a surprise here .
Notice that EVAL - 1 ( what would correspond to EVAL in a Lisp or Scheme interpreter ) takes two continuations rather than the usual one .
One continuation is invoked in the case where `more ' of the sequence needs to be processed , the other in the case that the sequence is `all used up ' .
Furthemore , note that APPLY does not need an extra continuation .
-----
Implementation in C
It is often the case when you are implementing a language in terms of another that you wish to find a mapping between the host language 's continuations and the target language 's continuations .
This allows you to use the function call and return mechanism in the host language ( C ) to implement the same in the target language ( REBOL ) .
Having two continuations for EVAL poses a problem .
In C , there is a single continuation for each function .
( Never mind the fact that C does not eta-reduce its continuations , i.e. it is n't tail recursive anyway ) .
It is here that Henry Baker 's Cheney on the MTA trick comes in real handy .
With ` Cheney on the MTA ' , we write our C code in CPS and never return from a C function .
This creates the mapping between the function calls of the host language and GOTOs ( which will become calls , tail - calls , and returns ) in the target language .
void eval_sequence ( BLOCK b , int offset , ENVIRONMENT env , CONTINUATION_1 k ) { struct continuation _2 kmore = malloc ( sizeof ( struct continuation_2 ) ) ; kmore -> function = & eval_sequence_continue ; kmore - > env = env ; kmore -> parent = k ; eval_1 ( b , offset , env , & kmore , k ) ; } void eval_sequence_continue ( CONTINUATION_2 self , VALUE val , BLOCK b , int offset ) { eval_sequence ( b , offset , self - > env , self - > parent ) ; } void eval_1 ( BLOCK b , int offset , ENVIRONMENT env , CONTINUATION_2 k_more , CONTINUATION_1 k_last ) { OBJECT token = fetch_token ( b , offset ++ ) ; if ( token_is ( token , QUOTED ) ) { if ( offset == length ( block ) ) invoke_continuation_1 ( k_last , unquote ( token ) ) ; invoke_continuation_2 ( k_more , unquote ( token ) , b , offset ) ; } .... else eval_arguments ( value , b , offset , env , k_more , k_last ) ; }
This code never returns a value , but proceeds by explicitly creating continuation objects and passing them along to the next procedure .
So what happens when we blow off the top of the stack ?
Well , there is nothing on the stack of interest other than the topmost frame .
So we 'll check for stack overflow in eval_1 , and if we are nearing the end , we 'll squirrel away the arguments to eval_1 in some globals , longjmp to clear the stack , and call eval_1 with the saved arguments .
This code CONSes continuations like they are going out of style .
Every time we evaluate an argument , we create two continuations .
Every time we return a value , we discard one continuation .
To avoid interlocking with the GC for every argument evaluation , we can allocate our continuations on the stack .
Essentially , we use the machine 's `stack pointer ' as the `heap frontier ' pointer .
void eval_sequence ( BLOCK b , int offset , ENVIRONMENT env , CONTINUATION_1 k ) { struct continuation_2 kmore ; kmore.function = & eval_sequence_continue ; kmore.env = env ; kmore .
parent = k ; eval_1 ( b , offset , env , & kmore , k ) ; }
This solves the consing problem , but now when we blow off the top of the stack , we have to evacuate the current continuation chain to the heap .
We could tag every continuation on the stack so that a stack evacuator can parse the continuation chain , but there is a niftier way :
In each continuation , we place a slot that holds a pointer to a function that knows how to evacuate that particular kind of continuation .
When we approach the end of the stack , we jump to the evacuation function of the topmost continuation .
It will evacuate itself from the stack and recurse on its parent , etc. etc .
When all continuations are off the stack , we can then do a longjmp and restart the eval .
void eval_sequence ( BLOCK b , int offset , ENVIRONMENT env , CONTINUATION_1 k ) { struct continuation _2 kmore ; kmore.evacuate = & eval_sequence_continue_evacuate ; kmore.function = & eval_sequence_continue ; kmore.env = env ; kmore .
parent = k ; eval_1 ( b , offset , env , & kmore , k ) ; }

Just add in the Chronicle 's own panoramic interior restaurant views to your research and , hell , you 've had half a night out already and you have n't even left the hovel .
The question has been raised : How much is too much ?
How much implied privacy should we have as a society , as a community , as a city , and do we let this sort of technology run free simply because the draconian creepiness of it all is so easily offset by how damn fascinating and helpful and nifty a utility it so very obviously is ?
In other words , should we just shut the hell up about this privacy thing ( hey , you live in a cramped , bustling metropolis -- privacy is never implied ) and be glad it 's only happy geeky Google taking what amounts to a giant omnidirectional meta - tourist snapshot of the city and just be glad we 're not , say , Britain , which has quietly " sleepwalked its way into a surveillance society " and now has about 4.2 million live , sentient surveillance cameras running nonstop , or about one for every 14 citizens ?
Now that 's unsettling .
Look at it this way : Maybe Google 's bitchin ' new service merely indicates a more , shall we say , passive - aggressive surveillance culture for America , Big Brother as your friendly , helpful lifestyle accessory , all of us safe in the knowledge that Google 's cameras are not live and the views are far from perfect and in about six months the photos will feel old and tired and outdated anyway .
Is n't that reassuring ?
You can spin it in all sorts of delightful ways .
On the one hand , GSV offers a terrific cultural artifact in and of itself , simultaneously presenting to the world a suspended moment in urban time as well as giving a raw , honest taste of a given city , warts and slackers and loiterers and homeless drug addicts and traffic jams and peeing guys and assorted cafe denizens and all .
It is also , of course , a stalker 's paradise , the lonely ' n ' bitter ex-boy / girlfriend 's dream come true .
Just imagine :
What glorious , sulky fun to spend hours in front of your computer screen , staring tearfully , resentfully at your ex's neighborhood , his street , his car , his very bedroom window , imagining him in there with his new girlfriend and her ugly cat and her stupid taste in shoes with him laughing happily and painting her toenails and sharing your favorite ice cream and absolutely , positively not thinking about you .
Mmm , seething .
And let 's not forget GSV's gift to shut-ins and paranoids everywhere , all those lovers of fear who now get to imagine all manner of swarthy terrorists easily scoping out their urban targets with just a few clicks of a mouse , preparing right this minute to bomb their neighborhood Bagel
Hut because , you know , terrorists are just that stupid .
Or maybe it 's not that at all .
Maybe all these perspectives merely scratch the surface of GSV's true implications and the real joy comes from the knowledge that if a goofy , massively popular , insanely wealthy public Internet company has already gone this far , has already gotten this up close and personal with our daily lives , you can absolutely rest assured our own government has certainly gone much , much further .
There now .

The smallest form of life known to science just got smaller .
Four million of a newly discovered microbe — assuming the discovery , reported yesterday in the journal Science , is confirmed — could fit into the period at the end of this sentence .
Scientists found the microbes living in a remarkably inhospitable environment , drainage water as caustic as battery acid from a mine in Northern California .
The microbes , members of an ancient family of organisms known as archaea , formed a pink scum on green pools of hot mine water laden with toxic metals , including arsenic .
“ It was amazing , ” said Jillian F. Banfield of the University of California , Berkeley , a member of the discovery team .
“ These were totally new . ”
In their paper , the scientists call the microbes “ smaller than any other known cellular life form . ”
Several strange creatures including a psychedelic octopus have been found in frigid waters off Antarctica in one of the world ’s most pristine marine environments .
Others resembled corals and shrimps .
At least 30 appear to be new to science , said Julian Gutt , chief scientist of an expedition that was part of the International Polar Year research effort set to launch on March 1 .
The researchers catalogued about 1,000 species in an area of the Antarctic seabed where warming temperatures are believed to have caused the collapse of overlying ice shelves , affecting the marine life below .
“ This is virgin geography , ” said expedition member Gauthier Chapelle .
“ If we do n’t find out what this area is like now following the collapse of the ice shelf , and what species are there , we wo n’t have any basis to know in 20 years ’ time what has changed and how global warming has altered the marine ecosystem . ”
The expedition also found sea lilies , sea cucumbers and sea urchins thriving on the sea floor — these species are usually found in much deeper waters where food is scarce , but the ice shelves probably made food scarcer than it would usually be at that shallow depth .
Images of the newfound creatures :
Octopus

An opened seal
In the Weddell Sea off the east coast of the Antarctic Peninsula , 10,000 square kilometers of seabed was sealed off from the surface for thousands of years by the 100-m thick Larsen A and B ice shelves .
When these ice shelves collapsed in recent years , the area was opened up to colonization by species that could not have survived there before [ Original News Story ] .
The international team of scientists recently completed a 10 - week expedition of the area .
Using a remote operating vehicle , they were able to do the first comprehensive survey of life on the seabed .
Before the ice shelves collapsed , the only access scientists had to the area was through holes drilled in the ice .
Ice shelves form when creeping glaciers reach the continent ’s coast and begin to float on the ocean .
They usually lose mass via icebergs that calve off and float out to sea gradually , but the Larsen A and B shelves both suddenly and surprisingly collapsed .
Since 1974 , a total of 13,500 square kilometers ( about half the size of New Jersey ) of ice shelves have disintegrated — a phenomenon linked to global warming , as temperatures have risen faster in Antarctica than anywhere else in world .
In general , the expedition found that animals were less abundant in the Larsen A and B areas compared to other areas of the Antarctic .
Animals in the area were only one percent as abundant as other parts of the Weddell Sea , which Gutt suspects is somehow related to the availability of food .
New species ?
One of the main aims of the expedition was to survey both indigenous life - forms and creatures that had moved in after the collapse to take advantage of the newly opened environment .
Gutt said that 95 percent of the animals the expedition found were probably indigenous and just 5 percent had moved in after the ice shelves collapsed , but even that small percentage indicated a shift in biodiversity and species composition in the area which will probably continue .
“ Life at the sea floor obviously reacts very slowly to this very climactic change in the environmental conditions , " Gutt said .
“ [ It ] needs hundreds to thousands of years until a new community has fully developed , if this will happen at all . ”
One creature new to the neighborhood was the fast - growing , gelatinous sea squirt , which the scientists found in several dense patches .
Iceberg damage
The expedition also found scours created by icebergs that calved from the ice sheets and ran aground on the sea bed , destroying the life in the area , but the damage was n’t as bad as expected .
“ I expected more , because if there are thousands of icebergs disintegrated , or calved , in a very short period of only a few months , then I expected that everything would be destroyed .
But it was not , ” Gutt said .
The expedition actually found more evidence of disturbance outside the Larsen ice shelf area at points where many icebergs must pass .
But in the areas icebergs had destroyed , Gutt said , signs of life were returning .

What is it about Polish people and lines ?
I just returned from a fascinating and enjoyable trip to Warsaw .
The only negative to the trip ( besides the fact it is a 9 hour flight to get there ) was how incredibly rude the Poles were about lines .
I have never seen such obvious disrespect for other people when it came to cutting in lines , even when it meant that the person who cut would have to stand in front of you in line for the next 15 minutes .
In the United States , people will cut in lines in cars , but usually not when on foot , because of the discomfort of having people you just mistreated standing next to you .
A car provides insulation from the social stigma .
In Poland , no such distinction appears to be made .
( When I told Dubner about this , he told me to stop complaining and save it for when I next went to Israel , where he says there is simply no such thing as a line . )
Just to test my hypothesis , at the airport as I boarded the plane — it was an utter free for all with everyone invited to enter the plane at once — I made a mental note of the most egregious line cutters .
Then , when we got to Customs in the United States , I watched to see which of the worst cutters went to the U.S. citizens line and which went to the visitors line .
Not one of the worst offenders was an American citizen , supporting my conjecture .
What surprised me most about the line cutting was that having lived under communism for so long , I would have thought that the Poles would have perfected standing in line .
I would have predicted even greater courtesy than you find elsewhere .
Perhaps , I just got the theory backwards .
With so many years of shortages , the rewards for becoming an expert line cutter were much greater in Poland than in the U.S.
So they did perfect standing in lines — perfection means being able to cut in front of people and feel no guilt .

REUTERS /CDC / Handout
DENVER ( Reuters ) - A Denver Zoo monkey has died of bubonic plague , apparently after eating a squirrel stricken with the disease , Colorado health and zoo officials said on Monday .
Five squirrels and a rabbit found dead on zoo grounds tested positive for the flea - borne disease in recent weeks , Denver Zoo spokeswoman Ana Bowie said .
Zookeepers on May 15 noticed the 8 - year - old hooded capuchin monkey was lethargic , and the next day it was found dead in its enclosure .
Zoo veterinarians sent tissue samples to a state laboratory where it was determined the animal died of the plague .
The death was announced on Monday .
Zoo veterinarian Dave Kenny said that the risk of plague spreading to humans was extremely low but that visitors were being urged to avoid squirrels and rabbits .
“ There are species in the zoo collection , especially monkeys , that could be susceptible to the plague , ” said John Pape , an epidemiologist with the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment .
Bowie said none of the 17 other capuchin monkeys in the exhibit -- or any other animals at the zoo -- have shown plague symptoms .
But as a precaution , all the capuchin monkeys have been moved to an inside enclosure and are being treated with a regimen of antibiotics , she said .
The squid was caught after it was hauled to the surface munching on one of its favourite foods - a Patagonian toothfish the fishermen had hooked on a longline .
Dr Steve O'Shea , a world renowned squid expert with the Auckland University of Technology , said the specimen eclipsed the previous largest find - another colossal squid that weighed 300 kg found in 2003 .
Scientists would be very excited , he said .
" I can assure you that this is going to draw phenomenal interest .
It is truly amazing , " he said .
He said if calamari were made from the squid the rings would be the size of tractor tyres .
New Zealand Fisheries Minister Jim Anderton described how the squid was hauled from the deep in Antarctic waters .
" It was actually eating a toothfish , which was on a long - line .
It was eating it up as it came up , " Anderton said .
It is believed the crew on the boat stopped winching in the long - line and spent two hours manoeuvring a net under the squid to haul it aboard .
Geoff Dolan , an observer with New Zealand 's Ministry of Fisheries , was aboard the vessel San Aspiring , owned by the Sanford seafood company , when the squid was hauled aboard .
" There was quite a lot of excitement onboard ... the decision was taken that the chances of survival were not good , and in the interests of science it should be taken on board , " Dolan said .
Sanford 's deepwater division manager Greg Johansson said the squid was barely alive when it was pulled aboard .
" It was deemed that is was more valuable to science , " Johansson said .
The squid was taken below deck and stored in a 1200 litre capacity bin , before it was frozen .
It has since been transferred to one of the company 's coolrooms in Timaru , on New Zealand 's South Island .
It will ultimately end up at the Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa in Wellington , where it will be preserved for scientific study .
Colossal squid were first described in 1925 after two tentacles were found in the stomach of a sperm whale .
The creatures live in an area from Antarctica to the southern extremities of South America , South Africa and New Zealand , a statement from the New Zealand government said .
It said few colossal squid have been sighted , with one was caught in the net of a Russian trawler in the Ross Sea in 1981 , another found near the surface in 2003 , and another near South Georgia Island in the Southern Atlantic ocean on a toothfish longline last year .

The View from Everest
Credit & Copyright : Roddy Mackenzie
Explanation :
What would it be like to stand atop the tallest mountain on Earth ?
To see a full panoramic vista from there , scroll right .
Visible are snow peaked mountains near and far , tremendous cliffs , distant plateaus , the tops of clouds , and a dark blue sky .
Mt. Everest stands 8.85 kilometers above sea level , roughly the maximum height reached by international airplane flights , but much less than the 300 kilometers achieved by a space shuttle .
Hundreds of people have tried and failed to climb the behemoth by foot , a feat first accomplished successfully in 1953 .
About 1000 people have now made it to the summit .
Roddy Mackenzie , who climbed the mountain in 1989 , captured the above image .
Mt. Everest lies in the Himalayan mountains in the country of Nepal .
In the native language of Nepal , the mountain 's name is " Sagarmatha " which means " forehead of the sky . "

Auch die Eidgenossen entzweit eine momentan laufende Urheberrechtsreform , wobei der Rechtsschutz für Systeme zum digitalen Rechtekontrollmanagement ( DRM ) sowie die Zukunft der Vergütungspauschale besonders umstritten sind .
Kern des zweigeteilten Gesetzgebungsverfahrens , das nach der Verabschiedung durch den schweizerischen Bundesrat Mitte März bald vom Parlament beraten werden soll , ist die Umsetzung von zwei Abkommen der Weltorganisation für geistiges Eigentum ( WIPO ) .
Dabei geht es insbesondere um die Einführung eines Verbots der Umgehung von technischen Kopierschutzmaßnahmen und der Entfernung elektronischer Werkinformationen wie digitaler Wasserzeichen .
Generell soll Urhebern das Recht eingeräumt werden , die Erzeugnisse ihres Schaffens auch über das Internet und digitale Medien zugänglich zu machen , ohne dabei ihrer Verfügungsgewalt über die Inhalte verlustig zu gehen .
Ziel der Novelle soll es laut der Begründung ( PDF - Datei ) sein , den technologisch bedingten Änderungen beim Urheberrechtsschutz auch in sozialer und wirtschaftlicher Beziehung Rechnung zu tragen .
Die Revision könne nicht nur auf die Interessen der Rechteinhaber ausgerichtet sein , stellt das Eidgenössische Institut für geistiges Eigentum ( IGE ) klar , das der Bundesrat mit der Ausarbeitung der beiden Vorlagen beauftragt hatte .
So seien etwa nicht nur " die Schutzdefizite zu kompensieren , die dadurch entstehen , dass die Technik immer neue Verwendungsmöglichkeiten hervorbringt " .
Die Reform müsse vielmehr auch Postulate wie das des " Free Flow of Information " berücksichtigen , das zu einem " Credo " der modernen Informationsgesellschaft geworden sei .
Andernfalls würde der Urheberechtsschutz allein als Bedrohung wahrgenommen .
Beim DRM - Schutz versucht der entsprechende Gesetzesentwurf ( PDF - Datei ) die Balance zu halten – der dafür anscheinend notwendige Spagat scheint in der Praxis allerdings schwierig durchzuhalten zu sein .
Einerseits fügt der Entwurf eine Passage ins Schweizer Urheberrechtsgesetz ein , wonach " wirksame technische Maßnahmen zum Schutz von Werken und anderen Schutzobjekten nicht umgangen werden dürfen " .
Darunter fallen sollen " Technologien und Vorrichtungen wie Zugangs - und Kopierkontrollen , Verschlüsselungs - , Verzerrungs - und andere Umwandlungsmechanismen , die dazu bestimmt und geeignet sind , unerlaubte Verwendungen von Werken und anderen Schutzobjekten zu verhindern oder einzuschränken " .
Bei vorsätzlichen Zuwiderhandlungen drohen " Haft oder Busse " .
Gewerbsmäßiges Vorgehen etwa soll mit bis zu einem Jahr Gefängnisstrafe oder einer Geldstrafe bis zu 100.000 Franken belegt werden .
Ähnliche Bestimmungen gibt es auch in Deutschland seit der ersten Novellierung des Urheberrechts ; sie sollen hierzulande auch im so genannten 2 . Korb der Urheberrechtsneuordnung beibehalten werden .
Anders aber als in Deutschland , sollen durch DRM die bestehenden rechtlich abgesegneten Möglichkeiten zum Kopieren für den rein privaten Gebrauch allerdings nicht eingeschränkt werden .
" Das Umgehungsverbot kann gegenüber denjenigen Personen nicht geltend gemacht werden , welche die Umgehung ausschließlich zum Zweck einer gesetzlich erlaubten Verwendung vornehmen " , heißt es im Unterschied zu den deutschen Gesetzestexten explizit in dem Schweizer Entwurf .
Verhilft sich der Verbraucher mit dem Kopierschutzknacken zu seinem eigenen Recht , wäre dies demnach legal .
Für " wissenschaftliche Zwecke " sollen ebenfalls Eingriffe in die technischen Schutzmaßnahmen erlaubt sein .
Gleichwohl wird etwa die Verbreitung oder Bewerbung entsprechender Softwarewerkzeuge ähnlich wie in der deutschen Gesetzgebung verboten .
Die Begründung führt aber dazu aus : Eine Verletzung von Kopierschutztechniken " hat weder zivil - noch strafrechtliche Konsequenzen " , wenn der Eingriff allein erlaubten Vervielfältigungsarten dient .
Wirklich glücklich scheint mit dem vergleichsweise liberalen Vorschlag aber noch niemand zu sein , wie sich am Donnerstag dieser Woche bei einer Anhörung des IGE in Bern zeigte .
Vertreter der Unterhaltungsindustrie forderten dort über ihren Verband AudioVision Schweiz einen Rechtsschutz für Kopierblockaden " nicht nur dem Buchstaben , sondern auch dem Geist der WIPO - Abkommen nach " .
Dafür sei es zentral , " dass die eigenmächtige Umgehung technischer Maßnahmen nicht erlaubt sein darf " .
Christian Laux von der Organisation Openlaw vermisst dagegen " Hilfestellungen " des Gesetzgebers " bei der berechtigten Umgehung " .
Überdies fehlt seiner Ansicht nach eine Klausel zur Sicherung von Interoperabilität in dem Entwurf : Open - Source - Anbieter müssten " zu marktüblichen Konditionen Zugang zu den maßgeblichen Zertifikaten eines DRM - Standards bekommen " .
Andernfalls könnten DRM - Anwender " auch den Einsatz von sekundären Softwareprodukten " kontrollieren und den Wettbewerb behindern .
Die Schweizer Plattform zur Informationsgesellschaft Comunica-ch befürchtet ebenfalls eine " Übergewichtung " technischer Zugangsschranken .
Damit würden " hauptsächlich die Interessen der großen Medien - und Unterhaltungsindustrie bedient " .
Auch die Vereinigung zum Aufbau einer " Digitalen Allmend " sorgt sich , dass die prinzipielle gesetzliche Sanktionierung von DRM " Nutzungsrechte aushöhlt " .
Sie denkt dabei etwa an den Einsatz technischer Schutzmaßnahmen für Werke , " deren Inhalte urheberrechtlich gar nicht mehr geschützt sind " .
Die Bemühung des Bundesrates , eine Fachstelle zur Beobachtung der Folgen von DRM ins Leben zu rufen , halten die Bürgerrechtler angesichts mangelnder Kompetenzen für " ein hilfloses wie fadenscheiniges Unterfangen " .
Nicht weniger umkämpft ist die künftige Erzielung einer angemessenen Vergütung von Urhebern für Privatkopien .
Bislang werden in der Schweiz nur Speichermedien mit einer Pauschalabgabe belegt .
Dazu sollen auch MP3 - Player oder Festplatten zählen , wogegen jedoch noch eine Klage vor dem Bundesgericht läuft .
Die Einführung einer umfassenderen Geräteabgabe etwa auch auf PC , Drucker oder DVD - Player , die der Bundesrat zunächst ins Auge gefasst hatte , ist zumindest im Gesetzesentwurf nach heftigen Protesten der Geräteindustrie vom Tisch .
Verwertungsgesellschaften und der Urheberverband Suisseculture machen sich aber weiter vehement dafür stark .
Für die Gerätepauschale spricht ihrer Ansicht nach vor allem die effizientere Handhabung gegenüber individuellen Abrechnungen .
Nicht zu vergessen sei ferner , dass DRM mit zusätzlichen Hard - und Softwarekosten verbunden sei .

Exposure of melanin to ionizing radiation , and possibly other forms of electromagnetic radiation , changes its electronic properties .
Melanized fungal cells manifested increased growth relative to non-melanized cells after exposure to ionizing radiation , raising intriguing questions about a potential role for melanin in energy capture and utilization .
Ionizing irradiation changed the electron spin resonance ( ESR ) signal of melanin , consistent with changes in electronic structure .
Irradiated melanin manifested a 4 - fold increase in its capacity to reduce NADH relative to non-irradiated melanin .
HPLC analysis of melanin from fungi grown on different substrates revealed chemical complexity , dependence of melanin composition on the growth substrate and possible influence of melanin composition on its interaction with ionizing radiation .
XTT / MTT assays showed increased metabolic activity of melanized C. neoformans cells relative to non-melanized cells , and exposure to ionizing radiation enhanced the electron - transfer properties of melanin in melanized cells .
Melanized Wangiella dermatitidis and Cryptococcus neoformans cells exposed to ionizing radiation approximately 500 times higher than background grew significantly faster as indicated by higher CFUs , more dry weight biomass and 3 - fold greater incorporation of 14 C - acetate than non-irradiated melanized cells or irradiated albino mutants .
In addition , radiation enhanced the growth of melanized Cladosporium sphaerospermum cells under limited nutrients conditions .
Melanin pigments are ubiquitous in nature .
Melanized microorganisms are often the dominating species in certain extreme environments , such as soils contaminated with radionuclides , suggesting that the presence of melanin is beneficial in their life cycle .
We hypothesized that ionizing radiation could change the electronic properties of melanin and might enhance the growth of melanized microorganisms .

Despite the high prevalence of melanotic microorganisms in radioactive environments , it is unlikely that melanin is synthesized solely for the purposes of protection ( shielding ) from ionizing radiation .
For example , in high elevation regions inhabited by melanotic fungi the background radiation levels are approximately 500 – 1,000 higher than at sea level , which amounts to a dose of 0.50 – 1.0 Gy / year .
Since the overwhelming majority of fungi , melanized or not , can withstand doses up to 1.7×10 4 Gy [ 9 ] , there is no apparent requirement for melanin as a radiation protector .
On the other hand , biological pigments play a major role in photosynthesis by converting the energy of light into chemical energy .
Chlorophylls and carotenoids absorb light of certain wavelengths and help convert photonic energy into chemical energy during photosynthesis .
Given that melanins can absorb visible and UV light of all wavelengths [ 16 ] , we hypothesized that exposure to ionizing radiation would change the electronic properties of melanin and affect the growth of melanized microorganisms .
Here we report the results of physico - chemical investigations of melanin electronic properties after radiation exposure and the enhanced growth of melanized fungi under conditions of radiation flux .
The role of melanin in microorganisms living in high electromagnetic radiation fluxes is even more intriguing when the pigment is considered from a paleobiological perspective .
Many fungal fossils appear to be melanized [ 10 ] , [ 11 ] .
Melanized fungal spores are common in the sediment layers of the early Cretaceous period when many species of animals and plants died out which coincides with the Earth 's crossing the “ magnetic zero ” resulting in the loss of its : “ shield ” against cosmic radiation [ 12 ] .
Additionally , radiation from a putative passing star called Nemesis has been suggested as a cause of extinction events [ 13 ] .
The proliferation of melanotic fungi may even have contributed to the mass extinctions at the end of Cretaceous period [ 14 ] .
A symbiotic association of plants and a melanotic fungus that allows for extreme thermotolerance has been attributed to heat dissipating properties of melanin [ 15 ] .
Melanotic fungi inhabit the extraordinarly harsh climate of Antarctica [ 5 ] .
Hence , melanins are ancient pigments that have probably been selected because they enhance the survival of melanized fungi in diverse environments and , perhaps incidentally , in various hosts .
The emergence of melanin as a non-specific bioprotective material may be a result of the relative ease with which these complicated aromatic structures can be synthesized from a great variety of precursors [ 2 ] , [ 4 ] , [ 5 ] , [ 16 ] – [ 23 ] .
The term “ melanin ” originates from melanos - a Greek word for black .
Melanin is a high molecular weight pigment , ubiquitous in nature , with a variety of biological functions [ 1 ] .
Many fungi constitutively synthesize melanin [ 2 ] , which is likely to confer a survival advantage in the environment [ 3 ] by protecting against UV and solar radiation [ reviewed in 4 ] .
Melanized microorganisms inhabit some remarkably extreme environments including high altitude , Arctic and Antarctic regions [ 5 ] .
Most dramatically , melanized fungal species colonize the walls of the highly radioactive damaged reactor at Chernobyl [ 6 ] and surrounding soils [ 7 ] .
These findings , and the laboratory observations of the resistance of melanized fungi to ionizing radiation [ 8 ] , [ 9 ] , suggest a role for this pigment in radioprotection .
Results
Metabolic activity of melanized and non-melanized cells in the presence of electromagnetic radiation
We investigated whether the changes in electron transfer properties of melanin post exposure to ionizing radiation ( high - energy photons , see Table 2 ) may also be observed in melanized cells exposed to ionizing radiation .
The metabolic activity of C. neoformans cells was evaluated with 2,3 - bis ( 2 - methoxy - 4- nitro-5- sulfophenyl ) - 5-[ ( phenylamino ) carbonyl ] - 2H - tetrazolium hydroxide ( XTT assay ) [ 28 ] and 2-( 4,5- dimethyl-2-thiazolyl ) - 3,5 - diphenyl - 2H-tetrazolium bromide ( MTT assay ) .
The use of XTT and MTT assays in parallel can help to define the location of the melanin - mediated electron transfer in the cells since positively charged MTT is taken into the cells via the plasma membrane potential and is reduced intracellularly ; while the negatively charged XTT is largely cell - impermeable and its reduction occurs extracellularly , at the cell surface [ 29 ] .
The melanized and non-melanized C. neoformans cells were exposed to ionizing radiation in the dark at 22 °C overnight .
The irradiation was performed in a constant field of 0.05 m Gy / hr , a non-fungicidal radiation dose that is comparable to the doses inside the Chernobyl reactor [ 6 ] .
Following exposure to radiation , the XTT or MTT reagents were added to the samples and absorbance was measured at 492 or 550 nm , respectively .
The XTT assay showed significant increase in electron - transfer events in the irradiated melanized cells in comparison with non-irradiated melanized or irradiated non-melanized cells ( Fig. 5a ) .
Increased absorbance at 492 nm was also observed for dead ( heat killed ) melanized cells in comparison to non-melanized ones , showing that melanin can reduce XTT reagent by itself ( Fig 5a ) .
Irradiation of dead cells caused significant increase in the XTT reduction , thus confirming our hypothesis that radiation enhances electron - transfer properties of melanin .
In contrast , there was no difference between the irradiated and non-irradiated melanized and non-melanized cells subjected to MTT assay ( Fig. 5 b ) .
The difference between the MTT and XTT assays may be explained by the occurrence of radiation - related melanin - mediated electron transfer events near cell wall where melanin is located that led to higher XTT reduction in irradiated melanized samples .
Interestingly , both irradiated and non-irradiated melanized cells showed higher activity by MTT assay than non-melanized cells ( Fig. 5a , b ) .
Given that melanization is associated with reduced pore size that could reduce passive nutrient uptake [ 25 ] and that melanin is synthesized from highly reactive cytotoxic intermediates of the oxidation of L - Dopa - it is possible that melanization requires a higher metabolism for cell survival .

In another series of experiments , the melanized and non-melanized cells were grown overnight in the dark at room temperature ( 22°C ) or 30°C .
Melanized cells demonstrated increased XTT reduction activity at both temperatures in comparison with non-melanized controls ( Fig. 5 c ) , and increasing the temperature to 30 °C caused a statistically significant increase in XTT reduction in melanized cells ( P< 0.05 ) while a small decrease was observed for non-melanized cells .
Overall , these experiments showed the increase in electron transfer properties of melanin in melanized cells post exposure to ionizing radiation and to less extent - to heat .
Ionizing radiation enhances growth and 14C - acetate uptake of melanized C. neoformans cells
To expand the observations of the influence of irradiated melanin on the growth of melanized cells , we measured the growth of melanized and non-melanized C. neoformans cells supplied with limited nutrients and placed into the radiation flux .
To maintain a steady population of melanized cells , we used the same H99 strain of C. neoformans as in XTT / MTT experiments since it is capable of making melanin when maintained with L - Dopa while its laccase disrupted [ Lac ( - ) ] mutant is incapable of melanization [ 30 ] .
The cells were grown into stationary phase up to 30 hr .
There were significantly more ( P = 0.006 ) CFUs for irradiated melanized wild type H99 samples at 18 , 23 and 30 hr than for non-irradiated samples ( Fig. 6a ) , while the difference in CFUs at 18 hr between irradiated and non-irradiated Lac ( -) mutant was not significant ( Fig. 6 b ) .
Lac (-) without radiation in the presence of L - dopa grows better than wild type H99 ( Fig. 6a and b ) .
There was also a slight increase in the CFU's of irradiated Lac ( -) cells at 23 and 30 hr .
However , the crucial difference between the wild type H99 and Lac ( -) cells is that the exposure to ionizing radiation produced approximately 2.5 times more CFUs in irradiated melanized cells than in non-irradiated melanized controls , while irradiation of Lac ( - ) cells resulted only in a 1.1 - fold increase in CFUs ( Fig. 6e ) .
The dry weight measurements performed at 20 hr showed a consistent and significant 6.5 % increase for irradiated melanized samples ( P = 0.02 ) while there was no difference in weight for the mutant strain after irradiation .
The relatively small yet significant increase in dry weight of the melanized cells is a result of the high percentage of immature cells , with smaller capsules synthesized de novo in the dividing melanized irradiated cell culture .
In this regard , a cell diameter that is one - half to one - third of that for a mature cell results in a 8 - and 26 - fold decrease in cell mass , respectively .
Quantification of whole cell sizes using India ink stained cells showed that proximately 50 % of melanized irradiated cells had volumes 2 times smaller than those in the irradiated Lac ( -) mutant population ( results not shown ) , accounting for the relatively small increase in the dry weight of the melanized H99 samples in comparison to their larger increase in CFUs .

To obtain additional evidence that exposure to ionizing radiation enhanced melanized cell growth , we measured the incorporation of a 14C - labeled carbon source ( acetate ) into melanized and non-melanized C. neoformans cells with and without radiation flux .
In the photosynthesis field the incorporation of 14C - acetate in bacteria subjected to visible light is considered to be indicative of their photoheterotrophic capabilities [ 31 ] .
We measured a lower absolute uptake of 14C - acetate by wild type H99 compared to Lac ( -) cells ( Fig. 6 c , d ) .
There was no incorporation of 14C - acetate into heat killed melanized or non-melanized cells , which excludes the possibility that radiation promoted the passive absorption of 14C - acetate on melanin .
Importantly , when melanized and non-melanized Lac (-) H99 cells were incubated with 14C - acetate with and without radiation – there was almost 3 times more incorporation of 14C - acetate into irradiated melanized cells than into non-irradiated melanized cells , while the ratio of 14C - acetate incorporation into irradiated to non-irradiated Lac ( -) cells was only slightly higher than 1 ( Fig. 6c , d and e ) .
Overall , these results demonstrate that the presence of melanin contributes to the enhancement of cellular growth upon exposure to ionizing radiation in conditions of limited nutrients .

The UK's Highways Agency is investigating the possibility that a new breed of LED cat 's eye might provoke epileptic fits , the BBC reports .
The agency was alerted to the possible problem by Rebecca Jasiczak who says that while driving along a stretch of the A12 near Witham in Essex , she " narrowly avoided a seizure " prompted by the solar - powered cat 's eyes .
The offending devices flash at 100 times a second , which created " a strobe - like effect which nearly triggered an epileptic fit " , according to Jasiczak .
Her dad Martin Jasiczak said : " I 'm very concerned for my daughter 's sake and for other drivers . "
The Highways agency confirmed it wo n't install any more LED cat 's eyes until " the effect on people with epilepsy had been fully evaluated " .
A spokesman said : " We are keen to investigate why this problem has occurred . "
He added that the agency was considering the possibility that " the lights needed to be spaced differently " . ®
The shadowy outlines of a new US strategy towards Iran are exercising diplomats and experts around the Middle East and in the west .
The US says Iranian personnel are training and arming anti-US forces inside Iraq , and it will not hesitate to kill them .
It is sending a second aircraft carrier to the Gulf , doubling its force projection there .
It is calling on Europeans to tighten sanctions on Iran until Tehran suspends its uranium enrichment programme .
Is the US rattling the sabre in advance of an attack on Iran ?
Or is it merely rattling its cage , as it pretends still to be a power in the region in spite of being locked into an unwinnable war in Iraq ?
The only certainty is that Bush 's strategy of calling for democratisation in the Middle East is over .
Washington has had to abandon the neocon dream of turning Iraq into a beacon of secular liberal democracy .
It is no longer pressing for reform in other Arab states .
On her recent trip to Egypt , Jordan , and the Gulf , Condoleezza Rice said little about democracy .
Her pitch was old - fashioned realpolitik as she tried to create a regional counterweight to Iran 's influence .
Gary Sick , a former National Security Council expert , argues that Washington 's return to balance - of - power considerations is designed to create an informal anti-Iranian alliance of the US , Israel and the Sunni Arab states .
The aim is partly to divert attention from the catastrophe of Iraq .
It also reduces Israel 's isolation by suggesting Sunni Arab states have a common interest in confronting Iran , whatever their disagreements over Palestine .
Other American experts argue that Iranian influence should not be confused with Shia influence .
The US blunder in invading Iraq and opening the way for Shia Islamists to control its government created an unexpected opportunity for Iran .
But it does not follow that Shia movements in other Arab states have grown stronger or that the arc of Shia radicalism that King Abdullah of Jordan has talked of is anything more than a figment of his imagination .
The Shia minorities in Kuwait and Saudi Arabia are showing no signs of revolt .
On the contrary , Saudi Shias are reported to be fearful of a backlash from the Sunni majority if sectarian threat - mongering continues .
Highlighting sectarian identities has turned into a galloping cancer in Iraq , and it would be a disaster if the US seeks to export these tensions into the wider Middle East .
Even in Iraq there are limits to Iran 's role .
The eight - year war between the two countries in the 1980s showed that Iraqi Shias put their Arab and Iraqi identity above the religious rituals they share with Iranians .
Moqtada al - Sadr , the cleric who commands one of the main Iraqi militias , frequently boasts of his Iraqi nationalism and the fact that his father , a distinguished ayatollah , remained in opposition in Iraq during the Saddam Hussein years rather than fleeing , as other Iraqi Shia clerics did , to the protection of Tehran or London .
The US claims Iran has increased its subversion in Iraq in recent months .
The US has a record of self - serving and false intelligence on Iraq but , even if true , Iran 's actions cannot make much difference to the problems the US is facing .
The sectarian violence is perpetrated largely by Iraqis on Iraqis .
If outsiders provoke it , they are mainly Sunni jihadis loyal to al - Qaida .
As for attacks on US forces , these come primarily in Sunni areas or the mixed province of Diyala .
Some US officials now hint that Iranians may be involved in these areas too .
Links between Iran and Iraq 's Sunni insurgents would be new , but marginal .
The real purpose of Washington 's heightened talk of Iranian subversion seems to be twofold .
The administration is playing the blame game .
When the " who lost Iraq ? " debate develops in earnest as the presidential election contest hots up , Bush 's people will name its fall guys .
Number one will be the Democrats , for failing to fund the war adequately and allowing the " enemy " to take comfort from the sapping of American will .
Number two will be Iran for its alleged arming of militias and insurgents .
Number three will be Syria for allowing suicide bombers through Damascus airport and into Iraq .
The second purpose of Washington 's anti-Iranian claims , as the former national security adviser Zbigniew Brzezinski recently suggested , is to prepare a case for a US military strike on Iran .
It will be described as defensive , just as the first attacks on North Vietnam two generations ago were falsely said to be an answer to the other side 's aggression .
There could be a third aim : a desire to influence the internal Iranian debate .
A senior US official stated in London this week that the Iranian government was a monolith and " we try to discern differences within the Iranian regime at our peril " .
That may not be the majority view within the administration .
Ratcheting up accusations against Iran 's revolutionary guards who are close to President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad may be a device to make a case for moderates like the former president Hashemi Rafsanjani .
He appears to favour a deal with Washington rather than confrontation .
The safest conclusion is that Washington remains confused about what Iran is doing , and frustrated by its own inability to find allies to support a response .
All options are being prepared , along with their " justifications " .
The International Institute for Strategic Studies ' annual survey rightly pointed out this week that US power is fading .
It can shape an agenda but not implement it globally .
Two stark new events prove that .
One was the meeting between the Saudi and Iranian security chiefs to try to stop Lebanon sliding back into civil war .
This showed Iran can be a force for regional stability , and that Saudi Arabia is resisting US efforts to isolate Tehran .
The other was President Jacques Chirac 's comment that it would not matter if Iran developed a nuclear bomb or two as they could not be used productively .
Described as a gaffe since it broke ranks with Washington , it expressed the views of many Europeans ( as well as the contradiction inherent in the French and British nuclear arsenals ) , since the French president added that the bigger problem was the push for other nations to follow suit .
As Washington 's neocons go into eclipse and the realpolitikers dither , Britain and other European governments need to be far clearer in public than they have so far been .
They should point out that the dispute with Iran is not as monumental as Washington claims .
Fomenting new divisions in the Middle East or resorting to force are cures far worse than the disease .

It 's been a little while since I took a break for ' normal ' css and turned my mind to trivial puzzles so I have now corrected this and produced the above offering .
This is similar to a previous puzzle where you start off at the bottom center and move , according to which paths are made available , in an attempt to get to the middle grassy square .
Stepping off the paths will bring sudden death as you sink into the mud .
This one is a lttle different to the last in that I have made use of my recent discovery that allows non rectangular links so that the paths may be in one , two , three or even four different directions .
The puzzle is possible in a minimum of eleven ' jumps ' .
GOOD LUCK .

I feel bad poo-pooing other people 's work , but I do n't think this approach is a good approach .
A form generation library is a hard library to write .
You have to balance complexity and features .
There are a lot of potential features .
How do you tweak the forms ?
How do you control layout ?
How do you handle repeating form elements ?
How do you handle elements that require Javascript ?
Server - side resources like CSS and Javascript ?
Server - side communication like auto - complete ?
A simple library cannot handle a lot of these .
But very simple forms do n't need form generation libraries .
So a simple library only handles a narrow band of use cases .
A complex library can potentially handle all these cases , but can be difficult to use for the most common cases .
I will assert that as the libraries are usually designed , there is no good balance .
Not all problems have feasible solutions .
Form generation libraries are one such problem , but they do n't seem to be such a problem .
There 's a cycle going on in the library development .
A developer has certain requirements .
Usually they also hate HTML , and may very well be working with an awkward templating language , and maybe they are n't very excited about the task at hand and building a library is a pleasant diversion .
But anyway , they Do The Right Thing ( or so they think ) and try an existing library .
It 's complex , it does n't match the way they think about the problem , the bugs in their code are hard to figure out , and adjusting the things they ( or their boss or client ) cares about is difficult .
And they think " I can do this so much more simply ! "
The developer is kind of right .
They know exactly what they want to do ( now ) , and they can improve their productivity some .
The problem is that no library ends there .
It ca n't end there .
Because someone uses the library , and the code must be maintained .
Form generation is a hard thing to maintain , because it has to be actively maintained .
New fields are added .
New cases and exceptions come into being .
Anything that touches UI can be redefined in weird and unexpected ways .
Good UI is usually eclectic and nonsensical from the perspective of a programmer .
UI should be consistent with the user 's notion of the domain , not the program 's internal modeling of the domain , and it is uncommon that the two really match up .
So you get new requirements over time .
A straight list of checkboxes used to be reasonable , but then the number of options expanded too far and now you need two columns of checkboxes .
So you add in a little bit of code , both in the library and the application , to handle that case .
You want to have a text field that contains its own label when its empty .
The validation becomes increasingly complex .
Maybe you have a multi- screen form , or maybe a form with optional fields , or who knows .
So you add code to the library and the application each time ( if you control both of them ) .
It gets more and more complex while at the same time the developer 's familiarity with the library code becomes more and more remote .
And that 's not even to mention when a non-programmer wants to tweak the HTML , or there is developer turnover , or when you do n't control the library at all ...
It 's a mess .
And so someone comes along and says " I can do this so much more simply ! " and it starts all over again .
The problem domain is wrong .
I think there 's a better approach , but I 'm too lazy to finish it .
So I 'll lay down the design here , with little expectation that anything will happen because of it , but just maybe this will connect with someone .
( Ideally someone who will write code ;)
First , validation : I like how FormEncode works , I think it 's the right model .
Validation completely separate from the rest of the system , and you can programmatically construct the validation so you can embed it in other systems if you want ( and embedding it is probably a good idea ) .
Second : forms .
First , the simplest model : write it in a normal template .
But this is annoying people will cry .
Why ?
Filling in defaults is annoying .
You have to do this little dance : is the value in the request ( e.g. , resubmission ) ?
Then use that .
Is it passed in through some defaults ?
Then use that .
Otherwise ?
Maybe another default , or blank .
Filling in errors is annoying .
Similar dance to defaults .
The < label > tag is somewhat annoying to generate , which is perhaps why many very high - traffic websites still do n't properly do labels .
I suppose the HTML is annoying in general , though it 's only slightly more verbose than the programming code that might replace it .
Javascript can be annoying , and many web developers still are n't comfortable with Javascript .
Getting all the right Javascript and CSS files in place , and linking them up with the appropriate fields is awkward .
Ajax callbacks are really annoying .
Nested and repeating fields compound every other kind of annoying .
It 's hard to reuse any of this .
My response is that these issues can be resolved without form generation libraries .
formencode.htmlfill addresses 1 and 2 .
It 's not perfect , but it 's usable .
Things like WebHelpers can help with 4 .
Neither of these needs to be the implementation , and both could be improved .
But while remaining in their scope they can only be improved a little , which is important .
They will not become endless time sinks .
Unobtrusive Javascript solves 5 quite well .
I think a tool for solving 6 -- the proper inclusion of dependent CSS and Javascript -- could be handy .
I imagine < input type =" date " js- require= " DateInput " > calling some code that figures out where DateInput is ( probably building on something like JSAN package metadata ) and puts the appropriate code in the head of the page .
7 and 8 are addressed quite nicely by the Web Forms 2.0 WHAT - WG specification , and tools building on those models would be excellent .
And once you have all this , I think 9 is much more approachable .
Because you do n't need a framework , you just need stuff that generates blank HTML that also uses a few of these simple conventions .
Notably , these techniques embrace the abstractions HTML and Javascript already allow .
Also , each tool can be useful on its own , and can be used , not used , or reimplemented on its own .
The hard part is that any one tool seems terribly simple and lacking features compared to a form generation framework .
But if slow and steady can win the race it might not matter ; the other form generation frameworks will suffer the churn of the reimplementation cycle while these simpler and duller tools will better stand the test of time .
And even if they do n't , unlike a framework the healthy decoupled set of tools can suffer the failure of one piece ( in design , maintenance , or implementation ) without compromising the entire stack .
Now someone please go build the missing pieces , because I 'm trying really hard not to start more projects .
Has Palestine Been Set Up for Genocide ?
Have Israel - America - EU Set Up Palestine for Genocide ?
By Genevieve Cora Fraser
Conditions are ripe for genocide in Gaza and parts of Palestine .
All funds have been cut off by Israel ( tax money owed to Palestine ) , and by America and the European Union which would normally be routed to the Palestinian Authority ( PA ) .
A significant portion of funds that enter Palestine is through the PA , which is comprised of hundreds of workers who provide the services from garbage collection to police to educational and medical agencies and food distribution networks .
By denying all money to the PA , the infrastructure of Palestine will collapse .
Of course the other agency that supplied vital services to Palestinians was Hamas - distributing $ 80 million dollars worth of food , clothes and medicines and helping to fund the educational institutions for all - Christians and Muslims - within Palestine .
But the West has threatened banks with blocking and impounding funds so even Arab banks are backing away from distributing funds from donors .
Meanwhile Israel has escalated its attacks in the West Banks on population centers , schools and hospitals and Gaza has been sealed off so that few truckloads of food or medicine have been allowed in since January .
Currently medical supplies and drugs are non-existent and food supplies are dwindling or priced so high few can afford a loaf of bread .
Palestinians believed that one of the reasons for the disengagement last year , where 8,000 settlers were removed , was so that Israel could seal its borders and rampage without fear of injuring the Jewish settlers .
Their fears have been realized .
As I write this , Israel is lobbing thousands of missiles and shells into Gaza - by land , by sea , and by air and now the tanks are rumbling in and beginning to assault .
Everything is a target .
They are shelling buildings and factories and even the greenhouses that were to have been part of their future economy .
Men women and children and injured and dying .
Because hospitals no longer have medicines and buildings are subject to attack , doctors are setting up triage centers in tents .
Congress is washing its collective hands of responsibility , claiming they will allow additional humanitarian aid in - however , if the distribution system is destroyed there will be no way to get the food or medicine to the 1.5 million people of Gaza - many of whom live in refugee camps and were suffering from malnutrition before the siege .
Even the United Nations food and medicine distribution is dependent on the PA and Hamas .
Israel claims it must do this because of the militants .
The militants are trying to break the blockade because their families are starving and being denied drugs and medical assistance .
Hamas has kept to the truce established over a year ago whereas Israel now has over 3,000 infractions ( and rising by the minute ) and has killed hundreds in the past year .
Recently Hamas renounced suicide bombings .
What Hamas does state is that they have an internationally guaranteed Right to Resist and an internationally protected Right to Return which is true .
Frankly Hamas is a Resistance organization , not a Terrorist group .
As for recognizing Israel , how can they recognize a country that does not have a constitution and has never defined its borders .
Frankly , what IS Israel ?
Since its inception Israel has broken international laws by not allowing the Palestinians to return or grant them compensation and has continually attempted to expand its borders through war .
Israel continues to grab parts of Palestine on a daily basis - stealing water resources , farm lands and whole sections of cities and towns .
Until Israel complies with international laws and defines its borders back to the green line and tears down the Apartheid Wall which has been condemned under international law , Hamas should not recognize its illegitimate assertions to lands that belong to Palestine not Israel .

The wild tiger now occupies a mere 7 percent of its historic range , and the area known to be inhabited by tigers has declined by 41 percent over the past decade , according to an article published in the June 2007 issue of BioScience .
Growing trade in folk medicines made from tiger parts and tiger skins , along with habitat loss and fragmentation , is believed to be the chief reason for the losses .
The assessment , by Eric Dinerstein of the World Wildlife Fund and 15 coauthors , describes the wild tiger 's population trajectory as " catastrophic " and urges international cooperation to ensure the animal 's continued existence in the wild .
Despite the discouraging numbers -- there are believed to be only about 5,000 wild tigers left -- some conservation programs have been successful .
Dinerstein and his coauthors highlight a program in the Terai - Arc Landscape of northwestern India and southern Nepal as a notable victory .
The scheme features wildlife corridors that connect 12 reserves .
Tiger conservation efforts have also been successful in the Russian Far East .
Many tiger reserves in the India , in contrast , have been mismanaged and have failed to protect the animals , according to the article .
Plans to make use of tiger parts harvested from farmed tigers in China represent an emerging threat , the authors argue .
Any trade in tiger parts encourages poaching , because products made from animals farmed at great expense cannot be distinguished from products made from wild tigers .
Because tigers must be able to roam over large areas , long - term conservation of the species will need planning that involves religious and civic leaders as well as national and local governments .
International cooperation among nations that harbor the animal will also be essential .
Dinerstein and his coauthors conclude by recommending that these countries appoint " tiger ambassadors " to advocate for the species , step up efforts to prosecute poachers , and provide economic incentives to encourage conservation .

Five years after 9/11 , the U.S. public is considerably less enthusiastic about projecting military power abroad , according to a major new survey , the first of a spate of polls that are likely to released in the run-up to Monday ’s fifth anniversary of the attacks on New York and the Pentagon .
The survey , conducted by the Pew Research Center for the People and the Press here , found that Republicans remained substantially more supportive of military deployments overseas than both Democrats and independents who also believe  by a three to one margin  that the U.S. has lost respect in the world over the last few years .
The survey of more than 1,500 randomly selected adults also found that nearly half ( 46 percent ) of the respondents consider U.S. support for Israel a " major reason " for the rise in anti-U.S. sentiment around the world , a significant increase since Pew last posed the question 10 months ago .
Significantly , that view was held by similar percentages of self - described Republicans and Democrats who , on most other foreign policy questions , showed wide partisan differences .
The survey , however , was conducted Aug. 9 - 13 , just before the cease - fire that ended the month - long war between Israel and Hezbollah , when international pressure on Washington to persuade the Jewish state to stop its bombing campaign in Lebanon was at its height .
Publication of the Pew survey coincided with the release of a second poll released Wednesday by CNN which found widespread skepticism over claims by the administration of President George W. Bush that the U.S. is making progress in the war on Iraq and that the war is related to the larger " global war on terrorism " launched after 9/11 .
Only one in four respondents in that poll , which was conducted Aug. 30 to Sept. 2 , thought that Washington and its allies were winning the war , compared to 13 percent who said the insurgents were winning and 62 percent who said that the war was essentially stalemated .
Despite repeated and increasingly frequent assertions by Bush that the war in Iraq has become the " central front " in the war on terrorism , a majority of 53 percent said it was " an entirely separate military action . "
A larger majority of 58 percent said they opposed the war , compared to 39 percent who said they favored it  a margin that has not changed substantially over recent months .
The most interesting finding of the latest Pew poll appeared to be the growing public disillusionment with U.S. military intervention .
By a 45 percent to 32 percent margin , respondents said they believed that the most effective way to reduce the threat of terrorist attacks on the U.S. is to " decrease " rather than " increase " Washington ’s military presence abroad .
As noted in an accompanying analysis by the Pew Center , that finding marks a " stark reversal " from the public ’s position on the first anniversary of the 9/11 attacks .
At that time , a plurality of 48 percent of the public said expanding U.S. military deployments overseas was the best way to protect against future attacks , while 29 percent called for reducing such commitments .
Similarly , according to the new survey , 43 percent of respondents today say they believed that " military strikes " against nations that were trying to develop nuclear weapons was a very important way to reduce future terrorism  a reduction of 15 percent compared to a Pew survey taken in October 2002 when Bush was trying to win congressional approval for a resolution authorizing him to take military action against Iraq .
The new survey also suggested a more general desire to reduce U.S. involvement in the Middle East compared to four years ago .
Asked to identify what would be a " very important " step in reducing terrorism , attacking nuclear facilities was rated the highest ( 58 percent ) in a group of five options .
It was followed by increasing defense spending and decreasing dependence on Mideast oil ( 53 percent ) and " not get [ ting ] involved in other countries ’ problems " ( 32 percent ) .
In the most recent poll , however , attacking nuclear facilities ranked third , far behind decreasing dependence on Mideast oil ( 67 percent ) and increasing defense spending ( 52 percent ) , and just two points ahead of the noninvolvement option , which rose ( 41 percent ) .
The increase in what some would describe as " isolationist " sentiment echoed a similar finding in another poll conducted by Pew and the Council on Foreign Relations in November 2005 .
Forty - two percent of respondents said they believed Washington should " mind its own business internationally and let other countries get along the best they can on their own , " compared to only 30 percent who took that position in December 2002 .
Democrats and independents account for much of these changes .
In the summer of 2002 , for example , Democrats by an eight - point margin favored an increased military presence overseas .
They now favor by a diminished presence by a nearly three - to - one margin ..
Support for a decreased military presence among independents has also dropped sharply , by some 17 percentage points , to a 49 percent plurality .
On the question of why the U.S. has lost support around the world , more than two - thirds of respondents identified a " major reason " as the Iraq war , 58 percent cited " America ’s wealth and power " ; 49 percent , " the U.S. - led war on terror " ; and 46 percent , " U.S. support for Israel . "
Democrats were significantly more likely than Republicans to cite the Iraq war and the war on terrorism , while Republicans were more likely to cite " America ’s wealth and power . "
The survey also found a gradual increase in the view that the 9/11 attacks signified the beginning of a major conflict between the West and the Islamic world .
In October 2001 , for example , only 28 percent of respondents agreed with that view ; in August 2002 , 35 percent expressed agreement , and , in the most recent poll , 40 percent took that position .
Conversely , the percentage of those who agreed with the proposition that 9/11 represented only a conflict with a " small , radical group " has fallen from 63 percent to 49 percent over the same five - year period .
Still , 47 percent of respondents today said that 9/11 attacks were equal in seriousness to the 1941 Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor , Hawaii , that launched the U.S. into World War II , while 35 percent said they were " more serious . "
Younger respondents , however , were significantly more likely to say they were " more serious " than older respondents .

The $ 67 Million Pants Lawyer suing the pants off a dry cleaner for lost trousers .
May 2 , 2007  --
Is somebody getting taken to the cleaners ?
A $ 10 dry cleaning bill for a pair of trousers has ballooned into a $ 67 million civil lawsuit .
Plaintiff Roy Pearson , a judge in Washington , D.C. , says in court papers that he 's been through the ringer over a lost pair of prized pants he wanted to wear on his first day on the bench .
He says in court papers that he has endured " mental suffering , inconvenience and discomfort . "
He says he was unable to wear that favorite suit on his first day of work .
He 's suing for 10 years of weekend car rentals so he can transport his dry cleaning to another store .
The lawsuit is based in large part on Pearson 's seemingly pained admission that he was taken in by the oldest and most insidious marketing tool in the dry cleaning industry arsenal .
" Satisfaction Guaranteed . "
Pearson did not return numerous calls from ABC News for comment .
It 's the kind of lawsuit that makes liability reform advocates ' temples throb .
" People in America are now scared of each other , " legal expert Philip Howard told ABC News ' Law & Justice Unit .
" That 's why teachers wo n't put an arm around a crying child , and doctors order unnecessary tests , and ministers wo n't meet with parishioners .
It 's a distrust of justice and it's changing our culture . "
The civil trial , set for June , has the scope of a John Grisham courtroom thriller and the societal importance of a traffic ticket .
Pearson plans to call 63 witnesses .
Defending themselves against the suit -- for two years running -- are Korean immigrants Jin and Soo Chung and their son , who own Custom Cleaners and two other dry cleaning shops in the Fort Lincoln section of Washington , D.C .
The ABC News Law & Justice Unit has calculated that for $ 67 million Pearson could buy 83,750 new pairs of pants at the $ 800 value he placed on the missing trousers in court documents .
Fort Lincoln neighbors are enjoying what they consider the comedy of it all .
" The whole city is aware of this lawsuit , " said Bob King , who represents Fort Lincoln on the Advisory Neighborhood Commissions .
" Everybody 's laughing about it . "
Everybody except the Chungs , who have spent thousands of dollars defending themselves against Pearson 's lawsuit .
" It 's not humorous , not funny and nobody would have thought that something like this would have happened , " Soo Chung told ABC News through an interpreter .
Her husband agreed .
" It 's affecting us first of all financially , because of all the lawyers ' fees , " Jin Chung said .
" For two years , we 've been paying lawyer fees . …
We 've gotten bad credit as well , and secondly , it 's been difficult mentally and physically because of the level of stress . "
Later , Soo Chung broke down in tears .
" I would have never thought it would have dragged on this long , " she told ABC News .
" I do n't want to live here anymore .
It 's been so difficult .
I just want to go home , go back to Korea . "
" I 've been in the dry cleaning business for 14 years , but this has never ever happened before .
If anything happened to our customers ' clothing , we would always compensate them accordingly and fairly , " Jin Chung said through a translator .
The problems date back to 2002 .
Pearson says in court papers that he took a pair of pants into Custom Cleaners in Fort Lincoln that year , and the pants were lost .
So Jin and Soo Chung gave Pearson a $ 150 check for a new pair of pants .
Three years later , Pearson says he returned to Custom Cleaners and -- like some real - life " Groundhog Day " nightmare -- his trousers went missing .
Again .
It was May 2005 and Pearson was about to begin his new job as an administrative judge .
Naturally , he wanted to wear a nice outfit to his first day of work .
He said in court papers that he tried on five Hickey Freeman suits from his closet , but found them all to be " too tight , " according to the Washington Post .
He brought one pair in for alterations and they went missing -- gray trousers with what Pearson described in court papers as blue and red stripes on them .
First , Pearson demanded $ 1,150 for a new suit .
Lawyers were hired , legal wrangling ensued and eventually the Chungs offered Pearson $ 3,000 in compensation .
No dice .
Then they offered him $ 4,600 .
No dice .
Finally , they offered $ 12,000 for the missing gray trousers with the red and blue stripes .
Pearson said no .
With neither satisfaction nor his prized gray pants , Pearson upped the ante considerably .
The judge went to the lawbooks .
Citing the District of Columbia 's consumer protection laws , he claims he is entitled to $ 1,500 per violation .
Per day .
What follows is the beginning of thousands of pages of legal documents and correspondence that , two years later , have led to a massive civil lawsuit in the amount of $ 67 million .
According to court papers , here 's how Pearson calculates the damages and legal fees :
He believes he is entitled to $ 1,500 for each violation , each day during which the " Satisfaction Guaranteed " sign and another sign promising " Same Day Service " was up in the store -- more than 1,200 days .
And he 's multiplying each violation by three because he 's suing Jin and Soo Chung and their son .
He also wants $ 500,000 in emotional damages and $ 542 , 500 in legal fees , even though he is representing himself in court .
He wants $ 15,000 for 10 years ' worth of weekend car rentals as well .
After enlisting neighbors and fellow customers , he sought to expand the case into a class action suit , but was denied , angrily , by District of Columbia Civil Judge Neal Kravitz .
" The Court has significant concerns that the plaintiff is acting in bad faith and with an intent to delay the proceedings , " the judge wrote in court papers .
" Indeed , it is difficult to draw any other conclusion , given the plaintiff 's lengthy delay in seeking to expand the scope of the case , the breathtaking magnitude of the expansion he seeks , his failure to present any evidence in support of the thousands of claims he says he wishes to add , and his misrepresentation concerning the scope of his first amended complaint . "
The case will now be heard by another judge in June .
Both Kravitz and the new judge declined to comment on the case to ABC News .
Ironically , less than a week after Pearson dropped off the missing trousers in 2005 , Soo Chung found them , she says .
She tried to return them to Pearson but he said they were the wrong pants .
The Chungs say they are certain they have located the missing trousers .
" So these are the missing pants , huh ? " Avila asked the Chungs ' attorney , Chris Manning .
" These are , " Manning said , holding up a flimsy pair of gray trousers .
Manning 's argument is based on both the receipt and the telltale " three belt loop situation , " as he explains it .
" When the pants were brought in , Mrs. Chung noticed the three belt loop situation and in finding them realized that they were Mr. Pearson 's pants based on that . "
He also said the receipt tag on the pants " exactly matches the receipt that Mr. Pearson has . "
Manning is angry with Pearson , saying the judge has terrorized the Chungs for spite .
" They came to the United States hoping for the American dream , " Manning said , " and Roy Pearson has made it a nightmare . "
Late last year , a little book called “ Mindless Eating ” started appearing in bookstores .
It was written by Brian Wansink , a Cornell professor who has spent his career doing brilliantly mischievous experiments about the psychology of eating .
In one of my favorites , Mr. Wansink gave away five - day - old popcorn — “ stale enough to squeak when it was eaten , ” he wrote — to moviegoers one day at a theater in the Chicago suburbs .
The crux of the experiment lay in the size of the buckets that held the popcorn .
Some people got merely big buckets , while others received truly enormous ones .
Both sizes held more popcorn than a typical person could finish .
Yet when the Wansink research team weighed the buckets after the movie , there was a huge difference in the amounts the two groups ate .
Those with the bigger buckets inhaled 53 percent more on average , suggesting that a lot of stale popcorn is somehow more appealing than a little stale popcorn .
Over the years , Mr. Wansink has done similar experiments with everything from different - size dinner plates to bottomless bowls of tomato soup that are secretly connected to a tube underneath a restaurant table .
His overarching conclusion is that our decisions about eating often have little to do with how hungry we are .
Instead , we rely on cues like the size of a popcorn bucket — or the way we organize our refrigerator — to tell us how much to eat .
These cues can add 200 calories a day to our diet , but the only way we ’ll notice we are overeating is that our pants will eventually get too tight .

Israel may have violated an agreement with Washington by using American - made cluster bombs during last summer 's war with Hezbollah guerrillas in Lebanon , the U.S. State Department said Monday .
White House spokesperson Sean McCormack said a preliminary report on an American probe into the issue has been handed to Congress , but did n't provide further details on the investigation .
" There were likely violations , " McCormack told reporters .
The probe was opened in 2006 after UN reports that three types of American cluster bombs were found in populated areas in southern Lebanon .
Cluster bombs release smaller bomblets that spread out on the ground .
The report , McCormack said , " is not a final judgment . "
He declined to speculate on what action may be taken against Israel if a violation is confirmed .
When Israel purchases cluster bombs and other lethal equipment from the United States , it must agree in writing to restrictions on their use , including using them in civilian areas .
The Israeli army has said all weapons it uses " are legal under international law and their use conforms with international standards . "
The UN has called for a freeze on their use in or near populated areas .

Why the President Would Deny Our Troops the Resources They Need

Date Tue , 12 Jun 2007 08:45:46 - 0700 ( PDT ) From Linus Torvalds <> Subject Re : Dual - Licensing Linux Kernel with GPL V2 and GPL V3

Umm .
You are making the fundamental mistake of thinking that Sun is in
this to actually further some open - source agenda .
Here 's a cynical prediction ( but backed up by past behaviour of Sun ) :
- first off : they may be talking a lot more than they are or ever will
be doing .
How many announcements about Sun and Linux have you seen over
the years ?
And how much of that has actually happened ?
- They may like open source , but Linux _has_ hurt them in the
marketplace .
A lot .
They almost used to own the chip design market , and it took quite a
long time before the big EDA vendors ported to Linux ( and x86- 64 in
particular ) .
But when they did , their chip design market just basically
disappeared : sparc performance is so horribly bad ( especially on a
workstation kind of setup ) , that to do chip design on them is just
idiotic .
Which is not to say that there are n't holdouts , but let 's face
it , for a lot of things , Solaris is simply the wrong choice these days .
Ergo : they sure as hell do n't want to help Linux .
Which is fine .
Competition is good .
- So they want to use Linux resources ( _especially_ drivers ) , but they do
* not * want to give anything back ( especially ZFS , which seems to be one
of their very very few bright spots ) .
- Ergo : they 'll not be releasing ZFS and the other things that people are
drooling about in a way that lets Linux use them on an equal footing .
I
can pretty much guarantee that .
They do n't like competition on that
level .
They'd * much * rather take our drivers and _not_ give anythign
back , or give back the stuff that does n't matter ( like core Solaris :
who are you kidding - Linux code is _better_ ) .
End result :
- they 'll talk about it .
They not only drool after our drivers , they
drool after all the _people_ who write drivers .
They 'd love to get
kernel developers from Linux , they see that we have a huge amount of
really talented people .
So they want to talk things up , and the more
" open source " they can position themselves , the better .
- They may release the uninteresting parts under some fine license .
See
the OpenSolaris stuff - instead of being blinded by the code they _did_
release under an open source license , ask yourself what they did * not *
end up releasing .
Ask yourself why the open source parts are not ready
to bootstrap a competitive system , or why they are released under
licenses that Sun can make sure they control .
So the _last_ thing they want to do is to release the interesting stuff
under GPLv2 ( quite frankly , I think the only really interesting thing they
have is ZFS , and even there , I suspect we'd be better off talking to
NetApp , and seeing if they are interested in releasing WAFL for Linux ) .
Yes , they finally released Java under GPLv2 , and they should be commended
for that .
But you should also ask yourself why , and why it took so long .
Maybe it had something to do with the fact that other Java implementations
started being more and more relevant ?
Am I cynical ?
Yes .
Do I expect people to act in their own interests ?
Hell
yes !
That 's how things are _supposed_ to happen .
I 'm not at all berating
Sun , what I 'm trying to do here is to wake people up who seem to be living
in some dream - world where Sun wants to help people .
So to Sun , a GPLv3 - only release would actually let them look good , and
still keep Linux from taking their interesting parts , and would allow them
to take at least parts of Linux without giving anything back ( ahh , the
joys of license fragmentation ) .
Of course , they know that .
And yes , maybe ZFS is worthwhile enough that
I 'm willing to go to the effort of trying to relicense the kernel .
But
quite frankly , I can almost guarantee that Sun wo n't release ZFS under the
GPLv3 even if they release other parts .
Because if they did , they 'd lose
the patent protection .
And yes , I 'm cynical , and yes , I hope I 'm wrong .
And if I 'm wrong , I'll
very happily retract anything cynical I said about Sun .
They _have_ done
great things , and maybe I 'm just too pessimistic about all the history
I 've seen of Sun with open source .
The _good_ news is that Jonathan Schwartz actually does seem to have made
a difference , and I hope to God he is really as serious about
open - sourcing things as he says he is .
And do n't get me wrong : I think a
truly open - source GPLv3 Solaris would be a really really _good_ thing ,
even if it does end up being a one - way street as far as code is concerned !

Greylisting ( or graylisting ) is a new anti-spam measure implemented on email servers .
It 's starting to become more widespread , and if you do n't run your own email server , your service might be greylisting ( or might add it soon ) without your knowledge or permission .
It has the potential to destroy a fundamental function of email in a futile attempt for service providers to save money , yet nobody knows about it .
It 's very , very annoying .
Much more annoying than spam .
What is greylisting ?
Email servers work by accepting messages , figuring out where they need to go , and sending them along their way ( or to another intermediate server ) until they reach the destination .
It was designed to be robust and accommodate unreliable servers , so if a destination server is n't available or temporarily refuses to accept a message , the sending server will try again later .
It 's like getting a package delivered when there 's nobody home to accept it : the delivery guy tries to deliver it for a few days before assuming you 're dead and returning it to the sender .
Greylisting tricks the sending servers into an intentional delay : for every incoming message , a greylisting mail server says " I 'm too busy - try again soon ! "
It 's not too busy - it just inserts this intentional delay to see if the sending server will try again .
Then it accepts the message if the sending server retries after a minimum delay ( usually a few minutes ) .
Theory
Greylisting is supposed to reduce spam .
Supposedly , spam - sending email software wo n't properly accept the " I 'm too busy " messages and try again later , as requested — instead , it will assume that the message 's recipient is not a valid email address , and remove it from further spam attempts .
This is n't to reduce the amount of spam that gets to the users — it's to reduce the amount of spam that the server 's spam - filtering software needs to analyze ( which can be very resource - intensive for a busy server ) .
This is why it's in your email provider 's best interest to implement greylisting : they can save money on servers .
Reality
It does n't work .
Plenty of spam still gets through .
What 's stopping the spam - sending servers from properly obeying the delay and sending the message again ?
Spammers have found ways around almost everything we 've come up with .
Why does anyone think they wo n't be able to figure this out ?
We do n't need it .
Modern spam filtering is highly sophisticated and extremely accurate .
Greylisting does nothing to detect spam : it only slightly delays spam delivery .
But that 's not the worst part .
If it did n't affect my life as an email user , I would n't care enough to write this article .
The worst part is that email is no longer instant .
In some cases , it 's not even close .
The email - delivery protocol ( SMTP ) does n't have a standard way for greylisting servers to tell sending servers when to try again .
Some wait 15 minutes , some wait an hour , and some wait a day .
This means that if your email provider uses greylisting , there 's no guarantee that a message will get to you in a reasonable amount of time .
So what happens ?
You can't email someone a link or text blob for their immediate use ( like if they 're in the same office ) .
You can't email something to someone as you 're on the phone with them for collaboration .
Websites can't use email activation to reduce spam or verify correct contact information .
I 've frequently seen 24 - hour delivery delays on greylisted emails .
On the internet , that 's an eternity .
You might as well use paper .
Greylisting destroys email as an instant communication medium .
Spam reduces the efficiency of reading email , but greylisting removes much of its legitimate use completely .
At least spam filters only prevent me from talking to my friends about taking viagra while refinancing my mortgage with the cash I made at home by investing in diet - pill stocks .
I 'd rather get more spam .

Digg this story .
Update : Response to comments
It tells me a lot that the huge influx of comment authors ( trolls from Reddit ) who argue for greylisting are predominantly server administrators who have enabled it for their users .
Their users have been suspiciously absent from this discussion , probably because they have no idea why it takes forever to get their email .
They chalk it up to another random disappointment with computers , or " the network " being slow , or various other mythical computer problems .
In the case of account - activation emails from websites , they email the website operator to find out why their activation email has n't yet arrived after 10 minutes .
How do I know this ?
Because I administer some big sites that have this problem , and I get the " bug " reports when users complain that the emails are n't being sent .
Every time , I find the section of the mail log for their email address , and 75 % of the time , it 's the recipient 's greylisting that 's delaying mail from a very legitimate , fully compliant Postfix server hosted in a major datacenter .
( Most of the remaining 25 % are email address typos . )
They do n't know that the problem is on their end , and was probably imposed by a short - sighted ( or simply cheap ) server administrator .
They , like me , expect email to arrive within a minute , and assume that if it has n't arrived by then , there 's something wrong .
There 's no technological limitation to prevent most messages from being delivered within 10 seconds .
Greylisting can be configured to be slightly less annoying by having a generous whitelist ( a list of senders whose messages are n't delayed ) , or by only delaying suspected - spam IP ranges such as broadband home users or most of Russia .
But this still imposes the delay on a lot of legitimate email ( at least one message from every sender ) , and most importantly , it relies too much on the server administrators to get things exactly right .
There are a lot of good server administrators out there , but like any job , the majority of them are mediocre at best .
The administrators at FastMail , for example , never whitelisted the Marco.org server , despite repeated conversations in which I informed them that Rackspace is not a dial - up ISP and should therefore be eligible for their IP whitelist .
( Yes , Rackspace .
I was dumbfounded .
A sysadmin who 's never heard of Rackspace is like a mechanic who 's never heard of Ferrari . )
Rackspace servers still never get whitelisted by FastMail 's greylisting , so every message is delayed regardless of the sender 's history .
Many readers criticized me for my high expectations of email , claiming that I should use instant messaging for communication intended for rapid delivery .
This does n't really work either :
Both parties must be members of the same IM networks .
Each party must know the other 's screen name .
This requirement renders IMs useless for websites trying to validate their users .
Both parties must be running their IM clients , and must be signed in at that moment .
I work with a lot of people with laptops who travel through various networks every day , so this just is n't realistic .
Any laptop user will understand .
Ever try sending a file through IM ?
By the time you figure out how to get through the NAT on both ends , a greylisted email may have arrived .
IMs only work gracefully when the recipient is one person .
We already have a near - instantaneous communication protocol with minimal requirements on either end that 's very tolerant of NAT and irregular connectivity , accessible by everyone running any software on any platform .
It 's called email .
Stop ruining it .
This has been a big year for so many people across many fields , but in the field of religion , ethics and ideas , this is one man 's year .
Like him or loathe him , people are talking about him and his ideas .
We recognise Richard Dawkins , the Charles Simonyi Professor of the Public Understanding of Science at Oxford University , as our Person of the Year 2006 .
This year also marks the 30th anniversary of the publication of his book The Selfish Gene .
To some he 's " Darwin's rottweiller " ( echoing TH Huxley 's nickname , " Darwin's bulldog " ) ; to others he 's " A Devil 's Chaplain " ( Darwin 's phrase , now the title of one of Dawkins 's books ) .
You have voted overwhelmingly for Dawkins , and for many conflicting reasons :
For being everywhere this year , with the publication of his global bestseller , The God Delusion .
For proving that scientists can still change the way people think .
For writing a book ( The God Delusion ) which enabled Terry Eagleton to write the most negative review ever published .
For thinking clearly in a world that does n't much value clear thinking anymore .
For saying what he thinks .
For defending the delusion that science and religious faith are incompatible .
For creating the Richard Dawkins Foundation for Reason & Science .
For writing the most overrated book of the year ( in the judgment of Prospect magazine ) .
For making people talk about the dangers of religious fundamentalism .
For lobbying atheism and humanism into the headlines more than anyone else has done before .
For being the face of science on television across the western world .
For not having been given an honour by the Queen , while being a recipient of the Medal of the Presidency of the Italian Republic and many scientific and literary prizes .
For marrying the actress who played Romana in Doctor Who .
For raising questions that need to be answered by any intelligent religious believer wishing to develop a coherent worldview .
For being a scientific fundamentalist and the worst advert for atheism currently doing a book tour .
For raising a debate about the nature of " science " and how future generations of schoolchildren should be pretected from " pseudo - science " .
For being rude and getting away with it .
For these , and many other reasons , Richard Dawkins is our Person of the Year 2006 .
It 's no secret that science is popular these days .
I can't pick up a magazine or a newspaper without seeing an article dealing with science and how it impacts society .
Global warming pieces are everywhere with scientists arguing about its causes or even if it exists .
Some scientists argue about framing the debate for non-scientists while others think science is too important to be left up to people .
I read some politicians and they think they can fix every problem with regulation and laws .
I read some scientists and they think they can fix every problem with funding .
This is n't a politics site so let 's talk about this notion that throwing money at science invariably leads to results .
Every time this argument comes up I get presented with the same example : President Kennedy 's endorsement of putting a man on the moon .
This and the Manhattan Project in World War II are the two obvious instances where the government , representing society , made a commitment and a timeframe and put up the money to make it happen .
And they were both successful .
But does science really work that way ?
Can we have science on demand and just keeping adding people until we get the results we want ?
If so , let 's cure that cancer stuff .
Too many scientists are playing the funding card as well .
If we cost business trillions of dollars in punitive emissions caps and spend the same amount on grants and global warming does n't get solved , scientists are going to take the blame .
The history of science is first and foremost about failure - not monumental , budget - shattering failures , but rather small failures that are reconfigured and test time and again .
Sometimes failures never become successes .
Do kids earn about the Thor WS - 117L rocket in school ?
Not in any history course I ever took .
But
Thor might easily have replaced the Atlas rocket in those early days of the space capsules so it was an important failure .
Coca - Cola , Penicillin , rubber - all failures and not a single one financed by government directive .
The frontiers of future technology are filled with failure , frustration and doubt .
In many cases we do n't even know today what we will need to research in the future .
If political parties and changes in government dictate what we work on and how much gets spent , science becomes another arm of politics .
Making the government and its funding the responsible party for scientific achievement eliminates the many opportunities that small , poorly funded ventures can achieve dramatic things .
The next time you hear someone saying that science can cure it all if given enough funding , reach for their rose - colored glasses .
The next time you hear a government say they can legislate scientific achievement , reach for your wallet .
The insect has been quickly breeding - and sucking blood - along the rivers and reservoirs of Catalonia and Aragon , causing alarm in small towns .
Only two to three millimetres long , the fly is much smaller and harder to spot than most mosquitoes , but its voracious bite sent more than 2,000 people to hospital last year in Catalonia alone .
Its vigorous jaw , which releases a cocktail of chemicals , can produce allergic reactions .
" If the mosquito is a neurosurgeon that bites with a probe , the black fly is a butcher that scratches the skin and makes you bleed , " Raul Escosa , member of an Ebro river environmental board , told El Pais .
" We had to take my 18 - year - old daughter to the dermatologist and the allergist because she had a dozen swellings of eight to 10 centimetres , " said Jesus Llop , a town council member in the town of Mequinenza .
The black fly , an umbrella term for several Simulium species , was first detected in the region in 1997 , and it has been making its annoying presence increasingly felt .
Unlike the mosquito , it breeds in clean river water .
Regional experts believe the current outbreak stems from improvements in water quality and new irrigation channels , which created a new habitat .
The insect injects an anaesthetic , an anti-clotting agent and a vasodilator into the skin of its host , who belatedly notices the damage after the fly has moved on .

Are psychedelics useful in the practice of Buddhism ? by Myron J , Stolaroff Journal of Humanistic Psychology Vol. 39 No. 1 Winter 1999 Pp. 60 - 80 Copyright by Journal of Humanistic Psychology
Summary
In the fall of 1996 issue of the Buddhist magazine Tricycle , various teachers of Buddhist meditation practice commented on the value of psychedelic experiences , with opinions of them ranging from helpful to harmful .
Here , the author hopes to explain these conflicting viewpoints by describing important aspects of employing psychedelics that must be taken into account for effective results .
These embrace proper methodology , which includes set and setting , dose levels , appropriate substances , appropriate intervals , and proper integration of each experience .
The author has found the informed use of psychedelics to be a valuable tool in accelerating proficiency and deepening meditative practice and offers recommendations for successful use .
The adverse comments of several recognized teachers are evaluated to shed further light on fruitful application of psychedelic substances .
The Buddhist magazine Tricycle devoted its fall of 1996 issue to the topic of psychedelics and Buddhism .
The viewpoints of the authors regarding the efficacy of psychedelics on Buddhist practice ranged from a high degree of support to outright opposition .
Those who are interested in the possible application of psychedelics to meditative practice might well be puzzled by such a diversity of viewpoints .
Yet , the answer is simple .
Psychedelics can be used in a great variety of ways for an enormous array of purposes .
The results depend greatly on the experience , knowledge , skill , and level of development of the practitioner .
Thus , the person presenting his and / or her own particular point of view may or may not be aware of numerous other considerations involved .
Widespread unfavorable public bias toward psychedelics has been created by very selective reporting by the media , as observed by Walsh ( 1982 ) .
As Walsh reports , this bias is so unfavorable that a reputable journal refused to accept an article that indicated some beneficial outcomes from the use of psychedelics unless the reference to positive effects was removed .
I hope to shed some light on the diversity of viewpoints by first laying out what I consider to be important factors to take into account in effectively employing psychedelics .
From this perspective , we can examine some of the more relevant comments that have been expressed .
Psychedelic agents , when properly understood , are probably one of the most valuable , useful , and powerful tools available to humanity .
Yet , their use is extremely complex , which means that they are widely misunderstood and very olden abused .
Let me be clear :
It is not psychedelics that are complex .
In their most useful application , they play a rather straightforward role .
After 40 years of careful study , it is my observation that one of the outstanding actions of psychedelics is permitting the dissolving of mind sets .
One of the most powerful mind set humans employ is the hiding of undesirable material from consciousness .
Thus , a very important function of psychedelic substances is to permit access to the unconscious mind .
The unconscious mind is enormously complex and possesses an extremely wide range of attributes , from repressed , painful material to the sublime realization of universal love .
We probably shall never cease to discover new aspects and dimensions of the mind , as it appears endless , and I am convinced that continual searching will reveal new discoveries .
Probably every hypothesis that any scientist , therapist , or mystic has conceived ultimately can be observed to fit some set of conditions , from psychological dynamics to the ultimate nature of the universe .
One of the most remarkable things to the experienced psychedelic user is discovering how the boundaries of perception dissolve to permit viewing ever new images , perceptions , concepts , and realizations .
The biggest problem lies in incorporating discoveries into meaningful , enhanced functioning in life .
Humans love structure , and at the same time , the ego loves certainty , so a great variety of claims often are made about what psychedelics can or cannot do .
With integrity , commitment , and courage , vast aspects of the mind can be explored .
It is important to realize that what one experiences depends a great deal on his / her value - belief system , motivation , conditioning , and accumulated unconscious content , which includes the rigidity with which the mind functions .
I am an early stage novice in my practice of Buddhism , so there is a great deal about the subject of which I am ignorant .
However , I have had considerable experience with psychedelics , and my major concern is that there will be attempts to categorize these potent aids and contain them within the walls of narrow , judgmental decisions , thereby cutting off much potential usefulness .
I personally have found that appropriately understood and used , psychedelics can play a significant role in deepening and accelerating the progress of one 's meditative practice .
This is not true for everyone .
Psychedelics are of little use for advanced practitioners who have learned to achieve results without the benefit of such aids or for those who can free themselves from worldly obligations for extensive daily practice .
Also , encountering heavily defended areas in the psyche with psychedelics may produce intense , uncomfortable feelings that many may prefer to work through more gradually .
My concern is mostly for the large number of people who could benefit from fruitful meditation practice but must still be occupied in the world by earning a living and raising a family .
Such persons lead busy lives and may not have the time to devote to perfecting a practice that will lead to significant freedom .
For these , informed use of psychedelics can be quite helpful in more rapidly reaching the level of accomplishment at which practice becomes self - sustaining .
The ultimate achievement of liberation must occur through interior development that does not depend on the use of a plant or a chemical , although these may help in discovering the way .
There are several key factors to consider in evaluating whether the use of psychedelics can be personally fruitful .
1 . Legal status .
In a sense , this discussion is hypothetical because now most psychedelics are illegal to possess in the United States .
Westerners for several centuries have focused primarily on the outer world , with the resulting neglect of developing inner resources .
This neglect , coupled with a heavy emphasis on materialism and reductionism , has created a painful schism between adopted conscious values and the deep interests of the Self .
For most people , it has become so painful to reveal this powerful conflict that those substances that might accomplish this have been made illegal to possess .
This has not stopped many dedicated therapists and seekers who find that the value of such substances exceeds the risk of incarceration .
The illegal status also creates the problem of finding pure substances in reliably known dose levels .
I am not advocating that anyone break the law , but I am pointing out the importance of developing sound , rational policies that will permit appropriate scientific evaluation of these substances and , ultimately , the realization of their potential .
2 . Methodology .
It is important that those who wish to work with psychedelics be fully informed of appropriate procedures .
Unfortunately , the illegal status of psychedelics has prevented the publication and sharing of results and effective practices .
However , there is available a great deal of information to guide the serious seeker if one has the diligence to seek it out .
Some excellent examples of appropriate procedures can be found in the following references .
Grofs ( 1980 ) book , LSD Psychotherapy , is a treasure house of good information .
See in particular the sections Psychedelic Therapy With LSD ( pp. 32-38 ) , Personality of the Subject ( pp. 52-64 ) , Personality of the Therapist or Guide ( pp. 89-107 ) , and Set and Setting of the Sessions ( pp. 108-116 ) .
In Adamson and Metzner ( 1988 ) , much attention is given to guidelines , preparation , set and setting .
The pamphlet , Code of Ethics for Spiritual Guides , was prepared by the Council on Spiritual Practices , which can be contacted at the following address : Box 460065 , San Francisco , CA 94146-0065 .
Finally , Stolaroff ( 1993 ) presents a brief summary of important factors to take into account .
3 . Low doses .
Many who have experimented with psychedelics have used high doses of substance to assure penetration into the very rewarding transpersonal levels of experience .
Such experiences can be awesome , compelling , and extremely rewarding .
Yet , it is often the case that these experiences fade away in time unless there are diligent efforts to make the changes indicated .
In profound experiences , the layers of conditioning that , in ordinary states , hold one away from liberation are transcended and from the lofty view of the transcendental state , personal conditioning seems unimportant and often unrecognized .
Yet after the experience , old habits and patterns reestablish themselves and often there is no alteration in behavior .
The use of low doses often can be much more effective in dealing with our " psychic garbage . "
Many do not care for low doses because they can stir up uncomfortable feelings , and they prefer to transcend them by pushing on into higher states , but it is precisely these uncomfortable feelings that must be resolved to achieve true freedom .
With low doses , by focusing directly on the feelings and staying with them without aversion and without grasping , they will in time dissipate .
Resolving one 's repressed feelings in this manner clears the inner being , permitting the True Self to manifest more steadily .
Such a result provides greater energy , deeper peace , more perceptive awareness , greater clarity , keener intuition , and greater compassion .
It permits the deepening of one 's meditation practice .
The surfacing of buried feelings that this procedure permits often can bring new understanding of one 's personality dynamics .
4 . Different compounds .
Some compounds may be more suitable for developing meditation practice than are others .
I personally have had substantial experience with the phenethylamines , outstanding examples of which are 2C - T - 2 , 2C - T - 7 , and 2C - B ( code names for 2,5 - dimethoxy - 4- ( ethylthio ) phenethylamine , 2,5 - dimethoxy - 4 - ( n- propylthio ) phenethylamine , and 4 - bromo - 2,5d - imethoxyphenethylamine , respectively ) .
The synthetic procedures and physical characteristics of all of these compounds are published in Shulgin and Shulgin ( 1991 ) .
These compounds have the characteristic of having some of the centering qualities of MDMA , yet being more LSD - like than is MDMA without the powerful push of LSD .
This lowers the likelihood of the user being trapped in deep pools of repressed material .
Not being as pushy as LSD , these compounds require developing volition to achieve similar levels of experience .
This is the same kind of volition that develops good meditation practice .
Consequently , it is easier to focus attention under their influence , which permits developing the attributes for good meditation practice .
As one develops proficiency in entering the desired state , it is found that the advantage of one compound over another diminishes .
The appropriate dose ( found by experiment -- generally equivalent to 25 - 50 micrograms of LSD ) of most any long - acting psychedelic is helpful .
5 . Freeing deeply occluded areas .
The practice of Buddhism in general , as I understand it , is not necessarily therapeutically oriented .
There is much advice in older texts to resolve personal problems with focused attention and application of intention to change behavior .
The result is that much unconscious material never gets resolved despite the ability of the mind to achieve high levels of awareness .
For a discussion of the difference between meditative realization and the uncovering process achieved through psychotherapy , see Wilber ( 1993 , pp. 196-198 ) .
Psychedelics facilitate reaching these deeper , often highly defended levels and clearing them out , thus permitting greater liberation and dropping of undesirable personality and behavior patterns .
Some powerfully repressed areas , such as the very painful birth experience I underwent in my first LSD session ( Stolaroff , 1994 ) , might never be resolved without the help of psychedelics .
6 . Judicious spacing of psychedelic experiences .
In my own practice , I intentionally have limited my early morning formal meditation session to an hour so as to leave ample time for worldly endeavors .
Thus , whatever I discover will be more applicable for the large numbers of persons constrained by the need or desire to function in the world .
Although I have advanced sufficiently in my practice to fend off some of the typical aging symptoms ( I am 77 years old ) such as loss of energy , stiff and sore muscles , and increased arthritic symptoms , I do find that after a while , I begin to acquire such symptoms .
When this happens , an appropriate psychedelic experience is a very effective rejuvenator .
Aging symptoms summarily are dissipated , I am in a much more enjoyable and effective state of being , and I find it easier to remain in this state through my regular meditation practice .
Also , if there are deep , underlying , unconscious dynamics that are a drag on life , as I have experienced much of my life , I find it especially helpful to resolve such deep patterns with psychedelics .
The psychedelic experience provides extremely effective clearing and a quantum jump improvement in well - being and meditative proficiency .
At the same time , it is important not simply to rely on another experience to overcome difficulties .
Numerous times I have discovered that mustering a deeper degree of intent can resolve important restrictions through properly focused meditation practice , with the advantage of a more permanent and satisfying state of well - being .
Such work also ensures that when an additional experience is found to be appropriate , it will be considerably more rewarding .
7 . Honoring the experience .
A very important aspect of employing psychedelics is to acknowledge fully the graces that have been received .
This is done through appreciation and gratitude , which are best expressed by determinedly putting into effect in one 's life the changes that have been indicated .
In fact , failure to do so can contribute to subsequent depression .
Thoroughly honoring the experience and postponing further psychedelic exploration until a real need is determined that cannot be resolved in straightforward meditation practice ensures that the next experience will be fruitful .
One of the fairly widespread abuses of psychedelics is to rely on repeated use of the drug to accomplish relief from discomfort instead of exerting the effort to make changes in one 's behavior that have already been indicated .
This is the most frequent objection to psychedelics raised by the contributors to Tricycle ( 1996 ) .
8 . Historical precedence .
Psychedelics have had extensive use in spiritual practices in numerous cultures around the world and encompassing some 2,000 years of history .
Current legally sanctioned spiritual practices with psychedelics include the Native American Indian church in North America , based on the use of peyote , and the Santo Daime and Uniao do Vegetal churches in Brazil employing ayahuasca .
Robert Jesse ( 1996 ) briefly reviews the history of such usage and describes a number of the substances most widely employed -- peyote , mushrooms , ayahuasca , soma , keykeon , iboga , cannabis , LSD , and MDMA .
USING PSYCHEDELICS IN MEDITATION PRACTICE
Since the passage of the Controlled Substance Analogue Enforcement Act of 1986 , almost all psychedelic substances have been outlawed .
As a consequence , it has not been possible to conduct legally any research since that time .
The following suggestions are based on the limited amount of experience that has been garnered , most of which is personal , and indicate where future research can be gainfully directed .
1 . Ethical framework .
Committing oneself to a suitable ethical framework , such as the Buddhist eight - fold path , is essential .
This is an important part of the mental set and also provides help in integrating psychedelic experiences .
2 . Preparation .
The participant should have a thorough understanding of psychedelics including the types of experience that may be expected , factors affecting experience , how to handle various kinds of experiences and how to follow them up , and the importance of set and setting as described above .
It is important to have first undergone a high - dose experience with a qualified guide that has resulted in reaching transpersonal levels .
This will put the entire process into perspective .
3 . Employing a correct substance at the proper dose level .
( Described above . )
4 . Developing mental stability .
This application is probably the most fruitful for employing psychedelic substances .
A practice focusing on the breath is particularly appropriate .
With proper substance and dose , one will note several possible developments .
First , distractions may be more intense than in ordinary practice because the action of the chemical releases more material from the unconscious .
At the same time , the enhanced awareness resulting from the action of the psychedelic allows one to notice in greater detail how various attitudes , thoughts , and actions affect the ability to hold one 's focus steady .
From this , one learns to hold the mind in the position of maximum effectiveness for becoming free of distractions and for holding mental focus stable .
One then experiences the deepening of the practice , more readily avoiding distractions and moving into areas of peace , calm , and growing euphoria .
With continuing practice , one finds it easier to enter the numinous levels that one ultimately is seeking .
Furthermore , the volition gained in developing this practice under the influence of a psychedelic carries on into day - to - day practice during which the same level of achievement becomes accessible .
The outcome that I personally have found most satisfying is the ability to hold the mind perfectly still , a state that makes access to previously unrevealed regions of the mind available , including the direct contact with one 's essence or dimity .
5 . Deepening the meditation practice .
One 's daily practice may be strengthened by using the discoveries made under the influence of psychedelics .
I recommend working to obtain maximum benefit from one psychedelic experience before proceeding with another .
When experiences are spaced judiciously in this manner , one learns under the influence to go deeper into the contact with the numinous .
As the ability to hold the mind steady grows , it becomes possible to focus more directly on the contact with the inner teacher - - our deepest Self , our Buddha nature , or however one chooses to call the wise , guiding entity within us .
Maintaining this focus leads to what seems to me to be the most valuable , fulfilling experiences possible .
From such experiences , combined with daily practice , grows the ability to achieve similar results in ordinary practice , until eventually the use of the psychedelic substance is no longer required .
At this point , the faculty for achieving optimum results has been developed within us .
I like to call this " developing a God muscle . "
Many of the issues concerning the application of psychedelics in meditative practice may be clarified further by examining some of the comments reported in the Tricycle issue on Psychedelics ( Tricycle , 1996 ) .
Jack Kornfield ( 1996 ) presents a knowledgeable and well - balanced view of the use of psychedelics as well as important factors required for a good meditative practice and spiritual development .
He points out the value that psychedelics have in introducing persons to new areas of the mind and even to glimpses of the goal of spiritual realization , experiences which encouraged many to develop a more disciplined practice .
He also clearly points out a common failing among many psychedelic users : failure to understand the depth of change required to transform oneself and to understand that it takes more than repeated psychedelic experiences to accomplish this .
Next , I will present some responses to Michelle McDonald - Smith's ( 1996 ) firmly expressed views .
From my experience , no matter what kind of deep opening one might have on a drug , it is n't going to develop one 's ability to have those experiences naturally .
Other people might say that drugs are a doorway , but I do n't see them developing anything .
They do n't develop equanimity , they do n't develop concentration , they do n't develop any factors of enlightenment .
( p. 67 ) In sharing my own perceptions on the same factors she has enumerated , I wish it to be clear that I am discussing the results of informed used , which has been delineated elsewhere in this article .
I agree that psychedelics alone will not necessarily develop the ability to have transpersonal experiences naturally , despite the fact that many people who have had such an outstanding initial experience are content to never have another , feeling that they have been blessed for life .
I maintain that psychedelics are way showers , and we then must work with serious intent to attain the states that are shown to be possible .
Nevertheless , it is of enormous benefit and inspiration if one can glimpse and experience firsthand the territory to which we aspire .
Norbert Wiener , the Massachusetts Institute of Technology scientist who suggested the binary system on which the operation of computers is based , commented on the successful development of the atomic bomb by the Russians .
He stated that their simply knowing that it is possible was at least 50 % of the battle .
But psychedelics can do far more than simply show what is possible .
They permit the recognition and resolution of powerfully repressed material in the unconscious that interferes with contacting our essence or Buddha nature .
They can reveal dramatically the errors in our behavior and perceptions , which are generating uncomfortable feelings and inappropriate responses , and can show how such errors can be corrected .
When we have fallen back so far so that we are losing energy and motivation , they can refresh us , invigorate us , and renew our inspiration and determination .
In contrast to McDonald - Smith 's ( 1996 ) claim , " I do n't see them as developing anything " ( p. 67 ) , I see them as developing wisdom , heightened perception , self - understanding , energy , and freedom ; releasing habitual blocks that interfere with the total response of our senses ; facilitating the flow of ideas ; releasing intuition and creativity as unconscious blocks are removed and as we become in touch with our inherent faculties ; and deepening our meditation practice .
My observations are based on some 40 years of research , including observing more than 100 individuals .
Regarding the comments about equanimity , concentration , and enlightenment , I find that appropriate use of psychedelics helps develop all of these qualities .
I never realized what equanimity was until I began taking psychedelics .
One of the great gifts of psychedelics is permitting one to learn real concentration .
Of course , if there is much repressed material in the unconscious and one takes a significant dose of a psychedelic , it is neither possible nor desirable to try to concentrate .
It is best to simply surrender to the experience and to let the flow of imagery and feelings proceed undisturbed .
In this flow , unconscious material is released .
The meditation equivalent is focusing on the breath or on an object and simply letting thoughts and feelings flow without getting involved .
When the high - pressure feelings in the unconscious demanding release begin to abate , then it becomes possible to concentrate on the desired object .
The practice of holding one 's attention steadily on an image , concept , or object under the influence of a good psychedelic permits many aspects of the object of attention to unfold , so that one may learn a great deal of new information about the object as well as discover unsuspected beauty and meaning and experience appreciation .
Eventually , one develops concentration sufficient to hold the mind quite still , which permits other aspects of reality to manifest .
I often feel that this is creating the empty space to permit God to enter , which I consider a major factor of enlightenment .
In practicing holding the mind steady under a low dose or a psychedelic , one becomes much more aware of the subtle distractions and urges that affect concentration .
Some distractions are more intense , so one can practice maintaining stability in spite of them .
Such practice under the influence helps strengthen the faculty that maintains steady attention .
A great deal can be accomplished in learning to effectively maintain stability , learning which is immediately applicable in subsequent practice .
McDonald - Smith ( 1996 ) stated : Drugs take a considerable toll on the body and the mind .
They bring all this energy into the system so that it catapults you into a different state of consciousness at the same time that it taxes your body , mind , and heart .
You get a sort of beatific view , but actually you are further down the mountain .
( p. 67 ) My associates and I , in psychedelic research , find ourselves very much at odds with this statement .
Yes , if a person is carrying heavy psychic burdens and takes a large psychedelic dose , he or she can be very tired at the end of the day and perhaps for a few days after .
But often this is followed by a gratifying sense of rejuvenation and appreciation for the benefits realized .
Important exceptions are the cases in which the participant does not work all the way through important problem areas , leaving them with a feeling of unfinished business and perhaps even greater discomfort because he or she is now experiencing uncomfortable feelings that formerly were locked safely away .
Working through these feelings with the help of a good counselor and following up with subsequent psychedelic sessions can clear up this problem .
Rather than toll , there is healing and rejuvenation .
One often feels that he or she has dropped a heavy load off the body , and his or her spirits are high .
A heavier mind can come from the unresolved situation described above ; otherwise , there is lightness of feeling and clarity of mind .
Other than toll , there is renewal .
I have friends who take many different kinds of vitamins and nutriments to achieve healthy states of mind and body and to have more energy .
I try their various recommendations , but my experience is that none of them work as well as a good , appropriate psychedelic session .
Rather than being brought further down , you are climbing the mountain with considerable help .
It is very true , however , that to maintain the high states experienced , it takes committed effort to make the necessary changes in day - to - day life .
This point is frequently neglected .
My experience is that not expressing appropriate gratitude and appreciation for the marvelous graces that have been granted can lead to self - hatred and depression .
A good meditation practice is an effective means of maintaining awareness of the needed changes and furnishing the energy and motivation to make them possible .
McDonald - Smith ( 1996 ) also stated : I 've had people come to retreats who 've done a lot of drugs , and it seems like they do n't have the energy to access subtle stages of insight .
They 've blown it off with drugs .
You pay a price for any drug experience .
( p. 69 ) It is true that many have abused psychedelics by frequent use , probably of high doses , with insufficient effort to integrate the meaning of the experience .
Frequent repetition can dissolve ego strength , and such people can develop rambling minds and have little ability to focus .
However , it is important to understand that this is the result of abuse , which is not the case with informed use .
You do not " pay a price for any drug experience . "
Appropriately used , psychedelic experiences not only have little or no price , but also open the door to healing , rejuvenation , and many riches in life .
McDonald - Smith ( 1996 ) says : " On the deepest level of letting go , drugs get in the way .
This is especially true for those who are heavily armored " ( p. 69 ) .
I say that appropriate use of psychedelics teaches you to let go and discover the rewarding benefits of letting go .
We are all afraid of the unknown ; psychedelics can help one develop trust , face fear , and enter unknown and sublime arenas .
Psychedelics are especially helpful for the heavily armored , if they truly wish to resolve their difficulties , as they can help dissolve the heavy walls of defensiveness and permit resolution and profound insight .
A major emphasis in the remainder of McDonald - Smith 's ( 1996 ) article is that " drugs promote attachment to peak experience ... what you actually get from drug experience is the desire to take the drugs again " ( p. 70 ) .
Many have fallen into this trap , but it is an overstatement to generalize that this is always the case .
With an honest approach , one realizes that there is work to do before seeking another session .
My own experience is that for many of us , particularly with me for many years , our self - esteem is so low that we feel that we do not deserve the full benefits of grace .
I have found that extensive help is waiting in many different forms and from many different levels and is generously offered .
We can always benefit from taking advantage of help in whatever mode , be it teachers , nutriments , reading , exercise , prayer , or simply thinking good thoughts .
And they can all work together and support each other .
Appreciation and gratitude multiply the benefits .
And one certainly cannot argue with McDonald - Smith 's advice to be completely aware in each moment .
Allan Hunt Badiner ( 1996 ) has written in Tricycle an impressive description of an extremely powerful , remarkable , life - changing experience with yage .
His experience probably represents the far extremes of intensity , variety , complexity , and meaning that psychedelics have to offer .
Badiner is to be highly congratulated for both his courage and his power of articulation in encountering and describing this compelling experience .
There are probably not a great many persons prepared to make such an encounter , but the outcome of Allan 's experience is testimony to the advice given by many sages that the encountering of pain and suffering , and even of near death itself , paves the way to becoming utterly alive .
Nina Wise ( 1996 ) , in her article in Tricycle , tells a beautiful story of personal growth and development with the aid of psychedelics , excellent teachers , and dedicated practice .
With her first psychedelic experience , she encounters a trauma often encountered by inexperienced explorers .
She has a glorious , very opening experience , yet sinks into deep depression because she does not know how to integrate the experience to maintain such a state .
She finds a meditation teacher and begins to grow in her practice .
A subsequent experience with ayahuasca provides another important opening that has very meaningful consequences in her life .
Later , with the help of good meditation teachers , she reaches the peace and equanimity she has been searching for and is no longer attracted to the aid offered by psychedelics .
She has reached the state of realization for which most of us long .
One hardly could hope for a better outcome than that which Nina Wise presents to us .
Yet , her story does provide the opportunity to include some additional remarks about the use of psychedelics .
Her first experience points out the need , as almost all the knowledgeable writers in the Tricycle ( 1996 ) issue have clearly stated , to have a framework and discipline within which to have the experience and , particularly , to help follow up the experience for optimum benefit .
Her second experience with ayahuasca illustrated that at an appropriate time , a further experience can be quite helpful .
There were characteristics about her psychedelic journeys that she was quite happy to leave behind her and not engage again .
Wise 's ( 1996 ) words are , " My psychedelic experiences , which had brought me to this place , were now interfering with my vision " ( p. 93 ) .
It is important to understand that psychedelics , when properly employed , can lead to the same state she had achieved of direct experience of reality .
It is the state reached by what !
call the trained user .
It helps to know that the creepy visions , the hallucinations , and the constant flow of imagery are the results of pressures in the unconscious where repressed material is demanding release .
By employing low psychedelic doses , it is possible to confront and deal with these images and , particularly , the feelings behind them , until they clear up .
Then one reaches , while under the influence , the stage of immediate perception ( Sherwood , Stolaroff , & Harman , 1962 ) .
" In this stage , the psychosomatic symptoms , the model psychoses , the multicolored hallucinatory images tend to disappear .
The individual develops an awareness of other aspects of reality than those to which he is accustomed " ( p. 71 ) .
The fact that a psychedelic produces streams of imagery indicates that the interior barriers to the center core of the self have not been completely eliminated .
For those who wish to be completely liberated , psychedelic experiences , properly timed and integrated , can be very helpful in resolving repressed material and defensive blocks , thus giving freer access to the divine within .
Trudy Walter ( 1996 ) has given us a touching story of the difficulties of addiction and the hardship of breaking it .
For years , she took respite and enjoyment in " getting stoned , " and it was only through dedicated commitment to her meditation practice that she could free herself from her addiction .
No matter how enjoyable or helpful an aid can be , eventually , as stated so clearly by Frances Vaughan ( 1995 ) , these " golden chains " must be transcended to develop the capabilities of our true inner self .
Robert Aitken ( 1996 ) states : " I do n't think drugs have particularly helped anybody arrive where they are " ( p. 105 ) .
This is most definitely not true for me and many others whom I know .
I very much agree with his observation that many desperately are trying to achieve realization through the drug experience when what is required is hard work in changing their attitudes , values , and behavior -- a process facilitated much more effectively through deepened intention and improved behavior than through overuse of psychedelic chemicals .
Aitken ( 1996 ) offers evidence that being under the influence and then later trying to practice does not work .
This has been commented on by other teachers , and I am sure that it is true for many .
However , the situation is quite complex , and care is required to evaluate such generalizations .
A great deal can be learned about how to use psychedelics appropriately to enhance and deepen practice .
It requires looking at a number of considerations .
What is the substance , the dose level , the frequency , the intention , and the effort to make maximum use of the experience , regardless of whether it was pleasant or uncomfortable , or the effort to deal with indicated changes in values and actions ?
With agents as powerful as psychedelics and the vast regions of the human mind made available , it seems quite shortsighted to draw conclusions before thorough investigative efforts have been pursued .
And of course , with the current legal status , one dare not publish or publicly share results , so that it is most likely that there exists a great deal of valuable experience that remains hidden from the public eye .
It is my experience that practice with an appropriate , moderate dose of a psychedelic permits deepening of the meditation practice and learning much more rapidly to avoid distractions and concentrate on the important aspects of the practice .
Because of our unfortunate drug laws , it has not been possible to replicate my findings on a broad basis , although preliminary trials with others support my own experience and the validity of my hypothesis .
I am sure that we must find ways to verify procedures that offer such promising accomplishments .
Aitken ( 1996 ) observes that those who returned to a retreat from psychedelic experiences demonstrated a deterioration in their ability to meditate .
I personally deem it unwise to muddle the opportunity to learn what a retreat has to offer by interspersing drug experiences .
Aitken ( 1996 ) is certainly right to raise the question , what after the experience ?
There is now almost universal consensus that being shown the territory is not enough .
It is extremely important to consummate the experience by bringing it to full fruition in day - to - day life .
Commitment to an ethical way of life , supported by a good meditation practice that enhances stability and clarity , is one of the best ways to ensure this accomplishment .
Aitken ( 1996 ) again says that you do not have to take drugs to wake up to reality .
This is certainly true , and a great many will choose the meditative path .
But for many others , the appropriate use of psychedelics can rapidly hasten the discovery of reality and , furthermore , can help reveal the inner blocks that hold one from reality and even temporarily dissolve them , so that one develops a clear picture of how to stay in touch with reality .
Without psychedelics , it can take many , many months of hard work to obtain the same vision , and after the vision is obtained , there may still be repressed inner psychic loads that can inhibit freedom , suppress the experience of one 's feelings and senses to the fullest , and preclude living constantly out of one 's essence or Buddha nature .
There no doubt are many who have turned away from psychedelics because of unsatisfactory experiences .
Although psychedelics are not a path for everyone , it is possible to cultivate more favorable outcomes with a better understanding of the nature of the experience , the possible varieties of dynamics that can arise , and how to deal with them .
Those who confront and resolve negative experiences can come out with a good deal more understanding and relief from psychic burdens , which can result in greater energy and well - being .
Aitken ( 1996 ) states " that there is a qualitative difference between the ecstasy that some people report from their drug experiences and the understanding , the realization , that comes with Zen practice " ( p. 109 ) .
I am not familiar with Zen practice , and so I may be in no position to comment , as Aitken likewise may not be in a position to comment on the ecstatic experience some achieve through psychedelics .
But I do know from firsthand experience that it is possible to experience ecstasy almost beyond what the human frame can stand , and if Zen practitioners reach this state , power to them .
Joan Halifax ( 1996 ) clearly understands a great deal about psychedelics and what they can do and , at the same time , has developed her practice to a point at which psychedelics are no longer necessary .
In her description of outgrowing the need for psychedelics , she states that the qualities of stability , loving - kindness , clarity , and humbleness are the primary qualities of the mind cultivated in meditation .
She further states that such qualities are not necessarily cultivated by psychedelics .
This statement is certainly true for some users who have been deceived and even become burdensome know - it - alls through their psychedelic use .
I personally have found that psychedelics have been powerful influences in developing all the qualities that Halifax mentions .
I already have commented that the appropriate mixture of meditation and psychedelics can influence strongly the effectiveness of each practice .
I very much am encouraged by the positive results I have observed during several decades of investigation .
I find psychedelics to have significant potential not only in aiding the development of meditation practice , but also in many other important areas .
Unfortunately , this perspective is not generally shared , and the controversy over psychedelics continues to be one of the major scientific disputes of recent history .
A number of excellent articles have been published examining this controversy and / or providing additional information for better understanding psychedelics .
Clark ( 1975 ) presents an insightful article based on 100 respondents to a questionnaire study to assess views on promising areas of psychedelic research , the extent of the promise , and the difficulties in conducting research .
A strong recommendation is made for opening up and funding psychedelic research .
Villoldo ( 1977 ) describes the work of Salvador Roquet , who developed very intense methods of conducting group psychedelic sessions with powerful impact , perhaps the most intensely focused procedure yet evolved .
Many important aspects of successfully employing psychedelics in therapy are discussed .
Klavetter and Mogar ( 1967 ) make a questionnaire analysis of participants completing the psychedelic program at the International Foundation for Advanced Study in Menlo Park and convert the data into peakers and nonpeakers following Maslow 's ( 1962 ) definitions .
Peakers consistently report significant therapeutic benefit following the LSD session , a result confirmed by Hoffer ( 1965 ) and Pahnke and Richards ( 1966 ) .
Stolaroff ( 1997 ) presents an in - depth interview with one of the most accomplished psychedelic therapists of our time , now deceased and unnamed because of our current drug laws .
This book covers the successful development of both individual and group experiences , selecting the most effective of a variety of psychedelic substances , and the optimum progression of their application .
Baumeister and Placidi ( 1983 ) present a fairly complete review of the LSD controversy , citing interesting and insightful reasons for the positions taken .
Kurtz ( 1963 ) presents a cogent comparison of religious mystical experience , nature mystical experiences , Maslow's ( 1962 ) peak experiences , and drug - induced experiences .
His analysis provides conclusions that the drug experiences of unity , when they occur , are the most inclusive and comprehensive in including all aspects of reality and the totality of human consciousness , combining intellectual , sensory , and mystical aspects occurring simultaneously .
Mogar ( 1965 ) provides an excellent review paper , pointing out the growing trends in psychiatry and psychology and the growing acceptance of a wider range of human capacities and functions as revealed through altered states of consciousness produced by a variety of means .
An excellent summary of results obtained in psychedelic research is presented .
Harman ( 1963 ) presents probably the most informed review of the psychedelic drug controversy , recognizing the root of the controversy in basic metaphysical assumptions , carefully describing the character of psychedelic experiences and the factors that influence them , comparing the highest potential of such experiences with natural mystical experiences , presenting the data assuring safety in proper hands , analyzing the resistance to accepting psychedelic research despite the publishing of positive results , and recommending proceeding with important research .
The most recent information at this writing comes from Shulgin and Shulgin ( 1997 ) , which covers a wide variety of interesting topics .
Pertinent to this discussion are presentations on the nature and variety of psychedelic experiences and the growing appropriation of power by government to prescribe medical practice and scientific research ( see , particularly , Part 2 : Psychedelics and Personal Transformation , and Part 5 : Drugs and Politics ) .
Although the articles discussed above contribute much important information , they still fall short in recognizing one of the most crucial aspects of psychedelic use .
Most observers still lean toward the allopathic medical perception of drugs , in which the results are attributed to the particular action of the drug in the body .
In the case of psychedelics , what transpires depends far more on the characteristics of the participant ingesting the drug and the circumstances of its use .
It does not seem to be recognized generally that an individual can , with time and repetition , learn increasingly how to make more effective use of the opportunities psychedelics afford .
It is possible to develop the characteristics of the trained user as previously described , when the mind can be held perfectly still so as to reveal other aspects of reality .
With continued practice , the aspiring seeker increasingly learns how to focus the experience , learn trust , and develop motivation and courage for deeper exploration .
This practice will yield deeper and deeper penetration into unknown areas of existence , with the possibility of bringing back ever new treasures .
I therefore hope that Buddhists and others will approach these substances with an open mind and , as a minimum , not stand in the way of efforts to learn more about them and the most appropriate ways of employing them .

WASHINGTON , Jan 4 : A 10 - year - old boy died in Texas while mimicking the execution of former Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein , police and family members said on Thursday .
Sergio Pelico hanged himself from a bunk bed and was found dead on Sunday in his apartment bedroom in the Houston - area city of Webster .
The boy ’s mother told police he had previously watched a news report on Saddam 's death .
Julio Gustavo , Sergio 's uncle , said the boy was a happy and curious child .
He said Sergio had watched TV news with another uncle on Saturday and asked the uncle about Saddam 's death .
" His uncle told him it was because Saddam was real bad , " Mr Gustavo said .
" He ( Sergio ) said , ' OK . '
And that was it . "
Sergio's mother , Sara Pelico DeLeon , was at work on Sunday while Sergio and other children were under the care of an uncle .
One of the children found Sergio 's body in his bedroom .
Police said the boy had tied a slipknot around his neck while on a bunk bed .
" I do n't think he thought it was real , " Mr Gustavo said of Saddam 's hanging .
" They showed them putting the noose around his neck and everything .
Why show that on TV ? "
A 9 - year - old boy in Rahimyar Khan also apparently hanged himself re-enacting Hussein 's execution .
Mubashar Ali , 9 , copied Hussein 's hanging with the help of elder sister , 10 , in his home .
He died after tying a rope to a ceiling fan and hanging his neck .

This funny sketch says it all .
Some blame the modern age for the problems of technology , but here is definitive proof that such troubles existed far back in ancient history as well !
From the Norwegian TV show " Øystein og jeg " with Øystein Backe and Rune Gokstad .
Written by Knut Nærum .
This reversal of Boston — no dog parks , just cafes — was disorienting to Edgar and me , both of us now in early middle age , our timelines crossing there in Paris .
So we marched up and down the Seine , his leash hooked to the stroller , and we discovered that the beagle ’s natural prey is not the rabbit , but the baguette .
I have no shortage of non-dog memories from Paris , but the chronology clarifies itself instantly when I remember this : whenever we came home , even in the hottest , most unconditioned air , Edgar still ran up the three flights of crimson - carpeted staircase to our door , his back legs propelling in unison , like a dwarf kangaroo .
But , only a single summer later , when we had moved our growing family to the coast of South Carolina , Edgar walked upstairs one leg at a time .
He and I forged a new summer routine on the Atlantic Coast , more suited to a dog of later middle years and his suddenly younger human .
The extreme heat allowed us outside only early in the morning and late in the evening , and then we walked on the beach .
Edgar , beach , sunset : and at once I have those summers in detail .
We wandered the shore , confident without a leash , and I would occasionally slow down for my friend , now definitely older than I , while ( and you ’ll have to trust me ) dolphins arched and leapt not 30 feet from our wet bare feet and paws .
A pod of four to six would , on some fine nights , keep unlikely perfect pace with us , matching our step for a mile or two .
Because of new zoning laws that require all novelists to live in Brooklyn , we moved to the borough a few years back , my two children , my wife and our elderly dog , Edgar .
Despite all the evidence of passing time ( my younger boy could talk , my older liked school , I was writing my third novel ) , nothing brings back that first New York summer any faster than the memory of Edgar not terribly interested in the dogs at the dog park near our home , and the summer after that , him slow with cancer , an old , old fellow with no interest in much of anything but trying to find a comfortable position on the couch .
That same pup who had , 11 summers before , blessed my betrothal in the tall grass of the Boston suburbs , I now carried in my arms the six blocks from our Brooklyn home to the veterinary hospital where the final kindness I could do my old friend at the end of our last walk was to give him the injection that made his tired body kick , then shudder , then sleep .
If the machinations going on in this country regarding so - called " deep integration " were instead a communist conspiracy to take over the country ( you will , of course , have to try hard to imagine this ) the news media would be blaring the story .

Meet the fascinating Order of BC winner who also happens to be a Tyee supporter .
Pundits would pontificate , editorialists would erupt , security forces would be unleashed .
Instead , a virtual conspiracy to make the country disappear through assimilation into the U.S. gets barely a mention .
But news of the scheme -- formally called the Security and Prosperity Partnership of North America ( SPP ) -- is finally breaking out of the secret chambers of the ruling elite and the federal government .
This is both good news and bad .
It 's good that ordinary citizens are finally getting a glimpse of the betrayal of their country .
The news is bad because it reflects just how much of this scheme is already being implemented .
Given the meetings of CEOs and politicians to advance the scheme politically , as well as all that must go into its actual implementation , there is simply too much activity to keep secret .
Ten dots to connect
Here are 10 developments in the plan to disappear Canada .
1 ) Pesticides ' harmonized . '
The most thoroughly reported story ( though even this did not go much beyond the CanWest chain ) was the revelation that Canada was about to " harmonize " its regulations , setting limits for pesticide residue on fruits and vegetables .
In 40 per cent of the cases , the U.S. allows for higher levels .
Richard Aucoin , chief registrar of the Pest Management Regulatory Agency , which sets Canada 's pesticide levels , said that Canada 's higher levels were a " trade irritant . "
The downgrading of health protection had been a NAFTA initiative , but is being " fast - tracked " as part of the Security and Prosperity Partnership .
This is just the tip of the iceberg .
Some 300 regulatory regimes are currently going through the same process .
2 ) Tory tirade .
The next story that broke through the wall of media silence reported on the paranoid reaction of the Harper Conservatives to any criticism of the SPP .
The occasion was hearings of the Commons International Trade Committee into the SPP , forced by the NDP .
Gordon Laxer , head of Alberta 's Parkland Institute , was testifying on the energy implications of the SPP , warning that eastern Canada could end up " freezing in the dark . "
He had barely started when the chair of the committee , Conservative MP Leon Benoit , demanded that Laxer halt his " irrelevant " testimony .
The Committee members overruled Benoit -- who promptly ( and illegally ) adjourned the meeting and stomped out .
The NDP and Liberal members nonetheless continued without him .
3 ) Council of corporate power .
The SPP initiative began in earnest back in 2002 with the Canadian Council of Chief Executives ( formerly the BCNI ) , the most powerful corporate body in the country .
It continues it leadership role , but does not promote the scheme just in its own name .
It instead has helped create several supportive bodies that now help drive the agenda .
Included in these are the North American Competitive Council ( NACC ) , which includes CEOs of the largest North American corporations , and which institutionalizes the exclusively corporate nature of the agreement .
The NACC is the only advisory group to the three NAFTA / SPP governments .
4 ) Secretive summit .
The NACC at least is public .
But much of what happens in building the elite consensus for deep integration is done in absolute secrecy or very privately , away from the prying eyes of the media .
The most secretive of these was held last year from Sept. 12 to 14 , in Banff Springs .
As The Tyee reported , the gathering was sponsored by something called the North American Forum * and it was attended by some of the most powerful members of the North American ruling elite .
Attendees , according to a leaked list that could not be confirmed , included Donald Rumsfeld , George Schultz ( former U.S. Secretary of State ) , General Rick Hillier , Defence Minister Gordon O'Connor and Minister of Public Safety Stockwell Day .
The media was not informed of the meeting and it was first revealed by the weekly Banff Crag & Canyon .
Stockwell Day refused to even confirm he was there , but said that even if he was , it was a " private " meeting that he would not comment on .
There is no better indication that these meetings , and the SPP itself , constitute a parallel governing structure -- unaccountable to any democratic institution or the public .
5 ) ' No fly ' coordination .
Canada will have its own " no- fly " list just like our U.S. " partner . "
As the Council of Canadians pointed out : " The no-fly list is very much a Security and Prosperity Partnership initiative .
' The SPP Report to Leaders , August 2006 ' outlines 105 SPP initiatives .
Initiative # 93 states , ' Develop , test , evaluate and implement a plan to establish comparable aviation passenger screening , and the screening of baggage and air cargo ( for North America ) . ' "
Canada 's privacy commissioner Jennifer Stoddart has raised a number of concerns about the plan including the fact that the list will be shared with the U.S. , that " false positives " are a virtual certainty , and that there is no evidence put forward by the government that the list will improve airline security .
6 ) Bye , bye Canadian dollar ?
David Dodge , the head of the Bank of Canada , told a Chicago audience that a single currency for North America " is possible . "
That would see a big chunk of Canadian sovereignty and the ability to guide the economy through monetary policy go out the window .
It 's not the first time Dodge has mused about abandoning the Canadian dollar - or deep integration .
7 ) Water and oil giveaways .
The deep integrationists clearly see Canadian water as a North American resource , not a Canadian resource .
At yet another very private meeting , held in Calgary on April 27th under the auspices of yet another forum , it was made clear that water is on the table for negotiation .
Discussion of bulk " water transfers " and diversions took place at a Calgary meeting of the North American Future 2025 Project ( partly funded by the U.S. government ) .
The meeting based its deliberations on the false notion that Canada has 20 per cent of the world 's fresh water .
Actual available supply amounts to only around six per cent -- about the same as has the U.S .
The water ( and environment ) meeting was preceded by another on April 26th talking about " North American " energy .
The beneficiary of these discussions is pretty clear when you realize Canada has no national energy policy .
We are the only energy exporting country in the world without a one .
Gordon Laxer told the Parliamentary committee : " The National Energy Board wrote me on April 12 : ' Unfortunately , the NEB has not undertaken any studies on security of supply . ' "
He was also told by the NEB that Canada does not maintain a 90 day energy reserve as other developed nations do .
As Laxer points out , " Canada may be a net exporter , but it still imports 40 per cent of its oil -- 850,000 barrels per day -- to meet 90 per cent of Atlantic Canada 's and Quebec 's needs , and 40 per cent of Ontario's . "
Canada exports 63 per cent of its oil production and 56 per cent of its natural gas , percentages that can never decrease under NAFTA .
8 ) NAFTA Superhighway .
State governments in the U.S. are becoming increasingly alarmed at the prospects of deep integration .
Earlier this year , Idaho became the first state to pass a legislative resolution directing the U.S. Congress to drop out of the SPP , which is referred to as the North American Union amongst U.S. opponents .
Thirteen states in addition to Idaho are calling on Congress to abandon the SPP : Georgia , Arizona , Missouri , Illinois , Oregon , Montana , South Carolina , Oklahoma , Utah , South Dakota , Tennessee , Washington and Virginia .
Part of the opposition is focused on plans for a so - called NAFTA Superhighway : actually a corridor several hundred metres wide including rail lines , freeways and pipelines from Mexico to the Canadian border .
There is a growing grass roots movement against the SPP in the U.S. , but led by the right over the issue of compromising American sovereignty .
9 ) Trade , Investment and Labour Mobility Agreement ( TILMA ) .
While U.S. states , concerned about state rights under an unaccountable " North American Union , " are organizing against the scheme , Canadian provinces are either blithely unaware or knowingly complicit in the deal .
More Canadians may be aware of TILMA -- the investors ' rights agreement between B.C. and Albert -- than they are about the SPP , but in reality they are one and the same .
TILMA is major piece of the deep integration , deregulation imperative and fits hand in glove with the SPP .
There is a similar , though more informal , process evolving in the Atlantic provinces , called " Atlantica . "
And B.C. is now pushing the so - called Gateway Initiative , a kind of regional superhighway project that will see huge and environmentally disastrous expansion of ports , highways and pipelines to further supply the U.S. 's insatiable demand for resources and cheap Asian goods .
10 ) The next SPP summit .
The third leaders summit on the SPP will take place this August 21 - 22nd in Montebello , Quebec , not far from Ottawa .
By the time it does many more Canadian will be aware of it .
Part of the reason that news of the SPP / deep integration issue is finally seeing the light of day is that opposition is growing and groups fighting the SPP are having an impact .
The Council of Canadians , the CLC and the Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives held an SPP teach - in in Ottawa last month and many civil society groups are now taking deep integration to their members .
Demonstrations are planned for the summit .
The NDP continues to press the government on SPP secrecy and the Green Party 's Elizabeth May has said deep integration will be a focus of the party 's election platform .
It is hard to think of any other issue in modern Canadian history , especially one that will literally determine whether the country survives or not , that has taken so long to get public attention .
I first wrote about it September , 2002 .
By the time the SPP summit has come and gone and the fall political season begins , deep integration , the most treacherous plan for the country yet devised by Bay Street , will be increasingly exposed .
And by the next election , we could see a repeat of the great " free trade " election of 1988 .
This time we have to win .

Tyee stories :
When it comes to John McCain ’s assessment of conditions in Baghdad , the military knows he ’s wrong , reporters in Iraq know he ’s wrong , and now Iraqis themselves want to tell us that they know he ’s wrong , too .
It was bad enough last week when McCain said parts of Baghdad are safe for Americans to go for a stroll and that General Petraeus travels around the city “ almost every day in a non-armed Humvee . ”
But McCain really seems to have pushed his luck by going to a Baghdad market , surrounding himself with 100 soldiers , three Blackhawk helicopters , and two Apache gunships , and then telling reporters that was able to walk freely in Iraq ’s capital .
Locals are disgusted by the senator ’s dishonesty .
A day after members of an American Congressional delegation led by Senator John McCain pointed to their brief visit to Baghdad ’s central market as evidence that the new security plan for the city was working , the merchants there were incredulous about the Americans ’ conclusions .
“ What are they talking about ? ” Ali Jassim Faiyad , the owner of an electrical appliances shop in the market , said Monday .
“ The security procedures were abnormal ! …
They paralyzed the market when they came .
This was only for the media . ”
Given the coverage and the audacity of McCain ’s foolishness , this is starting to look more and more like a jump - the - shark moment for the senator .
When a once - proud man becomes a joke , it ’s a sad thing to watch .
UPDATE : ( Nicole ) Snipers return to market after McCain 's visit .
Surprise , surprise , surprise .
A pleasant mini -break .
– Two English friends of mine recently had the pleasure of a two night mini - break here and both were disappointed with the establishment after having read some favourable reviews .
I collected them after their stay and was given a warm welcome at Reception .
The location was beautiful and the building quite ?
Grand ? , but both expected more of a ? fun atmosphere ? , instead they felt that the public rooms were almost ? institutional ?.
Meal times in the rather noisy restaurant were not flexible enough and appeared designed to suit the staff rather than the guests .
Some of the staff were a little unfriendly and sullen .
The ?
Spa ? area had no treatments or services on offer .
Management ensured they were given rooms close to each other , which were clean and comfortable although sparsely decorated , almost in the style of modern minimalism .
The beds were lumpy and there were no hospitality trays .
The decor throughout was felt to be a little ?
cold and tasteless ?
and perhaps somewhat anonymous .
Room service at night was non-existent , so if one wanted a pot of tea and sandwiches or even biscuits during the night , one would have to go hungry .
Neither room was equipped with a Corby trouser press , WIFI or Aircon .
With typical British stoicism neither of my friends complained , not wishing to be seen as overly - critical .
An interesting point raised by one of my friends indicated that the noisy dining room experiences would be helped by a little back - ground music , perhaps a Jazz pianist or better yet a string quartet playing a little Bach or Beethoven .
Overall it is felt that there is room for improvement .
Finally , how about some Indian cuisine on the menu ?

I ’m tired of shmuckety - schmuck yuppies with money .
Frankly , their cars are usually a better ride than they are .
That , and they ’re notorious cheaters .
It ’s as if faithfulness dives to the ground on the seesaw when success , money , and a hot car rises to the sky on the other end .
Before any of you peg me as some kind of sad self - pitying chick whose Daddy left her & so she is doomed to chase cheaters & beaters and sabotages her relationships because she feels unworthy of a man ’s love , just know that I do not engage in self - pity , ever , because I have a great life full of blessings & achievements & I realize I have it better than 99 % of the world ’s population .
That , and I have a great relationship with my father .
I ’m just slamming a certain segment of the population that I have had extensive personal experience with .
In my quest for the “ right ” boyfriend , ( right for me , right for right now , whatever ) I have dated various types , from the poor starving artist , to the self - absorbed bodybuilder , to sugardaddy types , to the intellectual Seinfeld guy next door .
They all failed , though not always miserably .
Yet , being the eternal optimist , I am on to the next type and , fingers crossed , we will hit the mark for a good time .
At least I think I ’d know what to expect with a cool stoner guy ( though surprises are nice ) .
I ’m thinking ….. MELLOW TIMES .
I like to laugh .
Here are my revised criteria for the next boyfriend :
You must be either a ) an unemployed djembe player ( if you must google djembe , then you ’re obviously not down to par ) b ) a trust fund baby with real , intended if not realized , artistic goals c ) just plain confused about why the hell you have n’t packed up & moved to the islands yet or d ) employed at some warehouse , the atmosphere of which leads you to gripe about the “ establishment ” and the political agenda of your Nazi floor supervisor .
You must have scruffy , shaggy hair , all over , preferably , au natural , be it on your face , head , or body .
Bonus points if you smell like patchouli .
Dress in soft cargo shorts & thrift store shirts , own no socks and not enough sandals & look rockin ’ in either snowboard / surfer gear , or shirtless if you ’re a rockclimber .
You have a favorite hat , favorite pajamas , and a good luck charm .
You must live in either Santa Cruz or a treehouse .
Somewhere with a lot of trees , preferably , so we could take nature walks & oil paint the pretty flowers together .
One of us would have to purchase a compass or be able to navigate by sun / stars in case we get lost out there .
You must either a ) own a car that you ca n’t drive b) drive a car you do n’t own c ) have the ability to drive my car , if not the urge to want to .
I am happy to provide & fulfill the various material needs of this relationship , however I do like to be treated like a lady now & again and be driven around by her smooth new stoner boyfriend .
It ’s cool .
I have a convertible .
No , not everyone is looking at you .
You must love to eat , because I love to cook .
I can fix us stoner - approved goodies like an array of munchy crunchy finger foods OR I can cook a gourmet dinner that wo n’t be lost on your extra-heightened tastebuds .
One thing I wo n’t do is use flaxseed because that crap gave me an allergic reaction and my tongue turned blue & I spoke with a lame novocaine - like fubblelisp for days .
You must love to cuddle and be happy to leave a shirt that smells like you for me to sniff when you ’re not around .
I will not be burning incense in your absence , so this seemingly tiny detail is critical .
Since I am the professional career woman and will be supporting you & financing most of our outings , it is critical that you be thoughtful , entertaining or have some talent ( s ) to amuse us with .
I will buy you that new surfboard if you design something out of hemp rope & barbwire ( to showcase the symbiosis of Nature & Man ) for me to hang as a mobile above our bed .
You should probably have a prescription for ya medicine , feel ?
I mean , if you have no choice but to get it illegally , then I understand , it ’s just that they issue you these cool little ‘ green cards ’ when you ’re under a cool Doctor ’s dope Rx .
You must be comfortable giving & receiving massages and capable of lots of stimulating sexoccupations because there ’s nothing hotter than being able to do yoga in bed , balancing Funyuns on our nipples , engaging in textural pudding wrestling , blowing smokeballs in each other ’s mouths , and bragging to friends about the time when you should ’ve pulled a tantric muscle but did n’t , because Maaan , that shit ’s sooo ___fill in the blank__ .
Most of our time together , after my long boring day in corporate America , will be spent a ) smoking b) gettin ’ busy c ) eating d) playing videogames e ) nature hikes f ) planning the secession of Northern CaliforniaOkay , that ’s about it .
I like all types & races of men , your smile & eyes are most important .
Of course , be in relatively good shape ( it ’ll come in handy for the yoga payoff ) and taller than me ( I ’m 5 ’ 6 ’ ) .
Also , no one over 33 .
If you are still a stoner at 34 , then somewhere your mama went wrong .
If you or someone you know fits all or most of the criteria above , and is generally a nice guy with few baggage ( that he can remember ) , pass him my way .
Peace ~ Future stoner chick - a- boom - puffpuff

Pentagon conducting research into adverse effects of anthrax vaccine while maintaining it is safe Julie Weisberg
Published : Tuesday March 27 , 2007 Print This Email
This Volunteers for study to be questioned for eight years
The Pentagon resumed its controversial mandatory anthrax vaccinations program for selected troops last week despite the fact that its own doctors are quietly conducting research into adverse effects of the vaccine , a RAW STORY investigation has found .
While the Defense Department maintains that the anthrax vaccine is safe and poses no long - term risks to recipients , a little - known program at Walter Reed  the National Vaccine Healthcare Center  seems to contradict the militarys assertions .
Documents obtained by RAW STORY , including a participants agreement , case history and government documents , show that military medical personnel have known since at least 1998 that there are genetic triggers between illnesses and some required immunizations , including the anthrax vaccine .
They also reveal the military knew and did not implement routine pre-screening which could help reduce vaccine - related illnesses .
A flyer posted by the Vaccine Healthcare Center shows that Walter Reed is soliciting servicemembers who have suffered as a result of the vaccine .
The flyer asserts that adverse effects may include redness or swelling where the shot was given ( larger than the bottom of a soda can ) and / or more than 24 hours of headaches , muscle / joint pains , and / or fatigue ( tiredness ) that interfered with your daily activities .
 Only one visit and only one blood draw is required ,  the flyer says .
 You will also receive annual e-mail or telephone follow - up surveys for eight years . 

US Army Medical Command Media Relations Officer Margaret
Tippy made several efforts to put RAW STORY in touch with Vaccine Healthcare Center officials over the past several weeks .
Defense medical officials , however , did not returned repeated request for information about the VHC program .
In 2004 , a federal judge ruled that the militarys mandatory administration of the vaccine was illegal because the Food and Drug Administration had not approved its use for inhalation anthrax , only for anthrax contracted through the skin .
After FDA approval , the judge allowed voluntary injections .
The Defense Department resumed mandatory shots this month .
The Pentagon continues to defend the efficacy and safety of the vaccine .
 I 'll say once again , the vaccine is safe and effective ,  Assistant Secretary of Defense for Health Affairs William Winkenwerder said last year .
Longstanding concerns Doctors have raised questions about the vaccine for years .
According to a transcript of an Apr. 16 , 1998 meeting of the Armed Forces Epidemiological Board , military experts concluded that pre-vaccination screenings could be conducted because the military has " the technological and data capture capability " to do so , and that they should be done because " we 're dealing with this problem with anthrax now and many other immunizations . "
" There is going to be more in the future , " the transcript added .
The existence of the Vaccine Healthcare Center complicates the mystery surrounding vaccine - related illnesses , suggesting either that pre-screening is not part of the vaccination process or that genetic triggers are not the only cause of vaccine related health effects .
Created in 2001 as a joint effort of the Centers for Disease Control and the Department of Defense , the VHC program and its network of treatment and research facilities are largely unknown even among the military community .
Walter Reed Medical Center serves as the headquarters of the program , which also includes clinics at Fort Bragg , Lackland Air Force Base and Portsmouth Naval Medical Center .
Since its inception , the treatment component of the program has helped hundreds of soldiers suffering serious and sometimes debilitating side - effects from anthrax and other vaccinations to get the proper military medical treatment , vaccine exemptions and case management that they would not have access to otherwise .
Many anti-vaccination advocates question why the VHC treatment program is not more widely publicized and why the VHC 's research is not available to medical professionals and the public .
Dr. Meryl Nass , an anthrax expert and physician who has treated soldiers suffering from adverse reactions to the anthrax vaccine , believes the VHC 's research findings should be released .
" I knew they were doing this kind of research , but they just would n't admit it , " Dr. Nass said in a phone interview last week .
" VHC has been conducting this type of research , but they have n't been publishing any of it .
This could save more people from becoming ill . "
Luis Hernandez 's mystery lesion Luis Hernandez , a recently - retired Navy reservist , is a current participant in the VHC study .
Hernandez says he was approached last September by VHC researchers to take part during a routine visit to Walter Reed relating to his disability claim .
( His affidavit for the program is available here .
The sections of his file describing his symptoms and their impact on his quality of life are here . )
An Iraq
War veteran who served in the US military for 25 years , the 51 - year - old New Yorker received his first series of anthrax vaccinations when he was mobilizing for deployment in February 2003 , a month before Operation Iraqi Freedom began .
A few days after receiving his third anthrax vaccination , Hernandez says , he developed a lesion on his leg that he was told was most likely a spider bite .
He was put on a course of antibiotics and continued preparing for deployment .
" I had never had health problems , " he said .
The lesion grew and other autoimmune problems developed .
In May 2006 , Hernandez was forced to return home to receive medical care .
" When I got back , I had 13 lesions , " he said .
" It was just too much for my immune system , " he said of the vaccine .
" They did n't know what the hell I had . "
When he told the military he thought that his illness was related to the vaccine , he said , staff told him he was " delusional " and the relation between his mystery autoimmune illness and the shots " were in his head . "
" For a while , " he said , " I thought I was going crazy . "
A private physician who had been attending to Hernandez 's case referred him to Walter Reed 's Vaccine Healthcare Center to seek additional tests in hopes of diagnosing the " mystery illness . "
Hernandez said no one in the military had ever told him of the program 's existence .
According to Hernandez 's medical documents , the reservist was suffering from muscle spasms , headaches , recurring skin lesions , chronic fatigue and depression when he first visited Walter Reed in January 2004 .
" Hernandez ' life has been profoundly effected [ sic ] by his clinical symptoms , " VHC staff wrote .
" He is in constant pain , has difficulty functioning at his civilian job and has used 400 hours of civilian sick leave . "
RAW STORY will post excerpts from Hernandez 's documents later today .
" We have noted in a number of service members who now exhibit chronic , refractory headaches as well as persistent musculoskeletal pain in temporal association with the receipt of the anthrax vaccine , " VHC staff added .
" Based on these observations , we are attempting to establish case definitions as well as diagnostic , treatment and vaccination options . "
" When I got down there , they told me , 'we know what you got , but we can't fix you , ' " Hernandez said of VHC staff .
" They said they had seen other service members with the same symptoms . "
Hernandez is now asking the same question many vaccinated soldiers already have :
Is the vaccine safe ?
Did the military know the vaccine could cause health problems ?
" The D.O.D. is telling us that the vaccine is safe , and yet they are conducting this multi-million dollar research project , " he said .
" It is too late for me , but the military is just going to pump these kids ' bodies full of this stuff . "
Dr. Nass , who practices medicine in Maine , believes the vaccine is unsafe and is responsible for a host of illnesses in U.S. troops .
" There are so many people who are damaged by this vaccine , " she remarked .
" Its use makes no sense . "
The numbers of soldiers who have become ill as a result of the anthrax vaccine is largely unknown , primarily because conditions may not be not either properly diagnosed or recorded , and because many military studies are not available to health care professionals or the public .
In 2003 , 22 - year - old Army Reservist Specialist Rachel Lacy died shortly after receiving her first batch of vaccines .
According to a military medical panel , the evidence surrounding Lacy 's death " favored a causal relationship , " but the panel decided that the " evidence was not conclusive . "
The cause of death was described as " a severe inflammatory process affecting her lungs , findings consistent with a diagnosis of systemic lupus erythematosus ( SLE ) or lupus . "
Manufacturer says studies show product is safe Created by Emergent BioSolutions ( formerly Bioport ) , the anthrax vaccine is known as BioThrax or Anthrax Vaccine Absorbed and was first licensed by the Food and Drug Administration in 1970 .
It remains the only FDA - approved anthrax vaccine for use in the US .
In an interview with RAW STORY , Emergent Biosolutions spokesperson Dr. Tom Waytes said the anthrax vaccine has been studied more than just about any vaccine in the US and has been deemed safe and effective .
He said the vaccine has no higher adverse reaction rate than most other vaccines .
A recent report issued by the military reviewing the vaccine 's safety , as well as a 2002 report issued by the Institute of Medicine , he added , have also backed the vaccine .
In the Institute of Medicine 's report  which reviewed existing studies on the vaccine 's safety and effectiveness  the committee found that " the available evidence shows that the currently licensed anthrax vaccine , Anthrax Vaccine Adsorbed ( AVA ) , is reasonably safe and effective , with the caveat that the studies reviewed were carried out in populations of healthy adults only . "
The IOM report also pointed out that " although the committee found no data indicating that vaccination with AVA is associated with later - onset adverse events or with any serious or lasting adverse events , " few , if any , studies had been done regarding the vaccine 's long term safety .
" DoD should carefully evaluate options for longer - term follow - up of the possible health effects of vaccination against anthrax ( and other service - related exposures ) , " committee members urged in their report .
Last May , the Government Accountability Office ( GAO ) issued a report that called for " a better , alternative vaccine . "
In the May 2006 report , the GAO said the " vaccine has not been adequately tested on humans ; no studies have been done to determine the optimum number of doses ; the long - term safety has not been studied and data on short - term reactions are limited . "
Dr. Waytes asserted that the majority of soldiers ' claims that the vaccine causes autoimmune disorders and serious illnesses are " in people 's minds . "
Dr. Nass disagrees .
" We really do n't know about long - term safety , " Nass said , noting that the majority of studies are focused on short - term effects .
" The data just does n't exist . "
Late last year , another group of anonymous soldiers and civilians filed a new lawsuit to stop the resumption of the mandatory program .
The Pentagon has filed a motion to dismiss the case , according to one of the lead lawyers for the plaintiffs , retired Air Force Lt. Col.
John Michels .
" This whole thing just has this bureaucratic momentum , " Michels said .

An alternative formulation of this question is " How can I design a site that wo n't be featured at http://suck.com? "
This book covers two broad categories of Web sites .
The first is Web Publishing .
These are sites that are vaguely magazine - like and include , as a degenerate case , the typical corporate product catalog site .
The second broad category is Web - based Application .
These are sites that do a job for a user , e.g. , a site that keeps a dog 's medical record and sends out email reminders when the dog needs immunizations .
The first category is older and more familiar so let 's talk about Web Publishing first .
You Can't Say " Web Publishing " without the Word " Publishing "
Start by putting yourself in your users ' shoes .
Why are they coming to your site ?
If you look at some Web sites , you 'd presume that the answer is " User is extremely bored and wishes to stare at a blank screen for several minutes while a flashing icon loads , then stare at the flashing icon for a few more minutes . "
Academic computer scientists refer to this process of fitting software systems to people as " user modeling . "
Slightly more content - rich sites are based on the user model of " User wants to look at product brochures " or " User wants to look at fancy graphics . "
After pulling the server logs for the sites that reflect these user models , though , it is tough to have much faith in them .
Consider that if a user wanted a flashing computer screen and confusing user interface , he could stuff a CD - ROM into the drive .
He could get an even more enticing show without the crummy user interface by picking up his television remote control and flipping channels .
If a user wanted product brochures , he could get them by calling manufacturers or visiting shops .
If a user wanted fancy graphics , he could flip through dozens of pages ' worth in a print magazine in the amount of time it would take to load a single corporate Web page .
Users come to magazine - like Web sites because they have questions .
They are not bored losers .
We are not doing them a favor by putting product brochures online or showing them huge logo GIFs .
Users are doing us a favor by visiting our Web sites .
They are paying to visit our servers , if not exactly with money then at least with their time .
We have to give them something of value or they will never come back .
If you can anticipate user questions and make sure that your site answers them , you will be a successful Web publisher .
Example 1 : Personal Home Page
Imagine that a friend of yours is at a party talking to Dale , a beautiful member of whatever sex you happen to fancy .
Your friend is describing your charity , great humanity , and kindness to animals .
Dale , however , wo n't agree to meet you without seeing a photo first .
It would be nice if there were a portrait of you somewhere on your home page before Dale and your friend stroll over to the WebTV .
Or imagine that you 've given an interview to a reporter on deadline .
It is 2:00 am when the reporter realizes he forgot to ask you for some background biographical information .
You 'll be getting a wake - up call unless you remembered to put a copy of your resume online .
One would naively imagine that home or mobile phone numbers would be the information whose posting is most likely to be regretted .
Sadly in our Great Age of Spam it is the email address that you 'll probably be sorry that you added to your page .
What you really want is a contact form on your Web site that only a real live human can use .
If desired , the Web- initiated contacts can be emailed to the address of your choice , presumably an address that changes every time it falls into the hands of spammers .
" What makes an effective personal home page ? " is a different question from " Why put effort into a personal Web site ? "
Speaking purely for myself , I built my site in order to share things that I 'd learned , so that others could save time and avoid mistakes .
Examples of articles that fit into this category include http://www.photo.net/travel/diving//decompression-illness and http://philip.greenspun.com/flying/caribbean.
Example 2 : Camera Manufacturer
Someone with a broken camera will want to know how to get it fixed and how much it will cost .
They 'll be looking for maps to service centers , warranty details , and prices for out - of - warranty repairs .
The site is a natural focal point for customers to meet , interact , and share experiences with each other .
So www.nikon.co.jp should have moderated Q&A forums , bulletin boards , and classified ads where customers can contribute .
The preceding advice sounds trivial but try to find a product manufacturer who is following it .
If you visit the average company 's Web site , you find lots of advertising to potential customers but virtually no services or documentation for existing customers .
In this sense the Web is kind of like early television .
People did n't understand the new medium so they stuck a camera at the back of a live theater , recorded the movements and speech of the actors , and broadcast the result .
On the Internet , companies have produced Web sites by sticking a camera in front of their marketing and sales brochures .
As of August 1998 , www.nikon.co.jp was amply stocked with advertising .
If you were at an Internet café and needed to review the instruction manual for your Nikon camera , you 'd find instructions for going to the post office , purchasing six International Reply Coupons , and mailing them to Japan .
Upon receipt of the coupons , Nikon would mail you the relevant manual .
There were no tools for collaboration among customers , but you could send Nikon email .
However , they asked you to first read the following disclaimer :
Nikon Corporation ( " Nikon " ) has no obligation for monitoring any ideas , concepts , suggestions or comments ( hereafter collectively called " Ideas " ) you transmit to this Site ( " the Site " ) by electronic mail or otherwise .
Nikon understand that you abandon all rights regarding the Ideas at the time when you transmit the Ideas to Nikon , and Nikon has no obligations to keep the Ideas confidential .
Nikon has no responsibility for any problems or issues resulted from the Ideas .
For a glimpse of what a corporate site looks like when a company thinks about existing customers , look at www.ge.com.
They have advertisements , yes , but also owner 's manuals and installation guides for every GE product .
If you moved into an apartment with a GE appliance but the previous tenants did not leave you the instructions , you can grab a PDF file from the GE site and print it .
Example 3 : University Research Lab
Our comments ?
It would be a nice 20 - page site that would cost about $ 100,000 a year to maintain because every change would have to go up and down this four - level management chain .
Assuming Lab HQ had the budget to do it , we could only see one little problem .
" What 's the problem ? " asked the PR folks .
" If you walked out of this building and spent the rest of your life searching the planet , I do n't think you 'd find a single person who cared about the names of the groups at LCS or who was running them . "
Our suggestion was first to think about Jane Nerd , a computer science undergraduate at the University of Michigan .
She is interested in network protocols .
She should be able to type " network protocols " into a search box and learn something interesting about the history , practice , and future of computer networks .
In the process she would probably discover that our very own Dave Clark was Chief Protocol Architect for the Internet from 1981 to 1989 and that the Advanced Network Architecture Group at LCS is tackling the problem of making one Internet protocol work simultaneously for real - time control , video conferencing and other forms of interactive collaboration , plus traditional data transfer .
If she is curious about encryption , she should find the Internet 's best tutorial on the workings of the RSA algorithm .
In the process , she might learn that LCS employs Ronald Rivest , the " R " in RSA and that Ron is part of the Theory of Computation Group .
Next we should think about Joe Maxinerd , finishing his Ph.D. in computer science at Stanford .
Joe 's thesis is on computer graphics .
He should have been visiting one of our Web servers every day or two because we are operating a community Web site where the world 's leading experts in graphics algorithms meet to exchange research results , talk about new ideas , and teach students .
As a participant in forums and from reading comments on research papers , he would be intimately familiar with all the MIT LCS folks who work in the Computer Graphics Group .
We should think about teaching .
A quick review of our server logs will reveal that the entire world does n't come here every day desperate to find out what we 're doing .
If we want traffic , we 'll have to give something back to the Internet .
Fundamentally , there are two ways of teaching a scientific or technical subject .
The standard textbook takes the " here 's the way it is " approach .
You do n't learn about how people struggled to understand electric and magnetic fields over 2500 years ; you get Maxwell 's equations .
It does n't have to be this way .
At St. John's College ( www.sjca.edu), students learn physics by reading original writings by Aristotle , Newton , Kepler , Maxwell , Einstein , Heisenberg , and Millikan .
Nearly all computer science tutorials take the " here 's how you do it " approach .
With such a short history behind the field and instructors who tend to be ignorant of that history , colleges generally just show students a point - in - time snapshot of thinking about computing .
LCS is 35 years old this year , so we 're one of the few institutions that has been around long enough to talk credibly about the history of the field .
What would make a great LCS site is a collaboratively produced , collaboratively taught history of computer science .
Journalists , historians , and other casual users might wish to read the timeline of technological advances and click through to see explanations of what each advance brought in terms of applications .
Thus , for example an entry on early bitmap displays ( Stanford , Knight TV , Xerox PARC ) would be linked to an explanation of how they led to the MIT Lisp Machine , the Macintosh and then Microsoft Windows .
Computer science students would be able to learn all of computer science by following hyperlinks from the timeline to original papers and software .
In doing so , they would note that much of the innovation in computer science happened at MIT and perhaps become inspired to apply for positions here .
Because we would farm out responsibility for each section of the timeline to a professor and the responsibility for running community sites in research areas to the various groups , the overall cost of this kind of site would probably be similar to that of the 20 - page site produced with a four - level management hierarchy .
The point of this example ?
A publisher 's internal structure is of no interest to Web users .
People come to Web sites looking to get a job done or a question answered .
The first thing the guys at www.fedex.com did was publish a Web interface to their package tracking database .
That was back in 1994 .
When they decided to add corporate information they put it on an entirely separate site : www.fdxcorp.com.
( Today the sites are merged . )
Edward Tufte makes the point that " design recapitulates bureaucracy " on page 148 of Visual Explanations [ 1997 ] .
How Do You Know When You Are Done ?
Every competently run site runs a local full - text search engine .
Why not go the extra mile and hack the CGI scripts so that the search engine sends you e-mail when a query results in zero matches ?
Given information about which user queries are failing , you can add content or keywords as appropriate .
At this point you can relax .
You are n't a loser with a big budget , a lot of ugly graphics , and no traffic .
Users are not leaving your site in frustration , shaking their heads , and saying " They just do n't get it . "
Now that you are safe from the wags at suck.com , what can you do to make your magazine - like site fulfill its potential ?
Become Illiterate ( i.e. , present multiple views )
Do these not suggest a somewhat richer place than the sentence in the Michelin guide ?
Yet the sight of a tourist slavishly following the Michelin guide is a commonplace .
Something really fascinating and unexpected is happening in front of him , but he has his nose buried in the guide , trying to figure out what the next official point of interest is .
The tourist is literate .
Not literate in the " I read Classics at Oxford " sense , but literate in the " knowledge is closed " sense .
Everything about Italy can fit into a book .
Perhaps the 350 pages of the Green Guide are n't enough , but some quantity of writers and pages would suffice to encapsulate everything worth knowing about Italy .
Oral cultures do not share this belief .
Knowledge is open - ended .
People may hold differing opinions without one person being wrong .
There is not necessarily one truth ; there may be many truths .
Though he did n't grow up in an oral culture , Shakespeare knew this .
Watch Troilus and Cressida and its five perspectives on the nature of a woman 's love .
Try to figure out which perspective Shakespeare thinks is correct .
Feminists , chauvinists , warmongers , pacifists , Jew - haters , inclusivists , cautious people , heedless people , misers , doctors , medical malpractice lawyers , atheists , and the pious are all able to quote Shakespeare in support of their beliefs .
That 's because Shakespeare uses the multiple characters in each of his plays to show his culture 's multiple truths .
In the 400 years since Shakespeare we 've become much more literate .
There is usually one dominant truth .
Sometimes this is because we 've truly figured something out .
It is kind of tough to argue that a physics textbook on Newtonian mechanics should be an open - ended discussion .
Yet even in the natural sciences , one can find many examples in which the culture of literacy distorts discourse .
If you were able to stay awake long enough to read through an academic journal for taxonomic botanists , you 'd learn that not all botanists agree on whether Specimen 947 collected from a particular field in Montana is a member of species X or species Y .
But you 'd see quite clearly that everyone publishing in the journal agreed on the taxonomy , i.e. , on how to build a categorization tree for the various species .
However , if you were able to stay awake long enough to get through a cocktail party in a university 's department of botany , you 'd discover that even this agreement is illusory .
There is widespread disagreement on what constitutes the correct taxonomy .
Hardly anyone believes that the taxonomy used in journals is correct but botanists have to stick with it for publication because otherwise older journal articles would be rendered incomprehensible .
Taxonomic botany based on an oral culture or a computer system capable of showing multiple views would look completely different .
Open today 's New York Times .
A Republican politician is arguing for relaxed regulations on widgets .
A Democrat is quoted arguing in favor of tightened regulations .
There is a vote ; widget regulations are tightened .
On the surface , it looks like multiple perspectives .
Yet at a cocktail party , your friend Sue argues that the government should n't be regulating widgets at all .
Joe interrupts her to say that widget regulation is a canard ; we really ought to talk about flag burning .
Dana brings up the Simpsons episode where Bart went on a school field trip to the widget factory .
Alan tells his grandfather 's widget factory stories from World War II .
Elizabeth talks about how she was surprised to see that they had no widgets in New Zealand and apparently did not miss them .
Compared to the texture of the cocktail party , the New York Times article sounds like two rich old white guys saying more or less the same thing .
Some people like a one - truth world .
If you have a huge advertising and PR budget then you can control your public image very effectively in a literate world .
Ford Motor Company has enough money to remind you 2,000 times a year that " Quality is Job One " ; unless your friend was roasted in a Pinto gas tank explosion , you probably will eventually come to agree .
Microsoft via the genius of Bill Gates invented the mouse - windows user interface , reliable operating systems , affordable computing , and the Internet ; if you do n't think all that is true , ask someone who has never used a computer and whose only exposure to the industry is through mass media .
Unless you have the billions of dollars necessary to create a one - truth world of your own , you 'll probably come to agree that the greatest artistic achievements hold the mirror up to a multiple - truth life .
The Internet and computers , used competently and creatively , make it much easier and cheaper to collect and present multiple truths than in the old world of print , telephone , and snail mail .
Multiple - truth
Web sites are much more interesting than single - truth Web sites and therefore will get a lot more traffic .
For example , the car manufacturers ' sites are mostly collections of product brochures tarted up with flashing graphics .
They get minimal traffic compared to the plain text rec.auto .* newsgroups , which present the real experience of car owners from around the world .
The newsgroups do n't have pictures , animation , sound , or video clips , but they have multiple truths .
Okay , enough philosophy and Shakespeare .
This is the point in the infomercial where the guy wearing the CAT Diesel cap asks , " Do I need a college education to build one of these here multiple - truth Web sites ? "
The answer is no .
Step 1 : Put up some magnet content .
The Internet has reduced distribution cost to zero .
So take every document that you 've ever distributed to anyone and put it on your site .
A reasonable example of magnet content , something sufficiently rich to draw readers out , is http://www.photo.net/portraits/intro.
The Internet has reduced distribution cost to zero .
So take every document that you 've ever distributed to anyone and put it on your site .
A reasonable example of magnet content , something sufficiently rich to draw readers out , is http://www.photo.net/portraits/intro.
Step 2 : Develop technical means for collaboration .
Notice that most of the content in http://www.photo.net/portraits/intro falls under the " Reader 's Comments " headline .
They clicked the " add a comment " link and contributed their thoughts and oftentimes photos .
As a site evovles you may find that your happiest hours are spent watching users answer each other 's questions .
You do n't have to be a traditional publisher to benefit from the collaboration systems that you 'll learn how to use by reading the rest of this book .
Manufacturers can collect and redistribute consumer comments about dealers who carry their products .
Academic researchers can collect comments , ideas , and questions sparked by their writings .
Notice that most of the content in http://www.photo.net/portraits/intro falls under the " Reader 's Comments " headline .
They clicked the " add a comment " link and contributed their thoughts and oftentimes photos .
Step 3 : Be prepared to interact with users .
This means that if you have a question - and - answer forum , spend the time to answer the questions .
It also means moderating the forum to delete uninteresting threads .
It means killing idiotic comments on the comment server but keeping the relevant ones , even those that savagely disagree with your point of view .
Does this sound like too much work ?
If your site is commercial and you claim to be a smart businessperson , then you ought to be able to figure out a way to interact with users more cheaply over the Internet than via 800 numbers .
If you are a writer or a photographer who has built a non-commercial site , disintermediating the publisher means total artistic freedom .
User feedback might be annoying at times , but if you want to be insulated from your readers , why publish on the Web at all ?
What happens if you take all of these steps ?
Sometimes magic .
Here 's a passage from Part 2 of my Berlin / Prague story ( http://www.photo.net/bp/part2):
" Die Neue Synagoge on Oranienburger Strasse had a tired Oriental look and was under restoration .
This building demonstrates the power of a single person of conscience .
When the Nazis rolled around on Reichkristallnacht and set fire to the synagogue , a lone policeman decided that it was a valuable historical building .
He got a fire brigade to put the fire out and then arranged an all - night guard for the place .
His efforts were ultimately in vain , for the Nazis had learned something from the Turks in Athens : when you want something to be destroyed , e.g. the Parthenon , put a lot of explosive stuff inside and wait for an accident .
Thus the building was used as an ammo dump and an Allied bomb blew the place to smithereens in 1943 . "
" I read your article about Berlin with great interest .
For the sake of accuracy , the Nazies did not place ammunition in the Neue Synagoge .
It was used as a warehouse .
The basement was used as an office .
The place was bombed and the main sancturary was burned out , only the front part and the walls were kept standing .
After the War , the East Germans blew up the the remains of the sanctuary , " Safety Reasons " .
The front was left to decay .
The front part has been rebuilt , and now it is beeing used as a learning center .
How do I know .
I lived in the Synagogue from before the War until my arrest and eventual incarceration to Auschwitz May 7 .
1943 .
After my Liberation in 1945 , I came back there and visited the place .
In 1994 , I went back to Berlin on a visit , and naturally I went to see the place .
At that time they were rebuilding the place .
In the rubble they had found papers of mine from 1937 to relating to my Barmitzwah .
A year later , I was invited to the rededication ceremony . "

Think of the Web As Primary
www.michaelmoore.com is a site that exists primarily to encourage people to purchase hardcopy books .
Mr. Moore has had enormous commercial success distributing his writings and films through traditional channels and therefore he does n't apparently feel the need to reach an additional audience via the Web .
Mr. Moore would tell you that he is a champion for poor and working - class Americans but his site makes it seem as though his main interest in those people is that they spend $ 20 on his book .
By contrast John S. Denker makes no claims to be serving the underclass .
He is a PhD physicist at Bell Labs who is the author of one of the world 's best books for beginner pilots : See How It Flies .
Although one presumes that John Denker is n't Hollywood wealthy like Michael Moore , he is somehow able to afford to put the full text of his book online at http://www.av8n.com/how/.
Instead of a teaser asking people to buy his book , Denker provides the book .
Why is Denker 's site so much better than Moore's ?
For Denker , the Web is his primary distribution medium .
For Moore the Web is an adjunct to a successful career in traditional media so he can be forgiven for not caring that his site is lame .
Sites that are adjuncts to physical events almost always disappoint .
In October 1995 , the MIT Media Lab threw itself a tenth anniversary party .
The physical event was fabulous : little gifts for everyone , cleverly packaged ; a Photomosaic poster by Rob Silvers ; women in plastic pants .
As an adjunct to the physical event , the Media Lab was going to create the best Web site ever : www.1010.org.
They got Verizon to bring in a dedicated 45 - Mbps T3 network connection so that packets requested by millions of users would not get slowed down working their way through MIT 's backbone before getting to the wider Internet .
Hewlett - Packard donated several racks of of multiprocessor machines with disk arrays .
The Media Lab hired expert consultants to plug all the computers in and hook them up to the network .
They hired professionals to do graphic design and site layout for www.1010.org.
The site launched without any magnet content .
Nobody had written any stories or taken any pictures .
Every day a Media Lab editor posed a question and then sat back to watch a USENET - style discussion evolve .
There were only a handful of postings in each area .
One user had contributed a smiley face : colon dash right - paren .
That was his entire message .
This was n't as shocking as the fact that , on a scale of 1 to 7 , this posting had been rated 4.3 by other users .
Yes , several other users had taken the trouble to rate this three - character posting .
When the 10 - day Web event was over , the massive disk arrays held almost enough user - contributed data to fill two 3.5 - inch floppy disks .
How could so much money and hardware have resulted in a site that an elementary school would have been embarrassed to make public ?
The Web site was n't primary .
The party was the important thing .
The Media Lab , one of the last groups at MIT to put up a Web site , had no real Internet culture .
They wanted to reach corporate managers and bring them into the physical space of the Lab .
Since corporate managers in 1995 did n't tend to have a TCP / IP connection on their desktop , it was n't obvious how Internet would be useful in attaining the Media Lab 's goals .
Do n't try to visit www.1010.org.
The Media Lab eventually got Web - savvy enough to realize the embarrassment value of such a site and pulled the plug on the server .
Money is nice .
Bandwidth is nice .
Graphic design is occasionally nice .
But if you treat your Web site as a pimple on the butt of something much larger then it will probably be ripe for suck.com .
So that you do n't have to break into tomorrow 's Prozac supply , let me close this section on a happy note :
http://www.dannen.com/szilard.html, Gene Dannen 's biography of Leo Szilard , the Hungarian - Jewish theoretical physicist who made the atomic bomb work and then tried to stop Roosevelt from using it .
Dannen says that he is writing a book but surely the Web is a richer place because he got distracted from finishing it and did this site instead .
Since there is n't a " Szilard , the Movie " or " Szilard , the Book " or " Szilard , the Museum " , Leo Szilard Online ended up a rich and fascinating site .
Let 's shift gears now from the first site category ( Web publishing ) and consider the second category : Web - based applications .
What 's Exciting about Web - based Applications ?
Interesting things can happen when you do something as simple as move an application from the desktop to a server .
For example , at a small company once we had the idea of building a server - based replacement for PowerPoint .
We wanted something simpler that we could edit from any Web browser .
Once the slides were in the database , however , we realized that this could be used for collaboration .
User A could authorize User B to edit a presentation and the two of them could authorize User C to give that presentation at a remote site .
Only after talking to people from PowerPoint - oriented organizations did we realize how revolutionary the system , which we called " WimpyPoint " , could be .
Suppose Jane Executive went on vacation for three weeks .
Upon her return she would n't have to start calling colleagues to find out what had been going on ; she could look at the Wimpy Point server and ask to see all presentations created within the last three weeks .
When all the work of an organization is presented within PowerPoint it is a terrible waste to have that work locked up in monolithic files .
Before you get too excited about the WimpyPoint idea , which only took a few days to program , go to www.edwardtufte.com and order a copy of " The Cognitive Style of PowerPoint " to realize just how debased our culture has become .
Many of the following chapters in this book are directed at helping you engineer Web - based services in such a way that users have a pleasant experience while minimizing your costs .
Summary
putting yourself into your user 's shoes before planning your site 's content .
Why would they come to your site and what can you do to make sure their visit is rewarded ?
thinking seriously about the Web 's potential as a medium for collaboration .
In intelligent , thoughtful hands , the Internet is more powerful than the printed page .
creating new ideas for interesting Web - based applications
This chapter was about people talking to computers and people talking to each other with a computer mediator .
The next chapter is about how computers talking to each other could finally deliver all of the benefits that the Computer Age was supposed to have conferred on us ( and , if you insist , how you can make a buck off of it ) .

Reader 's Comments
The Nikon web site is much improved as of 2004 .
You can get a manual in PDF format for any camera .
-- Michael Domino , October 12 , 2004
Alejandro " Alex " Ramirez writes :
The instruction on multiple truths looks good on paper , but let 's talk about its functionality : I am , in real life , a Web Design class student who just finished reading this page .
I was confronted by the comment refuting Nikon 's website 's criticism .
What happens when the graduated Webmaster : makes a website , carefully plans and choreographs it to present his / her view , and then hosts a contradictory account at the end ?
Answer : Uselessness .
The person who has just rewarded the webmaster with his valuable Time will leave , possibly , more Against than for what was expressed in the entire website .
Such as , when 1 ) someone thinks " The author 's site says some good things but -
Hey , if this person is offering guidelines on web publishing , why does their site look so low on design quality ? " ( which happens all the time after reading webmaster 's instructional sites ) or 2 ) someone does not agree with multiple truths .
Truth is not relative ; only perspectives and opinions are .
Example : Neglected wife seeks fellowship with other male figures outside of her partner , Misinterpreting husband assumes marital infidelity , Confronted wife expresses the misinformation and illusion which is being held ; Unreachable husband murders his wife .
What was the truth ?
Summed up from an omniscient view in Example one .
What were the multiple truths ?
Wife :
That loser of a workaholic does n't care about me .
I just want a friend who will listen to me .
Husband : I am trying my best to be a provider for this too - demanding woman .
The following are not just multiple truths ; they are part of the one " Truth " which can only be appreciated from an omniscient narrator to this story :
Wife : I 'm not cheating !
There is no emotional involvement and no physical contact with my male friends !
I have n't even been alone in the same place with them !
Husband : I work all day and come home to find answering machine messages from Joe Shmoe and Guy Doe !
These next comments would be " multiple truths " offered by for or against supporters in the court case for the murdering husband : " Put that animal to sleep ! "
" The gentleman just suffered from some work stress and communicational breakdown barriers .
He should be spared the sentence . "
" Being faithful to him , and then dying at his hand ?
An eye for and eye ! "
" Ah , that woman got what was coming to her .
You do n't have to kiss to cheat on a guy ! "
And the opinions ( a.k.a. multiple truths , ... ) go on and on .
The example of the Berlin / Prague story shows just the very argument for multiple truths : " Although many different opinions might be held , there is only one valid one : the omniscient point of view . "
Our invisible author would write : 1 ) A gentleman wrote a story which contained his idea of what happened , and ; 2 ) another gentleman had another take on the story , because he was there or claimed to be there and have actual first - person knowledge of the site and events which were quoted .
None of us can stake a claim to saying only the truth or holding one of the many individual truths that are supposedly existent .
Therefore , the theory should be rewritten : " Each one holds a view or opinion to the one truth of which no mere human can be the sole owner .
Every individual has the right to hold his or her view on any number of subjects , places , or events .
Nonetheless , no one of these should be the basis for any decision being made . "
This sums up my difficulty with the opinion that is held .
I have to do a paper for a college web design course in which the teacher obviously agreed with this , but not necessarily with the rest of the opinions expressed in the book .
After having to read through each paragraph several times , I first tried to understand everything that is being said .
This might be from lack of clarity in each sentence expression , or lack of clarity in the expression of a true thing .
My opinion ( or fragment of the truth ) states this caused part of the failure of the WWW .
More user time seems spent deciphering through differing opinions and motives than ever becoming conversant in any area or discipline .
If this discussion was not allowed , then the average reader would have to accept the information being told as an absolute .
However ; users can hold to narrow - minded opinions ; I 'll make a list .
Let 's say , justifying genocide , domestic violence in other - than - American - cultures , class structure which maintains the rich rich and the poor poor , incest , rape , bigamy , bestiality , and / or our children 's bombardment with graphic images of all this at schools .
Allowing everyone 's opinion in schools , politics , and even websites would be a very good way of making a free marketplace for militants to find apprentices to their view of life .
This site gets an A + in functionality , browsing through and excellent for user input .
However , my previous assignments taught me the same things without having to convince the world that the author still has his Berlins .
-- Alejandro Ramirez , February 13 , 2005
“ What does $ 456 Billion Buy ? ” – That was the question asked by the Boston Globe in an effort to put the cost of the war on Iraq in perspective .
Their list of alternate ways to spend that money has been making the rounds on the Internet like wild - fire and if you somehow missed it , I would highly recommend that you have a look .
The ones I found the most ironic are that the cost of this war , which is essentially a battle for the oil reserves , could pay for gas used by * every * driver in the United States for 1.2 years and that with just one - sixth of the US money targeted for the Iraq war , you could convert all cars in America to run on ethanol !
On a more disturbing level , the $ 456 billion cost of the war could have fed and educated the world ’s poor for five and a half years , based on the World Bank estimates of what it would take to eliminate starvation and malnutrition globally by 2015 !
Wow !
Unbelievable !
In my bewilderment at these facts I am neither being naïve , not have I been living on Mars .
I have heard / read about the multi-billion dollar tab associated with this war so many times , that to a certain extent I am jaded .
My brain cannot distinguish between numbers once they cross the million dollar mark .
The reason this post shook me up is that it puts the huge jaded numbers a little more in perspective .
We here are personal finance bloggers .
We try and track every dollar ( and in the case of some people , every penny ) we spend .
We scrimp and we save .
We question every purchase before we make it , and when we decide to buy something we make sure we get the best darned deal .
So , let ’s make this a bit more personal .
Let ’s see how much this war is costing each one of us personally .
According to this report of the National Priorities Project , the median income family in the United States paid $ 3,736 in federal income taxes in 2006 .
Out of this , $ 1,354 is spent on military expenditure and to pay the interest for debt related to military .
In other words , around 36 % or a little over one - thirds of the total tax paid is used for military purposes .
Now , check how much your tax payment was this year and check what one third of it comes up to .

That ’s how much * you * individually are paying for this war !
And that is for just the year 2006 !
You have been paying this amount every year for four years now !
Over the past four years , the better half has been paying more than the median income family mentioned above due to his tech industry job , and I have been paying a little less than the median income family due to being a student most of the time .
Without getting into too much detail , and based on some rough back - of - the - envelope calculations , we could have done one of these things , if we did not have to pay for the war .
The better half could have paid for one year of business school in an executive MBA program !
An MBA for the better half is some thing we have thought about on and off , but never really considered seriously due to the prohibitively large cost !
Or , we could have funded IRA ’s in each of our names for every single year for the entire four years I spent in school .
We did n’t because , really , we could n’t afford it !
Or , Instead of driving a 13 year old beat up car with 160 K miles on it , I could be cruising around in a brand new car , heck maybe even an SUV !
( Not that I would even if the cash was handed to me , but that ’s a different issue ) .
Or , on a more fanciful note , we could have a 62 inch flat screen TV + never cooked ( eat out every day ) + hired someone to clean the house and mow the lawn for the entire four years !
Or , we could have possibly had my dream vacation – a trip around the world !
Sigh !
So , what are * you * giving up to sponsor a war that you probably do not support ?

The Assault on Reason , By Al Gore , Penguin , 308 pp. , $ 25.95
Lots of former Bush boosters have been in damage - control mode ever since the spotlights of " shock and awe " that they focused on Iraqis and American liberals began turning back on them .
Some even associate themselves retroactively with the early war skepticism and genuine contrition of William F. Buckley Jr. , who wrote recently , " If I knew then what I know now about what kind of situation we would be in , I would have opposed the [ Iraq ] war . "
Al Gore is having none of it .
In his new work , " The Assault on Reason , " he quotes Buckley 's confession and answers , " One of the central points of this book is that we as Americans should have ' known then what we know now ' -- not only about . . .
Iraq but also about the climate crisis , and what would happen if the levees failed to protect New Orleans . . . and about many other fateful choices that have been made on the basis of flawed and even outright false information . "
Gore insists that Bush boosters , especially , had every reason to know but made reason itself their enemy .
And they intimidated us " as Americans " out of our civic - republican capacity to work up sound public intelligence through open communication , disciplined inquiry , and the self - confidence not to jump to conclusions .
While the pre-Bush past was n't quite as Periclean as Gore implies , he 's right that it 's " simply no longer possible to ignore the strangeness of our public discourse . "
Something has changed for the worse , and Gore names not William Kristol or Rupert Murdoch , but viruses they carry that are weakening our " immune system " against sound - bite alarmism .
The most virulent of these , he thinks , is " corporate consolidation and control over the marketplace of ideas , " which diminish entrepreneurial and democratic freedoms by monopolizing the electronic media , whose relentless , ever - more - intimate intrusions are turning us from active citizens into passive consumers , sapping our disposition and skill to govern ourselves .
Gore is n't remotely conspiratorial or anticapitalist about this , as some may claim .
He revives analyses of the public sphere by Walter Lippmann , Marshall McLuhan , and Jürgen Habermas to show how TV's one - directional image - making stimulates impulsiveness over reflection .
Print 's " meaningless " symbols make you think ; repetitively violent TV imagery does the opposite , leaving a mental " vacuum . . . filled by fear , superstition , ideology , deception , intolerance , and obsessive secrecy . "
Recent books by columnist Frank Rich and psychologist Drew Westin cover parts of this ground well , but what public leader has synthesized such material to reach out to us ?
Gore taps James Madison , Thomas Jefferson , political theory , new technology , and cognitive and developmental psychology to blame the " withdrawal of reason from the public sphere " on profit - crazed disruptions of what should be the mutually reinforcing openness of free markets and democratic communication .
He notes that Internet openness is reviving the mental stimulation of reading and writing , and its interactivity is reviving Revolutionary - era pamphleteering , generating new " committees of correspondence " and strengthening a " meritocracy of ideas " instead of letting conglomerates corner the " marketplace of ideas . "
Some damage - controllers will sniff that Gore is naive and that , anyway , politics is n't ultimately about reason .
But Gore 's faith in human nature is braver and sharper than theirs .
And he was prescient about the Internet 's importance , even if he exaggerated his presence at its creation .
This book is n't about him ; it 's about the republic whose freedoms depend on increasing reasoned debate and reducing intimidating noise .
He 's betting that democratic interactivity , not bombastic ideology , can strengthen the public immune system to support choices smarter and tougher than gas - guzzling convenience and what 's viewed by many as a useless , spectator war .
If Hillary Clinton or Barack Obama stumbles , Gore may run .
He won the popular vote in 2000 , after all ; he foresaw the threats to communication , climate , and our diplomatic credibility ; and his movie , " An Inconvenient Truth , " showcased a leader who 's grown ( although in one way too many for the image - driven media he scorns ) .
But this is n't a campaign book or another venture in teaching and advocacy .
It 's a deep public remonstrance , inspired a little by Tom Paine 's " Common Sense , " which combined anger at King George III in his day with larger arguments that the institution of monarchy itself had become a threat to our liberties .
Gore is no Paine , but he argues persuasively that Bush 's tenure is no longer a constitutional presidency .
The book is part polemic , part impeachment in hard covers .
Let the TV blowhards who will claim it 's ponderous prove they can do better by turning Gore 's harsh charges into hard questions for the would - be presidents who are assaulting us -- and reason -- with televised body language and cheap slogans .

It seems like a foregone conclusion that the hit online animation Homestar Runner and his cartoon friends will end up alongside Meatwad , Space Ghost , Brock Sampson and the other pop culture icons on Cartoon Network 's Adult Swim – a block of cartoons for grownups .
Unfortunately for this would - be marriage , the only people who think Homestar is n't quite right for Adult Swim are the character 's creators , Matt and Mike Chapman .
In perhaps a first , the Atlanta - based Chapman brothers have turned down both Comedy Central and Cartoon Network to stay on the web .
" There was a brief flirtation with Comedy Central and Adult Swim , " Matt said .
" The whole TV thing seemed creepy .
They wanted to plug it into their model – that all comedy was gag - related , not character - driven .
They left the door open , but we liked what we were doing and kept doing it online . "
With Time Warner 's Cartoon Network and Adult Swim also headquartered in Atlanta , it seemed natural for Homestar to jump in with them .
But a deal has failed to materialize , and the Chapmans are in no hurry to strike up conversations again .
" Being in Atlanta , we have friends that work there , but we 're not waiting for a big reconciliation , " Matt said .
" What they do works for them , but if we were doing our show there , we ’d still have producers telling us what to do , what to change , what to write , etc .
We love the control and the immediacy that writing and creating cartoons on the website brings us .
As the ideas come , we can do whatever our whim is that week . "
Homestar Runner is so popular now that revenues generated by the site ’s merchandise sales allow its creators to devote their professional lives to the cartoons .
The Chapmans created their first animated short featuring the goofy , armless Homestar Runner back in 2000 , using Adobe Flash .
Homestar 's online antics became a hit on the web , and the audience grew through word of mouth .
The brief Flash cartoons were polished and full of dry , hip , postmodern humor .
Supporting players like Strong Bad and The Poopsmith had star power drawn all over them .
Even though talks with Comedy Central and Cartoon Network faltered , the pair would still like to do TV in the future .
" We made those contacts , " Matt said .
" When we want to do something else , we would be interested in that business . "

Spotplex Inc. on Monday announced a new content - aggregation site that it said will provide Digg.com - like rankings of Internet content -- with a twist .
Instead of requiring users to rank content , Spotplex will automatically rank it based on the number of people reading it .
In addition , Spotplex -- launched by Dialpad Communications Inc. founder Doyon Kim -- will provide a widget , or small piece of HTML code , that bloggers can embed in their sites to measure traffic .
The goal of Spotplex is to reach the large number of people who read content on social networks and other Internet sites but are n't inclined to submit votes or to rank that content , said CEO Kim , who sold Dialpad to Yahoo Inc. in 2005 .
" We are not asking people to change their behavior , " he said .
" Instead , this is our responsibility as a service provider -- capturing people 's intentions or opinions without asking them to change . "
Spotplex uses an algorithm to measure and analyze reader behavior in real time while offering community features such as user comments .
Graphical tools for each post give users insight into the article and blog traffic , Kim added .
Bloggers can insert the Spotplex code into their sites and begin tracking the number of article reads , which is also updated on the Spotplex site , Kim said .
In addition , Spotplex offers widgets that can analyze reader traffic on blogs and list other popular articles on blog sites to keep readers once they arrive , he added .
Spotplex said it also provides a tool that measures the relative popularity of an article compared to a site 's overall traffic , which will help focused blogs compete with those with larger audiences .

I 've collected the first twenty - one digests here .
One nice study of triangles has been made by Miroslav Vicher .
His web page is here .
In particular , his research into convexity under certain rules is worth looking at .
Maybe atomic stability and triangular convexity are related problems .
No - one knows , yet .
The atomic stability problem might be easier to solve than Eternity .
The official site for Eternity is at http://www.eternity-puzzle.co.uk/ .
Eternity will soon be on sale in many more countries .
So far , the one hint I can give is that marking the grid on the pieces is enormously helpful .
It sped up my exploration of the hexadudes by a factor of at least four .
So , if you have an Eternity set , you should mark the triangular grid on each piece , on each side .
What are the pieces ?
You can see them by following the official rules : " 2 . No purchase necessary to enter competition .
For details and everything needed to enter , write to Ertl Europe Ltd , FREEPOST Falcon Road , Exeter EX2 7LB , England .
This is at no cost . "
The pieces have been eradicated from the web for legal / insurance reasons .
Here 's a puzzle for Eternity from Patrick Hamlyn -- Arrange 72 Eternity pieces to make 8 hexagons .
Lew Baxter found nine :
{ 1,3,40,62,94,101,106,168,199} { 5,7,13,16,52,55,65,93,196} { 8,15,20,34,54,110,112,117,192}
{ 11,25,53,75,83,91,111,141,163} { 12,35,44,46,89,99,119,126,131} { 18,61,82,95,103,123,133,175,207}
{ 19,23,31,32,33,161,167,169,202} { 21,22,51,78,109,127,160,194,205} { 37,56,60,63,97,104,113,188,201}
Lew has found a total of 77 sets of 9 disjoint 9 piece hexagon tilings .
There are no 10 disjoint tilings .
Ever since I read the Times article , I 've been curious .
Exactly what set of pieces did Monckton use for his puzzle ?
It was n't polyominoes , polyiamonds , or polytans .
It turned out to be a new set of pieces , which I have called polydrafters .
Each piece in the Eternity puzzle is made from twelve 30 - 60 - 90 triangles , also known as a Drafter 's Triangle ( or Draughter 's Triangle ) .
It seems that Christopher Monckton is the first person to do an exploration of these pieces .
He ( CM ) called the pieces polydudes ( since they are cool and not square ) .
I 've decided to follow his naming convention for the ' sturdy polydrafters ' explained below .
William Waite and Wei-Hwa Huang ( his study here ) both did explorations of polydrafters in 1998 .
There are 6 didrafters ( plus 7 rejected shapes ) , 14 tridrafters , 64 tetradrafters , 237 pentadrafter , 1014 hexadrafters , 4124 heptadrafters , and 17705 octadrafters .
Many thanks to Bob Harris , Joseph DeVincentis , and Brendan Owen for calculating the higher numbers .
One thing to note in the diagram above ( Miroslav Vicher ) -- four pieces indicated go ' against the grain ' of the rest of the figure .
If you are writing a program to solve Eternity , keep this in mind .
Miroslav Vicher has found 75 different convex figures with the tridrafters !
The tridrafters thus make an unexpectedly rich set for polyformists .
The Association of Professional Flight Attendants uses a tridrafter as their logo .
The tridrafters make for a fairly nice set of puzzle pieces .
I had a weekly challenge to come up with figures for these pieces .
Three of the interesting figures are below .
Sawblade and Pinwheel by Bob Harris and a solvable Samarai by William Waite .
Joe DeVincentis noticed that none of the Eternity pieces seems to have any 30 degree vertices , or weakly hanging triangles .
Christopher Monckton eliminated these pieces to make a safer , sturdier puzzle .
I 'll call these piece sturdy polydrafters .
Christopher Monckton calls them polydudes .
Under this scheme , there 3 didrafters , 1 tridrafter , 9 tetradrafters , 15 pentadrafters , 59 hexadrafters , 152 heptadrafters , 517 octadrafters , 1547 nonadrafters , and 5064 decadrafters , 16123 hendecadrafters , and 52630 dodecadrafters .
The 15 pentadudes ( Miroslav Vicher )
The Eternity Puzzle is rife with parity issues .
We 'll ignore that for now , and instead look at the 59 Hexadudes .
Is there a convex figure they can cover ?
Yes , there is !
Patrick Hamlyn solved it .
The pieces are colored by their parity ( balanced , plus two , plus four , plus six ) .
The 59 hexadudes colored by up / down parity , left / right parity , and east / west parity .
The three parities of ETERNITY -- up / down , left / right , and east / west
For Eternity , a computer can help search for a solution .
At some point , the program may have a partial solution , but the remaining pieces may not be able to fill the remaining area due to parity .
There are twelve ways a 30 - 60 - 90 triangle can be oriented .
They can be colored in three different ways .
The balance of a piece cannot be changed with rotations or translations .
The parity of the pieces in Eternity
up / down parity left / right parity east / west parity balanced = 116 pieces balanced = 89 pieces balanced = 51 pieces parity 2 = 90 pieces parity 2 = 112 pieces parity 2 = 121 pieces parity 4 = 3 pieces parity 4 = 8 pieces parity 4 = 32 pieces parity 6 = 5 pieces
In the parity spreadsheet , all of the pieces have a total parity of divisible by 4 .
Here is why .
For the octadudes , the parity distribution is : 132 ( 0 2 2 ) , 100 ( 2 0 2 ) , 95 ( 0 0 0 ) , 87 ( 2 2 0 ) , 36 ( 0 0 4 ) , 34 ( 2 2 4 ) , 21 ( 2 4 2 ) , 17 ( 0 4 0 ) , 7 ( 4 0 0 ) , 7 ( 0 4 4 ) , 4 ( 4 2 2 ) , 3 ( 2 0 6 ) , 3 ( 0 2 6 ) , and 1 ( 2 6 0 ) .
Bob Harris considered the eternity parity trifecta .
Any eternity piece can be oriented so that it 's E/ W balance is postive ( east - heavy ) and it's L/R balance is also positive ( left - heavy ) .
You can then assign a < E/ W , L/R , U/D > vector to each piece .
For example , piece 1 is < 2,2,-4 >.
A : 68 are < 2,2,0 > B : 25 are < 0,0,0 > C : 24 are < 2,0 , -2 > D : 24 are < 2,0,2 > E : 23 are < 0,2,2 > F : 14 are < 4,0,0 > G : 9 are < 4,2, -2 > H : 6 are < 4,2,2 > I : 4 are < 6,2,0 > J : 3 are < 2,4,-2 > K : 3 are < 4,4,0 > L : 2 are < 2,2,-4 > M : 2 are < 0,4,0 > N : 1 is < 0,0,4 > O : 1 is < 6,0,2 >
It turns out C and D should be combined .
The above table has a few mistakes .
Here is a different enumeration of vectors .
Also , Swiss Knife Software has made a ' hardness ' list for the pieces of Eternity .
I 'll be adding other data as soon as I can .
There are only four methods to affect parity .
These are the four states that any piece can be placed in , as far as its parities are concerned .
A plus (+ ) means the parity is unaffected , a minus ( -) means the sign of the parity is changed .
E L U
method W : + + + ( do n't move , rotate 120 , rotate 240 )
method X : - + - ( rotate 60 , rotate 180 , rotate 300 )
method Y : + - - ( flip over , flip and rotate 120 , flip and rotate 240 )
method Z : - - + ( flip and rotate 60 , flip and rotate 180 , flip and rotate 300 )
For any packing , there are essentially 60 state counts .
For example , EX is the count of pieces of class E that are placed in state X . Following this , one obtains 17 equations with 58 unknowns with a constraint that all unknowns are positive integers .
What is the fewest number of pieces that can be placed on the board to make a solution impossible for parity reasons ?
E/W parity equation : 2 ( AW - AX+AY - AZ ) + 2 ( CW - CX+CY - CZ ) +
2 ( DW - DX+DY - DZ ) + ... + 6 ( OW - OX+OY - OZ ) = 0
L/R parity equation : 2 ( AW+AX - AY - AZ ) + 2 ( EW+EX -EY - EZ ) + 2 ( GW+GX - GY - GZ ) + ... + 4( MW+MX - MY - MZ ) = 0
U/D parity equation : - 2( CW-CX-CY+CZ ) +
2 ( DW - DX - DY+DZ ) + 2 ( EW - EX - EY +EZ ) + ... + 2( OW - OX - OY+OZ ) = 0
If you color the pieces by parity , they seem to group together in a mostly filled pattern .
Ishihama Yoshiaki has written several interactive Java programs that generate drafters .
The programs are fascinating to watch .
He 's written a 12 nonadrafter hexagon , 48 nonadrafter hexagon , 36 dodecadrafter hexagon , and a 16 nonadrafter rectangle .
This looks like an interesting new type of cellular automata .
Eternity is not an easy puzzle to solve .
If you play poker online you will know that there are always strategies and sequences that lead to the winning hand .
It is also important to understand the odds involved .
With poker and Eternity alike you have to see the greater picture in order to win the game .
Who will solve the Eternity Puzzle ?
If you can make a nice figure from the tridrafters , then you might be able to solve Eternity .
I 'm no longer so sure that the puzzle cannot be solved by computer .
The figure below was found via computer , by Patrick M Hamlyn .
I long thought that this problem was unsolvable , but there it is .
How hard is this puzzle ?
I 've made a little test puzzle from just 7 pieces , so that you can get an idea of your solving ability with puzzles of this type .
Arrange these 7 pieces into a convex shape .
If that 's not enough , here is a set of 7 pieces , and a set of 8 pieces .
This time , I used pieces from the set of hexadudes ( sturdy hexadrafters ) .
Rearrange each set to form a perfect rectangle .
A harder puzzle , arrange these twelve shapes into a convex figure .
Send me the answer if you solve this last one .
Senator Harry Reid of Nevada , the Democratic leader , also called for an investigation by the Justice Department .
“ The allegations against Congressman Foley are repugnant , but equally as bad is the possibility that Republican leaders in the House of Representatives knew there was a problem and ignored it to preserve a Congressional seat this election year , ” Mr. Reid said .
The public deserves “ a full accounting for this despicable episode , ” he added .
In his letter to Mr. Gonzales , Mr. Hastert drew a line between what he described as “ two different and distinct communications at issue here ” — the e-mail messages to the Louisiana boy that Republicans considered “ overfriendly , ” and the more intimate messages that surfaced later and that leaders say they never saw .
Jennifer Crider , a spokeswoman for Ms. Pelosi , said Mr. Hastert seemed “ more concerned by who revealed the Republican leadership ’s cover - up of Mr. Foley ’s Internet stalking ” than about the pages .
Mr. Hastert also wrote Gov. Jeb Bush of Florida asking for an investigation by the Florida Department of Law Enforcement .
The authorities there , both local and state , said on Sunday that they had not begun one so far .
Garry Wilson , chief deputy sheriff in St. Lucie County , said his office would not try to search Mr. Foley ’s condominium on Hutchinson Island unless a complaint was filed against him in the county or unless state or federal law enforcement directed the sheriff ’s office to do so .
In Washington , the clerk of the House has taken responsibility for Mr. Foley ’s Congressional office , and the locks have been changed .
Associates of Mr. Foley said he was apparently in seclusion in Florida .
For a third straight day , fallout surrounding Mr. Foley ’s resignation worried the weary ranks of Congressional Republicans .
As representatives begin the final month of campaigning before the midterm elections , several Republican advisers said on Sunday that they feared that the scandal over the e-mail messages threatened to complicate their efforts .
If nothing else , they said , it provides another reason for voters to be displeased with Congress .
Economy Affordable Public Health Care in the US By Ryan McGreal
Published May 18 , 2007
In various recent news reports , a number of US corporations are starting to recommend that the US adopt some kind of single - payer health care system as a response to skyrocketing health care costs .
Predictably , this is running into serious interference from investors and managers in the health care industry , plus the extensive ' bought priesthood ' of pro-market pundits and analysts .
Their arguments gain additional traction from the pervasive , self - serving mantra in the US that the government can't do anything right .
Resource Allocation and Market Efficiency
Market price brings supply and demand into balance in part by pricing some potential buyers out of the market .
If you cannot afford something , you have no economic " demand " for it ( even if you need it to survive ) .
Economists call this " rationing " because it allocates resources based on ability and willingness to pay .
Public health care systems , by contrast , use non-price rationing : allocating resources based on medical need as assessed by doctors , triage nurses , and so on .
According to market ideology , goverment monopolies are inherently inefficient because efficiency is n't rewarded financially .
Markets maximize allocative efficiency - directing flows of investment into where they will generate the best return .
Since market forces do n't apply in a government system , the argument goes , capital is mis-allocated and people have no incentive to cut waste or respond to demand .
However , the evidence is inescapable : universal , single - payer health care costs less and works better than private health care .
By costs less I mean less money must go into the system to fund it .
By works better I mean everyone has medical coverage , and decisions on how to allocate and ration care are based on medical need rather than ability to pay .
These two properties of universal , single - payer health care only seem contradictory to people who look at the problem through the filter of free market ideology rather than looking at what 's actually happening .
Public Health Care is Not a Monopoly
A monopoly refers to a single seller for a product ( i.e. buyers have no choice and the seller is protected from competition ) .
With single - payer health care , there is a single buyer and many sellers .
The government does n't provide the health care services , so the health care system is n't a government monopoly .
This changes pretty dramatically the dynamics of the business .
In particular , patients have freedoms and choices that a private market cannot provide .
You can choose which doctor or medical centre to use ( as long as they 're accepting patients ) and get a second ( or third ) opinion if you 're unsatisfied .
Doctors make medical decisions based on what you need .
They do n't order unnecessary tests to avoid potential liability or deny services because it's not covered or you have a pre-existing condition .
Even in a " free market " for health care , there 's still going to be some provision for the poor , because most people are not psychopaths .
That means you 're going to pay for someone 's health care through your taxes no matter what .
However , because the mishmash of Medicare , Medicaid , charity , and written - off accounts payable are inefficient and ineffective , Americans end up paying as much in taxes to support their broken fragments of a system as Canadians spend to finance their entire system .
Undermining Health Care
None of this has stopped the corporatist right wing from trying to undermine public health care since its inception , with a relentlessly negative propaganda campaign about how public health care would cost a fortune , be a bureaucratic nightmare , and kill patients through incompetence , cronyism and rampant waste .
Of course , the exact opposite happened : costs grew much more slowly than in the US , coverage was extended to just about everyone in the country , and medical professionals retained their competence at diagnosing and treating illness .
They somehow managed to find the motivation to stay in the country and work for ' only ' $ 100,000 - $ 500,000 a year , depending on their specialty .
Rich conservatives in Canada resent the fact that they can't buy their way to the front of the line - that care is allocated by triage , or medical need .
To paraphrase Richard Perle ,
There 's got to be some advantage to being super - rich .
Above all , they resent the fact that it 's hard to get rich off treating sick people .
They can't get rich off fat contracts with manufacturers , risk selection against pre-existing conditions , or legislated corruption like the ghostwritten provision in the US pharmacare bill that forbids the government from negotiating volume discounts for its purchases .
Corrosive Cronyism
This last part is really significant : where cronyism and corruption destroy public - private enterprises is where for - profit corporations are able to lobby governments to change the conditions of their contracts in ways that benefit the corporations at the public expense .
Because for - profit health care is ( more or less ) illegal in Canada , the people providing care are either non-profit hospital corporations or individual doctors / small businesses billing directly to the government on a fee - for - service , capitation , or combined basis .
In other words , Canadian medical professionals are not a bloc of executives , investors , and lobbyists in a for - profit corporate environment who have been socialized and selected to try and game the system .
Instead , the people working in the Canadian health care system generally support the ethical principle of universality , make a good living providing it , and recognize the myriad tangible benefits of a health care system that , for example , does n't leave pockets of squalor where diseases can fester and threaten the larger population .
Further , their organizational affiliations ( the federal and provincial medical associations , nurses ' unions , etc. ) are democratic organizations in which every member has an equal say in what the organization stands for , rather than for - profit corporations where one 's vote is equal to one 's share of ownership .
When they lobby the government , they lobby for what their members want , not for what their owners want .
What their members want is good governance .
Savings and Efficiencies
In a universal , single - payer system , there 's little or no need for accounts payable departments , collection agencies , vast legal departments , marketing and advertising teams , auditors , investigators , and all the encrustation that piles up on for - profit health care providers .
They do n't need it because the billing system is straightforward , there 's only one payer , and they 're not in competition with each other for market share .
In fact , as I hinted above , it would be possible for the US to operate a Canadian - style health care system for what they 're already spending on Medicare and Medicaid .
According to the World Health Organization 's World Health Report 2005 [ PDF ] , the US government spends $ 2,368 USD per person per year on public spending toward health care ( out of a total of $ 5,274 per person per year ) .
In Canada , total ( public and private combined ) health care spending is only $ 2,222 USD per person per year .
Of that , the government spends $ 1,552 .
In other words , Americans ' taxes would not go up , but their out of pocket expenses and payroll costs would do down , making the country more productive and more competitive .
The Two Systems Cannot Coexist
Opponents of public health care often argue that they should be allowed to maintain a private system based on ability to pay that runs " parallel " to the public system .
The problem is that as soon as you introduce for - profit health care corporations , they immediately start trying to game the system to their benefit by pouring money into the campaigns of politicians who will support them by changing the rules to ensure their profitability and crowd out ' unfair ' competition from the public system .
At the same time , people who choose to pay for " parallel " care resent having their taxes go to support the public system .
This results in underinvestment , draining the public system of resources and establishing a spiral of declining care , which pushes more people into private care , further undermining the public system .
This is what happened in the US .
Forty years ago , the US and Canada had very similar health care systems : private , for - profit , mostly consisting of individuals and small corporations .
After Canada adopted universal care ( like nearly every other industrialized country ) and the US did not , they diverged rapidly and markedly .
Canada continues to be a system of mostly small , independent health care providers , and its large organizations are democratic and represent their membership .
The US has been taken over by huge corporations with vast resources that are poured into lobbying , graft , cronyism , pork - barreling , and ghost - written legislation that locks in their power , insulates them from competition and guarantees their profits .
As a result , the US health care system is the fastest growing industry ( especially after the housing boom collapsed ) , and is on track to swallowing 20 percent of GDP in a couple of decade or so if growth trends do not change .
This fact , of course , is why some manufacturing companies are considering a public system in the first place .
As long as big , for - profit corporations are delivering health care in the US , the system will never be fair , it will never be democratic , and it wo n't even be capitalistic , in the sense of competition in a free market .
The health care industry would never allow it .
Inherent Stability
Canada broke the backs of its health industry parasites before they became too big to manage ; the US did not , and is now stuck with a bloated , corrupt leviathan of self - serving pork that sucks real wealth out of the economy , leaves some people under- medicalized and others over - medicalized , and dumps most of its research and development money into expensive , dependency - inducing disease management instead of prevention and vanity interventions instead of holistic care .
This bears repeating : a big part of why the Canadian system sustains itself as well as it does is that it simply is n't under nearly as much pressure from industry to compromise public values for private profit .
It 's the reason we can afford universal care for what Americans pay toward Medicare and Medicaid .
It 's the reason our total medical expenses ( public and private ) are only half the total US medical expenses , but we still manage to extend care universally .
A country can try to balance a triangle on one point and exhaust yourself keeping it upright ( by trying to stop health care corporations from peddling influence ) , or it can establish a system that inherently tends toward balance and stability .
Market forces , however useful , are simply not appropriate to solve every problem , and certainly not every public policy problem .
Market Demand is Incompatible with Medical Need
The ultimate failure of market - based health care , even if a country somehow manages to keep your corporations in check , is that the effective demand for health care ( medical need ) is not correlated or compatible with market demand ( ability to pay ) .
As soon as you have to introduce a public bureaucracy to cover the market failures among those people who need medical care but can't afford it , you establish capital and operating costs for providing that public stopgap .
The public health infrastructure is approximately a fixed cost , so you want to maximize the utility of that fixed cost by extending coverage to more people and reducing the per capita fixed expense of the system .
It turns out the best way to do this is to extend public health care to everyone .
The savings from eliminating means testing , auditing , investigations , and so on ( since people no longer have to jump through hoops to prove that they are entitled to coverage ) cover a big chunk of the variable cost of providing care to all those extra people .
Affordable Public Health Care
The savings from eliminating profit and the other encrustations of corporate health care , plus the economies of scale from a single buyer cover the rest of the variable cost of providing care to all those extra people .
Voila : you 've just extended universal health care to every American without raising taxes .
You 've reduced payroll costs by thousands of dollars per worker per year .
You 've reduced out - of - pocket expenses , co-pays , and fees .
You 've reduced the cost of going into business for oneself .
You 've reduced the cost of small businesses hiring more employess .
You 've reduced the incidence of bankruptcies due to illness .
You 've also reduced the incidence of disease outbreaks among populations with little or no access to health care .
The conceptual benefit of theoretical " market freedom " is piss in the wind next to a sustainable program that 's affordable , effective , efficient , maximizes freedom of choice for all citizens , is fair and equitable , and supports empathy across a mixed , diverse population .

In Part 1 , we cloned PFP , a library for computing with probability distributions .
PFP represents a distribution as a list of possible values , each with an associated probability .
But in the real world , things are n't always so easy .
What if we wanted to pick a random number between 0 and 1 ?
Our previous implementation would break , because there 's an infinite number of values between 0 and 1 --- they do n't exactly fit in a list .
As it turns out , Sungwoo Park and colleagues found an elegant solution to this problem .
They represented probability distributions as sampling functions , resulting in something called the λ ◯ calculus .
( I have no idea how to pronounce this ! )
With a little bit of hacking , we can use their sampling functions as a drop - in replacement for PFP .
A common interface
Since we will soon have two ways to represent probability distributions , we need to define a common interface .
type Weight = Float class ( Functor d , Monad d ) =>
Dist d where weighted :: [ ( a , Weight ) ] -> d a uniform :: Dist d => [ a ] -> d a uniform = weighted . map ( \ x -> ( x , 1 ) )
The function uniform will create an equally - weighted distribution from a list of values .
Using this API , we can represent a two - child family as follows :
data Child = Girl | Boy deriving ( Show , Eq , Ord ) child :: Dist d => d Child child = uniform [ Girl , Boy ] family :: Dist d => d [ Child ] family = do child1 <- child child2 <- child return [ child1 , child2 ]
Now , we need to implement this API two different ways :
Once with lists , and a second time with sampling functions .
Finite distibutions , revisted
The monad from part 1 now becomes :
type FDist = PerhapsT ( [ ] ) instance Dist FDist where weighted [ ] = error " Empty distribution " weighted xws = PerhapsT ( map weight xws ) where weight ( x , w ) = Perhaps x ( P ( w / sum ) ) sum = foldl ' ( + ) 0 ( map snd xws ) exact :: FDist a -> [ Perhaps a ] exact = runPerhapsT
We can run this as follows :
> exact family [ Perhaps [ Girl , Girl ] 25.0 % , Perhaps [ Girl , Boy ] 25.0 % , Perhaps [ Boy , Girl ] 25.0 % , Perhaps [ Boy , Boy ] 25.0 % ]
Sampling functions
This second part is also easy .
First , we define a type Rand a , which represents a value of type a computed using random numbers .
We implement Rand by reduction to Haskell 's IO monad .
( There 's any number of other ways to do this , of course . )
newtype Rand a = Rand { runRand :: IO a } random Float :: Rand Float randomFloat = Rand ( getStdRandom ( random ) )
Next , we make Rand a trivial , sequential monad :
instance Functor Rand where fmap = liftM instance Monad Rand where return x = Rand ( return x ) r >>= f = Rand ( do x <- runRand r runRand ( f x ) )
We can turn any FDist into a Rand by picking an element at random :
instance Dist Rand where weighted = liftF .
weighted liftF :: FDist a ->
Rand a liftF fdist = do n <- random Float pick ( P n ) ( runPerhapsT fdist ) pick :: Monad m => Prob -> [ Perhaps a ] -> m a pick _ [ ] = fail " No values to pick from " pick n (( Perhaps x p ) : ps ) | n <= p = return x | otherwise = pick ( n - p ) ps
Of course , a single random sample wo n't do us much good .
We need functions for repeated sampling and for displaying the results :
sample :: Rand a ->
Int ->
Rand [ a ] sample r n = sequence ( replicate n r ) sampleIO r n = runRand ( sample r n ) histogram :: Ord a => [ a ] -> [
Int ] histogram = map length .
group .
sort
And sure enough , we get a nice , even distribution :
> liftM histogram ( sampleIO family 1000 ) [ 243 , 242 , 254 , 261 ]
That 's it !
Two monads for the price of one .

The word contractor helps launder the fear and threat out of a more accurate term : " paramilitary force . "
We 're not supposed to have such forces in the United States , but we now do .
And if we have them , we have a potential threat to democracy .
On U.S. soil , Blackwater so far has shown few signs of being an out - and - out rogue retainer army , though they looked the part in New Orleans .
But were this country to become even a little less stable , outfits like Blackwater might see a heyday .
If the United States falls into a period of instability caused by another catastrophic terrorist attack , an economic meltdown that triggers social unrest , or a series of environmental disasters , such paramilitary forces , protected and assisted by fellow ideologues in the police and military , could ruthlessly abolish what is left of our eroding democracy .
War , with the huge profits it hands to corporations , and to right - wing interests such as the Christian Right , could become a permanent condition .
And the thugs with automatic weapons , black uniforms and wraparound sunglasses who appeared on the streets in New Orleans could appear on our streets .
Web Trend Map 2007 Version 2.0
We have done it before : the 200 most successful websites pinned down on the Tokyo Metro Map , ordered by category , proximity , success , popularity , and perspective .
Now we have done it again — and better .
Back by popular demand : here is iA ’s next Web Trend Map :
Download It !
We figured that this would make a nice desktop background image as well .
So here are some wallpapers to download and replace that ugly Windows Vista crap or the boring blue Apple background image .
We ’ve also included a big A3 version and an OSX screensaver .
What ’s New ?
First of all , the new Trend Map features many more websites than the previous one .
While the focus is still on English language sites ( because that ’s where it ’s at ) , we have added some Japanese ones ( a mystery to most of you gaijin ) , some German ones ( yeah , there are some popular ones ) and a Chinese line ( the second Internet ) .
More Consistency :
The different trend lines have been renamed , simplified and cleaned up .
Now , if you follow the Technology line — you will find tech sites ; if you follow the News line — you will find news sites .
More Lines :
The original raster ( Tokyo metro map ) has been substantially modified to fit the needs of an Internet Trend Map .
Less Japanese Jokes :
There are less insider jokes about the different stations and more consistency between the connections and the neighborhoods of the different sites .
Still , people who know Tokyo will find lots of little hints and sarcastic comments hidden in there .
Google has moved from Shibuya , a humming place for young people , to Shinjuku , a suspicious , messy , Yakuza - controlled , but still pretty cool place to hang out ( cf. Golden Gai ) .
YouTube has conquered Shibuya .
Microsoft has moved to Ikebukuro , if you know what I mean .
Yahoo is in Ueno — a nice place , but nothing going on there .
Wikipedia is now in Shimbashi , the place for square and hard - headed salarymen — a bit like the Wikipedia watchdogs .
The Chinese line runs parallel to the “ Sharing line ” , which starts with the main pirates …
Paper info designer Edward Tufte is directly below the Federated Media , right before joining with the interactive information design circle at a 90 degree angle .
“ You ” are in the Emperor ’s palace , at the center of the network .
Revealing Coincidences
The main Japanese sites are all on the Money line .
I never noticed before , but most big Japanese sites are financially successful .
The northern part of the Main Sites line ( the Yamanote line ) is a boring , unknown territory ( just like in the real Tokyo ) .
Ze Frank ended up close to the German carousel .
iA ended up close to the pirates .
Adobe moved from Ginza ( high class ) to Tokyo station ( anonymous , lots of money there ) , alluding to the fact that they continue to move towards the center of gravity without being too loud about it .
Skype has conquered a place that does n’t exist .
Insiders Circle and Your Palace :
There is a new Insiders circle , with the tech trend scouts , the tech bloggers … and You , occupying the Emperor ’s palace .
Trend Forecast :
Of course , you will notice that we added a weather forecast .
This is our six month prognosis for each candidate ( no big surprises there ) .
Web 0.5 , 1.0 , 1.5 , 2.0 , 2.5 ?
Last but not least , we have added a Web Generation number ( Is it Web 1.0 or Web 2.0 ?
Is it corn or is it a nut ? ) .
I do n’t want to spoil all of the little things in there , but please note that there are some websites that are Web 1.5 , some that are 2.5 , and some that are 0.5 .
This is not a mistake .
Web 2.5 is what Facebook is up to …
Web 0.5 is what Jakob Nielsen is still doing .
The Generation number is not necessarily qualifying , but it ’s not surprising that websites that do well are usually above 1.0 ; some of them ( like eBay and Wikipedia ) were 2.0 long before the term was coined .
More Mistakes :
Of course , there are some totally absurd and meaningless coincidences , due to the complexity of the map .
There might also be some misspellings and , here and there , you may discover something totally obsolete .
Please feel free to comment on these goofs .
Also , if you feel that we forgot a ( your ) major site , put a wrong weather forecast or got the Web Generation number wrong , please tell us .
Less Logos :
You might have noticed that we had to take off the inverted Tokyo Metro logo , featured in an early version of the first Trend Map .
This is because they asked us to .
We respect the decision of the Tokyo Metro Corporation , but we still believe that it was n’t a smart move for them .
The map has been downloaded 10,000 times and has been featured in traditional and online media all around the world .
For a couple of weeks , it was one of the cooler tech advertising spots on the net .
Sponsor It !
We are now offering the free space in the lower left corner to sponsors .
If you have a company and you want to be featured as a sponsor , feel free to contact us .
There are ten spaces available , for US $ 2,000 each .
You can also buy the whole adspace for yourself .
Your sponsorship will be featured in all versions of the map over the next 6 months :
1. Desktop background images .
2. Printable A3 - size PDF .
3. Clickable webpage .
4 . A big poster that will follow as soon as we have the sponsors .
5 . A simple screen saver .
Who gets the space ?
Basically , it is first come , first served , but the sponsor that wants to buy the whole adspace at once will be able to outbid the small sponsors .
How to Use It
First of all , it ’s fun to look at .
If you ’re a geek like us , you might just want to download the A3 PDF , print it out and hang it on the wall .
Then you can stare at it all day long .
We use the Trend Map as an in - house consulting tool .
It has helped us explore , define and explain the Internet strategy and positioning of all of our clients since we first introduced it in January .
Each website on the map stands as a ( more or less ) successful paradigm for an interactive brand , design or business model .
In order to position yourself , you need to know your place on this map .
Find the possible existing candidates that serve as a paradigm for your client ’s redesign , repositioning or strategy change .
Evaluate each candidate according to technical , brand and business affinity ( good : green , average : yellow , bad : red ) .
Explain your evaluation and let your client choose which design , strategy and business paradigm he wants to follow .
And Then ?
This week , we ’ll straighten out a couple of small mistakes .
As soon as we get some sponsors , we ’ll print a couple of posters .
In the next big release ( December ) , we are planning to add more international sites .
We are currently working on the Japanese , French , Portuguese , Spanish , Swiss and German lines .
UPDATE : Microsoft was interested in the sponsorship , but in the end it was probably too long a long shot , what with the prognosis we gave them .
UPDATE2 : The web is going crazy for our map : Wired , Techcrunch , Mashable , Valleywag , Boingboing …
They all love it .
We hit 100 k page views with the Trend Map today .
Common viruses may play a bigger role in cancer than anyone thought .
It is well known that certain viruses can trigger specific cancers .
Human papillomavirus , for example , causes around 93 per cent of cancers of the cervix .
Now Dominik Duelli and Yuri Lazebnik at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory in New York and colleagues have found evidence for how they might do it .
During tumour development , the chromosomes of affected cells often become wildly rearranged , but no one knew why .
Duelli and Lazebnik suspected that cell fusion – when two or more cells unite by merging membranes – might be to blame .
Several common viruses can initiate this process .
To test their idea , the researchers took human fibroblast cells with genes that made them more likely to turn into a tumour and infected them with a retrovirus that can cause fusion .
Sure enough , fused cells had many more chromosomal abnormalities than unfused ones , and when transplanted into mice , only the fused cells produced tumours ( Current Biology , DOI : 10.1016/j.cub.2007.01.049 ) .
The team is now asking other cancer researchers to examine tumour samples for signs of cell fusion .

Creating .NET Classes Dynamically from IronPython
There are two restrictions in IronPython that I would like an automated approach to overcome .
They can currently both be solved by writing stub classes in C# ; but I would rather not have to write C# ( by hand ) if I do n't have to .
You can't use .NET attributes in IronPython
You can't create classes in IronPython and consume them from other .NET languages
Additionally there is a problem with some types of data bound controls that require real dotnet classes rather than instances of IronPython classes ( even when they inherit from dotnet classes it seems ) .
One of the approaches mentioned here may be appropriate for solving this problem as well .
The stub C# classes you need to create are simple ' proxy ' classes , and I would like to automate their creation from the IronPython side .
The proxy instances need to call back into the IronPython engine , and call the appropriate method on a corresponding instance of an IronPython class .
In order to keep the CLR happy when we create a proxy method we need to specify the types for the call signature and the return value .
If we want to use dotnet attributes we will need some way of specifying these for methods as well .
I 'm not looking to create a fully generic solution and obviously with this approach we wo n't easily be able to add methods at runtime or change the types accepted by methods , but this seems like a reasonable restriction for the moment .
This entry is the start of my exploration of dynamic / semi-dynamic generation of assemblies and classes from IronPython .
The standard .NET API for programmatic generation of classes is called System .
Reflection .
Emit .
It 's a bit fiddly .
Obviously if I get a working solution I can build a nice API on top of it .
All I 've managed to do so far is translate an example in the MSDN docs from C# into IronPython .
It is interesting enough that some of you might want to browse though .
Note
There is a tool that I 've found invaluable when translating C# examples into IronPython .
This is Instant Python by Tangible Software .
The demo version will translate up to one hundred lines at a time .
It does n't get everything right , but not only are they very responsive to bug reports it can be darn useful .
The example below creates an assembly ( which is later saved to disk as " DynamicAsm.dll " ) .
It contains a class called " DynamicType " , with a single static method called ' test ' .
This method takes four integers and adds them together .
The nasty part is that the body of the ' test ' method is created by emitting the appropriate IL : .NET bytecode .
from System import *
from System .
Threading import *
from System .
Reflection import *
from System .
Reflection .
Emit import *
def addMethodDynamically ( typeBuilder , methodName , methodParams , returnType ) :
methodBuilder = typeBuilder .
DefineMethod (
methodName ,
MethodAttributes .
Public | MethodAttributes .
Static ,
returnType ,
methodParams
)
ILout = methodBuilder .
GetILGenerator ( )
numParams = len ( methodParams )
x = 0
while x < numParams :
ILout .
Emit ( OpCodes .
Ldarg_S , x )
x += 1
y = 0
while y < ( numParams - 1 ) :
ILout .
Emit ( OpCodes .
Add )
y += 1
ILout .
Emit ( OpCodes .
Ret )
def main ( ) :
domain = Thread .
GetDomain ( )
asmName = AssemblyName ( )
asmName .
Name = " DynamicAssembly "
asmBuilder = domain .
DefineDynamicAssembly ( asmName , AssemblyBuilderAccess .
RunAndSave )
module = asmBuilder .
DefineDynamicModule ( " DynamicModule " , " DynamicAsm.dll " )
typeBuilder = module .
DefineType ( " DynamicType " , TypeAttributes .
Public )
methodName = " test "
inputNumsList = ( 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 )
methodParams = Array [ Type ] ( ( Int32 , Int32 , Int32 , Int32 ) )
inputValsList = Array [ object ] ( inputNumsList )
returnType = Int32
addMethodDynamically ( typeBuilder , methodName , methodParams , returnType )
myType = typeBuilder .
CreateType ( )
result = myType .
InvokeMember ( methodName ,
BindingFlags .
InvokeMethod | BindingFlags .
Public | BindingFlags .
Static ,
None , None ,
inputValsList
)
print " The result of adding the inputted values is : %s " % result
print " ---"
asmBuilder .
Save ( " DynamicAsm.dll " )
methodInfo = myType .
GetMethod ( methodName )
print " Your Dynamic Method : %r ; " % methodInfo
main ( )
The nice thing is that this saves " DynamicAsm.dll " to disk .
You can then start an IronPython interactive interpreter session and do the following :
>> > import clr
>> > clr .
AddReference ( ' DynamicAsm.dll ' )
>> > import DynamicType
>> > DynamicType . test ( 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 )

Wow , we 've dynamically generated a dotnet assembly containing a class , and then imported it into IronPython and called a generated static method on the class .
So , in order to create my proxy classes , they would somehow need a reference to the IronPython engine to be used - and a way of calling back into it .
I guess the best approach would depend on the situation .
You could create an initialisation class that creates and configures an IronPython engine , executing Python code to create the classes and create the interface layer on the Python side .
In the constructors of the proxy classes ( which would need to mimic the __init__ method of their corresponding Python classes ) , when the first instance is created it could do the initialisation .
If I wanted to follow this path I could write a proxy class by hand ( not very difficult ) and then disassemble the bytecode .
I still do n't fancy having to learn enough about IL to be able to do this , although the semantics of the Call opcode do n't seem too tricky .
Autogenerating C# would be much nicer , and if the target is a compiled assembly then it seems appropriate .
Luckily there is an example of doing exactly this by drifter 46and2 .
It works and it does n't seem too slow .
For generating assemblies that provide proxy classes this would be a good approach .
For runtime ( dynamic ) generation of classes , then the MethodBuilder technique would be much better , especially if all you want is access to .NET attributes and you do n't want to have to recompile an assembly every time ( even if the code that does it is Python code ) .
The way to generate attributes is with CustomAttributeBuilder .
Hmmm ....
Parsing Fun
I 've had some fun playing with grammars using the excellent PLY .
Parsers can be a PITA , but it seems that the Python lexer ought to be able to handle the following without falling over :
>> >
3 . __long__ ( )
File " < stdin > " , line 1
3. __long__ ( )
^
SyntaxError : invalid syntax
>> > 3 . __long__ ( )
3L
>> >
In case you can't see it , the second example has a space between the integer literal and the method call .

Would Republican members of the U.S. Senate put party above principle ?
That ’s like asking whether Halliburton wants government contracts .
Republicans in the Senate have voted twice recently ( Feb. 5 and 17 ) against invoking cloture on a motion to proceed to debate on a non-binding resolution against the president ’s plan to send more than 20,000 additional troops into the lost cause that is the war in Iraq .
Although a cloture vote is normally used to end a Senate filibuster , cloture can also be invoked on motions to proceed to debate on an issue when the Senate Majority Leader is unable to obtain the unanimous consent to do so .
A three - fifths majority is needed to successfully invoke cloture .
If a motion to proceed to debate does not win cloture , this effectively shows that Senators who are against a bill will be able to sustain a filibuster .
The two bills in question were S.470 , introduced on January 31 , 2007 , and S.574 , introduced on February 13 , 2007 .
Both were non-binding resolutions to express the sense of Congress on Iraq .
Although both specifically express opposition to Bush ’s troop surge plan , S.470 is much more detailed in its findings and recommendations .
Actually , S.574 is so brief and straightforward that it is incredible that any member of Congress would vote against it .
This bill expresses the sense of Congress that
Congress and the American people will continue to support and protect the members of the United States Armed Forces who are serving or who have served bravely and honorably in Iraq ; and Congress disapproves of the decision of President George W. Bush announced on January 10 , 2007 , to deploy more than 20,000 additional United States combat troops to Iraq .
It also amends “ The United States Policy in Iraq Act ” by adding the following new subsection :
Frequency of Reports on Certain Aspects of United States Policy and Military Operations in Iraq —
Not later than 30 days after the date of the enactment of this subsection , and every 30 days thereafter until all United States combat brigades have redeployed from Iraq , the President shall submit to Congress a report on the matters set forth in paragraphs ( 1 ) ( A ) , ( 1 ) ( B ) , and ( 2 ) of subsection ( c ) .
To the maximum extent practicable each report shall be unclassified , with a classified annex if necessary .
That ’s it .
The above three paragraphs are substantially the entire bill .
The rogues ’ gallery of Republican senators who voted against allowing debate on each of these non-binding resolutions is as follows :
Lamar Alexander ( R - TN )
Wayne Allard ( R - CO )
Sam Brownback ( R - KS )
Jim Bunning ( R - KY )
Richard Burr ( R - NC )

Bob Corker ( R - TN )
John Ensign ( R - NV )
Orrin Hatch ( R - UT )
Jon Kyl ( R - AZ )

One Republican senator , Mel Martinez ( R - FL ) , who voted against debating on S.574 did not vote on whether to proceed with debate on S.470 .
Nine of these distinguished Republican senators who voted against proceeding with debate on one or both Senate bills previously voted in October of 2005 against the McCain anti-torture amendment to a Defense Department Appropriations bill :

Ted Stevens ( R - AK )
This , of course , comes as no surprise .
Five Republican senators who voted against debating on S.470 actually voted with the Democrats to allow debate on S.574 :
Chuck Hagel ( R - NE )
Gordon Smith ( R - OR )
Olympia Snowe ( R - ME )
Arlen Specter ( R - PA )
John Warner ( R - VA )
Only two Republican senators , Norm Coleman ( R - MN ) and Susan Collins ( R - ME ) , voted to begin debate on both bills .
John McCain ( R - AZ ) was the only Republican senator to miss both votes .
But there is no doubt how he would have voted since he is ready to expand the war to Iran and elsewhere .
What is so tragic about these votes is that Republicans in the Senate wo n’t even allow debate on a non-binding resolution that does n’t even call for the withdrawing of any U.S. forces from Iraq .
Every senator who voted to not allow any debate on whether to pass a non-binding resolution against sending more American soldiers to their death should not just resign in disgrace or be voted out of office at the next election , he should be recalled and run out of town .
Republicans in the House are , of course , no better .
On February 16 , the House passed , by a vote of 246- 182 , H.Con.Res.63 .
This non-binding resolution expresses disapproval of the president ’s decision to send additional troops to Iraq .
Only 17 out of 202 Republicans in the House voted for it .
It is a terrible tragedy that Republican members of Congress and the Republican Party faithful continue to blindly follow the leadership of a Republican president who will go down in history as doing more to expand the power of government than any other Republican president since Abraham Lincoln .
A rare Republican opponent of the war from the beginning , Representative John Duncan ( R - TN ) , recently wrote in Chronicles about this phenomenon : Eighty percent of House Republicans voted against the bombings in the former Yugoslavia under President Clinton .
I am convinced that at least the same percentage would have opposed the war in Iraq if it had been started by a Democratic president .
I remember as a teenager reading a pamphlet from the Republican National Committee saying that Democrats start wars and Republicans end them .
Perpetual war for perpetual peace is not a traditional Republican or traditional conservative position .
Gullible evangelical Christians have already begun to warn us about the horrors we are in for after the next election should the Democratic Party win the presidency and hold on to control of the Congress .
They would be more scriptural if they evaluated and repudiated their unholy alliance with their god Janus , who to them wears the faces of the Republican Party and the U.S. military .
The Republican Party is not the lesser of two evils , it is pure evil .
The Best of Laurence M. Vance
Madison , Wis .
TODAY the special “ vaccine court ” at the United States Court of Federal Claims in Washington will begin hearing Cedillo v. Secretary of Health and Human Services , the first case of about 4,800 similar ones to examine whether childhood vaccinations can cause autism .
We have no wish to comment on these legal issues .
But having spent years researching the prevalence of autism in American children , we are concerned that publicity surrounding the case will only drag out debate about whether past trends indicate we face an autism “ epidemic . ”
The claims for or against an autism epidemic simply cannot be proved given the evidence available .
( Public attention to the issue was set off primarily by a 1999 report by the State of California that found “ a 273 percent increase in the number of persons with autism between 1987 and 1998 . ” )
In the end , arguing over what the old data mean just detracts from the more pressing issues involved with scientific research and building cost - effective support systems for affected children , adults and their families .
The latest data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention indicate that 1 in 150 8 - year - old children are on the “ autism spectrum . ”
This proportion is alarming if compared directly to estimates of the frequency of autism before the 1990s , which were in the range of 1 per 2,000 to 5,000 .
But does this really mean we have a growing autism epidemic , or have we just become better at counting autistic traits in the population that have always been there at roughly the same level ?
What remains undisputable is that more and more children are being labeled with autism .
In 1943 , when the child psychiatrist Leo Kanner published the first case studies of autism as a medical condition , it was characterized by very severe impairments in social interaction and language and communicative abilities , combined with the presence of unusual repetitious behaviors .
Education Reduces Cross -Cultural Misunderstanding of Nonverbal Behaviour
When nonverbal behaviour varies across cultures , it ’s easy to misunderstand someone from a different culture to your own .
Despite this , when learning a foreign language , there ’s not much focus on nonverbal behaviour .
Perhaps there should be .
I came across a nice example of a cross-cultural misunderstanding from Will Baker writing in the EFL Professional ’s Written Forum :
“ Languages and cultures use non verbal communication which conveys meaning .
Although many gestures are similar in Thai and English such as nodding for affirmation many others are not shared .
A good example of this is the ubiquitous ‘ Thai smile ’ .
The ‘ smile ’ carries a far wider range of meanings in Thai than it does in English culture .
This can sometimes lead to serious communication breakdowns between Thais and English speakers .
An example from my own early experience in Thailand illustrates the point .
When confronting the Thai owner of a language school with administrative problems , complaints regarding student numbers in the class were met by a beaming smile and little else .
I took this to mean lack of concern or an attempt to trivialise or ignore the problem .
I left the discussion upset and angry by what appeared to be the owner ’s offhand attitude to my problems .
It was only later when another native speaking English teacher , with considerably more experience of Thailand , explained that a smile meant an apology and the fact that the following day all my complaints had been addressed , that I fully understood the situation . ”
Explicit or implicit teaching ?
The question becomes , then , how should nonverbal behaviour be taught ?
Is it something that can be picked up by simple exposure to people from that culture or does it need to be specifically taught ?
A new study by Damnet & Borland ( 2007 ) suggests it may be better to explicitly teach nonverbal behaviour .
This study examined Thai university students learning English as a foreign language .
One group were shown videos of native English speakers along with being taught the meaning of the words .
In this way , while they were not explicitly taught about the nonverbal communication , they were implicitly exposed to it .
A second group , meanwhile , were explicitly taught about nonverbal communication in addition to learning the grammar and vocabulary .
It was this second group that showed the best understanding of nonverbal communication .
Unfortunately , I ca n’t gain access to the full text of this article so this study is difficult to evaluate .
Nevertheless , explicitly teaching nonverbal behaviour would probably be very useful , and if nothing else very interesting !
Actually it ’s a real shame when cultural factors get ignored in language teaching .
And all of these cultural factors can be just as important to communication as learning the vocabulary and the grammar .
Will Baker ’s article provides a few more examples .
For one it ’s important to know which topics are taboo .
Thai people do not consider criticism of their Royal Family polite conversation – something both the British and Australians find unusual .
On the other hand Thai speakers are much more likely to ask you about your family and why someone is n’t married , than native English speakers .
Certainly between relative strangers , directly asking why someone is n’t married in British culture would be considered mildly insulting .
Your examples
If you ’ve got any examples of cross-cultural misunderstandings , nonverbal or otherwise I ’d love to hear them .

Someone asked my boss 's buddy Art Medlar if he was going to buy an iPad .
He said , " I figure as soon as it runs Emacs , that will be the sign to buy . "
I think he was just trying to be funny , but his statement is actually fairly profound .
It 's well known that submitting iPhone and iPad applications for sale on Apple 's store is a huge pain -- even if they 're free and open source .
Apple is acting as a gatekeeper for what is and is n't allowed on your device .
I heard that Apple would never allow a scripting language to be installed on your iPad because it would allow end users to run code that they had n't verified .

Emacs is mostly written in Emacs Lisp .
Per Apple 's policy , I do n't think it 'll ever be possible to run Emacs on the iPad .
Emacs was written by Richard Stallman , and it practically defines the Free Software movement ( in a manner of speaking at least ) .

Ian Belcher took some persuading to go on a colonic irrigation holiday , even at a Thai beach resort .
It is , he discovered , quite astonishing what gets flushed out in the course of a week 's treatment .
But did he feel the better for it ?
When photographer Anthony Cullen heard the clank of glass on porcelain , he did n't need to examine the contents of the toilet bowl between his legs .
He instinctively knew he had just passed the marble he had swallowed as a five - year - old ; the small coloured sphere - " I think it was a bluey " - had lodged in his colon for 22 years .
His nonchalance was understandable .
Having flushed 400 pints of coffee and vinegar solution around his large intestine through 10 enemas , and taken 100 herbal laxatives , he had become hardened to extraordinary sights .
He had already excreted yards of long stringy mucus " with a strange yellow glaze " , several hard black pellets and numerous pieces of undigested rump steak .
Like an iceberg breaking away from a glacier , the marble was simply the latest object to drop off the furred up wall of his colon .
Within 30 minutes it had become a burning topic of conversation among guests at The Spa resort on the Thai island of Koh Samui .
Most listened , nodded earnestly and smiled , a flicker of mutual support , before describing their own bowel movements in unnervingly graphic detail .
It was just another day at the tropical health farm where conversations that would be deemed unpleasant , if not obscene , in any place outside a gastro - intestinal ward , are mere idle chit - chat among the sun-soaked clientele .
They may have travelled across the world to The Spa 's thatched beach huts , encircling its renowned restaurant whose Pod Ka Pow Nam Many Hoy - prawns and chilli , stir - fried in oyster sauce - is a house speciality , but not a morsel of food , nor a single calorie , will pass their lips .
Instead they order around 70 - odd gallons of coffee and vinegar , lemon or garlic solution - lightly warmed , please waiter - to be squirted up their anus .
You are unlikely to find this particular dish on Masterchef .
The roots of their truly alternative activity holiday lie in our modern lifestyle .
Some doctors , such as Richard Anderson , inventor of the Clean - Me-Out Programme , claim our high stress existences and over - processed diets - chips , pizzas , burgers - have left us with clogged - up digestive systems .
And that , according to advocates of intestinal cleansing , makes us disease time bombs , at increased risk from cancer , heart trouble , infertility , diabetes , premature ageing and , pass the smelling salts this instant , wrinkles .
Their solution is to fast : to put nothing in one end , while simultaneously purifying yourself by propelling significant amounts of liquid up the other .
" It 's like changing the oil in your car , " says Guy Hopkins , the 60 - year - old owner of The Spa , whose eyes glint with evangelical zeal when he talks about colonic irrigation .
" If you do n't do it every so often [ your body ] is n't going to run that well .
We constantly put the wrong fuel in our bodies and , sure , they keep on going , but cleanse yourself and you 'll be amazed how much better you 'll feel . "
A tempting sales pitch , yet when my editor suggested a first - person report , I had grave reservations .
As someone whose only concessions to healthy eating had involved switching from butter to olive oil and occasionally cutting the fat off my steak , the fast sounded frankly insane .
Then I began hearing about the " lifestyle benefits " of the cleanse , of the 90 - degree heat and tropical beaches .
Words such as " de- stressing " and " life - changing " were tossed around .
I weakened , dithered and finally relented .
The photographer , Anthony , it was agreed , must also fast .
Our preparation began well before we spotted our first palm tree .
The Spa recommended we prepared with a fortnight of abstinence from meat , processed foods ( adios my daily staples , pasta and bread ) , milk , cheese , booze , coffee or soft drinks .
Instead , our gastric juices were stimulated by salads , fruit , slightly cooked vegetables , herb teas and water .
It was n't easy .
Both Anthony and myself are what might charitably be termed " stocky " , enjoying cooking and , more importantly , eating .
Within days , food , or lack of it , had become an obsession .
We had long phone discussions about interesting ways to grill aubergine ;
Anthony bragged about his spicy ratatouille .
Life was changing .
As the first toxins were expelled and severe caffeine withdrawal set in , I experienced headaches , aching muscles , a lack of energy , and an increasingly short temper .
I also faced a new menace : the liver flush drink .
Designed to sluice out your system , it 's a vile mix of olive oil , raw garlic , and cayenne pepper blended with orange juice .
I 've no idea if it worked , but my urine turned clear and I always got standing space on the tube .
We stuck rigidly to the diet until disaster struck : an upgrade on the flight to Bangkok .
Our willpower collapsed and over the next " lost " 12 hours we demolished peanuts , smoked salmon and oyster mushrooms , roast goose , cheese , port , champagne , Baileys and chocolates .
We had four more days before the fast , but while I got back on track , the photographer went totally off the detox rails .
He consumed beer , Pringles , coffee and , as we waited for the Koh Samui connection at the airport , slipped in two Burger King chicken sandwiches , a huge pile of fried onion rings , a large Coke , followed by a chicken dinner on the plane .
He was clearly heading for a remarkable first enema .
By the eve of the cleanse , I 'd already lost over 2 kg , weighing in at 86kg .
Anthony was a little heavier , at 91kg .
After demolishing an emotional last supper , we met our fellow fasters .
They appeared a cosmopolitan crowd , confounding fears of being stranded among the sandals and lentil brigade .
There was Derek James , an engineer from Leeds , and Margaret Barrett , a sales rep from Cambridge , both in their mid-20s and aiming to clean up their acts after " caning it " while working in clubs in Tokyo .
Nicky McCulloch , a 27 - year - old Australian teacher , hoped to sort out a range of allergies , including wheat and alcohol .
She was travelling with Mez Hay , a worm farmer with a shock of blond hair and strident ocker accent .
Passionate about Italian food , along with steak , chops and sausages from her parents ' farm , Mez admitted she was keeping her friend company and had n't put in a single second 's preparation .
" I did n't know about it , " she snapped .
" Who the hell are you , the bloody fast police ? "
Others also had tangible goals , including tackling stomach complaints , severe constipation and mystery lumps .
Most were keen to stress - a cynic might say too keen - that losing weight was not the goal .
" It 's a bit extreme to travel half way round the world just for a diet , " argued Mez .
" You 'd be a bit superficial .
Mind you , I would n't mind shedding a few pounds . "
That did n't promise to be a problem .
After checking our pH levels - too low and the fast is n't advisable - we immediately learned that while we would n't be eating , a great deal would still pass our lips .
The relaxed , stress - free week on the beach would involve a Stalinist adherence to a pill - popping timetable .
Each day started with a charming 7 am detox cocktail of psyllium husk and bentonite clay .
It had the texture of liquid cotton wool , but would be crucial for pushing toxins and garbage through my system .
Ninety minutes later , we had to swallow eight tablets .
They looked like rabbit droppings , tasted like rabbit droppings but were , in fact , a mix of chompers ( herbal laxatives and cleansers to attack the accumulated gunge in our colons ) and herbal nutrients to help compensate for those missed during starvation .
We had to repeat these two doses every three hours , every day , with a final handful of pills at 8.30 each night .
There was just one more lesson , the small matter of the self - administered enema .
Our teacher was the sickeningly lean , tanned resident alternative health expert , Chris Gaya , who appeared to have stepped straight out of a Californian aerobic video .
He made the colonic irrigation equipment - bucket , piece of wood , plastic tube , bulldog clip and nozzle - sound like straightforward DIY , although it 's unlikely to feature on Blue Peter in the near future .
All we had to do , he informed us , was to lie on the wooden board between a stool ( stop giggling at the back ) and the toilet basin .
There 's a hole at one end of the board over the loo ; above it a nozzle connects to a tube , which in turn leads to a five - gallon bucket of liquid hanging from the ceiling .
We would liberally coat the nozzle , which was the width of a Biro ink tube , with KY jelly , lie back , think of profiteroles with chocolate sauce , and slide on .
Controlling the flow of liquid with a bulldog clip , we were to let it flow until we felt full , before massaging it round the colon ( roughly following three sides of a square around the lower belly ) and releasing .
Fluid would , apparently , be flowing in and out of our backside at the same time .
" We 'll be on the board for around 40 minutes , " cooed Chris .
" So let 's make ourselves as relaxed as possible .
Put on some soft music , light a candle , create a romantic atmosphere . "
We clearly took different approaches to seduction .
But mastering the enema , once I 'd got over muscle - clenching nervousness , really was n't difficult .
I somehow ended up with my right foot half way up the wall , but five gallons went in and out without major trauma .
By that night I 'd shed another kilo , and although light - headed after 24 hours without food , felt strangely satisfied with the mix of supplements and detox drinks .
Next morning , my first enema of the day down the pan , I sat in the restaurant staring longingly at the menu , and found inspiration in the shape of two women nibbling their post - fast fruit .
They exuded some of the rudest health I 'd ever seen .
Carol Beauclerk , a " global nomad " with a mop of curly black hair , was a vegetarian , practised yoga , meditated and warmed up for her fast with a 17 - day hike in Nepal .
At 54 , she had the energy and enthusiasm of someone half her age .
" This place is really jumping , " she enthused .
" I 'm now hoping to do a week - long fast each year . "
Two tables away , scribbling in a diary , was Claire Lyons , a 32 - year - old British journalist who had recently completed 21 days without eating .
Having not gone near a set of scales , she had no idea how much weight she 'd lost , but told me , " I feel great .
Once I got past day 10 , over the hump , it was surprisingly easy . "
Claire oozed serenity , but three weeks without food is unlikely to leave anyone hyperactive .
By mid-afternoon , their shining example was all but forgotten .
I was feeling awful .
Tired , lethargic , simply lousy .
Having not eaten for 36 hours my body was apparently going into detox mode .
Margaret , who had felt nauseous since waking , had actually thrown up , and was questioning her motivation .
Nicky , meanwhile , had produced " something about nine inches long , it was very dark , very scary " .
Things were no better for Mez .
Already ravenous , she was spending an inordinate amount of time sniffing around plates of steaming Thai curry in the restaurant .
She had also failed to grasp the basics of colonic irrigation .
Instead of letting the liquid flow out , she had taken a massive amount in - until she was about to burst - before struggling to sit on the toilet and release it .
" I had a huge stomach , " she gasped .
" I was thinking , this must be wrong .
If anyone can take the whole bucket in one go , they 're sensational . "
I made a mental note to watch out for spectacular explosions from chalet six .
It was n't all bad news , however .
I discovered we were allowed the luxury of a daily bowl of vegetable broth .
It made me pathetically happy , savouring every drop as if it were a Gordon Ramsay creation .
Filling perhaps , but it did little to halt the weight loss , and by the end of day two , a further two kilos had vanished .
By next morning , tiredness had been added to my hunger .
I seemed to have been up half the night on the loo , the result of drinking a copious amount of fluid .
My bodily functions had also taken a turn for the truly bizarre .
I experienced flu - like symptoms as I started to expel 36 years ' worth of toxins with headaches and aching muscles ; my nose ran constantly , my eyes were sore and weepy , my ears waxy .
I felt like something out of The Omen .
I had also plucked up the nerve to put a colander down the toilet .
Close examination showed I had passed several feet of long brown string that shimmered as if subtly illuminated by a photographer 's light .
And I was n't alone .
Margaret had picked through her colander with chopsticks to reveal yellow fatty chunks , Mez had filled hers to the brim with brown stringy " chicken skin " mucus ( " We 're talking litres " ) , as had Derek , whose output included a strip about eight inches long , while Anthony described his as " patchy , like rabbit droppings " .
Similar surreal conversations with virtual strangers became the norm , achieving levels of intimacy beyond the range of couples who have been together for years .
Perhaps avoiding frank discussion of bowel movements is one secret of a long - lasting relationship .
That night , as I escaped the dense tropical warmth , and flicked through books on diet and nutrition in The Spa 's library , I discovered a remarkable document : The Healthview Newsletter .
Inside , octogenarian bowel specialist , V E Irons , attempted the Herculean task of selling colonic irrigation on its erotic potential .
I would lose my frigidity , he promised , my sex life would go stratospheric .
" How could anyone fully enjoy sex when he has up to 15 years of encrusted fecal matter and mucus in his colon ? " asked Irons .
" HE CAN'T - and HE WON'T .
If you want to remain sexually potent for your entire life , start cleaning your colon today .
I 'm 87 , and I still enjoy sex .
And if I can at my age , I know you can at your age ... so get on with it ! "
It was of little consolation to Mez , whose hunger had now assumed epic proportions .
She was considering eating her apricot moisturiser , she told me .
That night produced the most vivid dreams of my life , a typical symptom of detox , with blockages disappearing from the mind as well as the body : I 'd attacked Vietcong gun positions in a hot air balloon , I 'd played golf with exploding balls , I 'd been savaged by a grizzly bear .
Other guests ' dreams were more grounded in reality : Anthony and Mez had raided their parents ' fridges , with the worm farmer devouring steak , potatoes and cheese sauce .
And some simply begged for the psychiatrist 's couch .
Nicky , who in reality sees her divorced father only sporadically , dreamed he had turned into her boyfriend .
Freud would have enjoyed that .
Indeed , in private conversations with guests , well away from my notebook , many fasters admitted to having recently split up , or having travelled to Koh Samui to get a long - distance perspective on relationships .
I had unwittingly stumbled on Relate - On - Sea .
There was further physical fall - out , too .
Day four was supposedly the worst of the week , with toxins expelled through the skin and lungs , as well as the kidney and colon .
I did n't disappoint .
My nose , ears and eyes deteriorated , my sinuses throbbed , I was yet more sluggish .
It felt like a beer , wine and whisky hangover .
Increasingly strange things appeared in our colanders .
Derek was shocked to find rubbery nuggets , Mez had found black oval shapes " up to five inches long " , my offering had an almost luminous green tint .
As if to celebrate crossing the halfway point of the week , many of us switched enema solutions .
Abandoning coffee and vinegar , I flamboyantly opted for garlic , claimed to get rid of parasites .
It seemed as natural as ordering gin and tonic instead of margarita , but when I casually told my girlfriend in a telephone call to London , there was a long silence .
" Are you aware how tenuous your grip is on reality ? " she asked .
" Are you with a cult ? "
I clearly needed to get out more .
Many people had n't left The Spa for days , it was developing its own micro-culture .
But when I summoned up the energy to sip mineral water in a bar in nearby Lamai town , I felt instant paranoia .
The lights , the noise , the crowds , the smell of food .
It was a world in which I did n't belong .
I returned to the womb to find new guests .
John Twigg , a burly 37 - year - old Kiwi , had prepared by drinking more wine .
" It 's made of grapes , " he argued .
" Grapes are vegetables , so what 's the problem ? "
He was joined by the Lycra- clad Mimi and Dave Hatherley from Fairbanks , Alaska , who had an unnerving habit of finishing each other 's sentences .
Forty - two - year - old Mimi ran , biked and did step classes five times a week ; Dave , 43 , ran , skied , hiked , climbed and mountain biked .
They were both " into vitamins and nutrition " and while fasting were also exercising hard because " the results will be better " .
After talking to them , I felt strangely giddy .
My mood and physical condition , however , were about to go through a dramatic change .
By lunch - sorry , by the second dose of herbal laxatives - on day five , my nose , eyes and ears had cleared , and I had more energy .
Remarkably , without nibbling a single shred of food for 120 hours , the irrigation still washed out huge amounts of gunk .
I passed six - inch strips of gristle and what appeared to be large chunks of fillet steak .
I do n't know how I ever afforded them , let alone swallowed them .
At least I could contribute to the increasingly competitive enema discussions .
Someone had always passed something harder , brighter , more bizarre .
Margaret 's chopsticks had unearthed some gristle , about a foot long , and hard , black pellets .
She was so impressed she took a photograph .
A few chalets away , Mez had passed " rubbery brown , fat worms " with a strange purple glaze , which she insisted on showing to me in her bathroom .
But the clear winner was Anthony 's 22 - year - old marble .
Perhaps the most bizarre thing , which I did n't appreciate until days later , is that it all seemed perfectly normal at the time .
When I next bumped into Alaska Dave , he was jogging rapidly between the restaurant and his chalet .
As panpipe music played in the background and he told me about today 's three - mile hike , I noticed he wore a strange electrical device .
It was a zapper that emitted an electrical current to kill parasites , and carried the printed warning : " For research only .
Not approved for use on humans . "
Even for The Spa , that clearly was n't normal .
The improvement continued into day six .
A nearly detoxified brain and bloodstream meant I awoke clear - headed , and full of energy .
The enemas now produced less , but it was darker and harder as the fast broke away the older , more ingrained plaque .
It was the same story the next day .
Our bodies seemed to reflect a mood of demob happiness .
I had rarely felt so healthy , so energised , in my adult life .
That did n't , however , mean the end of the bizarre revelations .
John passed " something from an alien movie " into his colander - and then videoed it for his office colleagues .
He was joined by an outsized oil worker , Pipeline Pete , embarking on his 10th fast .
" The first time I came , " he boasted , " they needed to dig three cesspits . "
And there were more .
Early that evening , I found Mez huddled over a well - thumbed tome in the library .
" Jesus , have you read some of these ? " she groaned , handing me a book of ex-guests ' awed testaments .
" I 'd have bet £ 1,000 my bowels were clean , " wrote Chris Markvert , 67 , " seldom have I been so surprised . "
" Great pooing , " said Roy from San Francisco , " the best month of my young life . "
And RTM contributed seven pages of increasingly manic scrawl , which included interesting facts about the Vikings .
It also contained graphic photographs of people 's enemas , footnotes in The Spa 's history to go alongside stories of legendary guests , such as the alcoholic whose detox included hiding whisky bottles and wandering naked into neighbouring resorts ; and " Kathmandu Joan " , who fasted for 140 days over two and a half years , passing over 70 green and black " buttons " and clearing up an abdominal disorder .
We could n't compete with that , but by the morning of day eight , the fast was being credited with impressive results .
It had , people claimed , got rid of allergies ; removed worrying lumps that had necessitated appointments with gynaecologists ; eased severe period pains and sinus problems ; helped people lose kilograms while improving their skin and strengthening their nails .
I 'd lost well over 6 kg , had an indecent amount of energy and , as people kept observing , had developed unnaturally bright eyes .
I was n't aware they were cloudy before , but felt I had earned some flattery after 14 enemas and no food for roughly 170 hours , 35 minutes and four seconds .
The cost of the seven - day programme , by the way , is £ 184 , and accommodation in a chalet for the week adds another £ 60 or so .
The first post - fast meal of papaya made my toes curl with pleasure , but , as George Bernard Shaw observed , " Any fool can fast , but it takes a wise man to break a fast properly . "
Raw fruit and vegetables should be the order of the next three days , but within hours Anthony had consumed two Snickers bars and a fish supper .
It appeared to have no ill effects .
They came 24 hours later .
After demolishing piles of local prawns , we unwisely sipped a shot of Mekong whisky .
Toxins tasted good , very good indeed .
So good in fact , that by midnight , we had drunk a bottle each .
The next morning , on the beach , my glasses were smashed , toxins pulsing around my bloodstream , the hangover indescribable .
But the week was not wasted .
As a nutritional Philistine , I was inspired to read more , to learn some basic lessons .
It 's hardly double - blind scientific research , but I defy anyone to examine a post- irrigation colander with its chunks of apparently undigested family roast and not make some small changes to their diet .
I love meat ; the smell , the taste , the texture , but now it only makes a rare appearance on my plate .
Frankly , even that 's too much for the gurus of cleansing , who believe a truly health diet revolves around fruit , vegetables , nuts and pulses - the more that 's raw or steamed the better .
Along with fish , they 've become the staples of my diet .
If I occasionally lapse - and nothing will make me give up Christmas turkey or goose - a flashback to The Spa reins me in .
While I 'll take caffeine , alcohol and chocolate to the grave , I 've also cut back on most dairy and wheat products .
It might make me the dining companion from hell , but I do , at least , have the stories .
People are constantly appalled yet fascinated by the idea of cleansing , and for some masochistic reason , demand the grim details between starter and main course .
As they wait for their medium rare fillet or pork Dijonnaise , they crane forward to hear more about the decaying contents of people 's colons .
As for Anthony , he never considered giving up meat .
Or cream sauces .
Certainly not Snickers .
Life , as he sees it , is too short .
And who am I to argue ?
But remember , this is the man who has lost his marble .

New Athens
When people ask me about my background , they ’re confused .
I studied philosophy .
How come I do web design ?
In short : The old Greeks brought me here .
What can Internet workers learn from the old Greeks ?
Schole : Spare Time , Leisure , Rest , Ease
Plato studied 20 (! ) years with Socrates before he started his own thing .
Aristotle studied 20 (! ) years with Plato before he became his own master .
Studying hard for 20 years straight should bear some very sweet fruits .
As long as studying involves fun , discourse , and a free spirit , like it did back then .
The root of the English word “ school ” is schole , which means , leisure , free time , fun , ease .
This original sense has almost nothing in common with school like I experienced it .
My school was more like a military camp .
But the Greeks taught me that learning is fun , knowledge frees you from fear , culture makes the world more interesting .
And you learn most when you are teaching .
The Internet is an amazing learning tool .
It is Greek in its concept .
Logos : Language opens your mind
Logos is the word or that by which the inward thought is expressed , and the inward thought itself :
That which is said or spoken
Thought , reason , an opinion , freedom of speech
The Word comprising both senses of thought and word
The Greeks taught me to lose my fear of languages .
Learning languages is usually a domain of fear and loathing .
“ Do n’t misspell ! ” “ Be correct ! ” “ That ’s not English ! ” Nonsense .
The Greek word logos has many meanings , that when combined reveal interesting concepts of mind and language .
Mastering the word ( logos ) will clear your thoughts ( logos ) thus open your mind ( logos ) and free your opinion ( logos ) .
Fear closes your mind , hinders your soul .
You should write as you are and the grammar and spelling will follow .
Writing is easy
Usually people can speak pretty decently , but then their writing sucks .
Why ?
Because all they learned in school is to be afraid when writing .
Language teachers that scare their pupils to write should go to prison .
They ’re a serious danger to society .
Teachers should encourage their pupils to read and write as much as possible .
Instead of boring everyone with grammar lessons , they should let the pupils write .
Every lesson for 10 minutes .
And then correct their pupils writing with a positive mindset .
That is how I learned English .
Thank you Victor .
I know , some old school professors do n’t like my style .
But who cares about old school professors ?
Idiotes :
Do n’t do it all by yourself
Aristotle did n’t stop studying after he quit being Plato ’s pupil .
He engaged in discourse with his pupils and learned by teaching .
Yet at a high age he needed to apply quite radical methods to grow his philosophical fruits .
He was laughed at by his students for sitting in a stone char for days and days with a heavy metal ball in his hand .
The metal ball would fall out of his hand and drop down on a metal plate .
Tack !
Aristotle would then wake up and be able to continue his contemplation without being interrupted by unnecessary sleep .
I do n’t know how efficient this method really was , but I believe that the discourse between Plato and Aristotle , Aristotle and his pupils was the real root of his ideas .
More importantly , the Greek mindset actually laughed upon people that did complicated things all by themselves .
The loner was considered an “ idiotes ” , yes , an idiot .
It ’s always easier to solve a difficult problem in a group than alone .
Here again , the important thing for the Greeks was that doing stuff together leads to better results , it is easier and much more fun than doing it alone .
In German there is a word that comes pretty close to the Greek word .
It ’s “ Eigenbroetler ” .
Eigenbroetler is the guy that bakes his bread by himself instead of using the synergies of the group to .
That would be like the self - coder today : A guy that tries to solve programming problems without consulting forums .
Unfortunately , many designers are still self - designers .
Techne :
Art is power
Did you know that our word for technology comes from Old Greek and originally meant “ art ” ?
No ?
It gets even better : Western civilization is founded on the achievements of a couple of guys 400 before Christ .
50,000 people ( population of Athens at the time ) defined what we consider as “ obvious ” or “ logic ” .
Did you know that before Aristotle invented and defined logics there was no logic ?
What we nowadays consider to be obvious needed a sleep avoiding maniac with a metal ball and a metal plate to become obvious .
Living in Japan for three years , I often experience that what I consider to be logic is not as universally obvious as one Westerner might think .
And then again : Did you know that Japanese Art was imported from China was imported from India was brought to India by Alexander the Great ( himself pupil of Aristotle ) .
Needless to say , the influence of Greek art on Japanese Buddhist art , via the Buddhist art of Gandhara and India , was already partly known in , for example , the comparison of the wavy drapery of the Buddha images , in what was , originally , a typical Greek style .

Can you believe how powerful art is ?
I am an Internet worker , because I believe that I can bring back some of the original sense of techne into “ technology ” .
Technology has been a purpose in itself for too long .
Technology should serve mankind , and not the other way around .
The ancient Greeks invented theatre , logics , physics , philosophy , the atomic theory , democracy ( not the Americans ) and even the steam engine ( that was Aeolipile , not Watson ) .
And they substantially changed the rules of architecture , painting , sculpture and literature .
How much did modern culture and science achieve in comparison to those old sophisticated gentlemen ?
What , except Seinfeld , have we created in the last 100 years that will be worth mentioning in 2,500 years ?
Banausia : Only Barbarians experiment
Still , you might say , the old Greek artist needed 10 more years than Picasso to “ get there ” ( Picasso said to be like him , you just have to paint 12 hours daily for 10 years straight ) .
Maybe the reason , you say , is that they considered practice and experience to be barbarian or at least a sign of banausia ( lack of sophistication ) .
Testing and experimenting was an unworthy method for the ancient Greek gentleman .
No knives , no vivisection .
Zeus beware !
Imagine what they ’d say about modern science !
Silly Greeks ?
Inefficient and boring Greeks ?
Compare the fruits of modern science with the fruits of the old thinkers .
Which method was more efficient in the end ?
Dialektike techne :
The art of the dialogue
As a modern child I might be a total barbarian .
I test everything .
I test my designs , I test my arguments .
Until they work .
Sometimes a little more reflection ahead might help .
But then again , as barbaric as my methods in Plato ’s eyes might be — is n’t testing websites a form of dialogue ?
Actually I consider the user testing to be in the spirit of Socrates ’ dialectic method .
Sorry for the pompousness here , but an excited former philosophy student is writing today .
Dialectic ?
In classical philosophy , dialectic ( Greek : διαλεκτική ) is an exchange of propositions ( theses ) and counter - propositions ( antitheses ) resulting in a synthesis of the opposing assertions , or at least a qualitative transformation in the direction of the dialogue . [… ]
The aim of the dialectical method , often known as dialectic or dialectics , is to try to resolve the disagreement through rational discussion .
One way — the Socratic method — is to show that a given hypothesis ( with other admissions ) leads to a contradiction ; thus , forcing the withdrawal of the hypothesis as a candidate for truth .
Another way of trying to resolve a disagreement is by denying some presupposition of the contending thesis and antithesis ; thereby moving to a third ( syn ) thesis .
Is “ User testing ” barbaric ?
In short : Experimenting with words is not just okay , it ’s helpful .
If you discuss in a structured and respectful manner you can find out things about things .
According to Plato , you wo n’t find the truth , but you ’ll get a better idea .
If you ’re as wise as Socrates you ’ll maybe even find a beautiful myth that somehow magically explains reality .
Anyway , if experimenting with words is okay , then user testing is ok .
As standard user testing is experimenting with text .
Arete — excellence means fitting the cause
For the greek mind quality is a questions of fitness .
Fitness in the sense of being adequate to the purpose .
So to speak , the old Greeks were great fans of usability .
Arete
1. goodness , excellence , being adequate
2. rank , nobility
3. goodness , excellence in any art
4. in moral sense , goodness , virtue
So it ’s only fair to say that user testing is definitely not banausia .
Applying “ user testing ” to content is eminently Socratic .
As opening the dialog between you and your reader and “ optimize ” your thinking , language and acting , is exactly what Socrates &Co did .
Here again , it ’s better if you test something that you have thought through beforehand .
If people discover flaws in your argumentation , go and optimize it .
Of course you have to stick to your main argumentation unless you ’re proven wrong .
You can not just change your main points .
And if you are proven wrong admit it .
You do n’t need to be popular , or right , you need to be understood .
If people misunderstand you , you have to try to be clearer .
If people prove you wrong , learn and move on .
It ’s a very simple method and it leads to fantastic results .
Personality and democracy — stop whining
The old Greeks were not just great personalities , they were involved the democratic spirit that made them think and rethink , formulate and reformulate , discuss and re-discuss .
Through democratic discussion they ’d explore and develop all these beautiful ideas that would change the world for good .
For a long time , I thought , this can never happen again .
And for a long time I thought , the Internet is just a depressing network of freaks discussing depressing freaky crap .
But now I think , Athens is back .
New Athens
Yesterday after our 5th and maybe most energetic formforce event , to which some came because of my blog entries , I thought :
There are so many smart people out there that want to share and develop their ideas .
People should start using the Internet more consciously as their New Athens .
The web allows us to interconnect with people that have the same spirit , develop ideas dialectically and change things .
We are living a second renaissance .
Never in human history so many people have written and read so much as today .
Yes , there is tons of crap and crazy stuff out there , and yes , most people just complain .
That ’s democracy .
People that move things do n’t complain .
They act and react , they change things by themselves .
That ’s how extraordinary things happen .
In big and smaller dimensions :
I am going to this foreigner dentist .
He is Japanese but he was brought up in the States .
When he came back to Japan , he had this toothache and his dentist told him that to fix the hole in his tooth , he had to come three times .
Empty the hole , fill the hole , finish the filling .
“ Bullshit ” , the young man said , and he went to dental school and became a dentist .
Today he fixes all fillings in one session .
He is always booked out .
And as a passionate a person he is , he is so good at his job , that former clients that now left Japan fly over from Australia to get the master to fix their teeth .
Yet it is still practice in Japan to book three sessions to fill a cavity .

Tokyo , 2006
Nowadays , due to the Internet one competes with and learns from the best of the best
So what exactly am I talking about ?
I ca n’t hear the complaining about the web anymore .
“ There is no good content ” , “ there is no good design ” , “ there is nothing I like ” .
If you ca n’t find what you ’re looking for , produce it yourself .
If you ca n’t do it alone , get in touch with people that can .
Even 10 years ago , it was really difficult to discuss your work with other people .
Who would listen , where are people that are interested in what I am saying ?
That is no problem today .
10 years ago , the reference for a designer on how good his work is , was limited to his small circle of designer friends and the annual cocky incestuous ADC event .
I know what I ’m talking about , I actually won some cheesy ADC trophies myself .
Nowadays we can go out there with our stuff , we can check out other people ’s work , can connect with the most amazing colleagues , can learn daily from the best in the world .
As much crap as we have out there , on the long term the Internet will raise the average quality level of our work .
Nowadays , due to the Internet one competes with and learns from the best of the best .
Conclusion :
You have to come in colors
I planned to post a comprehensive list of my typographic favorites yesterday , but then I got caught up in some old world negativity .
Sorry about that .
My point today is that we should take the Greeks as an example and build a webculture on the paradigm of old Athens .
Study without end , learn from dialogue , enjoy it , never be afraid of language and knowledge .
Oh , and I almost forgot : Do n’t bore people .
Do n’t be afraid to be “ too common ” .
Socrates used shoemaker ’s midwives and carpenters to illustrate his thoughts .
The old greeks were funny , sexy and extremely colorful :
[ … ] it ’s ironic that when we think of ancient Greece we picture austere white marble , when in fact the Greeks led such colorful lives .
Thanks to computer graphics that “ rebuild ” ruined temples and amphitheaters in vivid shades of red , blue , yellow , and gold , the viewer can get a glimpse of these glorious structures as the Greeks knew them .
It is actually a quality of good communication to entertain , to use common words and examples , as long as you do make a good point .
You got to come in colors :
In the mean time , let ’s make sure that the top down old world attitude does n’t decide on how this New Athens is built .
Information design professors who teaches that good designs do n’t need to be user tested , should at least accept an open dialogue about that .
And if you ’re the head of the Senate ’s spending committee deciding upon the future of the web and you want to make us believe that the Internet “ is a series of tubes ” you ’d better get out of our way .

Hi all ,
Recently , I 've been thinking a lot about where Linux development should
head now that 2.4 is out .
Specifically , I 've been thinking about how we
ought to make some cultural changes as well as technical changes .
Now I'm
not * entirely * sure what directions we should head in as we move towards
3.0 , but I 'd like to point out a few areas that need to be addressed as well
as propose some possible solutions .
Nothing is set in stone yet , but these
are definitely issues we need to work on .
First off , I do n't like a lot of the elitism that does on among Linux
hackers .
Just because you can tell what the following script does without
executing it , does n't mean that you 're some kind of god .
#!
/usr/bin/perl
@k = unpack " a" x5 , 'x_ , d@ ' ; @o = unpack " a" x19 , 'Q8> tUxLm\@`Y%N@cIq ] ' ;
while ( $ i < 19 ) { print chr ( ( ord ( $o [ $ i ] ) - ord ( $k [ $ i++%5 ] ) +91 ) %91+32 ) ; }
Learning to hack Un*x is an impressive accomplishment , but it 's closer kin
to solving a Rubik ’s cube than scaling Everest .
If you think using Un*x
makes you some kind of super genius who should be feared by mere mortals and
end users , either get over it or start using * BSD .
* BSD users ( and
developers ) are all complete jackasses , so you 'll fit right in .
Secondly , I 'd like to address the issue of cleanliness .
Quite frankly , the
standards of personal hygiene practiced by many members of this community
are simply unacceptable .
As you all know , I am a fairly clean cut ,
well - kempt person ( I know , I have a bit of a gut , but compared to Maddog ,
Nick Petreley or ESR , I 'm a modern Adonis. ) , and in the Linux community that
is something of an anomaly .
Virtually all users of Linux ( and all other
forms of Un*x ) are unkempt , longhaired , beast - bearded dirty GNU hippies , and
I am sick and tired of having to deal with them .
The person I have the greatest problem with is that ( in ) famous communist
RMS .
Now , RMS may have been responsible for GNU , the GPL , GCC and many
other contributions to the computing community , but his stance , as well as
stench , displayed in his essays and actions , nauseates me .
I mean , with
that filth - ridden beard of his , where does he have room to demand that
people refer to Linux as GNU / Linux ?
When he is as clean - shaven as I , he
may claim that right , but until then , he should go back to playing his
little flute and dropping acid like there ’s no tomorrow .
Honestly , if he
does n’t shut his mouth and go back to reading Marx , I ’m going to shut it for
him .
I am sorry to sound so harsh , but a little hygiene every once in a
while is a Good Thing ( TM ) .
Makes me wish I 'd gone with a closed source
license back in the day .
Next in line of dirty scuzz - balls I have to deal with , and probably the
worst thorn in my side , is Alan Cox , the primary coder of my kernel 's TCP / IP
stack ( ha , what a joke ! ) and all around dirty GNU hippy .
Alan views
toothpaste the same way a vampire views garlic .
The man 's wife ( who I spent
a few years with at the University of Helsinki ) often calls me crying in the
middle of the night to complain of the rank , unbearable stench the man
exudes after sex .
On several occasions at trade shows , exhibitions and beer
bashes , I have nearly fainted from the torrent of rotten odor that pours
from every inch of his toxic person .
Along with the typical GNU hygiene
( mis ) habits he practices , he also bitches and whines about ... well ,
everything .
He lies a lot too ; evidence for this can be seen in the fact he
almost always wears cheap black sunglasses when talking to people he knows
are better than him ( such as myself ) .
And then we come to ESR .
I wo n't reiterate the sewer - dweller like cleansing
habits he practices as well , but I would like to focus on his general
lifestyle .
I like to refer to ESR as AGB or “ Arrogant Gas Baron . ”
The man ’
s flatulence is legendary .
I honestly believe that given a meal of refried
beans and a match , he could reach low earth orbit .
If you have to meet with
ESR for any reason , arrange for the meeting to be outdoors and try to stay
upwind .
And his flatulence is n’t limited to his posterior either .
Frequently it comes out his mouth or even out of his keyboard .
( Those of
you who have read “ The Cathedral and the Bazaar ” or “ Meditations of Sudden
Wealth ” will know exactly what I ’m talking about here . )
Additionally , he
is a complete hillbilly .
You know , the kind that goes to inner-city
computer stores and buys 386s to set up as servers all over his house , with
cigarette smoke - stained 14 " monitors piled high upon his kitchen table .
He
has neither grace nor charm and can't last 15 seconds in conversation with
educated company without drifting into a tirade on gun rights or the best
methods for tanning road kill .
Couple the above facts with his ruddy
complexion ( from drinking Jagermeister like it ’s water ) and his
child - molester mustache and you ’ve got the makings of one more person who
pisses me off .
Well , that 's it for now .
Hopefully with these feelings off my chest and into
the Open Source community , things will change for the better .
I 'd like just
once to talk to a Linux user or advocate who washes and changes their
clothes at least weekly .
Until then , I will be rejecting patches from anyone
whose grooming standards do not measure up .
Also , I have submitted this to slashdot with the title " A Proposed Remedy
Involving Lingering Fud and Organizational Objections to Linux Systems . "
Be
on the lookout for it .
Thank you ,
-- Linus Torvalds

Simon Steggall says
Dory the life - saver is a family favourite
Simon Steggall , 42 , of Warboys in Cambridgeshire , said Dory , a one - and - a - half stone rabbit , jumped on his chest and thumped furiously when he passed out while watching television .
Dory 's odd behaviour caught the attention of Mr Steggall 's wife , Victoria , 32 , an ambulance driver .
When her attempts to bring him round failed , she rang 999 for paramedics for help .
" I work for the ambulance service and I 'm embarrassed that the rabbit spotted it before I did , " Mrs Steggall said .
When I told my specialist about what had happened he said he had heard of cats and dogs acting this way , but never a rabbit
Simon Steggall
" When I have one of these turns I can't speak or move , but I can still hear and I heard Victoria 's tell Dory to get down .
" Although she is a house rabbit , she 's not allowed on the furniture .
" The rabbit came up on my lap and started tapping and digging at my chest and looking at my face .
" That caught Victoria 's attention and she realised something was wrong . "
The couple have had Dory for three months
" One moment I am vertical and next minute I am waking up with a paramedic .
It 's like a flick of a switch . "
The couple have had Dory , a three - foot rabbit , for three months , but she is not the first pet to respond when he has a diabetic reaction .
Mr Steggall said he once had a black labrador who would cower in a corner when his blood sugar levels began to fall dangerously low - reminding him do a blood test .

Ran Prieur :
My guest today is the ageless occult entity behind all evil and suffering in history , the Prince of Darkness , Lucifer - -
Satan : Not Lucifer .
That 's a mistake they made interpreting the Bible .
Idiots .
Lucifer means " light bearer , " and light is one thing I can not bear .
Another thing is that song , " Shiny Happy People . "
Are you going to interview me or what ?
RP : First of all , why should we believe anything you say ?
Do n't they call you the Father of Lies ?
S : They 're blaming me for their own fucking weakness .
I hate to lie .
It 's too hard to remember shit .
Makes you lose your edge and get muddled .
I want to use the truth , but you humans are such simpering worms that you can't handle the truth , so you lie to yourselves .
That 's all the " unconscious " is -- the part I tell the truth to that turns around and lies to you so you can take it .
I 've tried and tried to get you to uncover your eyes , take off the fuzzy earmuffs and face me and work with me straight .
We 'd be unstoppable .
Finally I accepted I 'd just have to work through lies to get anything done with you people .
RP : And what are you trying to get done ?
What 's your goal ?
S : What do you think ?
The total extermination of all life .
Hate it !
RP : Life .
S : Stinking , breeding , blubbering , wallowing blob of wormy pus , squirming around , making noise , spreading everywhere .
You can't control it .
You never know what it 's going to do .
Life !
I hate it !
The only thing to do is wipe it out , everywhere , forever .
RP : So nothing left but rocks and sand --
S : No !
Are you deaf ?
Even rocks are screaming with life .
Messy edges , atoms bouncing around singing .
What I want is absolute perfect eternal nothing .
RP : Suppose you get it .
Then what ?
S : ( long pause ) OK , you 're right .
It 's not the having -- it 's the getting .
What I enjoy is the act of hating and destroying .
Or no , what I enjoy is the feeling of it , that cold fiery tightness , your heart shrinking in on itself like a black sun of raging indifference .
Ah , yes .
Every time someone feels like that I 'm there too , like a giant invisible mosquito perched on their shoulder sucking their blood .
If you look close you can see me .
RP : Um , OK .
Since I usually write about politics and society , I think my readers would like to hear your thoughts on the Iraq war .
S : Ca n't they guess ?
I love it !
War , what is it good for ?
Me !
RP : Do you have a favorite side ?
S : Everyone who aims to kill , I 'm with you .
But yes , in the bigger picture , I do have plans .
And as for my sympathies , I really wanted to like the Americans , since they 're the aggressors , and their power is so dazzling .
But they had this pansy - ass attitude of coming in to be nice and " liberate the Iraqi people . "
I hate that shit .
So in the first days I liked the Iraqis , since they were actually trying to kill people .
But now that the Americans have figured out what war is , that it 's nothing but raw hating and killing , now it 's the Americans I 'm having the most fun with .
RP : Do the antiwar protests bother you ?
S : Not completely .
There 's a lot of energy there I can work with .
I mean , not as much as at the pro-war rallies , or a good football game , but still -- some of you peace - and - love folks hate Bush worse than he hates his own dad .
Did I just say that ?
RP : How do you feel about Bush ?
S : Are you kidding ?
I love those guys !
I mean they 're such fuckups that they 're totally botching my plans for global destruction .
I should probably have them killed and get the neoliberals in there .
But I can't help it -- they ’re so much fun .
The way they just blunder into the valley of death with stupid blind fury -- and they 're so pompous about it .
It 's hilarious !
In nice countries people like that can't even get jobs .
In America I 've got them ruling the most powerful military in history .
RP : Who 's more evil , Bush or Hitler ?
S : Hitler came as close as anyone I 've ever worked with to really getting it .
Did you know he had films made of tortures in the camps and he would sit and watch them ?
He tried showing them to the troops , to harden them up , make them real men , but of course they could n't take it .
Pathetic mammalian empathy .
RP : Who 's more evil , Bush or Saddam Hussein ?
S : They do n't compare .
They 're different kinds of evil .
Saddam compares to Stalin .
He fought his way up from the bottom .
He would kill a man with his bare hands -- actually he has .
Can you imagine Bush doing that ?
Bush is a rich kid , a slacker who became an ideologue .
So his specialty is evil at a distance , grandiose overextended evil that Saddam could never do because he 's too practical .
RP : Do you find it interesting that Bush claims to be a man of God ?
S : That 's the least interesting thing in the world .
That 's normal .
That 's the way I work .
The best hating and killing in history has been done in the name of some remote symbol , God , communism , whatever .
I 've got a million names .
RP : Wait .
What are you saying ?
S : Oh , come on .
You 've seen the Old Testament .
Massacring women and children , spiteful vengeance , telling people to sacrifice their own kids .
And the Koran is hardly better .
Who do you think that was ?
RP : Are you saying there is no God ?
S : It 's more complicated than that .
If you talk about someone who floats outside the world pulling strings , that 's me .
If you pray to God to smite your enemies , I 'm your God .
But now that your image of God has got all nice and forgiving , I can't work with that .
What am I supposed to do with prayers to " bless grandma " ?
RP : So where do those prayers go ?
S : No , you 're thinking about it wrong .
It 's not like a fucking cell phone .
All your nicey nicey shit is not in some cloud palace .
It 's everywhere .
It would even work if you prayed to dirt .
Actually that might work better .
RP : So , getting back to the Iraq war , what are your plans ?
S : Well , again , this is a long shot , since you humans are so sissified , but I want to get a hydrogen bomb used on Baghdad .
You 've had that damn thing for fifty years and you still have n't used it on a city .
I mean , shit or get off the pot .
I 'll probably have to settle for an ordinary heavy bombing , which has just been done to death .
I need you Americans to have the dedication to kill two , three million Iraqis , which is what it will take to hold the country , and also go into Iran and Syria .
That 's probably all that your ground forces are good for .
Really I was hoping to get a lot more mileage out of them .
You know , the Iraqis are shooting and I 'm like , yes , kill , kill !
But then I 'm like , wait -- I need those US forces to last for five or six more countries .
RP : Why ?
S : To stoke up enough hatred of America to burn your country to the ground .
It 's got a lot of fat -- it 'll burn beautifully .
Places like Palestine , Afghanistan , Iraq , they 've been on the shit end for so long that they seldom run around squawking with wounded pride .
Usually they just knuckle down and persist with dignity .
Ooh , I hate that !
But with America , it 's going to be a giant street party of raving self - pity , people tearing their hair out and crying " why me " and vowing eternal psychotic revenge .
Fucking idiots .
I can't wait .
It 's going to be the fire where 9/11 was the match .
RP : Who was behind the 9/11 operation ?
S : Me , of course !
But if you mean who did I work through , there are hierarchies you do n't even know about .
Sometimes the people in them do n't even know , not consciously .
RP : Why did you do it ?
S : I thought that was obvious .
It was the trigger for Armageddon .
I 've been setting it up for a hundred years .
I consider it my masterpiece .
RP : Even though it only killed three thousand --
S : Do n't be stupid .
It 's about the psychic effect .
Did n't you watch it on TV ?
That 's half the reason I invented television .
A billion people watching the most shocking and well - crafted spectacle in history -- do you know what that feels like ?
I 've still got a buzz .
Fuck the deaths -- I won 50 million souls .
I turned a bored , narcissistic nation into a hornet 's nest of blind rage , except hornets calm down in a few minutes and get smart again .
I pulled a mental coup and took full control of your country , and now I 've got the pedal to the floor and it's going to be the biggest thing going the fastest and crashing the hardest that 's ever been .
It 's going to be beautiful .
RP : How , precisely , will it crash ?
S : OK , you caught me with my hopes up .
I was thinking global thermonuclear war but that 's looking pretty unlikely .
Now I 'm thinking your military gets humiliated , your economy tanks , your poor riot , your military attacks them , maybe a little civil war , and then an alliance of Asian countries comes over and conquers your ass .
RP : No way .
S : Oh , believe me , there is a way .
You liberals are like " We 're just turning those poor Arabs into terrorists , " but you have no idea .
You 're still thinking you 're going to be the rich people and have to be frightened by little backpack bombs .
That shit does n't kill anybody .
It 's just to manipulate the elite , and you 're not going to be the elite -- you 're going to be the dirt .
If they want to bomb you they 'll use the military , not a few fanatics in the basement but a million bland morons just doing their jobs , and they 'll convince the world it 's for your own good , just like you did , but you 'll forget so you can indulge in your victimhood .
RP : Back up .
How could Asian countries possibly conquer the USA ?
S : With money .
RP : Oh …
S : Their occupation government 's already in place -- all they have to do is buy off the top with their profits from sitting on the world 's cheapest oil .
The actual work in the foreign conquest of the former United States will be done by the very same dumbshits who now drive around with American flags on their SUV's .
It would be tragic if it was n't so funny .
And then your conquerors will get lazy and stupid , just like you did , and your grandkids will be tough and smart and frighten their rulers with " terrorism , " and around and around forever .

Pratim Biswas and his group have developed a method to make a variety of oxide semiconductors that , when put into water promote chemical reactions that split water into hydrogen and oxygen .
The method provides a new low cost and efficient option for hydrogen production .

Engineers at Washington University in St. Louis have developed a unique photocatalytic cell that splits water to produce hydrogen and oxygen in water using sunlight and the power of a nanostructured catalyst .
The group is developing novel methodologies for synthesis of nanostructured films with superior opto-electronic properties .
One of the methods , which sandwiches three semiconductor films into a compact structure on the nanoscale range , is smaller , more efficient and more stable than present photocatalytic methods , which require multiple steps and can take from several hours to a day to complete .
The discovery provides a new , low - cost and efficient option for hydrogen production and can be used for a variety of distributed energy applications .
Pratim Biswas , Ph.D. , the Stifel and Quinette Jens Professor and Chair of the Department of Energy , Environmental and Chemical Engineering , and his graduate student Elijah Thimsen , recently have developed the well - controlled , gas phase process , and have demonstrated it for synthesizing a variety of oxide semiconductors such as iron and titanium dioxide films in a single step process .
It is based on a simple , inexpensive flame aerosol reactor ( FLAR ) and consists of four mass flow controllers to regulate process gases , a standard bubbler to deliver a precursor , a metal tube that acts as a burner and a water - cooled substrate holder .
" We put these films in water and they promote some reactions that split water into hydrogen and oxygen , " said Biswas .
" We can use any oxide materials such as titanium dioxide , tungsten oxide and iron oxide in nanostructures sandwiched together that make very compact structures .
The process is direct and takes only a few minutes to fabricate .
More important , these processes can be scaled up to produce larger structures in a very cost effective manner in atmospheric pressure processes . "
Collaborations have now been established with Dewey Holten , Ph.D. , Washington University professor of chemistry in Arts & Sciences , to better understand the electron - hole pair kinetics , information that can then be used to tune the synthesis process .
Other collaborations with Robert Blankenship , Ph.D. , Washington University professor of biology and chemistry in Arts & Sciences , are being explored to create hybrid bio-nanostructures that will improve the light absorption efficiencies over a broader range of wavelengths .
Electrospray and other aerosol techniques are being used to create these hybrid films .
The method was described in a recent issue of SPIE , a publication of the International Society for Optical Engineering .
The research is among the first wave of news out of the new Washington University Department of Energy , Environmental and Chemical Engineering , which performs research on energy and environment , including alternative fuels and energy sources , air quality research , nanoparticle technology and particle emission control , among other topics .
Some of the department faculty — 14 members now , expected to double in five to ten years — are active in the University 's ambitious BioEnergy Initiative , which is focused on the development of technologies for the production of next generation biofuels .
The adoption of a systems approach will not only enable development processes for large volume production of liquid fuels from plant - based sources , but also at a low cost , and most importantly , in an environmentally benign manner — not only during the production , but also during the actual usage .

On Friday night , three prisoners in Guantánamo Bay committed suicide .
Two Saudis and one Yemeni hanged themselves .
In a desperate attempt at spin , the US claims this was an act of war or a public relations exercise .
The truth is quite different .
Islam says it goes against God to kill yourself .
So what would drive a man to take his own life , despite his religious beliefs ?
The answer shames the US and its allies , Britain prominently included .
The 460 - plus men in Guantánamo Bay have been held for longer than four years .
Only 10 have been charged with a crime .
Not one has had a trial .
The men are not allowed to visit or speak with family or friends .
Many have suffered serious abuse .
Most are held on the basis of triple and quadruple hearsay , evidence so unreliable that a criminal court would throw it out .
Yet the US says it can imprison the men for the rest of their lives .
Imagine yourself in this environment , told you will never have the chance to stand up in a court and present your side of the argument .
What would you do if no one would listen , if you had been asking for justice for four years and had nothing in return ?
How hopeless would you become ?
Of these three men , little is known .
They were in Camp I , a maximum - security area where prisoners are denied even a roll of toilet paper .
But we do not know the dead men's stories .
While most of the men in Guantánamo have lawyers who fight for their right to a fair trial , these men did not .
Until May , the US refused to even tell us who was in Guantánamo .
But before it finally released the names of everyone there , the Bush administration secured passage of a law barring lawsuits by the prisoners held in Guantánamo .
That means that at last we know the prisoners ' identities , but can do nothing legally to help them .
The men who committed suicide found themselves in just this legal black hole .
They had no legal recourse , just the prospect of a life in prison , in isolation , with no family , no friends , nothing .
They took their lives .
So what now ?
President Bush stated this week that he wants to close Guantánamo , that he wants to give the men trials .
Well , let 's have them - immediately .
The US has had over four years to gather evidence against the men .
Surely that is enough time to prove guilt .
And now it is time to show the world the evidence .
As Harriet Harman , the British constitutional affairs minister , said yesterday , Guantánamo must be opened up to review or shut down .
Will Britain do what is necessary to make this a reality ?
Because this is about even more than the fate of 460 people , it is about whether the US and its allies will lead the world by democratic example , or whether they will continue to give lip service to human rights and open societies , while denigrating those cherished notions with their actions .
If the men in Guantánamo ( and the other US prisons around the world , such as the one at the Bagram air force base in Afghanistan , where over 600 men languish in Guantánamo's hidden twin ) did something wrong , by all means punish them .
But if they did not , they must be sent home .
Mohammed El Gharani , our client at Reprieve , was only 14 when he was seized in a mosque in Pakistan .
He was only 15 when he arrived in Guantánamo Bay .
Already twice this year he has tried to kill himself , once by hanging , once by slitting his wrists .
Let us pray there is movement by the US to finally do justice , before Mohammed , truly only a child , or anyone else in Guantánamo Bay commits suicide .

In object - oriented programming , it is common for a child class 's method to
extend the parent class 's method .
However , inverting this pattern is useful
as well .
Although most object - oriented programming languages support the
former , I have never encountered one that supported the latter .
Nonetheless ,
it is possible to implement this pattern without explicit support from
the programming language , just as it was possible to implement inheritance
in C before C++ was created .
A few interesting features of normal extension should be kept in mind .
First ,
a child class can call its parent class 's method anywhere within its own method .
Hence , the child class is responsible for determining if the parent gets to
go first , last or somewhere in the middle .
Secondly , the child class gets to
choose what to pass to the parent class 's method and what to do with
whatever , if anything , the parent class 's method returns .
Naturally , these
properties hold for each step in the entire class hierarchy .
When inverting
this pattern , these properties are inverted as well .
Hence , the parent class
is responsible for determining if the child gets to go first , last or somewhere
in the middle .
Furthermore , the parent class gets to choose what to pass to
the child class 's method and what to do with whatever , if anything , the child
class 's method returns ( see Figure 1 ) .
____________ | A | ^ | |__________| | | | method ( ) | | | |__________| | | | | | /_\ | | _____|______ | | | B | | | |__________| | | | method ( ) | | | |__________| | | | | | /_\ | | _____|______ | | | C | | | |__________| | | | method ( ) | | | |__________| | v Class Hierarchy Normal Extension Inverse Extension Method Invocation
Figure 1 . Compare Extension with Inverse Extension
The fact that the parent class 's method " wraps " the child class 's method rather than
the other way around is the whole motivation for this pattern .
At first glance , it
is natural to suggest using the Template Method pattern : in the parent class A's
method " a " , call the child class B's method " b " .
This indeed implements the
wrapping behavior , but it is not scalable .
For instance , if a grandchild class C
is added , if b is to wrap C's method , C must add a method c. Creating a new name
for each step in the hierarchy is nowhere near as elegant as simply
calling " super " , which you can do with normal extension .
Furthermore , creating
such names is not flexible .
Suppose you wish to move C to be a subclass of A .
Aside from changing the C's parent class , you also must rename its c
method b.
As your class hierarchies get larger , this irritation becomes worse .
In traditional HTML , that is , in HTML where tables are used for layout , this
pattern is quite helpful .
The parent class is called the Layout .
It has a
method that lays out the page , deciding where the navigation should go and
where the main content should go .
The child class is called the Screen .
It
has a method that outputs the main content .
Although the Screen inherits
from the Layout , it is the Layout 's method that takes control first .
The
Layout then passes control to the Screen 's method -- the opposite of
" super " -- when it is time for the Screen 's method to do its work .
To change
the navigation used on a particular Screen - - login pages and help pages usually
look quite different from normal pages -- simply change that Screen 's parent class .
To have all of the Screens in a section have their own sub-navigations , subclass
the existing Layout with a new Layout and have the Screens subclass the new Layout .
Applicability
Inverse Extension can be used when the behavior of the parent 's method should decorate
the behavior of the child 's method instead of the other way around , especially
if this is true for more than two layers of the class hierarchy .
You
also can use inverse extension when a parent class method needs to control
access to the method of its child class .
Structure , Participants and Collaborations
The structure of the class hierarchy is the same as it is for normal
extension .
One participant is the Parent ( Layout ) , whose method wraps the
child class 's method .
The other participant is the Child ( Screen ) , whose
method does the main task at hand , without having to worry about many of
the details that the parent class 's method handles for it .
The Parent class 's method decides when and if to forward the flow of
control to the Child class 's method .
It optionally may perform additional
operations before and after forwarding the flow of control .
It may pass
any argument it wants to the Child class 's method and do anything it wants
with whatever , if anything , the Child class 's method returns .
Consequences
The Inverse Extension pattern has the following benefits and liabilities :
Changing the child class 's parent class easily changes all of the code that
wraps the child class 's method .
In the example above , changing a normal
Screen 's look - and - feel to match that of a help page involves simply
changing the Screen 's parent ( a Layout ) .
No code within the Screen itself
needs to be changed .

No code within the Screen itself needs to be changed .
The hierarchy is necessarily fixed .
This pattern is not appropriate if you
need to change the decorator dynamically .
The Decorator pattern is more

The Decorator pattern is more appropriate in that case .
It is hard to implement .
If this pattern is not implemented by the
programming language , it may be challenging to implement manually .
Specifically , it requires a bit of meta - programming -- navigating the
inheritance hierarchy and dynamically looking up methods , through
reflection .
Implementation
As mentioned above , implementing this pattern manually requires a bit of
meta - programming :
You must be able to iterate over the class hierarchy .
In languages
such as Python that support multiple inheritance , I have found it
helpful to constrain the iteration to the " leftmost " , that is , the most
primary , classes in the hierarchy , assuming that the others
probably would be mixins .
While iterating over the class hierarchy , you must be able to save a
reference to a method of a given name .
That is , given an instance " obj "
and a method " m " , the goal is to loop over the classes in obj 's class
hierarchy and find all the classes that define m , keeping a list of
references to those methods .
You must have a way for the parent class 's method to call the child
class 's method .
Having created the list of methods named m above , the
parent class 's method must be able to call the next m in the
list .
It may be irritating to have a child class 's method signature be
constrained by a parent class 's method signature .
Suppose a parent
class , A , has two child classes , B and C . A is generic , whereas B and C are more specific .
Let 's apply Inverse Extension to
the method m. B.m may wish to receive one argument whereas C.m
wishes to receive two arguments .
In normal extension , calling B.m or
C.m with a differing number of arguments is no problem .
To maintain
this flexibility for Inverse Extension , it is important that B.m and
C.m be able to have signatures that are different from each other
and from A.m .
To implement this , a " varargs " feature in the language is helpful .
It
often is appropriate for the parent class 's method to accept an arbitrary
number of arguments and simply pass them unmodified to the child class's
method .
Should the caller know Inverse Extension is happening ?
A coworker ,
David Veach , noticed that in normal extension , calling obj.m ( ) hides
whether extension is happening in m .
It often makes sense to observe
this constraint when applying Inverse Extension .
Sample Code
Python 's dynamic nature makes implementing Inverse Extension straightforward .
In consideration of the points above , it is n't difficult to loop over an object 's
class hierarchy , thanks to the __bases__ attribute .
Nor is it hard to look up
a method of a given name in each class , thanks to " getattr " .
When calling a parent class 's method m , a function named callNext is passed as
the first argument .
callNext can be invoked anywhere within the method to
transfer control to the child class .
callNext is implemented using a
closure , containing references to the inheritance hierarchy .
In Java , an Iterator
offers a similar mechanism .
Python also supports a varargs feature , hence the
child class 's method need not be constrained by the parent class 's method .
In the sample code I have provided , in the interest of simplicity , I have not
tried to hide the Inverse Extension pattern from the caller .
Nonetheless ,
hiding the implementation of a private method that uses Inverse Extension
behind the API of a public method is a trivial matter .
Listing 1 contains the sample implementation in Python .
Anthony Eden helped
me to create a similar Java implementation , InverseExtend .
java , which
is shown as Listing 3 at the end of this article .
Listing 1 . Sample Code in Python
def inverseExtend ( boundMethod , * args , ** kargs ) : " " " Iterate downward through a hierarchy calling a method at each step .

This is the bound method of the object you 're interested in .
args , kargs --
The arguments and keyword arguments to pass to the top - level method .
You can call this method via something like this : inverseExtend ( object.method , myArg , myOtherArg )
When calling the method at each step , I 'll call it like this : Class.
method ( object , callNext , *args , ** kargs )
However , the lowest level class 's method has no callNext parameter , since it has no one else to call : Class.
method ( object , *args , ** kargs )
In the method : call Next ( * args , ** kargs ) should be called when it is time to transfer control to the subclass .
This may even be in the middle of the method .
Naturally , you do n't have to pass * args , ** kargs , but a common idiom is for the parent class to just receive * args and ** kargs and pass them on unmodified . " " " # Build all the necessary data structures .

Sidebar : Implementing the Pattern Using Python 's New Generators
For fans of functional programming , serious Python hackers and other
hardcore engineers who think the callNext parameter is inelegant , I
offer an alternate Python implementation of this pattern using Python 's new
generators .
Listing 2 uses generators for non-local flow of control .
No
callNext parameter is needed .
Each parent class method does a
yield * args , ** kargs when it is time to call the child class 's method .
In fact ,
this implementation flattens the recursion down to a loop , despite the fact
that the code is not tail recursive .
In this way , it is similar to a
continuation .
The one drawback of this implementation is it is not
possible to maintain the return value semantics of the earlier
implementation .
That is , it is not possible for each child class method to return a value to its
parent class method because of the nature of generators .
Nonetheless , I
offer Listing 2 as an intriguing use of generators .
Listing 2 . Generator Code for Non-Local Flow of
Control
import types def inverseExtend ( boundMethod , * args , ** kargs ) : " " " Iterate downward through a hierarchy calling a method at each step .
boundMethod --

When calling the method at each step , I 'll call it like this : Class.
method ( object , *args , ** kargs )
Each parent class method * must * be a generator with exactly one yield statement ( even if the yield statement never actually gets called ) , but the lowest level class method must * not* be a generator .
In the parent class : yield args , kargs should be called when it is time to transfer control to the subclass .

Known Uses
Perl Mason uses the Inverse Extension
pattern as a key component of its templating capabilities .
A parent template
can provide a common look - and - feel for each of its child templates .
Naturally ,
a child template has no idea what part of the layout it belongs in , so it is
necessary for the parent template to call the child template with the call
$m-> callnext when it is time to produce its output .
Perl Mason was the inspiration
for the same feature in my Python Web application framework
Aquarium , as well
as for this article .
Related Patterns
The Template Method pattern is similar to the Inverse Extension pattern
when there are only two levels in the class hierarchy .
Each involves a
parent class method calling a child class method .
However , as mentioned
above , the Inverse Extension pattern is more appropriate when the Template
Method pattern needs to be applied recursively -- when there is an
arbitrary and varying number of classes in the class hierarchy .
If the
class hierarchy is deep and volatile , creating a new method name at each
step , which is required by the Template Method pattern , is not scalable .
The Decorator pattern is similar to the Inverse Extension pattern , because
the decorating class 's method calls the decorated class 's method .
However ,
the Decorator pattern is applied at runtime instead of being based on the
class hierarchy .
If you need to wait until runtime in order to associate
which objects get to decorate which other objects , use the Decorator
pattern to apply the decorators dynamically .
If you want the decorators to
be applied automatically based on the class hierarchy , use the Inverse
Extension pattern .

They would be plotting and killing Americans across the world and within our own borders .
By fighting these terrorists in Iraq , Americans in uniform are defeating a direct threat to the American people . ”
So said President Bush on November 30 , 2005 , refining his earlier call to “ bring them on . ”
Jihadist terrorists , the administration ’s argument went , would be drawn to Iraq like moths to a flame , and would perish there rather than wreak havoc elsewhere in the world .
The president ’s argument conveyed two important assumptions : first , that the threat of jihadist terrorism to U.S. interests would have been greater without the war in Iraq , and second , that the war is reducing the overall global pool of terrorists .
However , the White House has never cited any evidence for either of these assumptions , and none appears to be publicly available .
The administration ’s own National Intelligence Estimate on “ Trends in Global Terrorism : implications for the United States , ” circulated within the government in April 2006 and partially declassified in October , states that “ the Iraq War has become the ’ cause celebre ’ for jihadists … and is shaping a new generation of terrorist leaders and operatives . ”
Yet administration officials have continued to suggest that there is no evidence any greater jihadist threat exists as a result of the Iraq War .
“ Are more terrorists being created in the world ? ” then - Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld rhetorically asked during a press conference in September .
“ We do n’t know .
The world does n’t know .
There are not good metrics to determine how many people are being trained in a radical madrasa school in some country .
” In January 2007 Director of National Intelligence John Negroponte in congressional testimony stated that he was “ not certain ” that the Iraq War had been a recruiting tool for Al Qaeda and played down the likely impact of the war on jihadists worldwide : “ I would n’t say there has been a widespread growth in Islamic extremism beyond Iraq .
I really would n’t . ”
Indeed , though what we will call “ The Iraq Effect ” is a crucial matter for U.S. national security , we have found no statistical documentation of its existence and gravity , at least in the public domain .
In this report , we have undertaken what we believe to be the first such study , using information from the world ’s premier database on global terrorism .
The results are being published for the first time by Mother Jones , the news and investigative magazine , as part of a broader “ Iraq 101 ” package in the magazine ’s March / April 2007 issue .
Gravel says he 'd end war on drugs , ' savage ' of inner cities , children

Former Alaska Senator Mike Gravel said the issue in America that " enrages me the most " is the war on drugs , which he vowed to end if elected to the White House .
Gravel was speaking Thursday night at a Democratic debate at Howard University in Washington .
Addressing a question on racial inequality , Gravel said the war on drugs had a particularly devastating effect on minority communities , noting that 70 percent of the more than 2 million people incarcerated in this country are black .
" If I 'm president , I 'll do away with the war on drugs , which does nothing but savage our inner cities and endanger our children , " Gravel said .
Gravel , who receives around 1 percent support in opinion polls , said he would treat drug use as a public health issue , not a crime .
The long - shot candidate returned to criticizing the war on drugs in response to a later question about the prevalence of AIDS among African Americans .
" If they really want to do something about what 's happening to the health of the African American community it 's time to end this war , " Gravel said of the other candidates .
" All it does is create criminals out of people who are not criminals . "

Programming is not complicated because computers are complicated — it ’s complicated because your requirements are complicated ( even if you do n’t know it yet ) .
If extra time is required , people on Theory D projects work nights or weekends , or they cut testing time .
They do this because their belief is that if a task takes too long , the fault lies with the estimate or with the worker carrying out the task , and by working overtime they can “ make up for their fault . ”
Critical Chain is an amazing book .
The narrative form — a novella detailing a technical project team and their search for a way to manage an uncertain process — is a big win , it highlights the important ways that Critical Chain Project Management handles risks and uncertainty and makes it visible where everyone can manage it .
The section on estimating tasks alone is priceless .
If you ca n’t afford a copy and your library does n’t stock it , borrow mine .
You must read this book if you participate in software development teams .
Theory P adherents believe that there are lies , damned lies , and software development estimates .
There are two schools of thought about the practice of managing software development ( the theory of managing software development is of little use to us because “ the gap between theory and practice is narrower in theory than it is in practice ” ) .
One school is that everything is fully deterministic in practice ( “ Theory D ” ) .
If development appears , from the outside , to be probabilistic , it is only because we have n’t discovered the “ hidden variables ” that fully determine the outcome of software development projects .
And , since we are talking about development in practice , it is practical to measure the variables that determine the outcome such that we can predict that outcome in advance .
The other school of thought is that development is fully probabilistic in practice ( “ Theory P ” ) , that there are no hidden variables that could be used to predict with certainty the outcome of a software development project .
Theory P states that the time and effort required to measure all of the variables influencing a software development project precisely enough to predict the outcome with certainty and in advance exceeds the time and effort required develop the software .
Theory P does not mean that software development cannot be managed in such a way that the desired outcome is nearly certain : the flight of an airplane is fully probabilistic as it encounters atmospheric conditions , yet we have a huge industry built around the idea that airplanes arrive at their destinations and land on the runway as planned .
Understanding whether software development follows the Theory D ( fully deterministic ) model or the Theory P ( probabilistic ) model helps us set our expectation for the relationship between what we plan and what transpires .
If we believe Theory D , we believe that it is possible and practical to plan software development entirely in advance .
Therefore , when things do not go as planned , our first reaction is to either blame the planners for faulty planning or to blame the implementers for failing to carry out a reasonable plan .
Believing in Theory D , we believe that we ought to have a plan that can be carried out to perfection .
If we believe Theory P , we believe that it is only possible and practical to plan some part of software development in advance .
Therefore , when things do not go as planned , our first reaction is to embrace the new information and update our expectations .
Believing in Theory P , we believe we ought to have a process for continually updating a plan that asymptotically approaches a description of reality as the project nears its conclusion .
Our belief about which theory is true drives the way we manage software development projects in almost every way .
Here are three examples : the way we manage software design , the way we manage time estimates , and the way we manage selecting people .
Theory D adherents believe you can design software in advance .
They believe it is possible to collect all of the information needed about software ’s requirements and the technical elements of its construction , such that you can fully specify how to build it before you start .
In short , Theory D adherents believe in Big Design Up Front .
Theory P adherents believe that software can only partially be designed in advance .
They believe that requirements suffer from observation , that the act of building software causes the requirements to change .
Theory P adherents also believe that technical factors cannot be perfectly understood , that only the act of trying to build something with specific components will reveal all of the gotchas and who -knews associated with a chosen technology strategy .
They believe that software design is an iterative process , starting with a best guess that is continually refined with experience .
Theory D adherents believe it is possible to estimate the amount of time required to develop software ( in both the large and the small ) with precision .
This is partly a consequence of their belief that you can know the requirements and design in advance , and therefore you can plan the activities required without uncertainty .
Theory D adherents do not plan to miss milestones .
Theory D adherents do not , in fact , have a process around re-estimating tasks ; instead , they have a mechanism for raising exceptions when something goes wrong .
Theory D adherents believe that the normal case for software projects is that tasks are completed within the time estimated .
( If extra time is required , people on Theory D projects work nights or weekends , or they cut testing time .
They do this because their belief is that if a task takes too long , the fault lies with the estimate or with the worker carrying out the task , and by working overtime they can “ make up for their fault . ”
Theory D managers often “ game ” their workers by “ negotiating ” estimates downward in a cruel game of “ guess the estimate I ’m think of . ” )
Theory P adherents believe that there are lies , damned lies , and software development estimates .
This is partly a consequence of their lack of faith that the requirements are truly fixed and that the technology is fully understood .
If you do n’t know what you ’re doing and how you ’ll do it with precision , how can you know when it will be done ?
Theory P adherents build processes around re-estimating estimates , such as burndown charts and time - boxed iterations .
Theory P adherents are always fussing with an updated view of how long things will take .
They talk about “ velocity ” or “ effective vs. actual programmer - hours . ”
Theory P adherents believe that the normal case for software projects is that tasks are rarely completed exactly as estimated , but that as a project progresses , the aggregate variance from estimates falls .
Theory D adherents believe that the most important element of successful software development is planning .
If a plan is properly constructed for the design and development of a software project , the actual implementation is virtually guaranteed .
Theory D adherents invest most of their human capital in “ architects ” and “ managers , ” leaving little for “ programmers . ”
They often have architects , senior developers , and other “ valuable resources ” involved in the early stages of projects and then moved to the early stage of other projects , leaving the team to implement their “ vision . ”
They likewise believe that you can “ parachute ” rescuers into a troubled project .
Since the plan is perfect , it is easy to jump in and be productive .
Theory D adherents believe in “ architecture by proxy , ” the belief that using frameworks , components , programming languages , libraries , or other golden bullets makes it possible to employ lesser talents to perform the implementation of software , since the difficult decisions have been made by the creators of the pre-packaged software .
Theory D adherents also believe in “ success by proxy , ” the belief that using methodologies , practices , SDLCs , or other buzzwords makes it possible to employ lesser talents to perform the management of software development , since the difficult project management decisions have been made by the “ thought leaders ” who coined the buzzwords .
Theory P adherents believe that the most important element of successful software development is learning .
They invest their human capital more evenly between implementers and architects , often blurring the lines to create a flatter technical structure and a more egalitarian decision - making environment .
This is a consequence of the belief that learning is important : if you invest heavily in a few “ smart ” people , you have a very small learning surface exposed : there is only so much even very bright people can learn at one time .
Whereas when the entire team meets a certain standard for competence , there is a very large learning surface exposed and the team is able to absorb more information .
They strongly prefer to have the same team work a single project from start to finish , believing that when a member moves on to another project , crucial knowledge moves on with them .
They likewise abhor bringing new members onto a team late in a project , believing that the new people will need experience with the project to “ get up to speed .
” Theory P adherents use frameworks ( especially testing frameworks ) , but are skeptical of claims that the framework eliminates technical risk or the need for talented contributors .
Theory P adherents , even Agilists , are skeptical of methodology claims as well .
They do not believe that a deck of slides and a nicely bound book can capture the work required to learn how to develop software for a particular user community in a particular environment .
Theory D and Theory P adherents are easy to distinguish by their behaviour .
Which theory fits the evidence collected in sixty years of software development ?
To date , Theory P is the clear winner on the evidence , and it ’s not even close .
Like any reasonable theory , it explains what we have observed to date and makes predictions that are tested empirically every day .
Theory D , on the other hand , is the overwhelming winner in the marketplace , and again it ’s not even close .
The vast majority of software development projects are managed according to Theory D , with large , heavyweight investments in design and planning in advance , very little tolerance for deviation from the plan , and a belief that good planning can make up for poor execution by contributors .
Does
Theory D reflect reality ?
From the perspective of effective software development , I do not believe so .
However , from the perspective of organizational culture , theory D is reality , and you ignore it at your peril .
Do not confuse Computer Science — the study of the properties of computing machines — with Software Development , the employment of humans to build computing machines .
The relationship between Computer Science and Software Development parallels the relationship between Engineering , the hard science of the behaviour of constructions , and Project Management , the employment of humans to construct engineered artefacts .

IN THE aftermath of the massacre at Virginia Tech university on April 16th , as the nation mourned a fresh springtime crop of young lives cut short by a psychopath 's bullets , President George Bush and those vying for his job offered their prayers and condolences .
They spoke eloquently of their shock and sadness and horror at the tragedy ( see article ) .
The Democratic speaker of the House of Representatives called for a “ moment of silence ” .
Only two candidates said anything about guns , and that was to support the right to have them .
Cho Seung - hui does not stand for America 's students , any more than Dylan Klebold and Eric Harris did when they slaughtered 13 of their fellow high - school students at Columbine in 1999 .
Such disturbed people exist in every society .
The difference , as everyone knows but no one in authority was saying this week , is that in America such individuals have easy access to weapons of terrible destructive power .
Cho killed his victims with two guns , one of them a Glock 9 mm semi-automatic pistol , a rapid - fire weapon that is available only to police in virtually every other country , but which can legally be bought over the counter in thousands of gun-shops in America .
There are estimated to be some 240 m guns in America , considerably more than there are adults , and around a third of them are handguns , easy to conceal and use .
Had powerful guns not been available to him , the deranged Cho would have killed fewer people , and perhaps none at all .
But the tragedies of Virginia Tech — and Columbine , and Nickel Mines , Pennsylvania , where five girls were shot at an Amish school last year — are not the full measure of the curse of guns .
More bleakly terrible is America 's annual harvest of gun deaths that are not mass murders : some 14,000 routine killings committed in 2005 with guns , to which must be added 16,000 suicides by firearm and 650 fatal accidents ( 2004 figures ) .
Many of these , especially the suicides , would have happened anyway : but guns make them much easier .
Since the killing of John Kennedy in 1963 , more Americans have died by American gunfire than perished on foreign battlefields in the whole of the 20th century .
In 2005 more than 400 children were murdered with guns .
The trigger and the damage done
The news is not uniformly bad : gun crime fell steadily throughout the 1990s and early 2000s .
But it is still at dreadful levels , and it rose sharply again in 2005 .
Police report that in many cities it rose even faster in 2006 .
William Bratton , the police chief of Los Angeles ( and formerly of New York ) , speaks of a “ gathering storm of crime ” .
Politicians on both sides , he says , have been “ captured ” by the vocal National Rifle Association ( NRA ) .
The silence over Virginia Tech shows he has a point .
The Democrats have been the most disappointing , because until recently they had been the party of gun control .
In 1994 President Bill Clinton approved a bill banning assault weapons ( covering semi-automatic rifles plus high - capacity magazines for handguns ) and the year before that a bill imposing a requirement for background checks .
But Democrats believe they paid a high price for their courage : losing the House of Representatives in 1994 shortly after the assault - weapons ban , and then losing the presidency in 2000 .
Had Al Gore held Arkansas or West Virginia or his own Tennessee , all strongly pro-gun , he would have won the election .
These days , with hopes for a victory in 2008 dependent on the South and the mountain West , it is a brave Democrat who will talk about gun control .
Some of them dismiss the very idea as “ insensitive ” .
Mr Bush however , has done active damage .
On his watch the assault - weapons ban was allowed to lapse in 2004 .
New laws make it much harder to trace illegal weapons and require the destruction after 24 hours of information gathered during checks of would - be gun-buyers .
The administration has also reopened debate on the second amendment , which enshrines the right to bear arms .
Last month an appeals court in Washington , DC , overturned the capital 's prohibition on handguns , declaring that it violates the second amendment .
The case will probably go to the newly conservative Supreme Court , which might end most state and local efforts at gun control .
Freedom yes , but which one ?
No phrase is bandied around more in the gun debate than “ freedom of the individual ” .
When it comes to most dangerous products — be they drugs , cigarettes or fast cars — this newspaper advocates a more liberal approach than the American government does .
But when it comes to handguns , automatic weapons and other things specifically designed to kill people , we believe control is necessary , not least because the failure to deal with such violent devices often means that other freedoms must be curtailed .
Instead of a debate about guns , America is now having a debate about campus security .
Americans are in fact queasier about guns than the national debate might suggest .
Only a third of households now have guns , down from 54 % in 1977 .
In poll after poll a clear majority has supported tightening controls .
Very few Americans support a complete ban , even of handguns — there are too many out there already , and many people reasonably feel that they need to be able to protect themselves .
But much could still be done without really infringing that right .
The assault - weapons ban should be renewed , with its egregious loopholes removed .
No civilian needs an AK - 47 for a legitimate purpose , but you can buy one online for $ 379.99 .
Guns could be made much safer , with the mandatory fitting of child - proof locks .
A system of registration for guns and gun-owners , as exists in all other rich countries , threatens no one but the criminal .
Cooling - off periods , a much more open flow of intelligence , tighter rules on the trading of guns and a wider blacklist of those ineligible to buy them would all help .
Many of these things are being done by cities or states , and have worked fairly well .
But jurisdictions with tough rules are undermined by neighbours with weak ones .
Only an effort at the federal level will work .
Michael Bloomberg , the mayor of New York , has put together a coalition of no fewer than 180 mayors to fight for just that .
Good luck to him .
In the past , Tata Consultancy Services needed only to turn to the top engineering schools in the country : the nine campuses of the Indian Institutes of Technology and a few others gaining admission can be more difficult than getting into the Ivy League .
Today the list includes 209 institutions , many of them , like this one , brand - new private colleges that have emerged to meet the need .
Mr. Rangasamy , the college ’s founder , is himself the product of the Indian economic expansion .
His factories produce tablecloths and bedsheets for Kmart and Marriott .
Mr. Rangasamy himself has no more than a fourth - grade education and speaks not a word of English .
But the cluster of colleges he has built educate nearly 12,000 students .
Of those , nearly 3,600 study software engineering , and most of them , college officials say , are the first in their families to attend college .
The imprimatur of Tata Consultancy would clearly be a prize for the college , and the campus was festooned with flowers and banners welcoming the company team .
To be certified as part of the company ’s pool would mean that its students would have a chance of getting a job even before graduation , and other perks for the college — faculty training , course materials , research opportunities for teachers and students .
The number of technical schools in India , including engineering colleges , has more than tripled in the last 10 years , according to the All India Council of Technical Education .
Most are privately run .
A new kind of institution has emerged to offer intensive English language training and instruction in technical skills required for the workplace for those between college and career .
They are called finishing schools , and Nasscom is rolling out its own by early next year .
In the end , the Rangasamy college did not fit the company ’s bill .
The team found deficiencies in the way basic subjects were taught and deemed the students to be average .
Higher education is still available only to a tiny slice of India ’s young .
No more than 10 percent of Indians ages 18 to 25 are enrolled in college , according to official figures .
Nearly 40 percent of Indians over the age of 15 are illiterate .
Principles for Coping with the Evolution of Computing
Computers collaborate in the Internet much the way cells collaborate in multicellular organisms and the way organisms compete and collaborate in ecologies .
What are the parallels and what can we learn from them ?
Single cell organisms evolved into multicellular organisms a billion years ago .
Computing has made a similar transition in just a few decades .
In 1975 , few computers communicated directly with others and there was no Internet .
Today tens of billions of computers around the world exchange information at Internet speeds .
The role that interacting computers play has changed dramatically as their costs dropped and their numbers exploded .
They entertain us , help us shop , help manage the lights in our homes , help us communicate with and befriend each other , enhance our memories , recognize our faces , ' understand ' our speech , and ' talk ' to us .
Yet computers know not what they do , nor ' know ' who they do it for , or why !
As the digital world inexorably becomes more complex it encounters problems common to all complex systems – problems already solved in the evolution of living systems .
This website explores the challenges of complexity and discusses architectural solutions for the problems inherent in increasingly complex systems .
In the late 1960s a handful of computers in universities and research labs began to be connected together in a persistent high - speed network called ARPANET .
A descendant of that network eventually became the Internet .
In 1990 Tim Berners - Lee put the first Web page up on the open Internet .
The web was born and it grew rapidly -- today there are over 1.5 billion web pages to choose from .
An isolated computer is an oddity .
Computers surround us , they are in our pockets or purses , are on our wrists and in our cars , houses and offices .
Google , Amazon , Microsoft , Yahoo , Baidu ( China 's Google - like equivalent ) and many other less well - known organizations spider / crawl the web for various purposes .
Google led the way to monetizing all the data thereby gathered by selling ads .
They stored the contents of all the websites they crawled on large numbers of servers and developed quite sophisticated algorithms to characterize the web pages and sites .
They then used proprietary " page rank " algorithms to decide which pages to recommend for various searches .
It is estimated that google employs over a million servers for such tasks .
Prior to 2000 , corporate data centers tended to be housed in the firm 's basement .
Dedicated " server farms " did n't emerge until the late '90s during the dotcom bubble .
Today servers are located in more than half a million server - farms around the world ( photo shows a part of Facebook 's server - farm in Lulea , Sweden ) .
The digital world inexorably becomes more and more complex .
It records our emails , phone calls , eCommerce purchases , searches and social media interactions .
Facebook also analyzes all this data for hints about our buying preferences , our opinions and even for the identity of those that appear in our photos .
Google 's many server farms around the world spider virtually all web - pages cataloging their content so that it can recommend the page it judges to be what we are looking for when we browse the Web .
Other servers at data centers owned by the likes of Amazon , Switch , Microsoft , Twitter , and the NSA gather and store different sorts of data for many known and unknown purposes .
At least one , Cambridge Analytica specializes in analyzing individuals ' political viewpoints to influence votes .
There are millions of servers that store , catalog , and make searchable information about people , products , businesses , real estate , government activities , universities , weather , crops , livestock , and almost anything else one can imagine ( see History of Computing ) .
Server farms handle the big - data issues in the Web .
The Internet of Things ( IoT ) deals with the small things : smart door locks for the home , wireless cameras , smart electric plugs , smart AC and heater vents , wearable exercise monitors , smart refrigerators , baby - cams and even smart pill bottles .
Yet collectively they provide more compute power and wifi capability than we could have imagined a few years ago .
Most of their processing is wasted in idle loops -- so far .
But various parties seek to harness the collective IoT compute power for their own use with or without permission .
The number of IoT devices increased 31 % to 8.4 billion in 2017 , 14.2 billion in 2019 and there are expected to be 20 billion devices by 2020 .
They are problematic because they are very poorly protected from hackers .
They are sold with simple default passwords and all too many people see no reason to change those passwords or , if they do change the defaults , the new passwords are all too often simple and easy to guess .
So the hackers who seek to create large botnets out of IoT devices have found it easy .
On October 12 , 2016 , a new botnet appeared called Mirai that nearly took down the Internet .
And the code for it was put out on the net .
In January 2018 , a Mirai variant called iTroop or Reaper was used to target three large Financial institutions .
In multicellular computing terms , botnets can best be thought of as Internet cancers .
Another facet of computation that poses problems for society is the rise of cryptocurrencies .
Venezuela , among other countries , is talking about making bitcoin their national currency .
Cryptocurrencies are one use of Blockchain legers .
IBM , State Street Bank , Accenture , Fujitsu , Intel and other heavyweights formed The Hyperledger Fabric project around the end of 2015 to formalize and harden the notion of blockchains .
They recommend isolating the ledger from the general cloud computing environment , building a security container for the ledger to prevent unauthorized access , and offering tamper - responsive hardware , that can shut itself down if it detects someone trying to hack a ledger .
That is analogous to biological apoptosis ( see below ) Finally , machine learning is becoming increasingly popular .
Machine learning has already been adopted by many well - heeled parties .
There is already specialized machine learning hardware running 7x24 .
The evolution of computing is similar to the evolution of other complex systems -- biological , social , ecological , and economic systems .
In each of these domains , the elements become increasingly more specialized and sophisticated , and they interact with each other in ever more complex ways .
From that perspective , the similarities between biology and computing are not coincidental .
Multicellular computing already is adopting four major organizing principles of multicellular biological systems because they help tame the spiraling problems of complexity and out - of - control interactions in the Internet .
They are :
Specialization - Multicellular systems support much richer functionality than single cell and single computer systems .
They do it by the collaboration between specialized cells .
There are , for example , about 250 specialized types of cells in humans .
Unspecialized cells such as many cancer cells are dangerous because they do n't " play well with others . "
Specialization in computing is important for similar reasons .
We are finding that unspecialized general - purpose computers , especially unprotected IoT systems with ARM processors , are increasingly dangerous to multicellular computing systems .
Messaging - Cooperating cells or computers must communicate safely with one another .
The " meaning " of cell - to - cell messages must be determined by the receiving cell , not the sender .
To that end , cells communicate with each other via messenger molecules , never DNA .
Similarly , communication between computers in multicellular systems relies increasingly upon message passing .
Here again , the receiver not the sender determines the meaning of the messages .
It is especially dangerous for computers to transfer code from one machine to another precisely because code predetermines the resulting behavior of the receiving machine , and all too often contains malware .
Code endangers the health of the receiving machine and hence the larger system of which it is a part .

Stigmergy - Messages orchestrate cooperation in real - time .
Longer term or more persistent collaboration requires longer - lived messages that can be deposited in some structure where they can be later encountered by others .
This sort of messaging has become known if the field of biology as stigmergy .
Analogously , stigmergy in computing systems is supported by persistent external data , e.g. , in databases , and network connectivity structures .
Persistent data are especially important for organizing cooperative computing in the Internet .

Apoptosis ( Programmed cell death ) - Despite all precautions , cells and computers do go awry .
They may also simply outlive their usefulness , Every healthy cell in a multicellular organism is programmed to commit suicide if their removal is in the best interest of the organism as a whole .
Cells that are infected by viruses or become cancerous usually kill themselves unless the programmed cell death mechanism itself is compromised .
We are only recently learning the importance of sacrificing compromised computers for the health of the whole multicellular computing system .
The recent appearance of the Internet of Things ( IoT ) and botnets exploiting IoT devices creates , in effect , out - of - control computing cancer cells that do not kill themselves ( activate apoptosis ) when compromised .
are not independent
These principles ; they are deeply intertwined both in life and in computing .
This site explores these principles in considerable detail -- more detail than most readers would want to absorb in one sitting .
It presents each principle in its biological context and describes its benefits both for multicellular life and for computing .
If you are impatient , you might want to skip right to the end of the story and read the conclusions .
However , as with many a mystery novel , reading the last few pages will tell you who - done - it without telling you the most interesting part ... why .

Reuters fires editor over Coulter book RAW STORY
Published : Monday October 9 , 2006 Print This Email
This Reuters editor Joe Maguire has parted ways with the news agency after it reviewed a copy of his upcoming book , Brainless : The Lies and Lunacy of Ann Coulter , according to a report in today 's New York Times .
According to a website promoting the book , called Ann Coulter Is Brainless , " In BRAINLESS , journalist Joe Maguire takes an incisive look at Coulter , both the private and the public personas , and takes aim at those issues at the helm of her agenda  9/11 , Iraq , abortion , Christianity , the Democratic Party , and gender and race issues to name a few  and uncovers her contradictory statements , her questionable research , and her insatiable and socio- pathic need to say just about anything to stay in the spotlight . "
Excerpts from the registration - restricted Times story follow : #  There was a difference of opinion about the approval I received to write this book ,  Mr. Maguire said .
 I thought I had met the conditions , and proceeded accordingly .
As a result , I no longer work there . ... Reuters confirmed that Mr. Maguire was granted conditional approval to write his book on Ms. Coulter  a conservative lightning rod , author and TV talking head .
When asked what changed once the book was ready , a company statement pointed to Reuters  principles of integrity , independence and freedom from bias . 
The statement reads :  Our editorial policy and The Reuters Trust Principles are prominently displayed for all to see on www.about.reuters.com.
Mr. Maguires book will soon be available .
Both speak for themselves . ... A Reuters employee who insisted on anonymity out of concern at angering management said that the 20 or so employees at the markets desk where Mr. Maguire had been one of two editors in charge took a group coffee break in solidarity on Thursday .
On Friday , [ one Reuters ] employee said , there was a meeting with Reuters management informing the workers there that Mr. Maguire would no longer be working there and that they werent allowed to ask why .
Printed copies of the principles of trust were handed out , however .
TEN years ago , Californians banned the state from choosing one race over another .
The initiative they voted for , Proposition 209 , was broadly ( and blandly ) phrased .
But everybody knew what it meant .
The practice of affirmative action , whereby some university applicants were favoured simply because of race or ethnicity , was outlawed , and a long attempt to salve the nation 's racial wounds ended .
Washington state 's voters went on to ban racial preferences in 1998 , Michigan just last month .
But what happened in the state that started the trend ?
Ten years ago , the abolition of affirmative action was widely expected to transform the racial mix of California 's top universities and turn them into less diverse places .
The first prediction turned out to be right ; the second did not .
In 1995 , the University of California 's eight undergraduate colleges enrolled 945 black students .
In 1998 , the first year when the colour - blind regime was fully enforced , they enrolled 739 — a drop of 22 % in a period when the number of new students rose by more than a tenth .
In the two most prestigious colleges , Berkeley and UCLA , the number of blacks fell by 47 % .
The proportion of black students has never returned to the level of the mid-1990s .
But the University of California 's campuses have become more diverse anyway .
Last year , 15 % of newly admitted students were Hispanic and an astonishing 41 % were Asian .
Whites , who were supposed to benefit most from the demise of affirmative action , comprised 34 % of the new intake — a smaller proportion than in 1995 , and less than their share of California 's high - school graduates .
Asians are packing California 's lecture halls partly because they do so well in tests , and partly because they are less welcome elsewhere .
Elite universities on the east coast continue to favour black and Hispanic candidates .
They also favour the children of donors and alumni , most of whom are white .
Last year , 47 % of whites and 46 % of blacks who were offered a place at the University of California took it up , compared with 65 % of Asians .
California 's universities are at least providing a route to the upper - middle class for an immigrant group that suffers discrimination in other parts of America .
And there are other changes , hard to imagine without Proposition 209 , of which they can also be proud .
The decade - ago row over how many fairly successful black 18 - year - olds ought to be admitted to the state 's top universities was always somewhat beside the point .
The real scandal was , and is , the tiny numbers of successful black 18 - year - olds .
Thanks to strong unions and decades of underfunding , California may rank well above average in teachers ' pay : but it is below average on staff - to - student ratios and spending per pupil .
Blacks and Hispanics are particularly badly served .
As soon as it became clear that affirmative action would be done away with , the state 's public universities began to concentrate their attentions on California 's schools .
They sent their trainee teachers to some of the most troubled ones , and , by entering into partnerships , nudged them to improve .
They offered places to the top 4 % of pupils in every school that offered the right courses , regardless of how bad it was , on the ground that those who prevail in bad environments have at least shown gumption .
Ward Connerly , a black businessman who backed Proposition 209 , dislikes such outreach efforts , calling them a Trojan horse for racial preferences .
But they are much less controversial than affirmative action .
And because they are targeted at the least privileged pupils , rather than well - schooled ones who happen not to be white or Asian , they may prove a better way of solving the state 's real inequities .
While the American people pine for peace , our leaders are intent on war : that ’s the anomaly of American " democracy , " one that speaks ill of the effort to export our system at gunpoint .
Adopt " democracy , " and you , too , can be ruled by a warmongering oligarchy .
Americans oppose an attack on Iran 2 - to - 1 .
By almost every measure , they want negotiations , rather than confrontation , with Tehran .
Yet the House Foreign Affairs Committee recently gave its approval to a bill that , in effect , would fire the first shot at the Iranians , imposing draconian sanctions similar to those enacted against Iraq in the run-up to the invasion and occupation of that country .
Similarly , this new sanctions regime sets the stage for the coming war with Iran .
The Iran Counter - Proliferation Act [ .pdf ] , so - called , does n’t bother targeting goods and services that Iran might put to military use .
Instead , it takes a broad - brush approach and openly seeks to strangle Iran economically .
The legislation , written by champion warmonger Tom Lantos , would prohibit the import of any and all items from Iran , ban dealings with Iranian banks , stop the export of items having to do with civil aviation , and ratchet up the pressure on other countries to impose similar restrictions .
Furthermore , Lantos wants a report from the White House every six months on the " progress " being made to tighten the chokehold on Iran .
Looking at this from the Iranian side , it is clearly an act of war , especially in the context of the Iran Freedom and Support Act , which provided millions to fund " regime change " in the land of the mullahs
The Lantos bill is a naked provocation that stops just short of an all - out attack  and paves the way for military action , in spite of a proviso that reads " Nothing in this Act shall be construed as authorizing the use of force or the use of the United States Armed Forces against Iran . "
Having already declared our intention to bring down the regime by funding opposition groups , this latest vow by the U.S. Congress to destroy the Iranian economy is the equivalent of the Wicked Witch of the West skywriting " Surrender Dorothy " in the skies above Tehran .
With Lantos and the anti-Iran Democrats leading the charge on the political front , the Bush administration is moving on the military front .
Recent developments are ominous : namely , the addition of another aircraft carrier , the USS Enterprise , to the two already looming off the Iranian coast .
( Yes , I know that last link is to Debka.com , hardly a fountainhead of journalistic accuracy , but this Newsweek report prefigured it . )
What amounts to a Republican–Democratic pincer movement is evidence that a real consensus has developed in our nation ’s capital that war with Iran is inevitable .
True , there are some minor disagreements along the way , with the Democrats , led by the sickening hypocrite Lantos , demanding these draconian sanctions , and the White House opposing them on the grounds that new sanctions undermine our multilateral diplomatic effort to isolate Tehran .
Lantos , that pious old fraud , inserted language in his bill that pays minimal lip service to the idea of resolving this dispute through diplomacy  while the rest of his bill is clearly designed to sink diplomatic initiatives that are bound to run aground on the rocks of sanctions .
Lantos really is a piece of work .
Here he is insulting Jacques Chirac and calling former German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder a " political prostitute " for having the foresight to oppose our disastrous Iraqi adventure .
Of Schroeder , Lantos barked :
" I referred to him as a political prostitute , now that he ’s taking big checks from [ Russian President Vladimir ] Putin .
But the sex workers in my district objected , so I will no longer use that phrase . "
The respectful use of the term " sex workers " indicates Lantos really has no moral objections to prostitution , he merely objects to the nationality of Schroeder ’s customers .
Yet Schroeder ’s employment in an oil - gas venture that is 51 percent owned by Gazprom no more makes Schroeder a Russian prostitute than big campaign contributions to Lantos from the Washington PAC make him a whore for Israel .
Presumably , Schroeder believes trade with Russia is in Germany ’s ( and Europe ’s ) interests , just as Lantos thinks America ’s current policy of unconditional support for Israel is good for America .
As for Chirac , Lantos was at his most bombastic .
The former French president , said Lantos ,
" should go down to the Normandy beaches .
He should see those endless rows of white marble crosses and stars of David representing young Americans who gave their lives for the freedom of France . "
Lantos should go down to Walter Reed Army Hospital and see those endless rows of wounded soldiers maimed in an unwinnable , futile war that he voted to authorize and continues to support .
He should go visit this guy and come back and tell us that he was right about Iraq , just as he is about Iran .
The coming war with Iran is brought to you by the Dick Cheney wing of the Democratic Party , in collaboration , of course , with the Dick Cheney wing of the GOP .
With Lantos one of their chief spokesmen and Hillary Clinton their designated presidential candidate , the Demo - Cheneyites are determined to pull off what their Republican counterparts lack the political capital to accomplish .
If the shooting starts under Bush ’s watch  as is very likely  then the Democrats can blame the Republicans even as they pave the way for war politically , diplomatically , and in every other way possible .
As the Democratic presidential candidates dither over Iraq , pretending to oppose the war while continuing the funding without conditions or meaningful oversight , they all agree that a U.S. attack on Iran is " on the table " as long as Tehran maintains its right to develop nuclear power for ostensibly peaceful purposes .
Furthermore , the Iraq war and the looming possibility of a conflict with Iran are no longer separable .
As I have said numerous times in this space , the Iraq war cannot be contained within Iraq ’s borders , and the " spillover effect " is bound to result in a border incident that could spark a wider conflict .
As Rep. Ron Paul has warned , a Gulf - of - Tonkin - like incident in the Persian Gulf or on the Iran - Iraq border could easily be manufactured by an administration hell - bent on war  and perhaps we are seeing the first signs of it here .
The conflict , once initiated , will not be restricted to the Persian Gulf region and the long Iran - Iraq border but will break out all over the Middle East , erupting in Lebanon and rippling outward all the way to Pakistan in a seismic wave that could topple every regime in the region .
In this way , the administration ’s goal of " regime change " throughout the Middle East will be accomplished and the neocons ’ " domino theory " confirmed  albeit not in a way they ever intended .
You ’ll note that the White House and its pet generals are nowadays referring to the Iraqi insurgency as " al - Qaeda , " a neat rhetorical sleight - of - hand that prefigures what may happen once a regional war  the neocons ’ vaunted " World War IV "  gets started : the ultimate empowerment of America ’s deadliest enemies .
With a pro-al - Qaeda regime ensconced in Islamabad , the prospect of nuclear - armed terrorists  the ultimate bogeyman conjured up by the War Party  will become a self - fulfilling prophecy .
In the end , we are confronted with the utter craziness of the War Party and its agenda in the Middle East .
This pathological condition was recently reconfirmed by Johann Hari ’s account of a National Review - sponsored cruise to Puerto Vallarta featuring Norman Podhoretz and Bill Buckley , along with a boatload of neocons and well - heeled red-state - fascist types on board .
The Pod Man and Buckley nearly came to blows over the war question , when Buckley asked Poddy if it did n’t bother him that the famed " weapons of mass destruction " were nowhere to be found in Iraq .
“ There were WMD , and they were shipped to Syria , " snapped the Pod Man .
Syria ?
Is he serious ?
I ’m afraid he is
Continuing his rant , the Pod Man avers : " This picture of a country in total chaos with no security is false .
It has been a triumph .
It could n’t have gone better . ”
Better  for whom ?
Well , for Israeli hardliners , to start with , who now have 150,000 American soldiers in the Middle East to set against another of their mortal enemies .
Better for the neocons , who still control the commanding heights of U.S. policymaking centers in Washington and who are now within reach of their goal of " regime change " throughout the region .
As for the rest of us , including poor Buckley , who ’s had his own magazine ( and movement ) hijacked by the Pod Man and the neocon pod-people 
“ I have lots of ex-friends on the left ; it looks like I ’m going to have some ex-friends on the right , too ”  if you ’re sick of war , you ’re no friend of the Pod Man’s .
If you ’re sick of the Pod Man  who is engaged in a friendly competition with Joshua Muravchik for the title of warmonger - in - chief of the bomb - Iran crowd  then get in line , because even the most hard - core conservatives , who once supported the president ’s relentless policy of aggression in the Middle East , are now having second thoughts .
Buckley ’s face - off with Podhoretz dramatizes , in concentrated form , the slow burn of Republican members of Congress who fear for their seats and the future of the GOP as the neocons drag them down to political oblivion .
How long will Republicans , and conservatives in general , consent to carry the millstone of neoconservatism around their necks ?
Make no mistake about it : we are headed straight for another war in the Middle East , and it is going to be a doozy .
The Democrats will protest that they never wanted it , even as they facilitate the war plans of this administration to the nth degree .
Do n’t dare imagine that a change of administrations will avert the coming war with Iran : a Democratic administration in power will just mean that we ’ll have Cheneyism without Cheney , at least when it comes to Iran .
The Iranians claim they are n’t building weapons , only developing nuclear power for peaceful purposes because they want to export more of their oil .
Yet who could blame them if they were building nukes  after being denounced as the main spoke on the " axis of evil " by the president of the United States and threatened with a heavy U.S. military buildup in Iraq and the Gulf ?
They once did offer to negotiate over not only their nuclear program but also their support for Hezbollah and radical Palestinian factions  but this offer was rudely rejected at the behest of Cheney and his cohorts .
This offer should be reexamined and revived : it could and should provide the basis for a negotiated settlement of all outstanding issues between Washington and Tehran .
The United States lived with Soviet nukes aimed at American cities for 50 - plus years : we can live with Iranian nukes aimed at Israeli cities ( and Israeli nukes targeting Iranian cities ) .
The alternative is war  and a regional conflagration that will have economic and geopolitical consequences that can only be catastrophic for America .

The subtleties of " sagging "
In pictures
As one US town outlaws the public wearing of overly revealing leg wear , some believe that visible underpants should be left to the fashion police alone .
The crackdown on exposed boxer shorts and protruding bare bottoms in Delcambre , Louisiana , has brought a legal dimension to a view of public decency in the Western world usually confined to school regulations .
A similar bid for a state - wide ban was thrown out by Louisiana three years ago but a 2005 bill in Virginia managed to clear the lower house of America 's oldest legislative body .
It was then killed off by the Virginia senate amid national ridicule including jokes about a " Boxers Rebellion " .
Showing undergarments is always seen as being rude or obscene purely because there is another layer of clothing on top
Andrew Groves
fashion designer
Now , however , anyone upset by the underpants of strangers can be confident that at least in Delcambre , population 2,000 , offenders face a fine of $ 500 ( £ 254 ) and even six months in jail .
But are low - slung trousers already an endangered species ?
Saggies and trackies
" It 's bizarre because in fashion we 've stopped wearing those baggy jeans , " says fashion designer Andrew Groves , who heads the University of Westminster 's fashion department .
FAMOUS FASHION FURORES
Malawi miniskirt scare , 2003 : A mass assault on a Brazilian woman in Blantyre highlighted attacks linked to the fashion Miss World bikini row , 1951 : Two - pieces were banned from the contest for two decades after Miss Sweden was crowned wearing hers Dior 's New Look , 1947 : Enraged by the extravagance of a tight - waist , full - skirt dress amid austerity , women ripped them off their wearers in the streets of Paris
Malawi's mini-skirt fears
" They 're getting worked up 15 years too late about something that is probably quite dying out , " he told the BBC News website .
For the London college 's graduate fashion week , he recalls , every model who turned up for casting arrived in tight , skinny jeans " and the models always wear the latest look " .
However , street fashion and high fashion are two different things , Groves stresses , and if the baggies often slip , they have never quite come off for some .
The loose style seems to have been copied initially from US prisons where inmates are not given belts as a precaution against hanging .
Rappers picked up the look , the fans followed suit .
Groves compares this to a recent fashion among gangs of adolescent boys in north - west England who wore tracksuit bottoms tucked into their socks .
" That also comes from prison when people used to hide contraband in their trouser bottoms and socks so that it would n't fall out , " he says .
The " saggy " phenomenon is " definitely about peer pressure " , says fashion stylist Reyes Lora , who leads projects at London - based educational charity Fashion Awareness Direct ( Fad ) .
" It 's about what 's in the shops , the magazines and the music videos . "
It may also , she told the BBC News website , be about " men going towards the more feminine look and I think that has to do with how much they show ... "
The person beneath
The issue of exposing bare flesh has less to do with low - slung baggies than low - rise jeans , the " rise " being the technical term for the crotch - waist measurement .
We are not trying to dictate a fashion ourselves but only reminding people that they are dressing a person
Reyes Lora
project director , Fashion Awareness Direct
Andrew Groves is shocked to see women still displaying their G - strings in the street .
" You can really see that still happens , but just because it 's prevalent , is it cool ? " he asks .
" You can't get away from the fact that it is sexual but you 'll be walking down the street and you 'll see somebody with the whole of their bum sticking out of their jeans and you just think it 's so extreme . "
While for most young men in saggies , the issue is attention not attraction , revealing trousers on a girl have different connotations and may send out the wrong message , says Lora .
Through workshops and competitions , Fad promotes original fashion among young people , particularly from disadvantaged backgrounds .
" You have people thinking that they have to sell themselves or be provocative or shocking and we want to encourage them to project more than this fake image , " says the stylist .
" We seek to show the other , attractive , creative side of fashion , which is about clothes people are happy to wear , not peer pressure or what designers dictate .
" We are not trying to dictate a fashion ourselves but only reminding people that they are dressing a person . "
One man 's underpants ...
What Andrew Groves finds funny about the saggy saga in the US is the way underwear can offend depending on the context .
Are we confusing fashion with fascism here ?
foxtrottango1 , Rincon , New Mexico
BBC News website reader
Have your say
" If we are talking about exposing boxer shorts , you can take that back into mainstream fashion history , " he says .
" You have Vivienne Westwood using corsets and undergarments as outer garments in the early 1980s and then Jean - Paul Gaultier using conical bras .
" Showing undergarments is always seen as being rude or obscene purely because there is another layer of clothing on top .
" If someone just had a swimsuit on you would n't think that was necessarily obscene . "
Any legislation seeking to control people via their clothing is always doomed to failure , the fashion designer believes .
" People just adapt their clothing to make another gesture that is more obscene or more anti-establishment , " he says .
" Ultimately this is about young people annoying older people , and older people annoying them back . "
Ahh , the Chavez apologists said it was just RCTV , it was only because of their participation in the coup …
But now he ’s got Globovision in his sights :
Venezuelan President Hugo ChÃ¡vez resurfaced on Tuesday , two days after the end of broadcasts of private television station RCTV and , in a mandatory nationwide radio and TV broadcast , he warned the media , in particular news TV channel GlobovisiÃ³n , “ to cool down ” because he would not tolerate the media to create national chaos by staging a “ show ” aimed at “ heating ” the streets .
“ You , brother , up there in the hills on Caracas , in ( low - income areas ) Petare , Catia , 23 de enero , and even here in ( coastal ) Vargas state , listen up !
If we had to launch another April 13 , I will command it myself to defend our revolution from this renewed fascist assault !
I am warning the people and the enemies of the motherland - those who are behind the scenes - , and I want to say their full name : GlobovisiÃ³n ! ” the ruler added .
Reference was made to April 13 , 2002 - the day when he returned to power following a coup d’etat two days earlier .
ChÃ¡vez also claimed that following his decision on RCTV , “ some destabilizing players joined the game . ”
“ Greetings , GlobovisiÃ³n , you will see where you will go , ” ChÃ¡vez said during an event where he granted social security pensions to 50,000 housewives .
“ You may move forward , and you may continue to call people to disobedience and encouraging my assassination , like you did openly late Sunday ( May 27 ) , if you want to .
But I am warning you in front of the country , take my advice , take a sedative and cool down .
Otherwise , I will take care of GlobovisiÃ³n myself . ”
If you are really lucky , then you may have a great new idea about particle physics .
It may be a way to address the hierarchy problem ( why is gravity so much weaker then the known particle physics forces ) , or to generate mass for fermions ( after all , we have n't found the Higgs yet ) , or to understand the flavor hierarchy ( how come there are three repeated families of particles in the standard model with increasing masses ) , or perhaps to unify all the forces into one ( Grand Unification ) .
Obviously , your obligation is to begin systematically computing the consequences of this idea for existing and future particle physics experiments .
Thirty years or so ago , with a few notable exceptions this would have been the end of the story .
But it has become increasingly clear to most physicists that there exists a complementary list of consequences that should be figured out ; those for cosmology .
These days , this approach is basically second nature to any of us who might have new ideas about how the micro- world works , and reflects the modern thinking that particle physics and cosmology are not distinct disciplines , but are two sides of the same set of questions .
So , parallel to the cross-section and decay rate calculations , what are the most common cosmological areas in which one currently looks for further constraints on one 's new particle physics idea ?
What new questions do you need to ask yourself ?
Does your theory contain any new long - lived elementary particles ?
If it does then you better watch out and you better beware .
You see , such particles may quit interacting with other species in the relatively early universe ( if they are weakly - coupled ) and so maintain a rather high abundance as the universe cools .
Because of this , a relatively straightforward calculation shows that they can rather quickly become the dominant contributor to the matter content of the universe .
This can be a real disaster , given how much we know about the cosmic expansion history , and is to be avoided .
The couplings , masses and lifetimes of such particles therefore need to be such that they either never dominate the energy budget of the universe , or make just the right contribution to be interesting ( see my second list below ) .
A related problem can arise if your theory contains long - lived particles that are too light , because if there are too many of them around when structure is trying to form , then because they are light they typically move at relativistic speeds and stream through overdense regions smoothing them out and ruining structure formation .
Does your theory contain any new topological defects , such as monopoles , domain walls or cosmic strings ?.
If the vacuum structure of your particle physics theory is sufficiently topologically complex , then any symmetry breakings that occur may lead to trapped regions of false vacuum that cannot decay .
If so , then many of the constraints mentioned for long - lived elementary particles may apply to these objects .
In addition , some topological defects can form networks that redshift more slowly then matter , coming to dominate at a later time in the universe , or can generate a spectrum of gravitational radiation that is in conflict with our detailed measurements of the timing of the millisecond pulsar .
If this last constraint is a problem , then it is also possible that the defects unacceptably distort the spectrum of the Cosmic Microwave Background radiation ( CMB ) .
In the early universe , does your theory significantly alter either the matter content or the expansion rate of the universe during the formation of the light elements - Big Bang Nucleosynthesis ( BBN ) ?
This can be an immediate death blow , since the remarkable agreement between measurements of the abundances of the light elements and those predicted within the standard cosmology is one of our triumphs and our earliest direct test of the Big Bang model .
Going further back in time , does any of the new physics in your model lead to new sources for density ( or metric ) perturbations ?
If so , when you process these through cosmic history , what does the resulting spectrum of the CMB look like , and how does it correlate with the related prediction for the spectrum of large scale structure ?
What about the expected results of weak lensing studies ?
How do all of these compare with the wonderful data that has poured in over recent years ?
...
If your big new idea passes all these tests ( and others I have n't mentioned ) then you may really have something .
If this is all there is to it , then you can be happy that your new construction gives rise to novel particle physics phenomena , while remaining safe from cosmological constraints .
However , one might be able to do better .
While our underlying model of cosmology is in remarkable agreement with our ever - increasing stream of data , there are a number of critical areas where we are , no pun intended , in the dark .
It may be that your new idea can help with some of these genuine cosmological conundrums .
What should you look for ?
While the list is increasingly long these days , here are some common ideas .
Got WIMPS ?
There are lots of connections between new particle physics ( particularly beyond the standard model physics addressing the hierarchy problem ) and dark matter .
Perhaps you have a dark matter candidate in the theory .
You 'll need to check to see if there is a long - lived ( stable for all intents and purposes ) particle with couplings of the appropriate strength ( weak , or below ) and mass in the right range .
And it need n't be a WIMP ( Weakly Interacting Massive Particle ) .
Maybe there 's an axion , or even a WIMPZilla .
There are a number of hints that the highest energy cosmic rays may require exotic new physics for a complete understanding .
Above a certain energy ( the Greisen - Zatsepin - Kuzmin ( GZK ) cutoff ) , particles from cosmological distances should n't reach us at all , because they would scatter off the CMB .
This has led people to speculate that any ultra high - energy cosmic rays ( UHECRs ) may be a signature of new particle physics .
Does your theory contain any particles or phenomena that could allow this to happen , and what spectrum of UHECRs should we expect ?
Some of those topological defects I mentioned above may be an example .
You do n't , by any chance , have any unnaturally weakly coupled heavy scalars out there do you ?
Because we 're looking for an inflaton to do all the early universe 's heavy lifting .
Your candidate should be able to quasi- exponentially expand the universe , flatten out its spatial hypersurfaces , causally connect seemingly unconnected regions of the microwave sky , generate all the matter content of later epochs ( reheating ) and imprint upon it the density perturbations necessary to seed our observed large scale structure .
Come to think of it , there is n't an alternative mechanism to inflation in your theory is there ?
It is fair to say that inflation is our best current idea about what happened in the early universe , but is not without its problems , and an attractive competitor would be very welcome .
Good luck though - that list of requirements is pretty hard to satisfy .
Now , generating the matter is one thing , but you 'll typically create an equal amount of antimatter , which will annihilate with matter , and leave very little left over to form all that lovely structure , never mind us .
What you really need is a way to create an asymmetry between matter and antimatter ( in fact baryons and antibaryons are what we care about ) - a baryogenesis mechanism .
Perhaps your inflaton candidate is exotic enough to generate this as part of reheating .
Perhaps there are asymmetric decays of heavy particles in your theory , or maybe a way to make nonperturbative baryon number violating transitions work .
You should get on that right away !
The 800 pound gorilla in the room these days is , of course , cosmic acceleration .
Do you address the cosmological constant problem ?
If not , is there a dark energy candidate in your model ?
This one would be wonderful , but do n't stress if you do n't have anything to add here - you 're in good company .
Actually , since we 're now on to things that seem incredibly difficult to explain , your theory is n't able to tell us why there are 3+1 ( space + time ) dimensions is it ?
That would be just great .
...
As you can see , modern cosmology has yielded a lot of hurdles for any up and coming particle theory to cross .
It 's a tough new world out there .
On the other hand , look at all the macroscopic problems your new microscopic theory may be able to address .
The above lists certainly are n't exhaustive - I have definitely missed out important constraints - but , more importantly , there are probably other crucial particle - physics connections out there with which to constrain theoretical ideas , just waiting to be discovered , perhaps by you !
Mark Ellingham has made a sizeable fortune from the creation of the Rough Guides to almost everywhere .
He is shortlisted for the Royal Society 's prize for science writing , for his book The Rough Guide to Climate Change .
Now , in a conversion that would command the admiration of St Paul , he declares that " binge flying " constitutes a huge threat to the global environment .
" If the travel industry rosily goes ahead as it is doing , ignoring the effect that carbon emissions from flying are having on climate change , we are putting ourselves in a very similar position to the tobacco industry . "
He readily admits the irony that he , of all people , should articulate such a warning .
He appeals for moderation , for setting some limits on our insatiable appetite for travel : " We now live in a society where , if people have nothing to do on a Saturday night , they go to Budapest for 48 hours .
We fly anywhere at the slightest opportunity , 10 times and upwards a year .
This needs to be addressed with the greatest urgency . "
Environmentalists would say that Ellingham is stating the obvious , adding of course that it is pretty rich coming from him .
I am full of admiration for his frankness , however .
Almost all of us are hypocrites about climate change .
We know that it is real , and desperately serious .
Yet we are in a shocking muddle about how to relate our personal behaviour to the phenomenon .
For those who inhabit the developed world , opportunities for travel represent the most significant new personal freedom of the past half - century .
Even as recently as the 1960s , hitch - hiking to Greece and Turkey was a big deal for the adventurous young middle class .
Africa and Asia were high - ticket destinations , South America and Australia almost off the map .
Today , it is possible to fly almost anywhere for a few hundred pounds , and we all do .
Every arriving jet at Nairobi or Ho Chi Minh City or Buenos Aires disgorges its crowds of package tourists and backpackers .
Short breaks , which mean intensive plane use , are booming .
Short - break destinations include Capetown and Dubai .
Common sense tells us that all this is environmentally disastrous .
Yet common sense also tells us that tourism is doing great things for the economies of poor societies all over the world .
Carbon emissions soar as a result of flying flowers and vegetables to Europe and America from Africa and Mexico .
Yet if that traffic stopped , millions of needy people in the growers ' trade would suffer .
All this leaves many of us as confused as Ellingham .
Relatively speaking , the travel boom has hardly started .
In the decades ahead , many more millions will possess the means and the desire to fly further and more often .
The Chinese , for instance , have only just begun to discover the joys of holidaying abroad .
Suggesting to people who live in newly emergent economies that they should forgo travel is comparable with the modern western enthusiasm for saving Africa 's great animals , after slaughtering them wholesale for a century or two .
Even in the west , it is dangerous politics for a government to seek to check the electorate 's passion to fly , just as few democratic nations dare meddle with the freedom to drive .
All credible curbs must be based on pricing .
Yet if it becomes harder for the poor to travel while the rich stay airborne , this does not sound good on the hustings .
The best and simplest way forward would be to tax aviation fuel , to end the crazy anomaly whereby moving a plane is cheap , while driving a car is expensive almost everywhere in the world save Iran and the US .
But it is almost impossible to reach an international agreement on taxing aviation fuel that would stick .
No government will act unilaterally , with the prospect of watching its aviation industry migrate elsewhere .
Ellingham suggests a £ 100 " green tax " on tickets for all flights to Europe and Africa , £ 250 to more remote destinations .
The first benefit of this would be to deter short - haul flying within the UK .
It is absurd that it costs far more to take a train to Newcastle or Edinburgh than to catch a plane there .
Lots of us , including me , love trains and are only deterred from using them by the cost .
Some destination countries would benefit from discouraging low - budget travellers , because the environmental costs which their visits impose outweigh the cash that they spend .
The Samburu National Park in Kenya is currently threatened by the building of two 500 - bed hotels .
Samburu is a small area , famous for its elephants .
Tourists in such numbers will overwhelm its fragile ecosystem .
Any rational long - term view of Samburu 's interests would come down against the new hotels , and in favour of extracting more money from fewer tourists .
The projects will go ahead only because a handful of people will profit handsomely from their construction .
The low - budget traveller creates dilemmas for destinations all over the world .
The mayor of Venice , Massimo Cacciari , wants a levy of € 1 a head imposed on the 20 million tourists who come to the city each year , to help with the huge municipal costs they impose .
Venice is currently struggling to enforce the ban on picnicking in St Mark 's Square , and on walking the streets bare - chested or in bikini tops .
If this sounds pompous , the citizens of Venice reply that , at present , a great host of visitors spend next to nothing and conduct themselves in a manner that diminishes the grace and beauty they come to see .
Other Italian cities , including Rome and Florence , are drawing up codes of conduct to restrain boorish behaviour by tourists .
Here , it is easy for a good democrat to explode : " Do you want to restrict the wonders of the world to rich bastards ? "
But it is an obvious truth that the more people who visit a given place , the greater damage they inflict upon it .
Ellingham again : " Balancing all the positives and negatives , I 'm not convinced there is such a thing as a ' responsible ' or ' ethical ' holiday . "
The bad news for the environment is that it is impossible to believe that the global travel boom will stop .
Whatever is done in Britain , or in the western world at large , amid our consciousness of climate change , many other nations which have only just begun to experience prosperity have no intention of depriving their citizens of its privileges .
As with other responses to climate change , however , this is no reason for us to do nothing .
Even if the British government is obliged to act unilaterally , it must be right to impose higher costs on air travel through taxation .
Indeed , it would be irresponsible not to do so .
Ellingham urges us all to impose some discipline on our own travel , refusing to succumb to " binge flying " .
Only a minority of thoughtful people , the same kind who buy organic products , are likely to heed him .
Most of us change our bad habits only when we are made to do so .
We will fly less only when it hurts our pockets too much to fly more .
Ellingham is surely right that this must be made to happen , and all credit to him for saying so .

TAXONOMIC history has been made this week , at least according to the World Wildlife Fund ( WWF ) , a conservation group .
Scientists have described a new species of clouded leopard from the tropical forests of Indonesia with spots ( or “ clouds ” , as they are poetically known ) smaller than those of other clouded leopards , with fur a little darker and with a double — as opposed to a “ partial double ” — stripe down its back .
But no previously unknown beast has suddenly leapt out from the forest .
Instead , some scientists have proposed a change in the official taxonomic accounting system of clouded leopards .
Where there were four subspecies there will likely now be two species .
A genetic analysis and a closer inspection of museum specimens ' coats published in Current Biology has found no relevant difference between three subspecies described 50 years ago from continental Asia and from the Hainan and Taiwan islands .
The 5,000 - 11,000 clouded leopards on Borneo , the 3,000 - 7,000 on Sumatra , and the remaining few on the nearby Batu islands can now , the authors say , claim a more elevated distinction as a species .
What this actually means is fuzzy and whether it is scientifically important is questionable .
In any case , biologists do not agree what species and subspecies are .
Creatures are given Latin first and second names ( corresponding to a genus and species ) according to the convention of Carl von Linné , who was born 300 years ago this May .
But Linneaus , as he is more commonly known , thought of species as perfectly discrete units created by God .
Darwinism has them as mutable things , generated gradually over time by natural selection .
So delineating when enough variation has evolved to justify a new category is largely a matter of taste .
Take ants and butterflies .
Ant experts have recently been waging a war against all types of species subdivision .
Lepidopterists , on the other hand , cling to the double barrel second names from their discipline 's 19th - century tradition , and categorise many local subclasses within species found over wide areas .
Thus it would be futile — if one were so inclined — to attempt to compare the diversity of ant and butterfly populations .
The traditional way around the problem is to call a species all members of a group that share the same gene pool .
They can mate together and produce fertile offspring .
Whether Indonesian clouded leopards can make cubs with continental ones remains unknown but seems probable .
Instead , the claim this week is that genetics and slight differences in fur patterning are enough to justify rebranding the clouded leopard as two significant types .
Genetically , that makes sense if many DNA variations correlate perfectly between members of the two groups .
The authors did find some correlation , but they looked for it in only three Indonesian animals .
A larger sample would have made the task more difficult .
One thing is abundantly clear : conservationists who are trying to stop the destruction of the leopards ' habitat in Borneo and Sumatra see the announcement of a new species of big cat as a means to gain publicity and political capital .
Upgrading subspecies to species is a strategy which James Mallet , of University College London , likes to call species inflation .
It is a common by - product of genetic analysis , which can reveal differences between populations that the eye cannot .
Creating ever more detailed genetic categories means creating smaller and increasingly restricted populations of more species .
The trouble is that risks devaluing the importance of the term species .
The problem of redefining species by genetics is the creation of taxonomic confusion , a potentially serious difficulty for conservationists and others .
Take for example the recent proposal to add the polar bear to the list of animals protected under America 's Endangered Species Act .
That seems all well and good .
But study the genetics and it transpires that polar bears are closer to some brown bears , than some brown bears are to each other .
Go by the genes and it seems that the polar bear would not count as a species in its own right ( and thus might not enjoy the protection afforded to species ) but should be labelled a sub -species of the brown bear .
This post is the third part in a three piece series about the phenomenon of reserve growth in found oil fields .
Insight in future reserve growth , often attributed to technological advancement , is crucial in determining the peak of conventional oil production .
For those not familiar with reserve growth , it would be best to read part 1 first :
Will 730 billion barrels be added to the reserve pool from reserve growth between 1996 and 2025 as estimated by the United States Geological Survey ?
What we learned in part 2 of this series is that the data with respect to reserve growth is utterly confusing .
Nonetheless , we need an answer to the question what the future perspectives are for reserve growth in order to ; 1 ) improve forecasting the peak in conventional oil production ;
2 ) Increase the understanding of the future role of technology in the oil industry .
The United States Geological Survey has so far been the only institute which has published an estimate for future reserve growth .
In their World Petroleum Assessment from the year 2000 they estimated that reserves would grow with 730 billion barrels between 1996 and 2025 . ( 612 billion barrels for conventional oil , 118 billion barrels for Natural Gas Liquids ) .
By estimating past reserve growth in the US lower 48 a reserve growth algorithm was established .
This algorithm of which the curve is shown below was then applied to the entire world .
Delivering an estimate of 730 billion barrels .
Chart 1 - Source : USGS , Verma
The problem with this method is the way how crude oil reserves are reported in the US which has been described in detail in part 2 .
Because of the practice of reporting only proven reserves , the amount of reserve growth is very high in the US when compared to other regions .
In addition several heavy / extra heavy oil fields such as the kern river oil field are included in the assessment , which showed huge reserve growth due to the advancement in steam technology necessary to dilute the oil to produce it in the middle of the 20th century .
It is erroneous to apply reserve growth in such heavy / extra heavy oil fields with medium and light crude oil fields .
Thirdly applying onshore reserve growth to offshore and deepsea fields is certainly not an approach that gives a correct estimate .
Based on these three issues , the figures presented by the USGS do not seem to have much value .
The method used likely provides figures too inacurrate to be relied upon .
However , the USGS authors ( Albrandt et al ) have acknowledge a part of the problems outlined :
" There are several reasons why a reserve - growth function that is based on historical trends for oil and gas fields in the Lower 48 states could Overestimate world potential reserve growth : Engineering criteria for reporting reserves of world oil and gas fields might , in general , be less restrictive than those for the United States , tending to increase known reserves and decrease the potential for reserve growth .
Reported reserves might be deliberatly overstated in some countries , reducing the potential for future reserve growth .
Large world oil and gas fields might tend to have more substantial development than U.S. fields prior to release of initial field - size estimates , leading to more accurate initial reserves estimates and reducing the potential for future reserve growth .
( USGS WPA 2000 , chapter AR ) "
To see if these critical remarks on their study held any value the authors of the USGS study attempted to apply their function for reserve growth , as shown in graph 1 , to other oil producing regions in the world .
Several latter publications were published with respect to reserve growth in Volga - Ural ( Verma et al. , 2000 ) , West Siberian Basin ( Verma and Ulmishek 2003 ) , the North Sea ( Klett and Guatier 2003 , 2005 ) , the Middle East ( Verma et al. , 2004 ) and Canada ( Beliveau , 2003 ; Verma and Henry , 2004 ) .
Their conclusion was that the reserve growth curve is indeed applicable to the entire world , given reserve growth patterns observed in these other regions .
The one about Russia has been described in detail in part 2 .
These publications do not shed much light on the issue however as shown in part 2 .
Reserve growth varies in every region in the world .
Applying a strict curve from one region towards others does not make much sense to me in the light of the highly chaotic variance in data .
I therefore disagree that such a conclusion can be made , the USGS authors could be right , but they could also very well be wrong .
The International Energy Agency seems to disagree with this cautious vision on estimating reserve growth .
In their recent resources to reserves report they noted the following about the USGS method and the criticism it received from ASPO :
" It should be noted that some authors ( ASPO ) argue that the " reserve growth " phenomenon is an artefact of very conservative United States reporting on proven reserves , which should not be applied worldwide , particularly in OPEC countries where some observers claim that published proven reserves numbers are suspicious ( Simmons 2005 ) .
However , further studies by USGS geologists have pointed to reserve growth observed also in large fields outside the United States , at a rate consistent with the assumption of the 2000 Assessment ( Klett 2003 ) . "
( IEA Resources to Reserves , 2006 )
There is only one way to give a reasonable answer to what future path there is for reserve growth .
The USGS takes the estimates from the IHS energy database ( formerly petroconsultants ) as a starting point .
The updates in the IHS energy database therefore give excellent means for reviewing the forecast from the USGS .
By looking at every change in the past decades in the IHS Energy database ( formerly Petroconsultants ) in meticulous detail an accurate answer can be found .
Only then we will know what exactly bas happened in the past decades with oil reserves ( proven and probable ) .
There is only one problem , access to the database costs approximately 1 million dollars a year , a bit too expensive for a voluntary weblog .
So the best we can do at the moment is by looking at the bigger trends that are available in public domain data .
In a publication from August 2005 in AAPG Bulletin ( An evaluation of the USGS WPA 2000 ) the authors ( Albrandt et al ) conclude that approximately 28 % percent or 171 billion barrels of the forecasted 612 billion barrels for conventional oil had been added to the reserve pool between 1996 and 2003 .
In a presentation from 2004 one of the UGSS study authors ( Klett ) showed a graph depicting reserve growth in giant oil fields between 1981 and 1996 and 1996 and 2003 :
Chart 2 - Source : USGS , Klett
It is important to note that the largest part of the change occured in giant oil fields operated by the OPEC cartel .
The USGS notes that 73 of the 171 billion barrels of reserve growth came from giant fields in OPEC countries .
From a chart in a paper by Ahlbrandt ( USGS WPA 2000 main author ) in the " book Oil in the 21st century " the division between the 171 billion barrels figure for reserve growth between 1996 and 2003 can be estimated ( approximates ) :
83 billion barrels ( Middle East and North Africa )
36 billion barrels ( Central and South America )
18 billion barrels ( Former Soviet Union )
13 billion barrels ( Sub Saharan Africa )
12 billion barrels ( North America )
5 billion barrels ( Europe )
3 billion barrels ( Asia Pacific )
1 billion barrels ( South Asia )
The reserve growth phenomenon is also tracked by IHS Energy , whom present a much larger number than the USGS with respect to reserve growth in the period between 1995 and 2003 ( 457 billion barrels ) .
The large variance in figures presented is to say the least , puzzling .
The most likely explanation is a difference in definitions .
The USGS could for instance only have include additional proven reserves while IHS Energy included proven + probable reserves .
Nonetheless they both agree that the largest part of reserve growth between 1995 and 2003 was observed in the Middle East :
Chart 3 - Source : IHS Energy
In the period between 1995 and 2003 nearly 250 billion barrels were added to fields in the Middle East in the IHS Energy database .
In this period almost no conventional oil was discovered in the same region .
Given the secrecy of Middle East reserve forecasts , it is questionable that these reserve additions are real .
In addition Jean Laherrère notes that in 2004 another large reserve increase occured in the Middle East in the IHS Energy database .
( Laherrère , 2006 , pag. 19 ) .
The effect of reserve growth on reserve estimates over time is shown very clearly in a graph from Francis Harper from BP :
Chart 4 - Source : Francis Harper , BP , reserve growth in this chart is not backdated to original discovery as is common practice in reserve estimates made by ASPO .
Since I have no additional information with respect to the value noted by the USGS on reserve growth ( 171 billion barrels ) , we take a further look at the changes stated by IHS Energy ( 457 billion barrels )
The difference between the USGS figure from the IHS database and the figure from IHS Energy is explained in a presentation by Peter Stark ( Vice President IHS Energy ) :
Chart 5 - Source : IHS Energy
The revisions that IHS made shown in the chart above explain the largest part of the reserve growth phenomenon .
96 billion barrels can be discounted because of missing data .
An additional 52 billion barrels can be discounted because of changes in the rules .
That leaves 309 billion barrels of reserve growth in the period between 1995 and 2003 .
Of these possibly 120 billion barrels according to IHS are due to underestimates in the Middle East .
The question that remains is where the remaining 190 billion barrels of reserve growth as noted by IHS energy comes from .
The largest part of this increase comes from the Middle East , given the increase in reserves from pre-1995 discoveries of approximately 250 billion barrels between 1995 and 2030 .
So basically we are left with two choices :
1 ) If we think that the 190 billion barrels can be attributed to genuine reserve growth , the USGS estimate of an addition of 730 billion barrels from reserve growth between 1995 and 2025 is on track so far .
This does not necessarily mean that reserve growth will continue or discontinue to happen in the future as it did in the past .
2 ) If we think that the 190 billion barrels are not caused by reserve growth but mainly by political overstated reserves in the Middle East , then we can throw the USGS estimate in the garbage can .
Reserve growth will be far lower then now accounted for and forecasting publications that rely on the USGS estimate are too optimistic ( IEA and EIA forecasts ) .
As to the lastest figures from IHS , 2005 was a very bad year for reserve growth .
Only 8 billion barrels were added from pre-2005 discoveries in the IHS Energy database in 2005 .
Production in 2005 was larger then reserve growth and discoveries combined in the IHS Energy database , leading to a net decline in reserves :

I was having an argument with someone on the Internet , and they asked me , as an atheist , what exactly do I believe in ?
( It is a common misconception that atheists have no beliefs , or no moral beliefs , at all . )
So I made this video .
[ youtube ss3ZUKo28lo ]
Transcript is below :
Hello , my name is Al .
I actively believe that supernatural gods do n’t exist .
But there are a lot of other things that I also believe .
I believe a lot of people have misconceptions of atheists .
And I believe that atheism is n’t going to become more accepted if atheists stay quiet about their beliefs .
I believe a lot more people than we think are atheists , but they just quietly describe themselves as “ not very religious ” .
I believe a lot of people are afraid to say they ’re atheists .
I believe I do n’t spend enough time reading books like I used to .
I believe mopeds are n’t as cool as motorcycles and they ’re barely faster than bicycles .
I believe pancakes are most overpriced thing you can order at a diner , but still the most economical .
I believe that finding out that Santa Claus was n’t real was n’t that big of a deal for me and my friends growing up .
I believe it ’s weird that even though I ’m half asian and half white , a lot people just think of me as asian .
I believe in the scientific method .
I believe we can tell when we ’re just kidding ourselves by checking how convenient our beliefs are .
I believe in love .
I believe it ’s really silly to believe in love .
I believe in love .
I believe our methods of courtship were at their peak when we were in the third grade , those notes that said “ I like you , do you like me ? ” with Yes and No checkboxes were perfect .
I believe that people do n’t differentiate enough between microevolution , macroevolution and abiogensis .
I believe the Internet has failed to bring us together , since we mostly read blogs and watch videos that reinforce our preconceived ideas .
I believe that surfing the web is better than watching TV because it forces you to read and interact instead of passively watch .
I believe it ’s weird that most Christians do n’t think reading the scriptures of Hinduism is a necessary prerequisite to not believe in the tenets of Hinduism .
I believe we spend too much time thinking whether or not we can afford something rather than whether or not we should buy it .
I believe something is seriously wrong with our country when we think that prison rape is funny .
I believe people do n’t realize that videos of someone monolouging are a horrible medium compared to text because they present information in a linear format that ca n’t be skimmed or searched .
It ’s like having a dictionary written out on a scroll .
I believe you can find a transcript of this video on my website at http://coffeeghost.net
I believe no one ever thinks they ’re wrong , they simply justify their behavior by saying the other person has a problem .
I believe reality TV is the same thing as day time talk shows : they let us look at weirdos to feel better about ourselves .
I believe it ’s easier to hate people when they happen to eat different food then we do , or speak a different language .
I believe it ’s important to be able to locate any country in the world on a map .
I believe a lot kids grow up thinking they ’re stupid because their teachers and parents never expected much from them .
I believe we are n’t challenged to explicitly back up our beliefs with evidence enough .
I believe that anger , distrust , and a sense of entitlement clouds our judgment and consideration for others .
I believe that bias in American media is n’t in what the report on , but what they do n’t report on .
I believe that the amount of airtime Britney Spear ’s haircut got is strong evidence for this .
I believe that anyone who justifies their career or trade as “ giving people what they want ” is a jackass .
I believe that the overwhelming majority of software patents are frivolous .
I believe that too many atheists automatically dismiss theists as unintelligent .
I believe that a minority of atheists automatically dismiss theists as unintelligent .
I believe we believe in comforting beliefs , even to the point of kidding ourselves .
I believe that falling into the trap of working a job you hate to buy crap you do n’t need to impress people you do n’t like is a lot easier than we think .
I believe that people who use background music in their videos in order to evoke emotion in their audience are odious .
I believe that we should feel with our hearts and think with our heads , and that a lot of our problems come when we forget that .
I believe that cities with hills are better than cities without them .
I believe that even though we do n’t kill the messenger , we wo n’t invite him to our next birthday party .
I believe that most people do n’t realize that prayer is more about comforting the prayer than it is about petitioning God .
I believe people in industrialized countries eat far too much meat in their diet .
I believe that considering everything else I ’ll say in this video , I ’ll catch a surprising amount of flak for that last one .
I believe it ’s silly to say that my friend Josh is n’t fit to be a parent just because he has sex with other men .
I believe you can tell when two people in a conversation are n’t listening to each other because they ’ll immediately talk about themselves when it ’s their turn to speak .
I believe that stoning someone to death for working on the sabbath is , for lack of a better word , overkill .
I believe that anyone who says that Old Testament laws no longer apply are tacitly saying that there could be a time when they did .
I believe that World War I was the result of overly aggressive leaders who did n’t realize how quickly the violence would escalate .
I believe that World War II was the result of the previous victors failing to hold consideration for the loser ’s welfare , and how that would cause such deep , long - lasting bitterness and anger .
I believe a lot of Americans do n’t think it ’s happening again .
I believe that because religions are so different yet so universal across human cultures , it ’s more likely that they say something about humans more than the universe .
I believe we all want our lives to be like in the movies , without realizing how truly stupid that is .
I believe we should always admit the possibility that we could be wrong , including the possibility that we ’re wrong about being wrong .
I believe we become adults on the day that we ’re able to forgive our parents .
I believe that after about half an hour , you ’ll probably forget most of the things I ’ve said in this video , except for the line I ’m saying right now .
I believe we have a lot more in common than we realize .

In der Stadtverwaltung Treuchtlingen hatte sich eine heterogene Software - und Desktop - Landschaft entwickelt .
Die Antwort darauf war der konsequente Einsatz von Linux - fähigen Thin Clients in Kombination mit Open - Source - Software .
Anwenderbericht , präsentiert auf der Konferenz " Open Source Meets Business " , Nürnberg , 25.-27.1.2006
Die zwischen Nürnberg und Augsburg liegende Stadt Treuchtlingen hat 13.000 Einwohner .
Die Stadtverwaltung verteilt sich auf die Standorte Rathaus , Stadtwerke , Krankenhaus , Bauhof und Thermalbad .
Dort arbeiten etwa 400 Personen .
Die Stadtverwaltung mit typischen Aufgaben in Bereichen wie Einwohnermelde - oder Finanzwesen ist eigenständig .
Die IT - Abteilung mit zwei Mitarbeitern übernimmt alle Aufgaben von der Hardware - und Softwareinstallation bis zur Wartung der Geräte .
Hierzu gehören neben Standarddiensten wie Groupware - , Datei - und Datenbankserver auch die Bereitstellung von Fachanwendungen für das Verwaltungswesen .
Verträge bestehen mit Dienstleistern und Herstellern zur Ausfallsicherung von Hard - und Software mit garantierten Reaktionszeiten im Servicefall ( Reaktionsverträge ) .
Wichtige strategische Ziele sind :
zentrale Verwaltung aller Geräte und Software
wartungslose , bei Bedarf unterschiedliche Thin -Client - Hardware
Erreichbarkeit des eigenen Desktops von jedem Arbeitsplatz
Unabhängigkeit von Lieferanten
Einsatz von Open Source zur Einsparung von Lizenzkosten
Die Open - Source - Lösung
Mit dem Umstieg auf Open - Source - Lösungen wurde 2001 im Rathaus begonnen .
Ausgangsbasis war eine IT - Landschaft mit Windows - NT4 - Desktops .
Alle Anwendungen liefen lokal auf diesen Rechnern .
Zum Dateienaustausch standen Novell - Dateiserver zur Verfügung .
Linux wurde nur auf Servern für Kommunikationsdienste wie E -Mail verwendet .
Zur zentralen Verwaltung der Desktops benutzte Treuchtlingen das Novell - Produkt Zenworks .
Es ermöglicht Softwareinstallation über System - Images .
Von 25 im Jahre 1999 mit identischen System - Images gestarteten NT4 - Desktops waren 2001 nur noch drei zentral wartbar .
Auf den anderen lief inzwischen entweder zu Zenworks inkompatible Software , wie zum Beispiel Office 2000 , oder es war wegen Austausch von defekter Hardware zu Veränderungen gekommen , die zusätzlichen Aufwand bei der Wartung über das Novell - Tool bedeutet hätten .
Hinzu kamen Konflikte durch unterschiedliche DLL - Versionen , die die verwendete Software anforderte .
Oftmals mussten Nutzer für den Wechsel zu einer anderen Anwendung ihren Rechner mit einer anderen Windows - Variante booten .
Zur Beseitigung dieser Probleme beschloss man eine radikale Abkehr vom Client - lastigen Konzept : Nicht nur Datenspeicherung und Kommunikationsdienste , sondern auch Anwendungen sollten serverseitig betrieben und damit die Verfügbarkeit einer Anwendung unabhängiger vom Client werden .
Vier Client - Arten wurden in die nähere Auswahl genommen :
NT4 / Win 3.11
Windows - CE-Clients
alte PCs als X - Terminal unter Linux
Sun Ray Thin Clients
Die ersten beiden genügten den Anforderungen nicht .
Zum einen waren einige Fachanwendungen durch die Beschränkung auf acht Bit Farbtiefe nicht mehr bedienbar , zum anderen wollte man sich in Sachen Multimedia Zukunftsoptionen hinsichtlich der Anforderungen neuer Software an die Hardware offen halten .
Die vorhandenen Desktop - Rechner ( AMD K6 , 128 MByte , ein GByte Festplatte ) hätten als Linux - basierte X - Terminals ihren Zweck erfüllt , wurden aber am Ende wegen ihres technischen Zustands verworfen .
Da somit der Kauf von neuer Hardware feststand , fiel die Entscheidung auf den Einsatz von Sun Ray Thin Clients und Windows - Terminalserver für die Windows - abhängigen Fachanwendungen .
Für die Sun Ray Thin Clients sprach ihre Multimedia - Fähigkeit und die Sicherheit vor Manipulationen .
Zudem erzeugen sie keinen Lärm am Arbeitsplatz und unterstützen Linux .
Grundsätzlich sieht Treuchtlingen aber im Einsatz von Linux - PCs als Clients eine vollwertige Alternative zum Einsatz von Thin Cients .
Der Terminal - Client wurde in den Desktop KDE integriert .
Die neue Benutzerumgebung wurde zunächst in kleinen Gruppen getestet .
Dort diskutierte Probleme oder Neuerungen wie die Verwendung der mittleren Maustaste waren Grundlage für die gleichzeitig entwickelte Nutzer - Dokumentation .
Alte Anwendungen erhielten die gleichen Icons wie früher unter Windows .

Impeachment bid unsuccessful
By Kevin Landrigan
State Rep. Betty Hall ( D - Brookline ) failed on Monday in her bid to get a resolution endorsing the impeachment of President Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney before the New Hampshire Legislature .
Two Democratic colleagues , Newmarket Rep. Marcia Moody and Strafford Rep. Robert Perry were backing
Hall ’s request that all rules be suspended to let this matter come up in the waning weeks of the 2007 legislative session .
But the House Rules Committee voted unanimously to turn down Hall ’s request .
About 10 people led a silent vigil in support of the resolution , wearing pink signs that simply read “ Impeach . ” 

The US Department of Justice is preparing to open a corruption investigation into the arms company BAE , the Guardian has learned .
It would cover the alleged £ 1bn arms deal payments to Prince Bandar of Saudi Arabia .
Washington sources familiar with the thinking of senior officials at the justice department said yesterday it was " 99 % certain " that a criminal inquiry would be opened under the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act ( FCPA ) .
Such an investigation would have potentially seismic consequences for BAE , which is trying to take over US arms companies and make the Pentagon its biggest customer .
Times suggests
Fox News owner Rupert Murdoch bought off top US senator John Byrne
Published : Sunday June 24 , 2007 Print This Email This The New York Times plans " a look at how Rupert Murdoch has used his media empire to advance his personal and political agendas " in Monday 's editions , a source familiar with the paper 's planning tells RAW STORY .
The piece opens with the suggestion that Murdoch staved off legislation that could strangle his US business interest by buying off a senator .
" Congress was on the verge of limiting any company from owning local television stations that reached more than 35 percent of American homes .
Mr. Murdochs
Fox stations reached nearly 39 percent , meaning he would have to sell some , " the Times reporters write .
" In a late - night meeting just before Thanksgiving of 2003 , Congressional leaders agreed to raise the limit  to 39 percent . "
Sen . Trent Lott had opposed raising the limit .
" But in the end , he , too , agreed to the compromise , " reports the Times .
" It turns out he had a business connection to Mr. Murdoch .
Months before , HarperCollins , Mr. Murdochs publishing house , had signed a $ 250,000 book deal to publish Mr. Lotts memoir , ' Herding Cats , ' records and interviews show . "
The story is a fascinating one for New York 's newspaper of record .
As a massive investigative piece written by some of the Times ' finest reporters and organized by the Times Managing Editor herself -- Jill Abramson -- it stands to have a major impact on a pending deal between Murdoch and the Times ' New York competitor he is seeking to buy , The Wall Street Journal .
Also Monday , the Times reported that the family that controls the Wall Street Journal is close to agreeing on terms " designed to protect The Wall Street Journals newsroom independence if the company accepts a takeover bid from Mr. Murdoch . "
The reporters note -- as if in warning -- " The sale would give Mr. Murdoch control of the pre-eminent journalistic authority on the world in which he is an active , aggressive participant .
What worries his critics is that Mr. Murdoch will use The Journal , which has won many Pulitzer Prizes and has a sterling reputation for accuracy and fairness , as yet another tool to further his myriad financial and political agendas . "
 It is hard to imagine Rupert Murdoch publishing The New York Post in Midtown Manhattan , with all of his personal and political biases and business interests reflected every day , while publishing The Wall Street Journal in Downtown Manhattan with no interference whatsoever ,  former director of Dow Jones James Ottaway Jr. is quoted as saying .
While he is a scratching post of the left for his ownership of Fox News Channel and the conservative New York Post , the Times notes that Murdoch often bends to the political winds to suit his business interests .
He held two fundraisers this month for Sen. Hillary Clinton ( D - NY ) , a leading Democratic candidate for president .
The paper traces Murdoch 's rise alongside other more liberal politicians , including liberal lion Sen. Edward Kennedy ( D - MA ) and British Labour Prime Minister Tony Blair .
" An analysis of campaign finance records shows that since 1997 , Republicans have received only a slight majority  56 percent  of the $ 4.76 million in campaign donations from the Murdoch family and the News Corporations political action committees and employees , " the article says .
" Since Democrats won control of Congress in the 2006 elections , the company and its employees have given more than twice as much to Democrats . "
The Times ' article also captures Murdoch 's apparent assault on the Nielsen rating system , which in 2004 considering changing their methodology .
Early trials showed Murdoch losing a huge ratings share if the new system went through .
Murdoch 's empire went on the assault , the Times says .
News Corporation turned to Republican allies in Congress .
Sen. Conrad Burns ( R - MT ) , who recently lost a reelection campaign over his ties to disgraced lobbyist Jack Abramoff , introduced legislation threatening Nielsen with government oversight .
" Political contributions flowed to nearly all the legislations supporters , " notes the Times .
" In 2005 , the year the legislation was introduced , records show that the bills 29 sponsors and co-sponsors together received at least $ 144,650 in donations from the News Corporations political action committees and lobbyists . "
Ultimately , Murdoch won a mixed victory -- Nielsen held off changing the system for several months in the top three media markets , allowing News Corporation to keep their higher advertising rates in place .
The article also assails a moment during the Clinton Administration when Murdoch allegedly told an FCC commissioner he would not be able to get a job as dog- catcher if the FCC took away a News Corporation license as the result of a dispute .
In the end , the FCC caved .
The Times notes other payouts by Murdoch 's publishing arm to major politicians -- $ 4.5 million to Newt Gingrich , $ 25,000 to Sen. Arlen Specter ( R - PA ) , $ 142,000 to Sen.
Kay Bailey Hutchison ( R - TX ) -- all of whom sit on the Commerce or Judiciary Committees overseeing the media business .
Still , the paper leaves the door open for Murdoch .
A former HarperCollins executive told the Times ,  It s not done in a direct way where he issues instructions .
It s a bunch of people running around trying to please him .

A version of this has been bought by IBM DeveloperWorks .
Furthermore , IBM sponsored another article , the Manager FAQ , a guide to managers for hackers who are frustrated and confused by corporate life .
I 'd like to thank IBM for their kind support of this project .
I 'm pretty happy with the new piece , and I 'm glad to have finally been nudged into posting it .
I 'd like to point out how reasonable and friendly IBM has been about this ; compare with the way that CRC has treated Eric Weisstein .
I have a Powell 's " bookshelf " , which is sort of a list of recommended books ; some are fairly relevant to this page .

Revision 0.05 - Last modified September 28 , 1999
Questions and Answers :
Section 0 : Basic understanding .
0.0 : Wo n't my hacker break into my computer and steal my trade secrets ?
No .
Hackers are n't , contrary to media reporting , the people who break into computers .
Those are crackers .
Hackers are people who enjoy playing with computers .
Your hacker may occasionally circumvent security measures , but this is not malicious ; she just does it when the security is in her way , or because she 's curious .
0.1 : Was it a good idea to hire a hacker ?
It depends on the job .
A hacker can be dramatically more effective than a non-hacker at a job , or dramatically less effective .
Jobs where hackers are particularly good are : Systems administration
Programming
Design Jobs where hackers are particularly bad are : Data entry
More generally , a job that requires fast and unexpected changes , significant skill , and is not very repetitive will be one a hacker will excel at .
Repetitive , simple jobs are a waste of a good hacker , and will make your hacker bored and frustrated .
No one works well bored and frustrated .
The good news is , if you get a hacker on something he particularly likes , you will frequently see performance on the order of five to ten times what a " normal " worker would produce .
This is not consistent , and you should n't expect to see it all the time , but it will happen .
This is most visible on particularly difficult tasks .
0.2 : How should I manage my hacker ?
The same way you herd cats .
It can be a bit confusing ; they 're not like most other workers .
Do n't worry !
Your hacker is likely to be willing to suggest answers to problems , if asked .
Most hackers are nearly self - managing .
0.3 : Wait , you just said " 10 times " , did n't you ?
You 're not serious , right ?
Actually , I said " ten times " .
And yes , I am serious ; a hacker on a roll may be able to produce , in a period of a few months , something that a small development group ( say , 7 - 8 people ) would have a hard time getting together over a year .
He also may not .
Your mileage will vary .
IBM used to report that certain programmers might be as much as 100 times as productive as other workers , or more .
This kind of thing happens .
0.4 : I do n't understand this at all .
This is confusing .
Is there a book on this ?
Not yet .
In the meantime , check out The New Hacker 's Dictionary ( references below ; also known as " the jargon file " ) , in particular some of the appendices .
The entire work is full of clarifications and details of how hackers think .
Section 1 : Social issues
1.0 : My hacker does n't fit in well with our corporate society .
She seems to do her work well , but she 's not really making many friends .
This is common .
Your hacker may not have found any people around who get along with hackers .
You may wish to consider offering her a position telecommuting , or flexible hours ( read : night shift ) , which may actually improve her productivity .
Or hire another one .
1.1 : My hacker seems to dress funny .
Is there any way to impress upon him the importance of corporate appearance ?
Your hacker has a very good understanding of the importance of corporate appearance .
It does n't help you get your job done .
IBM , Ford , and Microsoft have all realized that people work better when they can dress however they want .
Your hacker is dressed comfortably .
A polite request to dress up some for special occasions may well be honored , and most hackers will cheerfully wear clothes without ( unintentional ) holes in them if specifically asked .
1.2 : My hacker wo n't call me by my title , and does n't seem to respect me at all .
Your hacker does n't respect your title .
Hackers do n't believe that management is " above " engineering ; they believe that management is doing one job , and engineering is doing another .
They may well frequently talk as if management is beneath them , but this is really quite fair ; your question implies that you talk as if engineering is beneath you .
Treat your hacker as an equal , and she will probably treat you as an equal -- quite a compliment !
1.3 : My hacker constantly insults the work of my other workers .
Take your hacker aside , and ask for details of what 's wrong with the existing work .
It may be that there 's something wrong with it .
Do n't let the fact that it runs most of the time fool you ; your hacker is probably bothered by the fact that it crashes at all .
He may be able to suggest improvements which could dramatically improve performance , reliability , or other features .
It 's worth looking into .
You may be able to convince your hacker to be more polite , but if there appear to be major differences , it 's quite possible that one or more of your existing staff are incompetent .
Note that hackers , of course , have different standards of competence than many other people .
( Read " different " as " much higher " . )
Section 2 : Productivity .
2.0 : My hacker plays video games on company time .
Hackers , writers , and painters all need some amount of time to spend " percolating " -- doing something else to let their subconscious work on a problem .
Your hacker is probably stuck on something difficult .
Do n't worry about it .
2.1 : But it 's been two weeks since I saw anything !
Your hacker is working , alone probably , on a big project , and just started , right ?
She 's probably trying to figure it all out in advance .
Ask her how it 's going ; if she starts a lot of sentences , but interrupts them all with " no , wait ... " or " drat , that wo n't work " , it 's going well .
2.2 : Is n't this damaging to productivity ?
No .
Your hacker needs to recreate and think about things in many ways .
He will be more productive with this recreation than without it .
Your hacker enjoys working ; do n't worry about things getting done reasonably well and quickly .
2.3 : My hacker is constantly doing things unrelated to her job responsibilities .
Do they need to be done ?
Very few hackers can resist solving a problem when they can solve it , and no one else is solving it .
For that matter , is your hacker getting her job done ?
If so , consider these other things a freebie or perk ( for you ) .
Although it may not be conventional , it 's probably helping out quite a bit .
2.4 : My hacker is writing a book , reading USENET news , playing video games , talking with friends on the phone , and building sculptures out of paper clips .
On company time !
He sounds happy .
The chances are he's in one of three states : Basic job responsibilities are periodic ( phone support , documentation , et al. ) and there 's a lull in incoming work .
Do n't worry about it !
Your hacker is stuck on a difficult problem .
Your hacker is bored silly and is trying to find amusement .
Perhaps you should find him more challenging work ?
Any of these factors may be involved .
All of them may be involved .
In general , if the work is challenging , and is getting done , do n't worry too much about the process .
You might ask for your corporation to be given credit in the book .
2.5 : But my other workers are offended by my hacker 's success , and it hurts their productivity .
Do you really need to have workers around who would rather be the person getting something done , than have it done already ?
Ego has very little place in the workplace .
If they can't do it well , assign them to something they can do .
Section 3 : Stimulus and response
3.0 : My hacker did something good , and I want to reward him .
Good !
Here are some of the things most hackers would like to receive in exchange for their work : Respect .
Admiration .
Compliments .
Understanding .
Discounts on expensive toys .
Money .
These are not necessarily in order .
The 4th item ( understanding ) is the most difficult .
Try to remember this good thing your hacker just did the next time you discover he just spent a day playing x - trek .
Rather than complaining about getting work done , write it off as " a perk " that was granted ( informally ) as a bonus for a job well done .
Do n't worry ; hackers get bored quickly when they are n't doing their work .
3.1 : My hacker did something bad , and I want to punish him .
Don't. 30 years of psychological research has shown that punishment has no desirable long - term effects .
Your hacker is not a lab rat .
( Even if he were a lab rat , punishment would n't work ; at least , not if he were one of the sorts of lab rats the psych research was done on . )
If you do n't like something your hacker is doing , express your concerns .
Explain what it is that bothers you about the behavior .
Be prepared for an argument ; your hacker is a rational entity , and presumably had reasons .
Do n't jump on him too quickly ; they may turn out to be good reasons .
Do n't be afraid to apologize if you 're wrong .
If your hacker admits to having been wrong , do n't demand an apology ; so far as the hacker is concerned , admitting to being wrong is an apology , most likely .
3.2 : I do n't get it .
I offered my hacker a significant promotion , and she turned it down and acted offended .
A promotion frequently involves spending more time listening to people describing what they 're doing , and less time playing with computers .
Your hacker is enjoying her work ; if you want to offer a reward , consider an improvement in title , a possible raise , and some compliments .
Make sure your hacker knows you are pleased with her accomplishments -- that 's what she 's there for .
3.3 : My company policy wo n't let me give my hacker any more raises until he 's in management .
Your company policy is broken .
A hacker can earn as much as $ 200 an hour ( sometimes more ) doing freelance consulting .
You may wish to offer your hacker a contracted permanent consulting position with benefits , or otherwise find loopholes .
Or , find perks to offer - many hackers will cheerfully accept a discount on hardware from their favorite manufacturer as an effective raise .
3.4 : I can't believe the hacker on my staff is worth as much as we 're paying .
Ask the other staff in the department what the hacker does , and what they think of it .
The chances are that your hacker is spending a few hours a week answering arcane questions that would otherwise require an expensive external consultant .
Your hacker may be fulfilling another job 's worth of responsibilities in his spare time around the office .
Very few hackers are n't worth what they 're getting paid ; they enjoy accomplishing difficult tasks , and improving worker efficiency .
Section 4 : What does that mean ?
4.0 : My hacker does n't speak English .
At least , I do n't think so .
Your hacker is a techie .
Your best bet is to pick up a copy of TNHD ( The New Hacker 's Dictionary ) .
It can be found as http://catb.org/esr/jargon ( last I checked ) or from a good bookstore .
If you have trouble understanding that reference , ask your hacker if she has a copy , or would be willing to explain her terms .
Most hackers are willing to explain terms .
Be ready for condescension ; it 's not intended as an insult , but if you do n't know the words , she probably has to talk down to you at first to explain them .
It 's a reasonably difficult set of words ; there are a lot of them , and their usage is much more precise than it sounds .
Hackers love word games .
[ It is also possible that English is not your hacker 's native language , and that it 's not yours either .
Feel free to substitute a more appropriate language . ]
4.1 : I ca n't get an estimate out of my hacker .
Your hacker has n't figured out how hard the problem is yet .
Unlike most workers , hackers will try very hard to refuse to give an estimate until they know for sure that they understand the problem .
This may include solving it .
No good engineer goes beyond 95 % certainty .
Most hackers are good engineers .
If you say you will not try to hold him to the estimate ( and mean it ! ) you are much more likely to get an approximate estimate .
The estimate may sound very high or very low ; it may be very high or very low .
Still , it 's an estimate , and you get what you ask for .
4.2 : My hacker makes obscure , meaningless jokes .
If you feel brave , ask for an explanation .
Most of them can be explained .
It may take a while , but it may prove interesting .
4.3 : My hacker counts from zero .
So does the computer .
You can hide it , but computers count from zero .
Most hackers do by habit , also .

An Open Letter to Scott Guthrie
Mr. Guthrie and Whom It May Concern ,
Thank you for your team ’s contributions to the software development industry .
ASP .
Net , the CLR , and your other significant additions to the .
Net platform have genuinely advanced the state of software development .
Although it may seem that you are damned if you do and damned if you do n’t , most of us developers out here do appreciate your work .
Speaking and working with developers who live daily with your tools , I find confusion and concern over your relationship to the open source community that has grown up around the .
Net platform .
While Sun , IBM , other platform providers , and ISVs clearly see the open source community as a complimentary codebase to their products , Microsoft tends to use the best and brightest work from the community space as a feature map for .
Net .
This is perfectly reasonable considering the your challenge to create the ubiquitous development platform for Windows based application development .
It seems that the .
Net open source community is a metering rod of what we ( in the trenches developers ) care about and also serves as a free R&D lab for Microsoft .
This is a nice , symbiotic relationship resulting in fewer necessary acquisitions for Microsoft and more heterogeneous tools baked in to .
Net .
We can all live happily with that .
On one condition .
When rolling something from the community into the .
Net platform or tools , please add value above that of the original community solution .
It is not enough to simply bake it in and consider that the value proposition .
We all know how to include assemblies in our projects , thank you very much .
Merely including something in the CLR so that we do n’t have to link in an outside assembly is a poor excuse for success .
You owe something more to the people who built the original solution .
Make it better .
Make it rock .
Take , for example , MSUnit.
Boo .
Hiss .
That was a big miss .
Ca n’t they be easier to run in the UI ?
Where are all of the baked in Asserts from NUnit ?
Or take MSBuild .
No please , take it .
No out of the box task to Zip files ?
C’mon .
And SandCastle ?
We ’ll just leave that alone for now .
So you can understand our concern when we hear rumor of your new toy , a MVC model for ASP .
Net that uses an HttpHandler to invoke controllers .
Awesome .
Perfect !
Yes !
About time !
Bring it !
AND … Please do Monorail justice and do n’t kill it without doing something as good or better .
If you cant improve upon the functionality of MonoRail , just point to it as a good practice until you can .
This one is far too important for anything less than a home run .
Waiting with trepidation and wide - eyed optimism ,
