On February 7 an English court granted an injunction to US multinational oil company ExxonMobil freezing the assets of the Venezuelan oil firm PDVSA in England and Wales .
The order covered assets to the value of $ 12bn .
The Venezuelan government was given no notice of the case nor any opportunity to be represented at the hearing .
This week PDVSA will appeal against the decision in the high court .
ExxonMobil 's action was in response to the policy of the Venezuelan government to take back majority control of its own oil resources .
Unlike other international oil companies - 30 out of 32 contracts have been renegotiated , with amicable agreements and compensation terms reached with the Venezuelan government - ExxonMobil refused the terms offered .
We believe the court ruling contravenes the right of Venezuela 's democratically elected government to exercise sovereignty over its natural resources .
The nationalisation of the state oil company has allowed Venezuela to tackle a range of social inequalities , by taking back the oil wealth and redistributing it to benefit the Venezuelan people .
We urge the amicable settlement of this dispute through arbitration under the auspices of the International Centre for the Settlement of Investment Disputes , a body of the World Bank , as sought by the Venezuelan government .

NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - Oil prices vaulted to a record $ 100 a barrel on Wednesday as violence in Nigeria , tight energy stockpiles and a weaker dollar triggered a surge of speculative buying , dealers said .
Oil ’s climb to the psychologically key triple - digit price helped send stocks tumbling on Wall Street and further darkened an already gloomy economic outlook in the United States , which has been battered by a housing crisis and credit crunch .
“ Oil hitting $ 100 a barrel has sparked some concerns about the consumer and inflation , ” said Todd Salamone , vice president of research at Schaeffer ’s Investment Research .
U.S. crude traded once at $ 100 a barrel , up $ 4.02 , before easing back to settle $ 3.64 higher at $ 99.62 .
It remains below the inflation - adjusted high of $ 101.70 hit in April 1980 , a year after the Iranian revolution .
London Brent crude rose $ 3.99 to $ 97.84 .
“ Oil could rise further from here .
It ’s simple supply - and - demand fundamentals , ” said Kris Voorspools , energy analyst at Fortis in Brussels .
The White House said it would not open up the nation ’s emergency crude oil reserve to lower prices .
Two members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries said the cartel was powerless to bring the market down from its lofty height .
Crude prices jumped 58 percent in 2007 , the biggest annual gain this decade .
Oil prices have nearly tripled since 2000 -- driven by rising demand in China and other developing countries , tight stockpiles and geopolitical turmoil .
Weakness in the dollar has added to gains across the commodity sector as investors supported the underlying value of products denominated in the softening currency .
Wednesday ’s price surge of more than 4 percent came after suspected militant attacks in Nigeria ’s main oil city , Port Harcourt , heightened concern over the potential for further disruptions in shipments from the world ’s eighth largest oil exporter .
“ With the military and the militant warlords engaged in a violent tit - for - tat , the risk for oil disruptions in Nigeria remains higher than in the past few months , ” said Olivier Jakob of Petromatrix .
Frequent attacks by militant groups since February 2006 have driven thousands of foreign oil workers from the oil - rich Niger Delta and cut oil exports by about 20 percent .
Investors are also particularly sensitive to signs of further fund investment in commodities at the start of the year .
The broad Reuters / Jefferies CRB Index of commodities rose nearly 17 percent in 2007 as the sector rebounded from a loss in 2006 .

A further decline in U.S. crude stockpiles -- already running at a three - year low -- was also expected .
Weekly government data will be released Thursday , a day later than usual due to the New Year holiday .
Stocks of crude in the United States were expected to have fallen 2.2 million barrels last week , the seventh straight week of decline , as refiners processed more crude , according to a Reuters poll .
Distillate stocks , which include heating oil and diesel , were forecast to have declined by 500,000 barrels .
City authorities in Munich , southern Germany , have closed down a kindergarten with immediate effect after discovering it was run by the Church of Scientology , the municipality said .
" The wellbeing of the children in the establishment was under threat because the education process was based on the principles of Scientology , " the municipality said in a statement .
The kindergarten opened last summer and had 18 children looked after by two adults .
The Royal Society of Chemistry , Europe 's biggest stinks association , has weighed into the biofuel debate .
RSC chief Dr Richard Pike , in a statement issued today , criticised current and near - future alternative fuel technologies and characterised carbon offsetting schemes as " bogus " .
" Where spin takes precedence over hard facts , the outcome is likely to be a spate of uncoordinated initiatives that have not been fully thought through , " said the hard - hitting brainbox , a chartered engineer and chartered scientist .
Dr Pike 's remarks appeared to have been stimulated by the fuss arising from biz kingpin Richard Branson 's recent flight test of a 747 partly running on fuel made from coconuts .
" Flying on biofuel is a milestone , " says the RCS statement , " but it must not become a millstone . "
Pike apparently sees the quest for biofuels as a wild goose chase through a minefield amid dangerous waters , up a creek without a paddle towards a plan you would n't touch with a bargepole .
Ahem .
The good doctor went on to say that biofuel was a very inefficient way of using land to turn sunlight into portable energy .
He said that solar power devices used to generate hydrogen by electrolysis would give you 20 times as many joules per acre .
Pike admitted that such technology would be " more expensive and complex " than " low - cost , low - yield " biofuels competing with food production and rainforests for fertile land .
But he said that a hydrogen - fuelled transport system , as well as using sunlight and space relatively efficiently , would be able to draw on other kinds of low - carbon power .
" If the issues of hydrogen and electricity storage can be resolved , " he said , " this would expand the flexibility of applying other energy sources , such as wind , tidal , geo - thermal , hydro- electric and nuclear , to the transportation sector . "
The doc is n't wedded to hydrogen , however , saying that the true " Holy Grail " for future transport fuel would be artificial photosynthesis , in which water and CO 2 would be combined to produce energy - dense fuel .
Pike speaks of driving this using " the sun 's energy and new catalysts in a land - efficient way " - but American boffins have said that you could power such fuel factories using any kind of energy you fancied .
Despite being a former oil and gas exec , Pike had little time for the various kinds of synthetic fossil - derived transport fuels currently being tested .
These are sometimes seen as a possible alternative to juice made from expensive and increasingly insecure crude oil imports .
Under these plans , liquid fuel would instead be made out of coal or natural gas - relatively cheap and securely available , at least for some Western countries .
" Coal - to - liquid ( CTL ) and gas - to - liquid ( GTL ) options are also being promoted , " says Dr Pike , but " their manufacture is extremely energy intensive .
Roughly , for every tonne of ' clean ' fuel used by the consumer as diesel , another tonne of feedstock has been burnt at the production site , so that globally carbon dioxide emissions per litre of fuel at end - use are significantly more than with conventional fuels . "
The RCS boss rounded off his remarks with harsh words on companies buying carbon credits to achieve green credentials .
" The majority of carbon - offsetting schemes are bogus , " he said bluntly , " because the net carbon savings of tree - planting , or other designated renewable sources , do not take account of the full - life - cycle energy and carbon balances . "
So there you have it - greenbacks can't make you green .
There ai n't no such thing as a carbon neutral organisation - according to the RCS , anyway .
And the official opinion of the biggest alliance of chemistry boffins in Europe has to carry some weight in this area at least , whatever you think of hydrogen cars and photosynthetic fuel grails . ®
The multibillionaire businessman and mayor of New York , Michael Bloomberg , is pushing ahead with plans to throw himself into the US presidential contest as an independent candidate this spring .
Bloomberg , who has a personal fortune that would allow him to mount the most expensive campaign in US political history , could seriously damage the chances of the Democratic candidate .
Bloomberg is waiting to see the outcome of the Republican and Democratic races before deciding whether to announce his candidacy in March .
But his staff want him to run and there is a blueprint drawn up for contesting the 50 states .
Journalists who cover Bloomberg , a member of the Democratic party before switching to the Republicans - from which he has now also resigned - say that if Barack Obama is the Democratic choice , he will not stand .
The same is true if John McCain , the most moderate of the Republican field , wins his party 's nomination .
Bloomberg , while denying he intends to run , spent this week raising his political profile .
He used the annual state of the city address on Thursday to make the usual city - specific announcements , such as 500 more beds for the homeless , but also to talk about national issues , such as immigration , tax relief and crime .
He is travelling to other states to raise his political profile and to engage in national policy debates .
Yesterday he visited Texas to make a health announcement with the Tour de France hero and cancer survivor Lance Armstrong .
Today , he will be appearing in California for a meeting with the governor , Arnold Schwarzenegger , to discuss infrastructure .
Although it has been confirmed he is paying out millions to pollsters to test support in the 50 states for a presidential run , he snapped at a reporter who questioned him this week about whether he would be a candidate .
" Miss , no matter how many times you ask the question , I 'm not a candidate .
That 's the answer .
I can't go into nitpicking .
This is ridiculous , " he said .
Independents have never won in recent US political history but they have influenced the contests .
Ralph Nader , who ran as an independent in 2000 , is often blamed for taking votes from Al Gore and allowing victory to George Bush .
Ross Perot , who stood in 1992 , spending $ 65 m , had a disastrous campaign but still managed to win 18.9 % of the popular vote .
Larry Sabato , professor of politics at the University of Virginia , said a Bloomberg run could have enormous influence .
" Normally , independents do not have much impact but this one is worth between $ 11bn and $ 20bn and he would be willing to spend at least $ 1bn [ about £ 510 m ] on this .
If he spends a billion , he would have outspent the Democratic and Republican candidates combined .
It is bound to have an impact . "
Stephen Hess , a political analyst at the Brookings Institution who served in the Eisenhower and Nixon administrations and was an adviser to presidents Ford and Carter , said yesterday that he would be surprised if he stood , given the risk that he would prevent a Democrat taking the White House .
" I know he is considering the race .
I think he has been a great mayor and philanthropist and I do not know why he would want to go down in history as the Great Spoiler , " Hess said .
Dec. 14 , 2007 �
The Department of Justice declined to prosecute a State Department employee who allegedly sexually assaulted a female Halliburton / KBR worker in Iraq , despite a recommendation from the State Department that he be charged , according to an internal document obtained by ABC News .
Ali Mokhtare , who is still employed by the State Department , was investigated in 2005 after a female Halliburton / KBR employee said he sexually assaulted her at the company - run camp in Basra , Iraq .
Mokhtare was a diplomatic official in Basra who first came to Iraq as a Farsi translator interviewing detainees .
The U.S. Diplomatic Security Service investigated the allegations against Mokhtare and presented the case to the Justice Department for prosecution , but " the case was declined for prosecution " states the document .
Furthermore , investigators requested that the State Department suspend Mokhtare 's security clearance , but according to a handwritten note at the bottom of the document , that request was denied .
Neither the departments of State nor Justice would comment for this article .
Watch a report on this story on ABC News ' " 20/20 " tonight at 10 p.m. ET .
Tracy Barker , Mokhtare 's alleged victim , is a mother of five from Fort Bragg , N.C .
She says she wants Mokhtare to be prosecuted for attempted rape and assault .
" I'm an American citizen being assaulted by a State Department employee , " said Barker " and nobody cares and nothing 's being done about it . "
Barker 's attorney , Stephanie Morris , said the lack of prosecution sends a message to overseas contractors that it is a " free for all . "
" You are not going to be prosecuted and you are not going to be disciplined by anybody , " said Morris .
Barker said that even the State Department agent assigned to her case , Lynn Falanga , advised her to sue the U.S. government when Mokhtare was let off the hook .
" She called me and my husband from her own home and said that the State Department was covering it up and that I needed to get an attorney and that they were going to let him continue assaulting people , " said Barker .

Falanga did not return a call seeking comment from ABC News .
Despite the fact that it was more than two years ago , Barker said she remembers her assault vividly .
She said that one evening in the summer of 2005 at the KBR camp in Basra , Mokhtare approached her and he said that he needed help with his air conditioner .
Barker handled repair orders , and she said she offered to come look at it the next morning .
Barker said Mokhtare told her that it was too hot to wait , and he needed her to come look at it tonight .
But when she arrived at his room , Mokhtare did n't have the air conditioner on his mind , according to Barker .
" He had poured a glass of Jack Daniels and offered me a drink , and of course , I declined , " said Barker .
" He jumped up and grabbed me around the neck and tried to get my shirt off of me . "
Barker said she struggled with him for a few minutes before she managed to fight him off .
Barker reported the incident , and a State Department investigator interviewed Mokhtare .
Mokhtare denied that he had attempted to rape her , but admitted that he had gone too far with Tracy , and signed a statement to that effect , which ABC News has obtained .
In the document , Mokhtare states he " admitted that he pulled her vest and shirt " and that he asked Barker , " What do you have behind there ? "
He also says that he " made a mistake and it was stupid , " according to the document .
Despite his admission , Mokhtare , a U.S. citizen , still works at the State Department today .
He would not comment to ABC News when we located him in Washington , D.C. , earlier this week .
Barker is yet another female former employee of Halliburton / KBR that has come forward to ABC News saying she was sexually assaulted , harassed and threatened while working in Iraq .
Barker says that aside from the sexual assault , she was constantly propositioned by her superior , and threatened and isolated after she reported the incident .
From the moment she arrived at the Halliburton / KBR camp in Basra , Iraq , she said she was treated like a sex object .
" When I arrived in Basra , there were about five men that work on the camp [ for Halliburton / KBR ] and they were waiting for me , " Barker told ABC News " 20/20 " in an exclusive interview .
" I was told they wanted to see what I look like , " she said , " to make sure I was decent - looking before they approved my transfer . "
Barker said her KBR boss in Basra repeatedly propositioned her and threatened her .
" The manager of the camp kept making gestures of how if I wanted my safety to exist on the camp , that I needed to sleep with him and that 's all he kept saying to me , " said Barker .
Barker said her co-workers were not much better .
She said when she first arrived at her new office it looked more like a fraternity house than a place of business .
" On my way into the office , there was pictures of prostitutes and animals having sex pasted in the hallway , " she said .
" Our office was just wallpapered with pornography .
There was not one space of wall at all . "
Barker said she inquired from her male co-worker where her workplace was located .
" My co-worker told me that , ' You can either sit at the end of my desk or on the floor , because that 's where the women sit that work with me , ' " Barker said .
When Tracy tried to report the co-worker to her manager , she said the manager 's gestures towards her only got worse .
" If I do n't feel safe , I can come to his room and get a backrub or sleep with him , " Barker said she was told .
Barker said following the sexual assault , she reported Mokhtare to her camp manager and he barred her from discussing it with anyone , not even her husband , whom she desperately wanted to call .
" I can't sleep , I keep crying , I want to call my husband , " Barker said she told her boss .
" He said , ' Oh no , no , no .
If you want to talk to somebody , you call me , you talk to me . ' "
During the State Department 's investigation of her allegations , Barker said , one of the investigators asked her to put on the outfit that the had worn on the night of the assault -- long khaki pants , a button - down shirt , and a vest .
" I was told to wear those clothes for three days to see if I was any kind of temptation to the male species , " she said .
As in similar cases , KBR has moved for Barker 's claim to be heard in private arbitration , instead of a public courtroom , as provided under the terms of her original employment contract .
In arbitration , there is no public record or transcript of the proceedings , and participants are generally prohibited from discussing the details of the case .
Barker 's lawyer , Todd Kelly , said that Halliburton / KBR created a " boys will be boys " atmosphere at the company barracks , which put females at great risk .
Halliburton has since divested itself of KBR and says it " is improperly named " in the suit .
In a statement , KBR said it was " instructed to cease " its own investigation by U.S. government authorities " because they were assuming sole responsibility for the criminal investigations . "
" The safety and security of all employees remains KBR 's top priority , " it said in a statement .
" Our commitment in this regard is unwavering . "

Brave New Denmark
The brave new citizenry described on this page was excerpted from a post found at www.rense.com .
According to the following observations and supporting comments from " rogue " Danes , Swedes and foreign nationals living in Denmark and Sweden the Danish people have been molded into the human model described in Huxleys " Brave New World . "
The defeminization of women and the emasculation of men have resulted in a mind - controlled , androgenous culture capable only of unquestioning obedience to the authoritarian state .
We suggest you read the following , take into consideration what is happening to Americans in America and then realize that our people are being transitioned into Brave New Americans : Mindless morons who accept as gospel every utterance of the ( police ) state
Following are excerpts from an email from Phillip Jones to Ted Tweitmeier dated Jan. 8 , 2008 .
The full communication , with comments from Tweitmeyer and several supporting " bloggers " can be found at www.rense.com entitled
" Brave New Denmark . "
Dear Ted :
Before I begin , perhaps I should tell you something about myself .
I am a 49 - year - old British man , married to a Danish lady and living in Denmark .
Prior to moving here back in 1996 , I had spent 15 years as a police officer in London and before that 6 years in the military .
I was raised in the industrial area of South Wales and come from `blue collar` stock .
Until my relocation to this small , cold northern country [ Denmark ] , I had `bought` into the consensus viewpoint and , although as a serving officer in London , I had been aware of all the rapid changes taking place in society , I had not realised that these changes were orchestrated and designed , as opposed to `evolutionary` .
I had imagined that Denmark would be little more than a smaller version of my homeland .
My wife was / is not much different in views and culture from myself , and our countries shared a joint history .
For the first half year or so , I didnt take too much notice of my surroundings , as we were occupied with the day - to - day business of setting up our home .
It was when I was able to sit back and take note of my new environment that I was struck immediately at how different Danes were from British people .
My wife had lived in the UK for some years and I soon learned that she was not typical of her country folk .
The most immediate and annoying character trait I noticed was the habitual need of Danes to tell other people how wonderful Denmark is and how much better everything is compared to other places .
To even the casual onlooker , it was clear that they were deeply delusional .
Denmark is an okay place , but no better and a degree worse than some places .
It is small , with a population of around 5,000,000 .
Until very recently , it has been very homogenous , ( and to a great extent still is ) and somewhat isolated , tucked away as it is up on the top edge of Europe .
In fact , if one wished to conduct a `social experiment` , few places would be better suited , or located .
Add to this the truth that Danish people are by nature in awe of authority , compliant and passive .
Forget the `Vikings` of yore .
Most of them settled in Britain , Northern France and down the Volga .
I began to question this pride in all things Danish .
The food variety and quality were not as good as in the UK .
The public infrastructure was inadequate and oh so slow .
Monopoly was the name of the game in business .
No competition whatsoever .
Danish produce and Danish produce only was the rule of things .
The sheer cost of living in the place was / is at least 2 - 3 times that of the UK and yet everyone was asking me so proudly if I felt lucky to be living in Denmark .
Then there is the much vaunted Danish medical system which , again , according to Danes , is  the best in the world . 
But that s just the thing , it wasnt / isnt and the standards are dropping continually whilst the costs of prescription medicine and dental care are rising out of control .
As a former London police officer , I was often asked to give lectures at Odense University on matters relating to crime etc .
Over the next few years , I gave dozens of these presentations and was shocked at how unquestioning and compliant young Danish people were .
They were immune even to provocation , which I used on several occasions in order to get a response , but usually to no avail .
I was able to attend several classes over this period and was appalled and shocked at the levels of Marxist / Feminist views being foisted on the young people .
The history of their country prior to the end of WWII is just not taught at all and very few Danes have any grasp of their countrys past .
Almost all the teachers were female ( of a sort ) , and the classes themselves were overwhelmingly populated by girls .
Almost every lecture I attended was weighted heavily towards a ` European` future , and very few were not heavily biased in that direction .
And yet , paradoxically , the `Denmark is the best country in the world , with the best education system , best medical system , best social system , best economy , ad nauseum , was also a constant theme .
This is the same message transmitted through every media outlet and Danes take love of flag to a new height , even decorating Xmas trees and birthday cakes with that national banner .
This apparent contradiction , caused me great confusion at the time , but no longer .
Today , I understand .
This acceptance / compliance extended into society in general , where complaints against the system of any kind were in very short supply to the point of being nonexistant .
With every new law , or government - inspired price increase or tax hike , would come the standard response " there s nothing you can do about it " or in Danish , " Saadan er Danmark , " which literally means , " That s how it is in Denmark " .
Denmark is the country of rules .
There are rules for everything here .
Even the rules seem to have rules and the people have an annoying way of interfering in each others lives to the point of self regulation .
One of the worlds smallest countries has one of the `biggest` governments and ` The State` is by far the biggest employer here , so people depend upon it for their livelihood .
The ID Card was introduced to Denmark back in the 1970s .
Every Dane or foreign resident here has a `personal number` and , unlike the `National Insurance` number in the US or UK , it must be quoted in order to do almost everything .
One can not get a bank account , travel , do business of any kind , learn to drive , drive , be educated etc etc. without it .
It masquerades as a health insurance card , but has a far more all encompassing purpose .
It is also backed up by a national register database .
The coming Biometric model will simply be accepted as an `improvement` and or progress .
Conformity in all things is the way of life here .
People dress the same , cut their hair the same , eat the same , do the same , like the same , say exactly the same phrases , in fact , modern Danish is more a language of phraseology than anything else ( Newspeak ? ) .
They like the same food ( and will serve the same `fayre` to guests every time , no matter which Danish home one visits ) .
An evening out at a Danish household , could / can be scripted beforehand , from start to end .
Danish women and girls have , with a few exceptions , become almost androgynous in appearance and most are fiercely feminist in their views , actions and manners .
Danish men are for the most part emasculated .
Danes love their country , but will not fight for it .
Danes loathe all things foreign , and resist all such influences to the point where their shops have very little on the shelves and what there is is ridiculously expensive and yet , they absolutely fail to recognise or resist the looming shadow of the European Superstate , still believing it to be something they can just walk away from when they have had enough .
Danes rarely smile , are very reserved to the point of being rude , and yet , a recent ( ish ) opinion poll carried out throughout the EU showed them to be the most content of Europes people .
Danes had been telling me for nearly eight years that `they had it so good` .
But they didnt .
Not at all .
They had it good like a bird in a cage has it good .
I had the feeling even back then that if I made too many comments of an unfavourable ` Anti Denmark`nature , my residency might be revoked , or I might come into contact with the `State Authorities` ( Danes are encouraged to `spy` on each other and do so with gusto ) .
Of course no such thing occurred , but the feeling was there .
Such is the insidious nature of Danish society , which heralds `free speech` as an inalienable right and yet damns that same `free speech` to foreigners or dissenters .
By the end of the 1990s , I had begun to understand the extent to which the Danish population had been completely indoctrinated .
Any form of criticism was fiercely resented .
Nobody ever complained about anything of an official nature .
Nearly everybody I knew , or those I saw speaking on TV , seemed to believe that the Danish government wished only good things for them .
That the ever burgeoning tax burden was necessary , even a good thing .
We are speaking of an income tax of on average 50 percent plus a sales tax of 25 percent .
This level of taxation is across the board and includes tax on cars , houses , food and , well , everything you can imagine could be taxed is taxed and then some .
And all prices on all things rise on 31st January every year , without fail .
This is just understood and accepted without comment by the majority of the people .
" Saadan er Danmark . "
When my wife and I tried to explain to people that , in the UK , we paid a fraction of the Danish tax burden and still managed at least a parity in social welfare and medical care , they wouldnt believe it .
When we told them that the food in DK was of an inferior quality , with no variety and ridiculously priced they , again , would not believe it .
We travelled to the U.S. three times between 1996 and 2001 spending a total of 14 weeks there and travelling some 6,000 miles .
Those three `trips` were milestones in my life and I was bursting with tales of our adventures .
But , upon returning to DK , not one Danish friend or family member showed any interest whatsoever in our stories .
It was as if we had never been away .
The only people who were at all interested were our `international` contacts .
Now , I might be rambling at this point , but what I am trying to depict here is a society quite unlike anywhere else .
Even by European standards , Denmark is different .
If it is nt Danish or Denmark , then they cannot contemplate it at all .
I felt totally disaffected with the country .
Even with no knowledge whatsoever of any `global conspiracy ,  I would say things to friends such as ; " These are not people , they re like ` Body Snatchers , ` " or , " There must be something in the water here , " and even , " Its in the food they eat . "
Little did I understand how close to the truth I was .
Then I started to put the pieces together ; the inertia of the youth , the conformity of its citizens .
The `blind` obedience of the populace .
The apparent contentment being voiced , which was in obvious conflict with the miserable demeanour of Danish people .
The narrow , insulated `bubble` view of the world around them .
The conditioned state of national denial , refusing to admit even the possibility that someplace else might be in some way better .
And the absolute kicker is the Danish obsession with work .
It is the only thing they talk about .
To work is everything and if one is not in work , then one is a member of a trade union , which will find some way of ensuring that one has little or no spare time to think and consider life and what is happening all around .
In 2003 , I read Pat Buchannans book , ` The Death Of The West . `
This work set me on the path to discovery and , although I have moved a little beyond it , the facts and ideas expressed by the author were , in many cases , highly relevant to my experiences in Denmark .
But the point is this ; on page 77 , Buchanan at the top of the page makes this quote , " The perfect totalitarian state is one where the all powerful political bosses and their army of managers control a population of slaves who do not have to be coerced because they love their servitude . "
This is from Aldous Huxleys nightmare novel `Brave New World` and it describes Danes and Denmark almost to a tee .
I spoke to my wife about this and she told me that she had read the book .
That , in fact , it was required reading at `Upper level` schooling .
You see , Ted , that is it .
Denmark is ` Brave New World` .
I set about reading `the work` and it chilled me to see all the parallels with Danish Society .
They have introduced so much of it here .
The mindless compliance and conformity , the androgyny , the totally passive and non-agitative demeanour .
The all pervading social state .
The brainwashing and categorizing of students within the education or rather , `state indoctrination` program` .
The resorting to the use of `psycho analysis` for any form of `anti social` behaviour , which can be nothing more than daring to publicly criticise the state , or asking awkward questions , or young males playing around in classrooms .
The prescription of `happy pills` to supposedly depressed people or , in other words , anyone who begins to see what it is that surrounds them .
The mass media , state education , state health service and all the other avenues of public information tell the same story incessantly .
Denmark is the best country , Danes are the best at everything .
All things Danish , are better than those which are non-Danish .
It has created a people so `dumbed down` , so afraid , so passive , so paradoxically proud yet obviously suffering from a deep seated inferiority complex .
Arrogant , yet totally lacking in self - confidence .
Put another way , this is one `mucked up place . `
No need of `tasers` or heavy - handed Police tactics here .
Not much evidence of surveillance cameras either .
If the government says inject your kids with this or that drug , Danes will do it because the government told them to .
When the time comes to be microchipped , the State will tell them its for the best and they will do it without question .
Joseph Goebbels said , " Propaganda must be able to be understood by even the most stupid members of society .
Then you can make people believe that paradise is hell , and hell is paradise " .
Denmark is not quite `hell` , but its on its way there .
Yesterday , another `BS` news report told Danish people than the reason the cost of food had risen so much was because of problems in Australia and Nigeria .
Well then , that s okay then , is nt it ?
We just have to suck it up , there s nothing we can do about it` .
The State has explained why we now pay almost double what most people are paying in the rest of Europe for food , electricity , oil , clothing , transport , tax etc. etc .
The fools just accept it .
Nobody asks , " What has Australia and Nigeria got to do with a 25 percent price rise in the cost of Danish dairy products , bacon , meats , bread and the spectrum of food stuffs produced in Denmark ? "
They are told its down to a recession , or inflation , or some other ( bogus ) cyclical economic phenomenon .
But the point is , nobody asks any questions .
They are simply `content in their servitude . 
Recently , the Danish Prime Minister signed the EU Reform Treaty .
Then , without bursting into fits of laughter , told the Danish people that there would be no referendum on this ` Treaty` as it did not affect Danish sovereignty .
This is clearly a `bare faced` lie , as once ratified , it will remove Denmarks ability to decide its own economy , justice system , home affairs , defence and a whole lot more .
In other words , Denmark will be a nation no more , except in the daydreams of its prozac - popping citizenry .
When I have tried to explain this to people here , they say things like " No , our prime minister would never do that .
He would never sign such a document " .
Then , when told he already has , I get , " Ah well , we can always withdraw later if it doesnt work out . "
But that s just the point , they wont be able to short of declaring armed resistance and that s just not the Danish way .
To a Dane , raising ones tone a little above whisper level is considered displaying anger .
The `Feminazis` here have done their job very well .
It is my opinion that the EU is running two `test models` side by side .
Model one is the UK `1984` type , which is intended for those member states whose populations are more prone to resistance , and model two , the `Brave New World` type , as demonstrated here in DK , for smaller , less rebellious peoples .
I have probably not done this topic justice , but if I have introduced you to what is happening here , that will be my work done .
Denmark is like nowhere else , and Danes are unlike anyone else , except perhaps the Swedes and Norwegians , who , from what others have said , are undergoing similar programming .
PS .
It should be said that , of course , not every Dane follows this pattern , but in my experience at least 96 percent of those I have met during the past 10 years do .
Received from my Mom , who remains a source of wisdom and experience .
And she does n't even drink beer . :)
When things in your life seem almost too much to handle , when 24 hours in a day are not enough , remember the mayonnaise jar ... and the beer .
Here are a few thoughts to keep in mind :
A professor stood before his philosophy class and had some items in front of him .
When the class began , wordlessly , he picked up a very large and empty mayonnaise jar and proceeded to fill it with golf balls .
He then asked the students if the jar was full .
They agreed that it was .
So the professor then picked up a box of pebbles and poured them into the jar .
He shook the jar lightly .
The pebbles rolled into the open areas between the golf balls .
He then asked the students again if the jar was full .
They agreed it was .
The professor next picked up a box of sand and poured it into the jar .
Of course , the sand filled up everything else .
He asked once more if the jar was full .
The students responded with an unanimous " yes " .
The professor then produced two cans of beer from under the table and poured the entire contents into the jar , effectively filling the empty space between the sand .
The students laughed .
" Now , " said the professor , as the laughter subsided , " I want you to recognize that this jar represents your life .
" The golf balls are the important things -- your family , your children , your health , your friends , your favorite passions -- things that if everything else was lost and only they remained , your life would still be full .
The pebbles are the other things that matter like your job , your house , your car .
The sand is everything else -- the small stuff .
" If you put the sand into the jar first , there is no room for the pebbles or the golf balls .
The same goes for life .
If you spend all your time and energy on the small stuff , you will never have room for the things that are important to you .
" Pay attention to the things that are critical to your happiness .
Play with your children .
Take your partner out to dinner .
Take time to get medical checkups .
Listen to some good music or play another 18 .
There will always be time to clean the house , and fix the disposal .
" Take care of the golf balls first , the things that really matter .
Set your priorities .
The rest is just sand . "
One of the students raised her hand and inquired what the beer represented .
The professor smiled .
" I 'm glad you asked .
It just goes to show you that no matter how full your life may seem , there 's always room for a couple of beers . "

Man Smuggles Art To
The &%#$ing Moon !
In 2003 , Craig Kalpakjian proposed a series of Earthworks - style drawings that would be executed on the surface of the moon , like the Nazca Lines or 60 ’s bad boys Michael Heizer ’s and Dennis Oppenheim ’s desert drawings .
He called them Moonworks .
Now I find out there was already an entire Moon Museum , with drawings by six leading contemporary artists of the day : Andy Warhol , Robert Rauschenberg , David Novros , Forrest “ Frosty ” Myers , Claes Oldenburg , and John Chamberlain .
The Moon Museum was supposedly installed on the moon in 1969 as part of the Apollo 12 mission .
I say supposedly , because NASA has no official record of it ; according to Frosty Myers , the artist who initiated the project , the Moon Museum was secretly installed on a hatch on a leg of the Intrepid landing module with the help of an unnamed engineer at the Grumman Corporation after attempts to move the project forward through NASA ’s official channels were unsuccessful .
Myers revealed the exhibition ’s existence to the New York Times , which published the story Nov. 22 , 1969 , two days after the Apollo 12 crew had left the moon–and the Intrepid–and two days before they arrived back on earth .
Here ’s the photo from the story :
According to Myers , who was involved with E.A.T. on the Pepsi Pavilion project at the time , the six drawings were miniaturized and baked onto an iridium - plated ceramic wafer measuring just 3/4 ″ x 1/2 ″ x 1/40 ″ , with the assistance of engineers at Bell Labs .
According to the Times , the artworks are , clockwise from the top center : Rauschenberg ’s wavy line ; Novros ’ black square bisected by thin white lines [ in 1969 , Novros also created the incredibly rich , minimalist fresco on the second floor of Judd ’s 101 Spring St ] ; a computer - generated drawing by Myers ; a geometric mouse by Oldenburg , “ the subject of a sculpture in his current show at the Museum of Modern Art ” [ a sculpture which is in MoMA ’s permanent collection , btw ] ; and a template pattern by Chamberlain , “ similar to one he used to produce paintings done with automobile lacquer . ”
Warhol ’s contribution , which is obscured by the thumb above , is described as “ a calligraphic squiggle made up of the initials of his signature . ”
Actually , it ’s a drawing of a penis .
Here are some other photos by Frosty Myers , published , I believe , with a 1985 Omni Magazine article by the arts writer Phoebe Hoban .
That would be the Warhol Penis there in the upper right .
As the NASA spokesman told the Times when asked about the Museum infiltration , “ I do n’t know about it .
If we had been asked , it sounds like something we ’d have very much interested in [ sic ] .
If it is true that they ’ve succeeded in doing it by some clandestine means , I hope that the work represents the best in contemporary American art . ”
[ emphasis added for ironic amusement , though to Myers ’ credit , it turned out to be a pretty good grouping of artists to have involved . ]
But is it conceivable that someone could have smuggled dirty pictures onto a mission to the moon ?
Actually , yes .
Even if Warhol had n’t sent that penis to the moon , Apollo 12 would still have achieved the first known incident of lunar nudity .
The back - up crew for the A12 mission surreptitiously inserted reduced photos of Playboy centerfolds into the flight crew ’s fireproof plastic cuff checklists which were only discovered about 2.5 hours into their first moon walk .
[ if you ’re at work , that first link is to nasa.gov , and the second is to playboy.com .
The same scans are available at both sites , though NASA has conveniently embedded theirs in a PDF . ]
In addition to the six drawings , the Moon Museum also acquired a large collection of photographs ; astronaut Alan Bean accidentally left several rolls of undeveloped film behind on the lunar surface .
The checklists came back with the astronauts .

There 's a lot of beautiful origami art out there that I 've been wanting to share .
I just recently decided to take origami up myself ( so far , I 've become great at making tiny waterbombs out of Post - Its ) , so I had a little more motivation to get going and finish this collection of works by those far more accomplished in the art .
Hope you enjoy .
Joseph Wu's Origami
Page is a great place to start , with news , articles , instructions , hundreds of links -- oh , and the galleries of Wu's own outstanding creations in categories like fantasy gaming and creatures of myth , including a section of commissioned works used in advertising and illustration , as well as several galleries of works by others .
OrigaMIT is the website of the Massachussetts Institute of Technology 's Origami Club , and it includes a nice gallery of members ' works .
For the best of the best , check out Badass Origami at A.R.T. , a collection of works from MIT 's fourth annual Student Origami Competition .
There are some more nice models in Origami , another post at A.R.T.
Stones are okay , but people who live in paper houses probably should n't throw scissors .
The Origami House is a collaborative installation that was created by a team of designers , folders , and paper engineers for the Folding Australia 2005 Convention .
Eric Joisel is a professional Parisian origami artist , and in addition to a gallery of his fantastic works , his site presents very interesting features on the creation process and a nice intro to and history on the art .
His highly sculptural pieces tend to the fantastic and in addition to people and very naturalistic animals there are a number of Lord of the Rings characters , gnomes , fairies , and other magical creatures among his subjects .
Origami artist Guspath
Go creates intricate and wonderful models of mostly fantastic creatures .
He also photographs his own creations with a great eye .
Gilad 's Origami Page is the site of prolific folder Gilad Chan , who has folded loads of models from the simple to the splendid .
All the models ' sources are credited and linked .
But wait , there 's more !
In addition to his own pieces , he has also collected tons of photos of brilliant work from half a dozen origami conventions .
It 's all there in the huge themed galleries Many more artists ' galleries , along with some diagrams , artist info , and books for sale are collected at the French site Design in Origami .
Some highlights : Manuel Sirgo Alvarez is an accomplished origami artist with a large gallery of beautiful works , including many wonderfully rendered insects and spiders , and a sizeable number of marine invertebrates .
Lionel Albertino specializes in insects of all descriptions , but his gallery features a few other surprises .
Sometime soon I 'll do a follow up and share some good places to get started doing your own origami , with beginning instructions and nice diagrams .
For now , enjoy the visual inspiration .

Suggestions for learning R
The R project is at http://www.r-project.org :
In particular , see the `other docs ' there .
Over and above the strong set of functions that you get in `off the shelf ' R , there is a concept like CPAN ( of the perl world ) or CTAN ( of the tex world ) , where there is a large , well - organised collection of 3rd party software , written by people all over the world .
This is called ` CRAN ' for Comprehensive R Archive Network .
You will be amazed at the quality and comprehensiveness of the code out there .
The dynamism of R and of the surrounding 3rd party packages has thrown up the need for a newsletter , R News .
You should make it a point to look hard at back issues .
The standard online documents associated with R tend to be reference manuals targeting someone who already knows quite a bit .
The articles in R News are very valuable in taking you from scratch to understanding R. As an example , you can certainly learn using the online documents on the boot ( ) package , by saying :
library ( help=boot ) library ( boot ) ?
boot
But you will learn a lot more by reading the article Resampling Methods in R : The boot package by Angelo J. Canty , which appeared in the December 2002 issue of R News .

私は先日、30年程度生きてきての人生初めての借金をしてしまいました。
借金をする前はローンを組むことすら抵抗のある性格だったのですが、一度してしまうとたびたび繰り返してしまう状態になってしまいました。
きっかけはスマートフォンによる基本プレイ無料をうたったゲームでした。
初めのうちは無料で遊べる範囲でプレイしていたのですが、ライバルにどんどん差を付けられましてその人たちは課金をしていると聞き、私も負けていられないと思い課金をしてしまいました。
課金をする最初は数百円までと決めていて、それだけでもドキドキしていましたが、数回繰り返していくうちに慣れてしまいました。
だんだん課金して行く金額も増えてしまい数千円、数万円と月々の少ないお小遣いでは次第に足りなくなっていってしまいました。
人間の欲望というのは怖い物で課金無しでチマチマとプレイしてしまうのが我慢できなくなり、とうとう借金をしてしまいました。
Clubbing someone to death with a loaded Uzi
I once had an intern who wrote wrote the following code to process a web survey form .
The form input widgets were named q1 , q2 , and so forth : foreach $k ( keys % in ) { if ( $k eq q1 ) { if ( $ in{$k} eq agree ) { $ count{q10} = $ count{q10 } + 1 ; } if ( $ in{$k} eq disaagree ) { $ count{q11} = $ count{q11} + 1 ; } } if ( $k eq q2 ) { @ q2 split = split ( / \0 / , $ in{$k} ) ; foreach ( @q2split ) { $ count {$_} = $ count {$_} + 1 ; } } if ( $k eq q3 ) { $ count { $in{ $k}} = $ count{$in{$k}} + 1 ; } ... }
There is a lot wrong with this code , but it's all trivial compared with the one big problem , which is the wholly unnecessary loop and tests .
The whole thing could be ( and should be , and was ) rewritten as : if ( $in{ q1 } eq agree ) { $ count{q10} = $ count{q10 } + 1 ; } if ( $in{ q1 } eq disaagree ) { $ count{q11} = $ count{q11} + 1 ; } @q2 split = split ( / \0 / , $ in{ q2 } ) ; foreach ( @q2split ) { $ count {$_} = $ count {$_} + 1 ; } $ count{$in{ q3 }} = $ count{$in{ q3 }} + 1 ; ...
After which one could start addressing the smaller problems , like the fact that " disagree " is misspelled .
This is the sort of mistake you expect from an intern .
I chuckled and corrected him .
But I 've seen it several times since from non-interns .
Here 's another example .
I am not making this up .
Whether it 's more or less odious than the intern code is up to you to decide : foreach $ location_name ( %LOCATION ) { $ location_code = $ LOCATION {$ location_name} ; if ( $ location_name eq $ location ) { printf FILE " $ location_code\ , " ; printf FILE " %4s " , " $ min3\ , " ; printf FILE " %4s " , " $ max3\ , " ; printf FILE " %1s " , " $wx3
" ; } }
It could have been written like this : printf FILE " $ LOCATION {$ location}\ , " ; printf FILE " %4s " , " $ min3\ , " ; printf FILE " %4s " , " $ max3\ , " ; printf FILE " %1s " , " $wx3
" ; I started using this problem as an interview question .
I 'll present the subject with trivial code like this : for my $k ( keys %hash ) { if ( $k eq " name " ) { $ hash {$k} ++ ; } } and then ask if they have any comments about it .
One nice thing about the question is that it translates naturally into whatever imperative language they claim expertise in .
It 's appalling how many supposedly professional programmers see nothing wrong here .
They squint at the code , and say " I think you need parentheses around % hash there " , or they criticize the choice of variable names .
I first used this as an interview question because the Python code sample submitted by a job applicant contained an example of it .
" Weird , " I thought , " but maybe she 's outgrown that . "
Since she claimed to be an expert
Perl user , I asked her about it in Perl , using code like the example above .
After she made a syntactic suggestion , I said " It 's not a syntax problem , and it 's not a trick question . "
She criticized the syntax some more .
Finally I told her the answer : " Could n't you just use $ hash{name} + + ? "
" Oh , yeah , I guess so , " she said .
A few minutes later we were going over her Python code sample and I pointed out the place where she had done the exact same thing , and asked if she was happy with that loop and wanted to change it .
No , she thought it was just fine .
" Does n't this look like the example I showed you on the whiteboard a little while ago ? "
" Oh , I guess it does . "
We did n't hire her .
Larry
Wall once said that iterating over the keys of a hash is like clubbing someone to death with a loaded Uzi .
I had already realized that you could , in principle , commit this error with a regular array instead of with a hash , but I had never seen an example until today 's episode of the Daily WTF .
The Daily WTF code is so awful , all the way through , that I was afraid that people might miss this slightly - more subtle gem lurking in the middle , and that was what motivated me to write this article in the first place .
Here 's the gem : // Java for ( int a=1 ; a< =params.size ( ) ;a++ ) switch ( a ) { case 1 : if ( params.get ( 0 ) != null ) this.one=params.get (0 ) .toString ( ) ; break ; case 2 : if ( params.get ( 1 ) != null ) this.two=params.get ( 1).toString ( ) ; break ; ... case 14 : if ( params.get ( 13 ) != null ) this.fourteen=params.get ( 13).toString ( ) ; break ; } } Wow , that is just , uh , stunning .

The four stolen masterpieces
In pictures
The pictures , by Vincent van Gogh and Claude Monet , were among four paintings worth $ 160 m ( £ 82 m ) that were stolen from Zurich 's Emil Buehrle Collection .
They were discovered on the back seat of a white sedan parked outside a psychiatric hospital in the city .
Three masked , armed men took the artworks from the museum last week .
' Good condition '
HOW THE THEFT HAPPENED 1 : Zurich police say the three robbers entered the museum just before it shut on Sunday
2 : Officers say one of the men used a gun to force 15 visitors and several staff to the floor
3 : Police say his two accomplices then seized the four paintings from a ground - floor display hall - according to the museum website , the Music Room
4 : Eyewitnesses say the robbers loaded the art into a white vehicle in front of the museum and drove off .
It was all over in three minutes , police say
The two recovered paintings are Monet 's Poppies near Vetheuil ( 1879 ) and van Gogh 's Chestnut in Bloom ( 1890 ) .
They were in good condition and still under the glass behind which they were displayed in the museum , Zurich police commandant Philipp Hotzenkoecherle said .
The two other stolen paintings , Degas 's Count Lepic and his Daughters ( 1871 ) and Cezanne 's Boy in a Red Jacket ( 1888 ) , are still missing .
Police closed the area around the Psychiatric University Clinic , about 500 m from the gallery , on Monday after a suspicious car was found .
The impressionist artworks were identified by museum director Lukas Gloor after a thorough inspection .
After the 10 February robbery , Mr Gloor said the works were so well known that it would be impossible to try and sell them on the open market .
The three thieves who stole the paintings are still at large .
" The severe wound which was inflicted on our house on 10 February has been closed somewhat , " said Lukas Gloor , curator of the collection at the museum .
Computer security expert who testified to NH Legislature , holds State accountable

Let me recap : first , Harri Hursti personally explained to New Hampshire officials how their specific election equipment could be manipulated by insiders ... in such as way as to change the outcome of an election , while at the same time producing fraudulent poll tapes that confirm the mistabulation ... Second , New Hampshire also chose to not hand - count a statistically valid sub -sample of ballots in - precinct on election night - a technique that can detect accidental or deliberate mistabulation of 1 % or more , of both hand - counted and optical scan ballots , with greater than 99 % confidence ....
Had New Hampshire simply chosen to count a 10 % sample of their ballots in precinct on election night , they could almost certainly have avoided the need to recount all the Republican and more than half of the Democratic primary ballots by hand - a week later , in adversarial circumstances , and under a cloud of suspicion about chain of custody and the legitimacy of secret vote counting .
It 's disturbing but hardly surprising to hear that LHS , the vendor that runs New Hampshire elections , took custody of the Diebold optical scan memory cards after the 2008 primary election .
In New Hampshire , LHS uses the notorious GEMS central tabulator software to program individual memory cards for each optical scan device that will be counting votes in each voting location .
The memory cards contain ballot definition files that are used by the optical scan software to interpret which marks on the ballot correspond to which candidates on the ballot at that location .
The memory card also contains software , but of course , we know that software is perfectly benign ... if you believe the vendor , because of course no one is allowed to independently examine those cards before or after the election .
Oh , yes , the memory cards also store the " results " of the election .
After the election , each optical scan machine prints out a " poll tape " which reports the vote totals by race and candidate for that machine at that location .
The poll tapes are signed by local election officials and couriered to the Secretary of State by NH state troopers .
Unlike most jurisdictions , New Hampshire does not use GEMS to tabulate the vote ; elsewhere , in most places that use Diebold optical scan voting equipment , the memory cards are couriered to the county election office and plugged back into the county 's GEMS server for upload and " automatic " tabulation .
In New Hampshire , the poll tapes are manually tabulated by an individual using Excel .
So it 's not surprising LHS retains custody of the memory cards , since the New Hampshire Secretary of State does n't use memory cards to tabulate the vote .
But several years ago Harri Hursti and Black Box Voting publicly demonstrated just one means of altering the contents of a Diebold memory card in such a way as to both alter the outcome of the election and also produce a matching , fraudulent poll tape report .
What is astonishing to me is that New Hampshire continues to use precisely the same Diebold Optical Scan model - 1.94w - on which Hursti first demonstrated his insider attack .
What compounds my astonishment is that last autumn , Hursti presented the details of that exploit in person to the New Hampshire State House Subcommittee on Election Equipment - and yet the state still decided to keep running its elections on precisely that model of Diebold equipment !
Finally , although I did my best to convince New Hampshire legislators in my own testimony there last September , they also decided not to pioneer the UBS mandatory in - precinct election - night hand - count audit of a random 10 % sample of all ballots .
This is a remarkable situation , so again let me recap : first , Hursti personally explained to New Hampshire officials how their specific election equipment could be manipulated by insiders ( oh , say - just hypothetically - at LHS ) in such as way as to change the outcome of an election , while at the same time producing fraudulent poll tapes that confirm the mistabulation .
The only way to detect Hursti's exploit would of course be to hand - count the ballots .
Second , New Hampshire also chose to not hand - count a statistically valid sub -sample of ballots in - precinct on election night - a technique that can detect accidental or deliberate mistabulation of 1 % or more , of both hand - counted and optical scan ballots , with greater than 99 % confidence .
UBS could easily have confirmed - or discounted - allegations that the unexpected ten point shift from final pre-election polls to election results in the Democratic primary did not truly reflect the will of the people of New Hampshire .
Had New Hampshire simply chosen to count a 10 % sample of their ballots in precinct on election night , they could almost certainly have avoided the need to recount all the Republican and more than half of the Democratic primary ballots by hand - a week later , in adversarial circumstances , and under a cloud of suspicion about chain of custody and the legitimacy of secret vote counting .
Game Mod was a six hour long workshop with the objective of showing the participants that it is not required to understand code to experiment and play with it .
Although they had no experience in coding , the task of each participant was to make a mod ( modified version ) of a game built in Processing .
The code to be modded .
A version of the atari game ' Breakout ' was built in Processing for the workshop .
Unlike common breakout games , in this version the ball bounces on all four sides of the screen , so the game goes on forever , without pauses .
This way the game can be modified to the point where its original gaming references are lost , and still maintain a continuous and endless motion .
( A cool side - effect is that the player can dribble with the ball ) .
Although the code of the version had advanced programming features , like Java classes , it was optimized for easy reading and tweaking .
Which was n't so hard to do : the use of classes allows a clear view , by breaking the code into various sheets , each one controlling a specific aspect of the game .
Also the variables of classes are usually declared at the beginning : the easy - tweaking bit is the first visible thing on the code .
One specific thing I did was to write descriptive names of variables and methods ( in a human readable way ) , and in Spanish , the main language of the workshop .
The modding .
The task of each participant was to create a mod of the game : dig into the code , change its looks and behaviours , search for unexpected results .
The workshop was given in the context of a graphic design graduate .
Very few participants had had any experience in coding .
No one had ever heard of the Processing language .
After a short presentation were they were shown several videogames and some of their mods , like Quake and the multifaceted Untitled Game , participants were guided to open the game source code in the Processing IDE .
That 's it , that 's all I showed .
They found out how to run and stop it , and after five minutes most were already modding its graphics and dynamics .
The main aim was not to teach them how to code , it was to push them to play around a be creative with a tool that is unfamiliar to them .
Someone said that you do n't have to learn how to play an instrument to make music with it .
They saw first - hand that the same applies with coding , and that there 's no point in being shy about touching the inside parts of an interactive medium .
I answered very few specific programming questions throughout the workshop , and my usual answer was to point them to the Processing reference , so they would either creatively look for an alternative solution , or find out they could easily get the answers by themselves - the great work put into the Processing reference and examples was a big helper .
As a matter of fact , all the pedagogical approach of Processing was a big helper in many aspects .
The mods .
I was impressed by the results since the first moments after they opened Processing .
These students have definitely proven you do n't need to read a manual to be creative with a tool .
Contrary to what many may think , understanding of technology is not a definite requisite for artistic expression on digital media .
Graphic design students , with almost no previous experience in coding , were pushed head first into object oriented programming .
They discovered that in the complex system of a game program , change can lead to unexpected and beautiful results , and their lack of knowledge of the tool was more a creativity boost than it was a limitation .
Try it .
If you 're curious about programming , or about Processing , or just want to play around , then you should try this .
It 's easy , and it wo n't take you much time .
In 20 minutes you 'll have your first mod done .
You do n't need to know anything about programming , just change stuff and see what happens .
All you need is Processing and the game source code .
The installation of Processing is quick , and clean .
If you 're on Windows , get the version with java .
After you open Processing , uncompress the whole folder and drag the ' gamemod_breakout.pde ' file into the Processing application icon , or open it from within Processing .
( Actually , the best way is to place the folder in the Sketchbook folder and restart Processing , but I 'll let you discover that feature by yourself ) .
Then start messing around .
A few tips : if something breaks , " undo " ( CTRL+Z ) .
If you like what you see , " Save as ... " a different name , just in case it breaks really bad .
By breaking I mean that the game window wo n't pop-up when you press play , and that means there 's some kind of error in the code and it wo n't run .
That 's usual stuff , it happens all the time when programming .
Once again , the burden of responsibility to help maintain America 's liberty rests upon the shoulders of the men in the pulpits .
That should not surprise us , because it has always been this way .
Part of what made America great was old fashioned , tell - it - like - it - is , no -nonsense preaching .
Most of what we hear today is a bunch of mealy - mouthed , pussyfooting , ear - tickling , do n't - offend - anyone preaching , which has largely contributed to America 's current slippery slope into the sewer .
But if you thought it could not get any worse , guess again .
A startling television news report from Shreveport , Louisiana has revealed a sinister plot hatched deep inside the diabolical brain cells of the Bush administration to use America 's pulpits as promoters of tyranny .
That is a strong statement , I know .
But it is true .
According to KSLA television in Shreveport , the Department of Homeland Security ( DHS ) intends to use America 's preachers to help pave the way for martial law in the event of another terrorist attack upon the United States .
The KSLA report ( which you can read for yourself here : http://www.ksla.com:80/Global/story.asp?S=6937987 ) begins , " Could martial law ever become a reality in America ?
Some fear any nuclear , biological or chemical attack on U.S. soil might trigger just that .
KSLA 12 has discovered that the clergy would help the government with potentially their biggest problem : Us . "
The report continued by saying , " [ G ]un confiscation is exactly what happened during the state of emergency following Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans , along with forced relocation .
U.S. Troops also arrived , something far easier to do now , thanks to last year 's elimination of the 1878 Posse Comitatus act , which had forbid regular U.S. Army troops from policing on American soil .
" If martial law were enacted here at home , like depicted in the movie , ' The Siege ' , easing public fears and quelling dissent would be critical .
And that 's exactly what the ' Clergy Response Team ' helped accomplish in the wake of Katrina . "
The report went on to say : " [ C ] lergy response teams would walk a tight - rope during martial law between the demands of the government on the one side , versus the wishes of the public on the other .
' In a lot of cases , these clergy would already be known in the neighborhoods in which they 're helping to diffuse that situation , ' assured Sandy Davis .
He serves as the director of the Caddo - Bossier Office of Homeland Security and Emergency Preparedness .
" For the clergy team , one of the biggest tools that they will have in helping calm the public down or to obey the law is the bible itself , specifically Romans 13 . "
Dear Reader , are you getting this ?
In order to convince American citizens to surrender their firearms to the government during a time of martial law , DHS is enlisting the assistance of America 's pastors .
According to the DHS , my job as a church pastor , is to tell my congregation that , according to Romans 13 , they must surrender their firearms when the government asks them to do so .
Of course , faithful readers of this column know that I have already addressed the Romans 13 question .
See http://www.chuckbaldwinlive.com/c2007/cbarchive_20070810.html
For those who are ignorant of Romans 13 , let me address the issue bluntly : According to Romans 13 , every citizen is only bound to obey his or her governing official to the degree that the governing official does not violate the duty of the citizen to obey the " higher powers " which , for Americans , are God and the U.S. Constitution .
In other words , no Christian can be ordered to disobey God , and no American citizen can be ordered to disobey the U.S. Constitution .
Properly understood , Romans 13 teaches that each and every governing official ( including the President of the United States and all those under him ) must submit to the U.S. Constitution .
Article .
VI .
Paragraph .
3 . of the U.S. Constitution states , " The Senators and Representatives before mentioned , and the Members of the several State Legislatures , and all executive and judicial Officers , both of the United States and of the several States , shall be bound by Oath or Affirmation , to support this Constitution . "
So , what does the Constitution say regarding the disarmament of American citizens ?
The Second Amendment of the U.S. Constitution could not be clearer : " A well regulated Militia , being necessary to the security of a free State , the right of the people to keep and bear Arms , shall not be infringed . "
Did you get that ?
" [ T ] he right of the people to keep and bear Arms , SHALL NOT BE INFRINGED . "
[ Emphasis added ]
Therefore , any attempt to disarm the American people must be viewed as an act of tyranny and must be resisted .
The right to keep and bear arms is rooted deep in American history .
I remind readers that it was the attempted gun confiscation of the colonists ' arms , which had been cached at Concord , Massachusetts , that directly precipitated the beginning of America 's fight for independence .
America 's founders were clear on this subject .
Our first President , George Washington , called our firearms " the people 's liberty teeth . "
Our third President and author of the Declaration of Independence , Thomas Jefferson , said , " No free man shall ever be de- barred the use of arms .
The strongest reason for the people to retain their right to keep and bear arms is as a last resort to protect themselves against tyranny in government . "
America 's founders spoke unanimously on the subject .
Patrick
Henry said , " The great object is that every man be armed .
Everyone who is able may have a gun . "
Samuel Adams said , " The said Constitution shall never be construed to authorize Congress to prevent the people of the United States who are peaceable citizens from keeping their own arms . "
And what did the Lord Jesus Christ tell His followers on this subject ?
Jesus said in Luke 11:21 , " When a strong man armed keepeth his palace , his goods are in peace . "
Did you see that ?
Jesus said that in order for a man 's goods to be " in peace " it was necessary that he be ARMED .
Now , I do n't know about you , but I will take the word of Jesus over the word of a DHS official anytime .
Furthermore , Jesus told his disciples in Luke 22:36 , " [ H ]e that hath no sword , let him sell his garment , and buy one . "
Upon hearing the words of Jesus , Simon Peter responded by saying , " Lord , behold , here are two swords . " ( vs. 38 ) That means at least two of Jesus ' disciples were armed with swords ( the 1st Century equivalent of a modern handgun , something used for personal protection ) , and Jesus did not rebuke them or ask them to surrender their swords .
He merely said , " It is enough . "
I realize that after Simon Peter used his sword to cut off the ear of the man as soldiers came to arrest Jesus in the Garden of Gethsemane , Jesus told him to " put up thy sword . "
But notice ,
He did not tell him to " give up " his sword ; he merely told him it was not time to use it , because it was in the plan and providence of God that Jesus be taken to Pilate , that He might be crucified for our sins .
Do n't tell me that the Bible teaches pacifism , because it does n't .
I am a Christian , and I am a pastor .
And I agree with Charlton Heston who said that they could have his guns " over my cold , dead hands . "
If DHS believes that I will ask my congregation to give up their firearms , they are grossly mistaken .
It also needs to be pointed out that , apparently , DHS must already be planning to declare martial law in the United States or else this kind of advanced strategy would not even be necessary .
Why would they already be asking pastors to be prepared to request their church members give up their guns if they did not intend to declare martial law ?
Now , what every single church - going Christian in America should immediately find out for themselves is , What does my pastor intend to do ?
Will he ask me to surrender my guns , or not ?
I highly encourage every reader who currently attends church to ask your pastor this question RIGHT NOW .
Of course , the next question Christians need to ask themselves is , What will I do if my pastor says he would ask me to surrender my guns to the government ?
I suggest that every church member in America settle this matter right now .
And if you discover that your pastor would indeed ask you to surrender your guns ( or equivocate by saying he would have to " pray about it " ) if asked to do so , you should immediately leave that church and find a pastor who believes the Bible and supports the U.S. Constitution .
Furthermore , if you do not currently own a firearm , you might want to heed the words of Jesus and go buy one .
So , once again , the burden of responsibility to help maintain America 's liberty rests upon the shoulders of the men in the pulpits .
Will we be preachers of truth or promoters of tyranny ?

It 's been a while since we 've seen some new browser action on Windows Mobile handsets .
But everything changed at the 2008 Mobile World Congress in Barcelona , as three separate vendors  Opera , Skyfire Labs , and Torch Mobile  showed off slick new browsers , while a fourth  ACCESS  did a technology demo of their own browser .
It 's been a while since we 've seen some new browser action on Windows Mobile handsets .
But everything changed at the 2008 Mobile World Congress in Barcelona , as three separate vendors  Opera , Skyfire Labs , and Torch Mobile  showed off slick new browsers , while a fourth  ACCESS  did a technology demo of their own browser .
Torch Mobile showed off its Iris browser , which works on Windows Mobile devices and a handful of other embedded platforms .
Billed as " small , fast , and user - friendly , " Iris is a WebKit - based browser designed to work on not just Windows Mobile , but other cell phones , set - top boxes , portable media players , and UMPCs .
Essentially , if you 're building an embedded device , Torch Mobile has a browser they want to sell you ( or at least start coding for you ) .
Iris supports HTML 4 , parts of HTML 5 , JavaScript , SSL , and CSS 2.x and 3.x , but not Flash .
It includes tabbed browsing and a zoom function all the rage in mobile browsers these days and works with both touch screen and non -touch screen units .
There 's also a mouse cursor , which is something that Research in Motion finally added to their built in BlackBerry browser ( the Pearl 8130 is the only handset to have it so far ) .
We installed a copy of Iris on a Sprint MOTO Q9c ( which runs Windows Mobile 6 Standard ) and were treated to a bare bones , flaky browsing experience .
We doubled the zoom and entered full screen mode , only to find no way out ; dropping to the home screen and re-entering the browser caused it to crash .
Interestingly , while it handed full - blown desktop sites just fine  our own Gearlog looked gorgeous in Iris , although scrolling was sluggish  it stumbled on WAP sites .
It could n't show any CNN.com pages properly , claiming a rendering error prevented it from displaying images on each one .
A visit to wap .usatoday.com also failed to render images , and rendered the page too wide .
So Iris still needs work .
At least the zoom function did its job ; unlike with Opera Mini or Symbian browsers , you just zoom in and zoom out right where you are ; there 's no box to move around first .
Meanwhile , ACCESS demoed NetFront Browser 3.5 for Windows Mobile Concept Version , a high - resolution browser for , strangely , older Windows Mobile 5.0 for Pocket PC devices like the Dell Axim x51v .
The new version includes vague usability improvements such as improved stylus accuracy , " first - draw time " and zooming speed , but it 's hard to get excited over something that does n't run on current smartphones .
( The company suspended general Windows Mobile development back with version 3.3 . )
The new NetFront and Torch Mobile browsers join Opera Mobile 9.5 , which product manager Bjarte Vosseteig showed us on the MWC show floor .
Opera Mobile 9.5 significantly pumps up the existing Opera Mobile 8.6 browser .
You can now zoom in and out of Web pages , looking at a zoomed - out overview to decide what part of the page you want to focus on .
Nokia 's and Apple 's mobile browsers already do this  not to mention Opera Mini 4.0 , Opera 's other handset browser  but not on Windows Mobile devices .
Opera 's UI is sleeker , with attractive , gray menus and a full - screen mode where the menus disappear completely .
If you click on an image in a Web page , you get various options to send or save the picture .
You can open multiple tabs for Web pages .
There 's a password manager and a better URL auto - complete function , so you have to type as little as possible .
You can save pages offline .
Most powerfully , though , Opera Mobile 9.5 supports
Web widgets , which are little applications developed in AJAX and HTML that display various chunks of information , like sports scores or weather .
Opera 's widgets are similar to Google 's , Yahoo's , Apple 's and Windows Vista 's on the desktop .
All desktop Opera widgets will now run using the Opera Mobile engine on Windows Mobile devices , though Vosseteig said developers will want to re-code their widgets to support phones ' smaller screens .
On the sample phone we saw , widgets were accessed using a separate icon - it did n't look like you were going into the browser .
Opera Mobile is still missing one major Web standard - Adobe Flash , which Skyfire supports ( see below ) .
Vosseteig said that Windows Mobile device manufacturers have been slow to port Flash Lite players to their devices , and that Opera could support them if they did .
Opera is also exploring licensing Flash themselves to include it directly in the browser , he said .
Opera Mobile 9.5 will be available later this year , with a price around $ 24 , Vosseteig said .
Finally , Skyfire Labs showed off Skyfire , which appears to live up to its billing as the most PC Web - like mobile browser .
It supports a wide range of rich media content including dynamic Flash 9 , AJAX , Java , audio , and streaming video including QuickTime  much of this one - ups even Safari on the iPhone .
The browser also supports zooming , full - screen view , and multiple page thumbnails .
The current version of Skyfire , in private beta , works on Windows Mobile handsets ( 5 and 6 , touch screen and non -touch screen ) at up to 320 - by - 320 pixel resolution .
The company claims to have a Symbian S60 version in the works as well .
Six senators to President Bush : Congress will have a say in post - war plans RAW STORY
Published : Thursday December 6 , 2007
del.icio.us
Print This Email This Six United States Senators have co-authored a letter to President Bush insisting that Congress is to be included in the decision - making process for a plan to maintain a post - war American presence in Iraq .
A copy of the letter , in PDF format , can be accessed HERE .
Text of the full letter follows below .
# Dear Mr. President :
We write you today regarding the  Declaration of Principles  agreed upon last week between the United States and Iraq outlining the broad scope of discussions to be held over the next six months to institutionalize long term U.S. - Iraqi cooperation in the political , economic , and security realms .
It is our understanding that these discussions seek to produce a strategic framework agreement , no later than July 31 , 2008 , to help define a long - term relationship of cooperation and friendship as two fully sovereign and independent states with common interests  .
The future of American policy towards Iraq , especially in regard to the issues of U.S. troop levels , permanent U.S. military bases , and future security commitments , has generated strong debate among the American people and their elected representatives .
Agreements between our two countries relating to these issues must involve the full participation and consent of the Congress as a co-equal branch of the U.S. government .
Furthermore , the future U.S. presence in Iraq is a central issue in the current Presidential campaign .
We believe a security commitment that obligates the United States to go to war on behalf of the Government of Iraq at this time is not in Americas long - term national security interest and does not reflect the will of the American people .
Commitments made during the final year of your Presidency should not unduly or artificially constrain your successor when it comes to Iraq .
In particular , we want to convey our strong concern regarding any commitments made by the United States with respect to American security assurances to Iraq to help deter and defend against foreign aggression or other violations of Iraqs territorial integrity .
Security assurances , once made , cannot be easily rolled back without incurring a great cost to Americas strategic credibility and imperiling the stability of our nations other alliances around the world .
Accordingly , security assurances must be extended with great care and only in the context of broad bipartisan agreement that such assurances serve our abiding national interest .
Such assurances , if legally binding , are generally made in the context of a formal treaty subject to the advice and consent of the U.S. Senate but in any case cannot be made without Congressional authorization .
Our unease is heightened by remarks made on November 26th by General Douglas Lute , the Assistant to the President for Iraq and Afghanistan , that Congressional input is not foreseen .
General Lute was quoted as asserting at a White House press briefing ,  We dont anticipate now that these negotiations will lead to the status of a formal treaty which would then bring us to formal negotiations or formal inputs from the Congress . 
It is unacceptable for your Administration to unilaterally fashion a long - term relationship with Iraq without the full and comprehensive participation of Congress from the very start of such negotiations .
We look forward to learning more details as the Administration commences negotiations with the Iraqi government on the contours of long - term political , economic , and security ties between our two nations .
We trust you agree that the proposed extension of long - term U.S. security commitments to a nation in a critical region of the world requires the full participation and consent of the Congress as a co-equal branch of our government .
Sincerely , Robert P. Casey , Jr. ( D - PA )
United States Senator Robert C. Byrd ( D - WV )
United States Senator Edward M. Kennedy ( D - MA )
United States Senator Jim Webb ( D - VA )
United States Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton ( D - NY )
United States Senator Carl Levin ( D - MI )

[ Liberal Fascism : The Secret History of the American Left from Mussolini to the Politics of Meaning .
By Jonah Goldberg .
Doubleday , 2007 . 487 pages . ]
Jonah Goldberg has ruined what could have been a valuable book .
Goldberg has in the past treated libertarians with disdain , but here he offers an analysis of fascism that libertarians will find familiar .
Goldberg has been influenced by John T. Flynn 's comparison of Franklin Roosevelt 's New Deal with Italian fascism ; and he cites Friedrich Hayek with respect .
He has learned from Murray Rothbard on the progressives as well .
( He at one point remarks , " if libertarianism could account for children and foreign policy , it would be the ideal political philosophy " [ p. 344 ] . )
Fascism is usually counted a movement of the Right ; but , as Goldberg notes , many leftists viewed Mussolini with sympathy .
( Here Goldberg follows the important work of John Patrick Diggins , Mussolini and Fascism : The View from America . )
H.G. Wells in a speech at Oxford in 1932 called for a " Liberal Fascism " ; and Rexford Tugwell , a leading member of Roosevelt 's Brain Trust , said in 1934 , " I find Italy doing many of the things which seem to me necessary … .
Mussolini certainly has the same people opposed to him as FDR has .
But he has the press controlled so that they cannot scream lies at him daily " ( p. 156 ) .
How is this possible ?
Leftists wish to reconstruct society along socialistic lines ; fascists glorify the nation and militarism .
How can leftists favor fascism ?
Goldberg readily resolves the difficulty .
Precisely by importing the war spirit into domestic affairs , leftists hope to reconstruct society .
In war , people unite to achieve victory ; in doing so , they sacrifice their personal ends to achieve the common goal .
The fascists took exactly the same view , and many leftists accordingly recognized the affinity .
The progressives were well aware that war would enable them to advance their ambitious social plans , and they advocated American entry into the First World War for this reason .
Herbert Croly , author of the vastly influential The Promise of American Life , " looked forward to many more wars because war was the midwife of progress … Croly 's New Republic was relentless in its push for war " ( pp. 99 , 107 ) .
The wartime regime of Woodrow Wilson fulfilled the hopes of the progressives .
War socialism under Wilson was an entirely progressive project , and long after the war it remained the liberal ideal … .
If we are to believe that " classic " fascism is first and foremost the elevation of martial values and the militarization of government and society under the banner of nationalism , it is very difficult to understand why the Progressive Era was not also the Fascist Era . ( p. 119 )
Goldberg appropriately calls attention to " the brilliant , bizarre , disfigured genius Randolph Bourne [ who ] seemed to understand precisely what was going on " ( p. 108 ) .
Given the Wilsonian precedent , the affinity of the New Deal with fascism is hardly surprising .
Just as the progressives had done under Wilson , the New Dealers demanded collective action by the government to cope with the economic emergency .
Indeed , many of the measures they supported reinstituted programs of Wilson 's wartime government .
In his discussion of the New Deal , Goldberg draws attention especially to the close parallel between the National Recovery Administration and Mussolini 's corporatism , a fact that was not lost on either the fascists or the New Dealers .
If Goldberg has elaborated and extended the standard libertarian view of fascism , does he not deserve praise ?
Why then do I claim that he has ruined his book ?
The fault , as I see it , lies not in various less defensible contentions about fascism that he advances .
He seems to me too ready to call any resort to " identity politics " fascist ; and while he criticizes the " compassionate conservatism " of George Bush , he turns a blind eye to the effects of Bush 's bellicose foreign policy on the domestic scene .
Goldberg himself supports the Iraq war ; when one is faced with a " good " war , apparently , the link between war and fascism no longer need be of concern .
However dubious Goldberg 's views on these issues , they are at least matters of opinion .
By contrast , he makes a large number of outright errors on historical matters .
He traces fascism to the philosophy of Rousseau , " who properly deserves to be called the father of modern fascism " ( p. 38 ) .
To see Rousseau as a precursor of totalitarianism is certainly a defensible position ; Jacob Talmon classically argued for this view in The Origins of Totalitarian Democracy .
But in his account of Rousseau , Goldberg makes an astonishing claim : " It followed , moreover , that if the people were the new God , there was no room for God Himself … .
Loyalty to the state and loyalty to the divine must be seen as the same thing " ( p. 39 ) .
Has Goldberg ever examined the " civil religion " of Rousseau , which he claims is enforced " by the all - powerful God-state " ( p. 40 ) ?
Rousseau gives the dogmas of the civil religion in Book IV of The Social Contract .
The first of these is the " existence of a mighty , intelligent , and beneficent Divinity , possessed of foresight and providence . "
Goldberg might also consult with profit the Profession of Faith of the Savoyard Vicar in the fourth book of Emile .
This defends the view that God can be known from the natural order ; it does not identify God and the state .
Goldberg does no better when he turns to the great classical liberal Lord Acton .
He tells us ,
Lord Acton 's famous observation that " power tends to corrupt and absolute power corrupts absolutely " has long been misunderstood .
Acton was not arguing that power causes powerful leaders to become corrupt ( though he probably believed that , too ) .
Rather , he was noting that historians tend to forgive the powerful for transgressions they would never condone by the weak .
( p. 84 )
Acton 's comments come in a letter to Bishop Mandell Creighton in April 1887 :
I cannot accept your canon that we are to judge Pope and King unlike other men , with a favorable presumption that they did no wrong .
If there is any presumption it is the other way against holders of power , increasing as the power increases … .
Power tends to corrupt and absolute power corrupts absolutely .
Acton , it is apparent , is saying what Goldberg says that he is n't : he is contending that the possession of power tends to cause leaders to be corrupt .
In a column on National Review Online for October 23 , 2002 , " Might vs. Right , " Goldberg himself quotes this passage and defends his odd interpretation of it .
Goldberg cannot understand a few simple sentences .
Are we to take Acton as saying that the spectacle of absolute power absolutely corrupts the historian who writes about it ?
Goldberg has not yet touched bottom .
The book includes a section , " The Nazi Cult of the Organic " that discusses such matters as vegetarianism , public health , and animal rights .
In it , this passage appears :
German historicism had pioneered the organic conception of society and state tied together .
The state , wrote Johann Droysen , is " the sum , the united organism , of all the moral partnerships , their common home and harbor , and so far their end . "
Nor were these ideas uniquely German .
Droysen was Herbert Baxter Adams 's mentor , and Adams was Woodrow Wilson's .
Droysen 's work is cited throughout Wilson 's writings .
The law that established our national park system was dubbed the " Organic Act " of 1916 . ( p. 385 )
Does Goldberg seriously think that the organic concept of the state , i.e. , the view that the state , like an organism , must be explained by how its parts function together for a common end , has anything to do with a " back to nature " movement ?
It is hardly surprising , by the way , that Wilson often cites Droysen .
He was one of the most famous German historians of the nineteenth century .
Our author does not neglect American philosophers .
He gives us a crude caricature of William James on the " will to believe " :
[ James ] pioneered the notion that all one needs is the " will to believe . "
It was James 's benign hope to make room for religion in a burgeoning age of science , by arguing that any religion that worked for the believer was not merely valid but " true . " ( p. 37 )
Goldberg has either never read James 's essay , " The Will to Believe , " or read it with the same interpretive skills he displayed in his remarks about Acton .
James argued that in a restricted number of cases , one has the right to believe something that goes beyond the evidence .
The evidence for the view one favors must be no worse than for views that contradict it ; and one must be in a situation where a choice cannot be avoided .
The options that one faces must be living , momentous , and forced .
Though James noted certain cases where believing something can result in its becoming true , e.g. , a patient whose belief that he will recover has beneficial effects that help to cure him , he did not advocate the strange position Goldberg here attributes to him .
( I do not think it worthwhile to inquire what Goldberg has in mind by the distinction between " valid " and " true . " )
We now come to my favorite passage :
In his infamous rectorial address , [ Martin ]
Heidegger looked forward to the time — hastened by Hitler 's efforts — " when the spiritual strength of the West fails and its joints crack , when the moribund semblance of culture caves in and drags all forces into confusion and lets them suffocate in madness . " ( pp. 174–75 )
How can I possibly accuse Goldberg of distortion ?
Has he done anything more than quote a passage from the rectorial address ?
Well , let 's have a look .
In " The Self - Assertion of the German University , " the address in question , Heidegger calls for teachers and students to will the essence of the German university : this essence is " the will to science as will to the historical spiritual mission of the German people as a people that knows itself in its state . "
( I cite from the same translation that Goldberg uses , which appears in Günther Neske and Emil Kettering , eds. , Martin Heidegger and National Socialism : Questions and Answers [ New York : Paragon House , 1990 ] , p. 6 . )
This will to science is to be achieved in large part by rethinking the beginnings of Greek philosophy .
It is up to us : " Do we , or do we not , will the essence of the German university ? " ( Neske , p. 13 ) .
Heidegger then says , " But no one will even ask us whether we do or do not will , when … " following which is the passage that Goldberg quotes ( Neske , p. 13 ) .
Goldberg has completely reversed what Heidegger is saying .
Heidegger does not look forward to the spiritual collapse of the West .
Rather , he warns that we may delay too long in our mission to will the essence of the university .
If our culture " caves in , " what we will is irrelevant .
Further , although Heidegger criticized the philosophical notion of " values , " he did not contend that " good and evil were childish notions " ( p. 174 ) .
Goldberg does not confine his howlers to intellectual history .
He refers in one place to " communist Jacobinism ( or Jacobin communism , if you prefer ) , which expropriated property and uprooted institutions in order to remake society from the ground up " ( p. 297 ) .
The Jacobins were not communists .
Although they abandoned the original laissez - faire tenets of the Jacobin Club for interventionism , they remained strong defenders of private property .
It goes on .
It is not true that in the notorious Tuskegee syphilis experiment , " poor black men were allegedly infected with syphilis without their knowledge " ( p. 261 ) .
Rather , men who already had syphilis were deceived into thinking that they were being treated for their illness .
Unity Mitford did not " have to leave the country , incensed that Britain would fight such a progressive leader as Hitler " ( p. 460 n. 15 ) .
At the time war was declared , she was in Germany .
She was so despondent that she shot herself in the head , but her suicide attempt failed .
She was then sent back to England , where she lived out the war as an invalid .
As all - too - often , Goldberg has things backwards .
I have saved the best for last .
He says that Napoleon 's " victories against the Austro - Hungarian Empire prompted the captive nations of the Hapsburgs to greet him as ' the great liberator . '
He beat back the authority of the Catholic Church , crowning himself Holy Roman Emperor … " ( p. 41 ) .
No , no , Mr. Goldberg .
Emperor Francis II , who had meanwhile become Emperor Francis I of Austria , dissolved the Holy Roman Empire in 1806 .
The Austro - Hungarian Empire did not come into existence until 1867 , although of course the Habsburgs ruled over both Austria and Hungary throughout the nineteenth century .
Goldberg does somewhat better in the index .
There is a listing for " Napoleon I , Emperor of France " ( p. 479 ) ; but this too is wrong .
Napoleon was Emperor of the French : the title is important because Napoleon claimed his power emanated from the French people .
He was not the successor to the French territorial kings , as the title Emperor of France would have suggested .
Although Liberal Fascism contains much important information , its many mistakes require that it be used with extreme caution .
Jonah Goldberg should acquire a more accurate knowledge of history before he presumes to instruct others .
cryptogon.com news – analysis – conspiracies
January 3rd , 2008
For years , I wanted to believe that Peak Oil could bring this horror show down .
My problem , of course , was that I could n’t ignore simple , observable realities and the fact that evil people have many plans up their sleeves .
Some of you view collapse due to Peak Oil as a given .
I understand that desire .
Unfortunately , it ’s just not going to go that way .
The people of the “ developed world ” are going to be handled in a manner similar to the way conventional Western medicine treats cancer patients .
We ’re going to be kept alive only to the extent that corporations can lift our wallets .
And somehow , guess what :
This system is going to limp on , creaking and grinding and murdering and polluting all the way into the grim dystopia of clean , green fascism .
Hell is going to be built right here .
Shell has the patents .
And their process works .
There ’s no conspiracy in the world of Peak Oil .
Corporations do n’t do things in secret or hold back on technology in that reality .
We ’re just running out of oil .
Malthus .
Scarcity .
Etc .
It ’s that simple for many Peaknics .
( Mention enough absurdities surrounding the energy scarcity arguments and they ’ll change the subject to topsoil .
I agree , Peak Soil is a much more compelling issue than Peak Oil . )
In the real world , outside the blatherphere , it ’s not that simple and after the energy corporations lift your wallet , they ’re going to flip you upside down and shake loose any spare change that might have remained in your pockets .
In addition to being closely monitored , tracked , traced and chipped , chances are , you ’ll exist in a state of near financial ruin .
You will , however , probably have enough money left over to pay an annual fart tax on your pets and children to whatever fascist nanny state you ’re unfortunate enough to suffer under …
Or else .
The rumors of what really happens to people who do n’t pay their fart taxes on time will be enough of an incentive to comply .
Note :
The oily foilheads will jump up and down , screaming , “ Natural gas .
Natural gas .
Shell uses natural gas in the process .
And water .
Die off !
Overshoot !!
DOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOM !!! ”
They ’re a twitchy lot , are n’t they ?
But the oily foilers can stick geothermal in their pipes and smoke it .
And , while the Peaknic religion does n’t allow it , they should check out Global Resource Corporation ’s tuned microwave process that extracts oil and natural gas from any hydrocarbon source ( stories : here and here ) .
Yes , they have an insitu version as well .
The psychopathic corporations even have nuclear power on the table for the tar sands !
Sure , why not ?
And it takes lots of water .
Rivers ?!
Who needs ’em ?
F-em .
F-em twice .
More oil .
The point is :
If you think that energy scarcity is going to hinder the recovery of oil from the alternative deposits , you are flat out shitting yourself .
It ’s too big a prize .
Energy will be the last thing to take down this horror show .
As for the much more serious top soil and water scarcity issues , that ’s nothing a bit of kill off ca n’t solve .
Seriously , DO NOT TAKE MY WORD FOR IT .
Read the Fortune article all the way through .
Note the money and decades of research .
Do you really think that the physicists doing this work just did n’t get the memo from the Peak Oil bloggers ?
Is Shell buying back its own shares because they think that things are going to get rough for them ?
No .
Companies buy back their own shares when they know they ’ve got something good .
If your company had a way of getting oil out of a stone for some fraction of the current market price per barrel , you ’d be buying back your own shares too .
My wishful thinking can only take me so far down the energy collapse fantasy .
Unfortunately , this horror show grinds on , whether we want it to , or not .
And those of us who survive the cull will all wish that Peak Oil could have done the job that we were afraid to do .
Via : CNN / Fortune :
The reason you probably have n’t heard about the Green River Formation is that most of the methods tried for turning oil shale into oil have been deeply flawed – economically , environmentally or usually both .
Because there have been so many false starts , oil shale tends to get lumped with cold fusion , zero - point energy , and other “ miracle ” fuels perpetually just over the horizon .
“ A lot of other companies have bent their spears trying to do what we ’re now doing , ” Vinegar says of his 28 - year quest to turn oil shale into a commercial energy source .
“ We ’re talking about the Holy Grail . ”
Unlike the Grail , though , Shell is convinced that oil shale is no myth and that after years of secret research , it is close to achieving this oil - based alchemy .
Shell is not alone in this assessment .
“ Harold has broken the code , ” says oil shale expert Anton Dammer , director of the U.S. Department of Energy ’s Office of Naval Petroleum and Oil Shale Reserves .
Vinegar has developed a cutting - edge technology that , according to Shell , will produce large quantities of high - quality oil without ravaging the local environment – and be profitable with prices around $ 30 a barrel .
Now that oil is approaching $ 90 , the odds on Shell ’s speculative bet are beginning to look awfully good .
Shell declines to get too specific about how much oil it thinks it can pump at peak production levels , but one DOE study contends that the region can sustain two million barrels a day by 2020 and three million by 2040 .
Other government estimates have posited an upper range of five million .
At that level , Western oil shale would rival the largest oilfields in the world .
Of course , considering the U.S. uses almost 21 million barrels a day and imports about ten million ( and rising ) , even the most optimistic projections do not get the country to the nirvana of “ energy independence . ”
What oil shale could do , though , is reduce the risk premium built into oil prices because energy traders could rest easy knowing that the flow of oil from Colorado or Utah wo n’t ever be cut off by Venezuelan dictators , Nigerian gunmen or strife in the Middle East .
In a broader sense , U.S. energy security lies in diversity of supply , so enhancing domestic sources is appealing .
Clinton is increasingly choosing the denial strategy .
Losing , Hillary style
McALLEN , Texas – Hillary Clinton has had a lot of experience dealing with setbacks in the last five days , losing two of her top campaign aides and eight consecutive contests to Barack Obama in their battle for the Democratic presidential nomination .
But she has n’t gotten any better at acknowledging defeats .

In speeches to supporters in Texas Tuesday night and Wednesday morning , she ignored Obama ’s convincing Tuesday wins in Virginia , Maryland and Washington , D.C .
Only in a press conference after a Wednesday morning rally in this dusty border town did Clinton acknowledge the results of the Potomac primary .
Even then , she said everything was going according to plan .
“ I want to congratulate Sen . Obama on his recent victories and tell him to meet me in Texas .
We ’re ready , ” she said , before brushing off questions about her apparent struggles by saying , “ that ’s what I always thought would happen .
So we are very well positioned to compete in these big states and that ’s what I intend to do .
This is a long journey to the nomination .
Some weeks one of us is up and the other is down , and then we reverse it . . .
It ’s a long and winding road . ”
Clinton also said she was n’t concerned that Obama on Tuesday cut into her base of Hispanics and white women , and she denied reports that her campaign is in turmoil .
“ From my perspective this is the exciting part of the campaign , ” she said .
Still , the unprompted recognition of Obama ’s success was rare for Clinton , who in her speeches neither congratulates Obama on his wins , nor acknowledges her losses , even if only to predict she ’d soon turn things around in her March 4 firewall states of Texas and Ohio .
And when directly confronted about defeats and stumbles , she normally makes it sound as if everything is going precisely to plan .
All campaigns spin setbacks .
But for Clinton , it ’s an especially tricky question – and one polls suggest she may have to answer again Tuesday when Hawaii and Wisconsin vote .
Should she gracefully concede defeats , as she did when she came in third in the Iowa caucuses ?
Or ignore losses for fear of drawing more attention to them and to her slide from the frontrunner status she held just two months ago ?
She ’s increasingly choosing the denial strategy .
And it was on full display Tuesday night at a rally in a basketball arena on the campus of the University of Texas at El Paso .
Unless they had listened to the news on the way to the event , the estimated 12,000 people who turned out would n’t have had a clue that , by the time Clinton took the stage , it was clear Obama was going to sweep the day ’s primaries .
In El Paso , where Clinton made a dramatic entrance into the darkened arena while supporters waved light sticks , she basically stuck to her standard stump speech , throwing in some local issues and shortening it a bit to get to a nearby fundraiser .
" I am so excited to be making this campaign , but I ca n’t do it without all of you .
I need you here in El Paso and across Texas to stand up for me , ” she said to thundering , prolonged applause .
“ Because if we stand up together , if we work together , if we fight together , we will take back America and we will make history together . ”
It almost had the feel of a victory speech , complete with confetti sprinkling the hall at the end .
Asked why Clinton did n’t take the opportunity to congratulate Obama , spokesman Doug Hattaway said there are too many contests bunched close together to discuss the results of each during speeches .
“ I do n’t know that there ’s any protocol at this stage , ” Hattaway said .
But on Jan. 3 , in a speech after Obama and John Edwards finished ahead of Clinton in that day ’s Iowa caucuses , she congratulated both men as well as the four candidates whom she beat .
“ I am so proud to have run with such exceptional candidates , ” she told supporters .
Likewise , when she beat Obama five days later in the New Hampshire primary , he congratulated her “ on a hard - fought victory here in New Hampshire .
She did an outstanding job .
Give her a big round of applause . ”
But by last Saturday , when Obama shut - out Clinton in Louisiana , Nebraska , Washington State and the Virgin Islands , the congratulatory rhetoric seemed like ancient history .
That evening , with exit polls showing Obama cruising to big wins , Clinton stuck to Democratic red meat in a speech to Virginia Democrats in Richmond .
She ripped President Bush and likely GOP nominee Sen. John McCain of Arizona and celebrated the historic significance of the Democratic contest being between a woman and a black man .
At a press conference two days later , she was confronted about the four Saturday losses – plus another in Maine on Sunday – combined with the resignation of her campaign manager and the news that she had loaned her campaign $ 5 million to help it through a cash flow crunch .
What do you say to folks who say your campaign does n’t look like a winner , a reporter asked .
“ Well , to the contrary , I think it exactly is .
We had a great night on Super Tuesday , ” she said of her split decision with Obama in the 22 states that voted Feb .
5 . “ I commend Senator Obama on his recent victories , but I believe if you look at the states that are upcoming , I am very confident . …
This is an ongoing contest and I feel very good about it . ”
After the El Paso speech , supporters who were aware of the results of the Chesapeake primary were divided over whether Clinton should have congratulated Obama .
“ I do n’t know that she ’s ignoring ( Obama ’s wins ) , ” said Richard Blancas , a 46 - year - old Clinton supporter on disability leave .
“ She knew what the votes were going to be .
She needs to go full force with ( the states ) she knows are her strengths . ”
But Kirstie Beard , an 18 - year old high school student , said she “ would have liked to hear ” Clinton congratulate Obama .
Maybe she forgot , Beard suggested .
“ She gets caught up in the moment . ”
I supported our original mission , which was humanitarian in nature and limited in scope .
I can no longer support a continued United States presence in Somalia because the nature of the mission is now unrealistic and because the scope of our mission is now limitless .
. . .
Mr. President , it is no small feat for a superpower to accept setback on the world stage , but a step backward is sometimes the wisest course .
I believe that withdrawal is now the more prudent option .
Mr. President , the mission is accomplished in Somalia .
The humanitarian aid has been delivered to those who were starving .
The mission is not nation building , which is what now is being foisted upon the American people .
The United States has no interest in the civil war in Somalia and as this young soldier told me , if the Somalis are now healthy enough to be fighting us , then it is absolutely time that we go home .
. .
It is time for the Senate of the United States to get on with the debate , to get on with the vote , and to get the American troops home .
I think it is clear to say from the meeting we had earlier with -- I do not know how many Members were there -- 45 , 50 Senators and half the House of Representatives , that the administration is going to be under great pressure to bring the actions in Somalia to a close .
. . .
All of which means that I support the able Senator from West Virginia - - who , by the way , was born in North Carolina -- Senator Robert C. Byrd , and others in efforts to bring an end to this tragic situation .
The United States did its best to deliver aid and assistance to the victims of chaos in Somalia as promised by George Bush last December .
But now we find ourselves involved there in a brutal war , in an urban environment , with the hands of our young soldiers tied behind their backs , under the command of a cumbersome U.N. bureaucracy , and fighting Somalia because we tried to extend helping hands to the starving people of that far - off land .
Mr. President , the United States has no constitutional authority , as I see it , to sacrifice U.S. soldiers to Boutros - Ghali 's vision of multilateral peacemaking .
Again , I share the view of Senator Byrd that the time to get out is now .
And make no mistake about it , if we were to leave Somalia tomorrow , other nations would leave , too .
Chaos would resume , the relief effort would stop and starvation soon would return .
That knowledge has led us to continue our mission .
. . .
If we leave them now , those embers will reignite into flames and people will die again .
If we stay a short while longer and do the right things , we 've got a reasonable chance of cooling off the embers and getting other firefighters to take our place .
. .
So , now , we face a choice .
Do we leave when the job gets tough or when the job is well done ?
Do we invite the return of mass suffering or do we leave in a way that gives the Somalis a decent chance to survive ?
Recently , Gen. Colin Powell said this about our choices in Somalia : " Because things get difficult , you do n't cut and run .
You work the problem and try to find a correct solution . " . . .
So let us finish the work we set out to do .
Let us demonstrate to the world , as generations of Americans have done before us , that when Americans take on a challenge , they do the job right .
But , Mr. President , I must say I have also been jarred by the reactions of many of our colleagues in the U.S. Senate and in the Congress .
I am jarred by the extraordinary sense of panic that seems to be rushing through this deliberative body , and by the strident cries for a quick exit , an immediate departure notwithstanding the fact that what we are doing in Somalia does not bear any resemblance to Grenada , to Panama , to Iraq , and most importantly , to Vietnam .
. . .
We must recognize that any decision that we make about Somalia is not just a decision to get our troops home .
It is not just a decision about looking out for the interests of the United States .
There are extraordinary ramifications attached to the choice that we make in the next days in the Congress and in this country .
. . .
Mr. President , we are in a situation now where withdrawal would send the wrong signal to Aidid and his supporters .
It would encourage other nations to withdraw from the U.N. effort in Somalia and no doubt would result in the total breakdown of the operation and possibly the resumption of the cycle of famine and war which brought the United States and other members of the international community to Somalia in the first place .
Rightly or wrongly , the Bush administration committed us to this operation .
We , as a nation , have accepted this responsibility .
We should not panic and flee when the going gets rough .
If we are going to withdraw , we have an obligation to do so in a responsible manner , in a way that does not undermine the operation or leave the Somali people to a worse fate .
I think the President 's plan , as currently outlined , will allow us to step aside responsibly .
As hundreds of additional United States troops with special weapons and aircraft began heading to Somalia , a wave of hostility toward the widening operation swept Congress .
. . .
But Mr. Aspin and Mr. Christopher were besieged by skeptical lawmakers , who scorched them with demands for a clear road map for an exit from Somalia , coupled with bitter complaints that the policy goals were unclear or unrealistic .
It is not clear whether the critics can assemble sufficient votes to pass a law requiring Mr. Clinton to stop the operation .
But Congressional anxiety , already high , has been fueled by a wave of constituents ' telephone calls reflecting outrage over the prospect of a new hostage crisis , and television pictures of Somali crowds dragging a dead American servicemen through the streets .
. . .
Mr. Christopher said the United States wanted to withdraw its forces when possible , " but not before our job is done of providing some security . "
A wave of hostility toward the military operation in Somalia swept Congress today , forcing the White House to send two Cabinet secretaries to Capitol Hill to try to calm critics and plead for additional time to formulate a new policy .
" It 's Vietnam all over again , " said Senator Ernest F. Hollings , Democrat of South Carolina , who is in a group of conservatives calling for quick withdrawal from Somalia .
. . .
Mr. McCain , a prisoner of war in the Vietnam War , said of Mohammed Farah Aidid , who has been blamed for attacks on United Nations peacekeepers : " We should tell Mr. Aidid that we want the Americans back .
Otherwise he will pay sooner or later .
Then we should come home . "
My post this morning on Salon concerns the accusation voiced this weekend by Chris Wallace in his Fox News interview with President Clinton ( a favorite accusation of neoconservatives ) that Clinton " emboldened " Al Qaeda when he withdrew American troops from Somalia as soon as we suffered casualties , which ( so the neoconservative mythology contends ) led Osama bin Laden to believe that we were weak and could be defeated .
President Clinton 's response was refreshingly aggressive because the premise of the question is so patently and outrageously false .
Clinton responded : " They were all trying to get me to withdraw from Somalia in 1993 the next day after we were involved in ' Black Hawk down , ' and I refused to do it and stayed six months and had an orderly transfer to the United Nations .
" As I document in the Salon post , that defense , if anything , is a profound understatement , because it was Clinton ( along with Senate Democrats like John Kerry ) who wanted to stay in Somalia because a precipitous withdrawal would be panicky and weak , but it was primarily conservatives in Congress -- mostly Republican Senators and some conservative Southern Democrats -- who were demanding that American troops be withdrawn immediately , and were even threatening to cut off all funds for our troop deployment .
My analysis is set forth in the Salon post .
Following are the full excerpts providing the factual support for that analysis :
As always , no matter how many times it occurs , it is truly disturbing how there seems to be no limit on the false propaganda and rank historical revisionism which can be disseminated by this administration and its followers and uncorrected by our national media .
My full analysis of this is here .
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - Consumer advocate Ralph Nader , blamed by many Democrats for their loss of the White House in the 2000 election , said on Sunday he is launching another independent campaign for the White House .

Nader , who will turn 74 this week , announced his longshot presidential bid on NBC ’s “ Meet the Press ” saying that neither the Democrats nor the Republicans were addressing problems facing Americans .
Nader called Washington “ corporate occupied territory ” that turns the government against the interests of the people .
“ In that context , I have decided to run for president , ” he said .
Democrats said they do not expect Nader , who also ran as an independent in 2004 , to have much of an impact .
“ When you get into running for your third or fourth time , I do n’t think people will pay that much attention to it , and I would n’t see it having any effect on the race , ” Virginia Democratic Gov. Tim Kaine said on “ Fox News Sunday . ”
In an interview with Reuters , Nader said he will push the candidates on a number of issues including health care and changing the tax system to shift the burden away from wage earners and put it on things like pollution , tobacco and “ Wall Street speculation ” and reduce taxes on wages .
Nader dismissed Democratic criticism of his latest bid for the White House .
“ For anybody who thinks that the third try is something that should be demeaned , it represents persistence , it represents never giving up the struggle for justice , ” Nader said .
“ The forces of injustice never take a holiday . ”
Nader ran for president in 2000 , when he got about 2.7 percent of the national vote as the Green Party candidate .
Many Democrats blamed Nader for draining votes from Democrat Al Gore and tipping the election in favor of Republican George W. Bush .
He also ran as an independent in 2004 , but got only a tiny fraction of the vote .
Nader said he expects to do better this time and will work to get his name on the ballot in all 50 states .
Republican presidential hopeful Mike Huckabee , appearing on CNN’s “ Late Edition , ” said he thought Nader could pull votes away from the Democratic nominee .
“ Naturally Republicans would welcome his entry into the race and hope that maybe a few more will join in , ” Huckabee said .
Democratic candidates Sen. Hillary Clinton and Sen. Barack Obama criticized the independent candidate .
“ That ’s really unfortunate .
I remember when he did this before , it did n’t turn out to well , for anyone , especially our country , ” she said .
“ I hope it ’s kind of a just a passing fancy that people wo n’t take too seriously . ”
Obama , Clinton ’s rival for the Democratic presidential nomination , was asked on Saturday about a Nader candidacy .
“ My sense is that Mr. Nader is somebody who , if you do n’t listen and adopt all of his policies , thinks you ’re not substantive , ” he said .

6 James Blunt
Who Is This Wuss ?
James
Blunt is the helium - voiced , Jagger - lipped balladeer who burst onto the scene in 2005 with your mom's favorite song , " You 're Beautiful . "
Once his career took off , Blunt could be found every time you turned on your fucking radio or television , including on such rawk - ready shows as Oprah and Sesame Street , where he sang a reworked version of " You 're Beautiful " called " Triangles . "
Jesus tapdancing Christ .

According to our friend Wikipedia , " You 're Beautiful " received massive airplay in the U.K. , which helped propel Blunt 's debut album , Back To Bedlam , to No. 1 on the U.K. albums chart .
This helped unseat Coldplay 's X&Y from the pole position , a fact we only mention because those last few words manage to make James Blunt and Coldplay sound even gayer .
In short , James Blunt is the kind of guy you 'd probably like to punch clean in the face .
If he walked into the room , the only thing stopping you would probably be a sense of pity , and possibly the fear of doing some sort of lasting damage to his delicate , child - like frame .

Why He Owns You :
Have you ever driven a tank ?
James Blunt has .
Before launching a career in leprechaun troubadourism , James Blunt served as a captain in the British Army .
Granted , it 's the British Army , but you can bet your ass that the training required to make captain involves learning several techniques that would see to it that he could whoop your ass six ways to Sunday before you land a single womanly slap .
To make matters worse ( for you ) , during the war in Kosovo Blunt was put in charge of leading 30,000 troops into the Kosovan capital .
So not only could he fuck you up proper , he 's the type of dude that people put in charge of ordering around tens of thousands of other men fully capable of doing the same .
It should go without saying he leaves a trail of vanquished supermodels in his wake wherever he goes .

Who You Are In Comparison :
If you were on the surface of Saturn , how long would a day last ?
This has remained a mystery for scientists , because the thick clouds of gas obscure the surface of the planet from direct observation by telescopes or orbiters .
Below all those clouds there is a surface that rotates at a constant speed .
Since scientists can’t directly see the surface , they ’ve taken another approach : listening .
You can also check out these cool telescopes that will help you see the beauty of planet Saturn .
With the help of radio emissions that come from the interior of Saturn , scientists have been able to close in on its rotation period .
Charged particles trapped in the interior emit radio waves when they interact with Saturn ’s magnetic field , at about 100 Kilohertz .
It ’s as if Saturn had its own radio station broadcasting at a certain frequency , and as the magnetic field deep inside the planet rotates it changes the frequency of the station .
Voyager measured these emissions for nine months when it passed by in the 1980s , and the rotation was calculated to be 10 hours 39 minutes 24 seconds , with an uncertainty of 7 seconds .
The Ulysses spacecraft also monitored the emissions 15 years later , and came up with a result of 10 hours 45 minutes 45 seconds , with a 36 second margin of error .
Wait , that ’s 6 minutes of difference !
Either Saturn slowed down a lot over the years , or something else is going on .
Cassini has been measuring these same radio emissions with its Radio and Plasma Wave Science instrument , and has observed that in addition to this long - period variation , the rotation differs by as much as one percent in a week .
Scientists think that this could be due to two different things : the solar wind coming from the Sun is interfering with the measurements , or particles from Enceladus ’ geysers are affecting the magnetic field .
Both of these would cause the radio emissions to vary , and they could be causing the different results simultaneously .
Cassini ’s new data strongly suggests that the solar wind is a likely culprit : there is a variation in the measurements of the short - period rotation every 25 days , which corresponds with the rotation of the Sun as seen from Saturn .
The speed of the solar wind , too , varies the measurements , so must be accounted for .
Enceladus could be the cause of the long - term difference , but more measurements are needed to see if this is definitely the case , or if there is yet another factor .
Nailing down the rotation of Saturn will be helpful in calculating the true wind speeds of the clouds , and give important clues about the composition and distribution of the interior .
Once the interference from the solar wind and Enceladus are taken into account , the true rotation of Saturn can be determined precisely .
Then only one question remains : do they have commercials on Saturn FM ?

Crops such as oilseed rape have been engineered to produce fish oil
Experiments have proved that crops containing genes from marine organisms are able to produce omega 3 fatty acids normally found in oily fish .
Adding the oil to animal feed would create omega 3 - rich meat , milk and eggs .
Researchers from the EU - wide Lipgene project say such food would help tackle public health issues like obesity .
' Good ' fats
Concerns over dwindling fish stocks and marine pollution has led researchers to seek an alternative source of long chain omega 3 fatty acids ; fats that have important health benefits , especially for the heart .
The best source is oily fish , such as salmon , mackerel and herring , but most people do not get enough in their diet .
Most people do n't eat enough oily fish
Omega 3 fatty acids are made not by the fish themselves but by the marine microbes they consume .
Scientists at Rothamsted Research in Harpenden , Herts , isolated key genes from a species of microscopic single - celled marine algae known as Thalassiosira pseudonana .
They inserted the genes into crops such as linseed and oil seed rape and found that the plants were able to synthesise omega 3 fatty acids in their seed oils .
" We know that this works , we 've done proof of concept studies in model plants and also in crop plants and we can see the accumulation of some of the fish oils we 're interested in , " said research group leader Professor Johnathan Napier .
" We 're still at the stage where we'd want to optimise and improve the levels that we see so I think we 're probably three or four years away from the point where we have something ready for regulatory approval for some sort of limited field release , " he added .
The eventual aim is to feed GM - enhanced oils to animals such as chickens and cattle , to produce omega 3 enriched meat , milk and eggs .
This would provide a sustainable source of fish oil amid concern over dwindling fish stocks .
" The big problem is that fish ( and fish oils ) is a very seriously diminishing natural resource , " said Professor Napier .
" There are big problems with the sustainability of natural fish stocks and there are also concerns about pollution of the marine environment so we 're interested in trying to produce a sustainable alternative source with these fish oils . "
Consumer issues
Professor Ian Givens from the Nutritional Sciences Research Unit at the University of Reading said he believed that consumers would see the benefit of such foods , despite the fact they come from transgenic crops .
There is concern over dwindling fish stocks
" There has been a lot of concern and resistance about the whole GM technology in the food chain , " he said .
" Things move on .
When people are able to see more clearly what the benefits to them are from these sorts of approaches , rather than the benefits to others , I suspect that mindsets will change but it will take time . "
New figures released by Lipgene show that only 30 % of the UK population is consuming the recommended 450 mg / day intake of omega - 3 fatty acids .
Teenagers , especially males , and low income groups eat the least of all , said Professor Givens .
The Food Standards Agency ( FSA ) recommends that everyone should eat two portions of fish a week , including one portion of oily fish .
But because fish can contain pollutants such as dioxins and PCBs , there are limits to the amount that should be consumed , particularly for women who are pregnant and breast feeding .
An FSA spokesperson said an expert committee reviewed the evidence on the relationship between long chain omega 3 fatty acids and cardiovascular disease in 2004 .
" Two portions of fish per week , one white and one oily , provides the amount of long chain omega 3 fatty acids that can help prevent heart disease , " said the spokesperson .
" The Agency recommends that it is better to eat fish , especially oily fish , rather than fish oil supplements or fish oil fortified foods because as well as being rich in long chain omega 3 fatty acids , fish also contains essential vitamins and minerals and is a good source of protein . "

Morning , citizen !
The grandly titled Julian Le Grand , chairman of a ministerial advisory board called Health England , has a humdinger of an idea for you : smoking permits .
He proposes a ban on the sale of tobacco to anyone who can't flash a licence at the cashier .
Good news for smokers : Le Grand reckons said licence should cost only £ 10 .
Bad news : he wants to make the application process as deliberately complex as possible .
You 'd have to fill out a lengthy form , attaching a photograph , proof of age and a fee , and send it all to a central Smoker 's Permit processing centre and wait for your licence to come back , by which point , let 's face it , you would have probably died .
Oh , and the licence expires after a year , so you have to apply all over again each time it runs out .
Why leave it there ?
Why not make it expire every 24 hours , so you have to reapply each morning ?
Or include a Sudoku on the application form ?
Or force the tobacco companies to sell cigarettes inside complicated Japanese puzzle boxes ?
Or change the name of the brands each week , without publicising the change , while simultaneously making it illegal for a shop to sell you anything you have n't asked for by name , so you have to stand at the counter fishing for codewords for an hour ?
Or here 's a good one , Julian : make it a requirement for smokers to walk around with a broomhandle stuck through their sleeves , running behind the neck , so their arms are permanently splayed out , like a scarecrow's .
To spark up under those conditions , they'd have to work together in pairs , flailing around in the outdoor smoking area like something out of It 's a Knockout .
His paper , incidentally , also proposes " incentives for large companies to provide a daily ' exercise hour ' for staff " .
Welcome to your future life : having struggled into work suffering withdrawal pangs because today 's smoking licence did n't arrive in the post , you 're forced to spend 60 minutes doing squat - thrusts in the car park .
And each time you start crying , a man in a helmet comes round to gently remind you that it 's all for your own good .
Through a loudhailer .
If that sounds like a nightmare , do n't worry : you can still wriggle out of the squat - thrusts , provided you 're carrying a valid Laziness Licence , whose application process involves climbing a ladder to reach the forms ( stored at the top of a 200 ft crane ) , ticking 900 boxes with a 7kg pencil , and finally posting it into a motorised mailbox that persistently runs away from you at speeds of up to 25 mph .
In other words , you still have freedom of choice .
Provided you 're carrying a valid Freedom of Choice Permit , that is .
Getting your hands on a Freedom of Choice Permit is pretty straightforward .
The application form requires only your name and signature .
Admittedly , you have to deliver it in person to the Freedom of Choice Licensing Agency , which is open only between 4.15 am and 4.18 am , and is based in an unmarked office in the Falklands , but nevertheless , thousands have already applied , if the queues are anything to go by .
The current waiting time is a mere nine weeks , although you'd be advised to get there early and guard your place in line because there have been reports of disturbances .
Anyway , once you 've got your Freedom of Choice Permit , you 're free to do as you please , within reason , provided you notify the Central Scrutiniser six days in advance of any unapproved activity , quoting your 96 - digit Freedom of Choice Permit code in full , which is n't printed anywhere on the permit itself , but is given to you once and only once , whispered quickly into your ear at the desk in the Falklands , by a man standing beneath a loudspeaker barking out other numbers at random .
The permit itself , incidentally , is shaped like a broomhandle , and is designed to be threaded through your sleeves at all times .
If you could n't be bothered with all that , you will just have to do as you 're told , which is n't that bad , to be honest .
There 's a compulsory exercise hour or five , and an approved list of foodstuffs , but that 's about it .
You will still have at least 10 minutes a day to do as you please , although we 've just banned violent videogames , which are bad for your head , and there are one or two ideologies we 'd rather you did n't discuss with friends or on the internet , which is why we 're not issuing any Freedom of Speech Permits for the time being - although if you 'd like to be notified when they 're available , simply book yourself into one of our underground holding pens and remain there until your name is called , or not called , or time itself comes to an end .
Whichever takes the longest .
Once upon a time , in between scrawling allegorical fables about lions and wardrobes , CS Lewis said something prescient .
" Of all tyrannies , " he wrote , " a tyranny sincerely exercised for the good of its victims may be the most oppressive .

New pictures expose the gory reality of Japan 's so - called " scientific " whale hunt in the Southern Ocean , with a slaughtered adult minke whale and calf being hauled on board a Japanese factory ship .
The release of the photos marks a significant shift in whaling politics , for they were taken not by the environmental activists who spent much of January harassing the whalers on their Antarctic hunt but by officials working for the Australian government .
They were put into the public domain by the eco-friendly administration of the new Labor premier , Kevin Rudd , accompanied by withering comments from Australian ministers .

For a government to become so strongly involved raises the stakes considerably in a dispute in which most of the international community is ranged against Japan .
It provoked anger in Tokyo and a warning to Australia from a Japanese official that this was " dangerous emotional propaganda that could cause serious damage to the relationship between our two countries " .
But there was as much , if not more fury , at the pictures in Australia .
Peter Garrett , the Environment Minister , and a former member of the rock group Midnight Oil , said : " It is explicitly clear from these images that this is the indiscriminate killing of whales , where you have a whale and its calf killed in this way . "
He said he felt " sick and sad " looking at them and added : " To claim that this is in any way scientific is to continue the charade that has surrounded this issue from day one . "
The images include footage of a harpoon being shot into a whale , which is then hauled on to the ship .
One photo shows two whales – one far smaller than the other – being dragged by ropes up a ramp .
The row comes as the Humane Society International urges the Australian government to launch a case against Japanese whalers in the International Tribunal of the Law of the Sea .
Japan has defied the international moratorium on commercial whaling which has been in place since 1986 by claiming that its whale hunts are carried out for scientific purposes .
This season it is seeking to kill up to 935 minke whales and 50 larger fin whales .
Last month activists from two anti-whaling groups , Greenpeace and the Sea Shepherd Conservation Society , spent weeks trying to disrupt the hunt with their vessels Esperanza and Steve Irwin .
Many of their pictures were flashed around the world .
But perhaps of more long - term significance was the fact that this time Australia sent a fisheries and customs patrol ship , Oceanic Viking to the Southern Ocean to gather photographic and video evidence about Japan 's hunt , for use in a possible legal challenge .
The resulting pictures caused a strong reaction in Tokyo yesterday .
Hideki Moronuki , chief of the Japanese Fishing Agency 's whaling section , denied that the photograph depicted a baby whale , and accused Australian officials of coming dangerously close to the whaling ships to take the images .
" The fleet is engaged in random sampling , which means they are taking both large and small whales , " he said .
" This is not a parent and calf . "
After Wednesday 's congressional hearing where Roger Clemens and Andy Pettitte seemed at odds over the Rocket 's alleged steroid use , Yankees catcher Jorge Posada supports Clemens without casting aside his current New York teammate .
Posada , who said he did n't watch any of the hearing that included former Clemens and Pettitte trainer Brian McNamee , thinks Clemens is being honest about not taking steroids or HGH .
" He sounded real truthful the other day and that 's all I wanted to hear , " Posada told reporters Friday at the Yankees spring training complex .
" I believe Roger .
That 's the guy I believe . "
Posada went on to discuss the crucial conversation where Pettitte claims Clemens said he used steroids .
" It 's been so long ago that they talked about it , so I do n't know , " Posada told reporters .
" Andy said that they talked about it , and right now , I do n't know much about it .
It 's going to keep going on .
Rocket said it was a miscommunication or whatever , and I believe Rocket . "

We posted a video of Senator John McCain saying he'd be ok with the U.S. being in Iraq for 100 years , and during his appearance on Meet The Press this morning , McCain stood by that statement and was absolutely giddy about President Bush 's surge .
As long as Americans are n't being wounded or killed , and it's the Iraqis who are fighting and dying , McCain believes that Americans are just fine with the United States having permanent bases there , and keeping a large military presence all over the world .
He also points out that the Saudis did n't want our base in their country , but it 's worth noting that Bin Laden was angered by our presence there as well -- but according to the Republicans in last night 's debate , terrorism has nothing to do with American foreign policy .
McCain : " It 's not American presence that bothers the American people , it 's American casualties , and if Americans are safe wherever they are in the world , American people do n't mind that .
So , what I believe we can achieve is a reduction in casualties to the point where the Iraqis are doing the fighting and dying , we 're supporting them , and over time then there will be the relation between the two countries . "
Is n't that what 's been happening for the past four years ?

Modern thieves looking for a serious payoff are skipping the obvious old staples and crawling underneath your car in search of the real prize : the catalytic converter .
Standard issue on cars in this country since the mid-1970s , catalytic converters use a small amount of platinum to convert harmful engine emissions , including nitrogen oxides and carbon monoxide , into less harmful ones , like nitrogen and carbon dioxide .
Considering that platinum has , in recent weeks , made an understatement of its status as a precious metal by touching $ 2075 an ounce , and considering each catalytic converter contains between three and seven grams of the stuff , that little metal box under your car just became a whole lot more interesting to certain folks .
This recent price spike is largely the result of fears of mine closures due to power cutbacks in South Africa , which controls some 80 percent of the world 's platinum output , but it 's hardly platinum alone that is seeing record prices .
Palladium and rhodium , also used as catalysts , are running about $ 445 and $ 7300 an ounce , respectively .
So what 's the answer ?
An Ohio company 's medieval - esque CatClamp is a ground - level tool to thwart thieves ( who often get $ 200 or more for each stolen catalyst ) , but a lasting solution will have to come from the source .
The world 's automakers , which collectively spend more than $ 2 billion a year on platinum , are striving to find ways to curb their need .
Mazda , for instance , has devised a catalytic converter that uses nano - particles of precious metals instead of larger particles to reduce the amount of such elements by 70 to 90 percent .

Alexander Litvinenko began his patriotic career volunteering for the Red Army straight out of school in 1979 .
By the time the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991 , the KGB had plucked him from the ranks and set him to work as an operative detective .
He was 29 .
Litvinenko first served in counterterrorism in the mid-90s , then began infiltrating the criminal gangs that flourished in the chaos of the new Russia .
Litvinenko , according to former colleagues and commanders , was a workaday spy .
His modus operandi was to stride into a scenario , bang heads together and wait for the fallout .
He hoovered up everything that came his way , leaving analysts to sort the truth from the lies .
He was , like many agents in Kontora - or " the company " , as they called the KGB and its successor , the FSB - secretive , solitary and vain .
Litvinenko was expected to be capable of violence in his job , but Marina , who had married him in 1994 , despite her fears about the secret services , told us the Sasha she knew was gentle , straightforward and passionate .
Those who served with Colonel Litvinenko also recall that he was naive - a flaw in his line of work .
For him , there was only right and wrong .
" He was like a salmon swimming upstream , " one former FSB general told us , citing how Litvinenko , against his advice , investigated links between crime clans and what Russians had come to know as the siloviki - a group of strongmen within the Kremlin whose core members came from St Petersburg with a background in the intelligence services .
Their mentor was Vladimir Putin , a former KGB agent who became head of the FSB in 1998 and president the following year .
Litvinenko was quickly smacked down for his intrusion .
He was transferred to a highly secretive FSB unit that carried out hits on criminals and terrorists .
Litvinenko was incensed when he learned that his first target was to be Boris Berezovsky , one of the country 's oligarchs who had taken an outspoken stand against the siloviki
In November 1998 , Litvinenko staged a press conference in Moscow , in which he exposed the Berezovsky plot , fuelling a firestorm in the Russian parliament .
Within days he was under investigation .
Within weeks he found himself in prison .
His allies contrived his release in December 1999 , but by the summer of 2000 they were urging him to flee or face a lifetime in a political gulag .
Berezovsky had already installed himself in London and was busy sponsoring every enemy of Putin who crossed his path .
He owed a debt of gratitude to Litvinenko and , in November 2000 , he arranged for him , Marina and their son , Anatoly , to escape from Russia , sending Alex Goldfarb , a Russian émigré and pro-democracy campaigner , to escort the family to London .
Litvinenko assumed he would be feted in the west .
He looked to the experiences of other leading exiles , including Oleg Gordievsky , the far more senior former KGB London station chief and an old friend , who had been embraced by the British authorities when he defected in 1985 .
However , Litvinenko was no Gordievsky , and by the time he fled , America and Britain were awash with former KGB agents .
He tried to punt his knowledge to private security companies - about crime bosses in Moscow , about who was bent in Russian politics .
No one was interested .
Instead , he was kept afloat by Berezovsky , who set him up in a house in the north London suburb of Muswell Hill , paid his son's school fees and gave Litvinenko a stipend of £ 4,000 a month .
In exile , Litvinenko carried on relentlessly truffling for dirt on Putin , but having to live on handouts from Berezovsky niggled at his pride .
While his wife , Marina , embraced her new life in the UK , re-establishing a career as a dance teacher and learning English , Litvinenko , who spoke hardly any , hankered after independence .
He needed other sources of income and new outlets for his investigative skills - he found them in Italy and they may have led to his murder .
When Litvinenko was poisoned with polonium , a rare and deadly nuclear isotope , as he sat sipping tea at a London hotel in November 2006 , the finger of suspicion pointed to the Kremlin .
In a deathbed statement , Litvinenko blamed Putin , and the trail of radiation from the polonium - leading across London and all the way to Russia - quickly convinced detectives from Scotland Yard 's anti-terrorism squad that the culprit was a former FSB officer , Andrei Lugovoi .
The crime was fixed in the west 's collective imagination as a Putin plot to snuff out a brave dissident , a whistleblower who had stood up to the dark forces emanating from the Kremlin .
But this was a theory , implicating the highest levels of the Russian government , that the British government did not want to pursue .
Simply seeking to extradite the prime suspect - Lugovoi - has thrown London into a furious row with Moscow , resulting in tit - for - tat expulsions of diplomats , restrictions on visas for Russian officials and attempts by Russia to close down two British Council offices .
Wary of Russia withdrawing its patronage from Britain altogether - a considerable blow to the City , where Russian deposits amount to £ 50bn - the British government has been reluctant to take anything other than the narrowest view of the case .
An inquest might delve deeper for evidence , but there seems little prospect of that at the moment .
Although Scotland Yard says its investigation was completed last May , with the director of public prosecutions recommending that Lugovoi be extradited and charged , the St Pancras coroner 's office , which covers University College Hospital where Litvinenko died , told us that no inquest could be held since - in their view - the police investigation remains open .
So large chunks of evidence about Litvinenko 's activities remain unexplored .
Goldfarb told us : " It could hang like this for years .
Marina is very frustrated . "
If Scotland Yard have been restricted in their investigations , the Italian security services have no such inhibition - and felt able to show us the results of their inquiries .
They were watching Litvinenko long before he came under scrutiny in London , and gathered a vast dossier of material on him , including phone tap transcripts , affidavits , photographs and emails , court depositions and police interrogations ; it charts how , driven by money worries , Litvinenko had been secretly cultivating a new project in Italy .
It began in December 2003 when Litvinenko had a call from Mario Scaramella , 34 , a silver - tongued opportunist from a wealthy Neapolitan family who was seeking his help .
Scaramella was the last person to have a meal with Litvinenko , at the Itsu restaurant in Piccadilly on November 1 2006 , a few hours before the former spy was poisoned .
In 2003 , Scaramella was working for a government body , known as the Mitrokhin Commission , that had been formed two years earlier by prime minister Silvio Berlusconi ostensibly to discover if senior figures in the Italian establishment had been in the pay of the KGB - in reality a vehicle for smearing Berlusconi 's socialist enemies .
Litvinenko knew this from the start but still jumped at the chance .
The commission was a meal ticket and would enable him to see more of his brother , Maxim , who had fled Russia before him and was living in Senigallia , a small Italian port on the Adriatic coast .
Litvinenko's only concern was about the value of the information he had to bring to the table .
In the FSB , he'd had no connection with the foreign wing and no knowledge of its network of recruits in abroad , the people who were to be the focus of the commission .
To back him up , he took along a new contact he had made through the Berezovsky circle , Evgeni Limarev , also a Russian exile , who lived in France and was the son of a high - ranking KGB officer .
The Italian files reveal how Scaramella and Litvinenko worked hand - in - glove for three years as the prime movers in the commission that would publicly smear Italy 's leftwing statesmen .
Any evidence would do , both fact and fiction .
When that failed to gain traction , Litvinenko began dredging Italy 's underworld , which had links with the Russian and Ukrainian criminal clans , which in turn had powerful connections in the Kremlin .
Through them , Litvinenko and Scaramella hoped to find new evidence of the links between the Italian left and the KGB .
They were making dangerous enemies .
Litvinenko had no compunction in recalling a piece of gossip he had been told by a former KGB deputy director as he fled Russia .
In 2000 , General Anatoly Trofimov had warned Litvinenko not to go to Rome since " Prodi is our man in Italy " .
He was referring to Romano Prodi , the former Italian prime minister who went on to become president of the European Commission .
Now Litvinenko regurgitated the unfounded claim to Scaramella who persuaded him to write it down .
It may have been no more than KGB tittle - tattle , but written in Russian by a former KGB colonel , it became evidence - exactly what Berlusconi needed at a time when Prodi was gearing up for a return to Italian politics .
By the summer of 2004 , Limarev and Litvineko were flying to Naples or Rome on a monthly basis , touted around town by Scaramella as his " KGB colonels " .
Limarev , who today lives in the French Alps and continues to work as a security consultant , told us , " Each day Mario [ Scaramella ] would come to the hotel with a procession of SUVs .
When he passed , everyone bowed to him .
We would whirl around parties and official functions , shaking hands . "
Besides Prodi , potential targets on their list included former communist prime minister Massimo D'Alema ; Alfonso Pecoraro Scanio , Green party leader ; the then head of intelligence ; a couple of judges ; two reporters from La Repubblica ; a dozen politicians and officials connected to Italian military intelligence ; and a clutch of former defence ministers .
Others outside Italy had become interested in their work , too .
The Bush administration and the Berlusconi government were close allies over Iraq and the war on terror ; the last thing Washington wanted was the left to regain power in Italy after the elections of 2006 .
Litvinenko , Limarev and Scaramella were introduced to Robert Seldon Lady , a political officer at the US consulate in Milan - an undercover CIA agent .
When Lady got into trouble in Italy , it was Litvinenko and the Mitrokhin Commission who tried to dig him out .
In 2004 , the Italian authorities issued an arrest warrant for Lady , accusing him of " rendering " an imam to Egypt , where he was tortured as a terror suspect .
Lady went into hiding , and the Mitrokhin Commission began investigating allegations that the prosecutor in the Lady case , Armando Spataro , had secret links to the KGB .
In a similar tactic , two Italian journalists who reported that the CIA 's Rome station chief had been complicit in creating the story about Saddam Hussein buying uranium from Niger , were branded FSB dupes by the Mitrokhin Commission .
A consultant on the commission , Gianni Paolo Pelizzaro , recalls : " Scaramella and his KGB colonels did a lot of things using the name of the commission they should not have . "
Limarev says it was around then that he backed away from involvement with the other two .
Meanwhile , Litvinenko's trips to Italy grew more frequent .
" With his consent , Berezovsky had cut back his stipend and he was preparing to go it alone , " Goldfarb says .
" I asked him what he was up to and [ Litvinenko ] said , ' I am consulting .
I have business projects . '
We had no idea what he was doing in Italy . "
Marina , who had always stayed out of her husband 's work , says she did not even ask him which country he was going to during his frequent trips abroad .
According to Pelizzaro , Litvinenko " was giving Scaramella lots of information about Russian and criminal infiltrations in Italy , but most of it was very difficult to verify and crosscheck .
It was a little bit out on a limb . "
In the old days , Litvinenko had been familiar with criminal clans in Russsia , now he was making risky approaches to the Italian mafia .
Scaramella believed if they could get inside this network , they would be able to leverage much more damaging intelligence about Italian politicians .
They spread their net wider .
The Litvinenko dossier lists a dizzying roll call of names investigated by the pair , among them Semion Mogilevich , the darkest figure in Russian organised crime - a notorious Ukrainian whose network extended from Kiev to Naples .
Mogilevich , a striking man at barely 5ft 6in and more than 20 stone , has a portfolio that includes private banks , financing the sale of enriched uranium and laundering his money through companies listed on the New York stock exchange .
He was already on the FBI 's wanted list but , according to Litvinenko 's sources , had extensive links to Putin 's government .
Taking on Mogilevich , who runs a private army of brutal killers , was a huge risk for a civilian outfit such as the Mitrokhin Commission , and Litvinenko soon picked up word that he was enraging the Ukrainian 's siloviki friends in Moscow .
In autumn 2005 , he made a tape recording in London , expressing his concern : " I gave a lot of information about Mogilevich to Scaramella .
Now I know Russian special services are very afraid that this commission will uncover information about its agents in Italy .
The Russian embassy asked for my brother to be extradited so he could be prosecuted back in Russia .
It is blackmail against me to stop me working with Scaramella . "
But Litvinenko would not back off .
In October 2005 , he claimed to have uncovered an FSB agent hiding in Naples , a man he believed had been in deep cover since 1999 .
This FSB agent was Ukrainian by birth and , according to Litvinenko , he had strong links to Mogilevich 's mob .
His name was Alexander Talik , he was born in 1970 and , according to the Italian dossier and to depositions read out in a subsequent Italian court hearing , had served with the Red Army before being recruited by the FSB , where he rose to the rank of captain .
Talik , at the same hearing , would admit to having served in the FSB until 1977 , but denied everything else .
He said Scaramella had tried to strong - arm him into providing information to the commission on Mogilevich and Ukrainian criminals based in Italy .
When he refused , the court heard , Litvinenko and Scaramella resorted to fabrication : they tried to frame Talik as part of a criminal conspiracy , hoping this would persuade him to cooperate .
In accordance with their alleged plan , Litvinenko sent Scaramella a fax in October 2005 warning him of a Russian security services operation to kill Litvinenko 's brother , Maxim , Scaramella and a political associate of Berlusconi's .
The detail of the plot was bizarre : a white transit van with Ukrainian numberplates , apparently en route from Kiev to Naples , was carrying a consignment of grenades , hidden inside hollowed - out bibles , to be used to mount attacks on the three men .
The alleged recipient and hit man was Talik .
Litvinenko and his brother reported the threat to the local police in Senigallia .
Scaramella reported the plot to the police in Rome .
A police patrol in Abruzzo did indeed discover two white vans with Ukrainian numberplates and a concealed shipment of grenades .
Six Ukrainians were arrested and charged with smuggling arms .
At Litvinenko's suggestion , Scaramella also gave police the name of the FSB officer in Moscow who they said was managing Talik .
Still nothing happened .
Police in fact had their doubts about Scaramella - the details he provided about the vans ' progress seemed just too precise .
In November , Litvinenko took matters into his own hands and " revealed " the entire plot to the Ukrainian media , including Talik 's name .
The Italian authorities , by now suspicious of the Mitrokhin Commission , Scaramella and Litvinenko , had begun recording their phone calls .
One tap caught Litvinenko crowing to Scaramella , " All the Ukrainian newspapers have published and all the Ukrainian citizens know about Talik and the plot .
I also indicated that Talik has been arrested . "
In fact , Talik had not been arrested , and evidence presented at a later court hearing suggested he was in a mood for revenge .
A phone tap , played to Talik in court , captures his reaction .
" Complete bullshit has been written about me , " he complains .
" Litvinenko has blamed me for organising arms shipments from the Ukraine . "
More chillingly , he continues , " I 've asked for the address of this arsehole in London and I 've given a dossier to Vitalich who will take everything to Moscow . "
Asked by the person on the line who Vitalich was , Talik refuses to explain , insisting only that Vitalich would pass on this contract on Litvinenko's life to three powerful sponsors , all siloviki
In court , Talik admitted making the call - but the reference to Litvinenko was merely an idle threat , he said .
He denied accusations that he had high - ranking contacts both in the Ukrainian mafia and in the Kremlin and said he had been enraged by Litvinenko 's outing of him as an FSB agent to the Ukrainian media .
The Italian police initially took seriously the threat caught on the phone tap ; but , given that they now were also convinced Litvinenko and Scaramella had tried to frame Talik , they alerted no one .
The police also began probing how Talik had stayed in Italy for six years with no visa .
By February 2006 , nine months before Litvinenko was poisoned , they had assembled a 73 - page dossier on him .
Litvinenko and Scaramella continued to work together , repeating the Prodi allegations , this time on camera .
The slur reached new ears .
Gerald Batten , a British MEP from the UK Independence party , picked up on it and met Litvinenko on March 29 at Itsu , the Russian 's regular haunt .
Four days later Batten demanded an inquiry into Prodi at the European Parliament .
The story caused uproar in Italy .
The Italian general election was imminent - Prodi threatened to sue Litvinenko and Scaramella .
Berlusconi , instead of achieving a strike against the left , was forced by parliament to wind up the Mitrokhin Commission .
A few days later Prodi was returned to power .
Scaramella was out of a job .
Litvinenko , too .
Oblivious to the inquiries going on into the supposed contract on his life , he was busy looking elsewhere for a lucrative new collaboration .
In January 2006 , Litvinenko had attended Boris Berezovsky 's lavish 60th birthday party at Blenheim Palace , where he met a ghost from the past .
He was seated on the same table as Andrei Lugovoi , a former FSB agent whom he had known in Moscow during the 90s .
Lugovoi had gone on to serve 14 months in prison , for helping a Berezovsky business partner evade prosecution .
He told Litvinenko that since getting out he had become a multimillionaire , running a private security agency that provided bodyguards to rich Muscovites .
Litvinenko should have been wary of Lugovoi from the start , but the lure of money was too strong .
Otherwise he might have found out that Lugovoi was a close associate of Alexander Talik ; the two men served together in the same KGB and FSB divisions .
Instead , Litvinenko confided to his good friend Alex Goldfarb that he had agreed to become Lugovoi's " man in London " .
Others warned him to be careful , including Evgeni Limarev .
Limarev was to play one last significant role in the Litvinenko affair : he sent a series of alarmist emails to Scaramella in October 2006 , claiming that a Russian plot was afoot to kill everyone connected to the Mitrokhin Commission .
He was not referring to the alleged Talik hit , but to another that had no independent verification .
The messages sent Scaramella running to Litvinenko in London , who reluctantly agreed to meet him on November 1 2006 .
A series of witness statements Scaramella would later make to anti-terrorism detectives at Scotland Yard , which we have seen , give an account of this last meeting .
Scaramella picked up a final email from Limarev at an internet cafe in Soho just minutes before he met Litvinenko , as usual in Itsu .
But Litvinenko was dismissive of Limarev 's warnings .
Scaramella told British detectives : " Litvinenko was adamant , ' It 's pure shit , Mario .
Do n't worry , ' he told me .
' As soon as I get home , I 'll make some verifications through my contacts in Moscow . ' "
They arranged to speak again the next morning .
But when Scaramella called , Marina answered the phone .
" She said Alexander was very sick , puking , " Scaramella told police .
The following day he rang again , only to be told Litvinenko was on his way to hospital .
Paranoid , Scaramella scribbled down a note and hid it in his wallet .
" It contained details about my closest relatives and advice that if something happened to me , it was necessary to inform the police , " he said .
As Scaramella flew back to Naples , he sent Litvinenko an email .
" I made comments about the timing of his sickness and reminded him about the names mentioned by Limarev . "
There was no reply .
But after he read in the newspapers that Litvinenko was critically ill and had probably been poisoned , he tried calling one more time , on November 17 .
Litvinenko , who had just been transferred to University College Hospital under armed guard , answered his mobile phone .
Scaramella told police : " I said : ' It 's Mario , how are you ? '
He said , ' I 'm sick , very sick .
Sorry , I can't speak . ' "
Six days later , Litvinenko was dead .
Scaramella was a mess .
As he tried to deal with a sickening fear that he was about to be killed , too , the Italian authorities moved on the grenades - in - bibles plot .
Five days after Litvinenko's death , the Italian police 's specialist operations division raided Talik 's Naples apartment .
He was driven to Rome and questioned .
The transcript reveals that rather than explore the alleged threat , or Talik 's connections with Lugovoi , the police had a new agenda - gathering evidence against Scaramella .
Scaramella was arrested on December 24 and charged with " calumny " , or criminal lying , against Talik .
A few months later he was also charged with weapons smuggling .
The trial of the six Ukrainians who had been arrested with the grenades , and who had been in custody since October 2005 , collapsed for lack of evidence .
In September 2007 , after nine months in police custody , Scaramella was placed under house arrest at his family 's villa near Gaeta , a seaside town north of Naples .
He denies the charges .
His only link with the outside world is his father , Amedeo , who agreed to meet us at his lawyer 's office overlooking the Bay of Naples .
" While my son and I were in London assisting your police in December 2006 , " Amedeo said , " the police here broke the doors of all of our houses .
When we returned to Italy , Mario was locked in a solitary cell , two metres wide , for 45 days .
We kept asking , ' Why are you arresting my son ? '
Why had they taken 13 months to arrest Talik , only to release him straight away ?
There has been a deeply political aspect to my son's case . "
In Britain , Litvinenko would be portrayed as a freedom - loving , pro-western martyr , granted political asylum in 2001 , but in Italy he had become foolishly wrapped up in a rightist plot and his death was quietly celebrated .
Maxim Litvinenko remains in Senigallia .
Even though he accused Talik of plotting to kill him back in October 2005 , he now claims never to have heard of the FSB agent .
" I know nothing .
Who is Talik ?
I do n't know what you are talking about , " he said .
Talik lives freely in a grimy Naples quarter , where our taxi driver does not want to go .
" You walk , " he says , speeding off .
Through narrow streets darkened by parachutes of laundry overhead , we press on to an apartment with no windows .
We knock .
Locks are drawn back and an ashen face peers out .
It is Nataliya , Talik 's wife , a child holding on to her leg .
Can we speak to her husband , we ask .
She stares mutely .
We need to talk to him about Litvinenko , we say .
A look of incredulity spreads across her face .
" Who told you how to find us ? " she screams , slamming shut the huge iron door .
We can hear her running upstairs , screaming for her husband .
And we back out of the one - way street .
" The singularity will either be really successful , in which [ case ] we 're going to have the biggest boom ever , or it is probably going to blow up the whole world . "
Such were the words of Peter Thiel , co-founder of PayPal , multi-millionaire Facebook backer , and now the president of Clarium Capital Management , a global macro hedge fund .
Thiel took the stage Sunday morning at the Singularity Summit in San Francisco to discuss the effects the singularity – the technological creation of smarter - than - human intelligence – would have on the world 's financial markets .
As you might gather from his statement above , Thiel 's approach to the topic was rather polar , and his talk centered mainly around how one might go about investing and interacting in a near - singularity world – a world where " there is the possibility of things going extraordinarily well or extraordinarily bad . "
Due to that extreme polarity , Thiel 's talk centered less on what would happen if our robotic / AI overlords decided humans were expendable , and more on a positive singularity scenario .
" Even if you put all your money into gold coins and silver chests and hide it in some forgotten corner of the planet ... when the world does come to an end , there will be nothing left to buy and to sell and probably some humans or robots or something else will have come along and taken your gold away from you , " he told a laughing audience .
Operating under the notion that the bad versions of the singularity are things that one simply cannot invest in at all , Thiel said that , in some sense , if you believe in something like this , you have no choice but to bet on it as an investor .
And what will those investments be ?
Well , according to Thiel , the best investments will be the ones that represent the most aggressive bets on the singularity .
In fact , we may already be seeing such bets .
Leading up to the singularity , Thiel described " a world full of massive manias , booms and busts on a scale unprecedented in all of history . "
Sound familiar ?
It should , if you agree with his thesis .
" Interestingly , if you actually look at the world 's financial market over the last 25 to 30 years , that is exactly what they have manifested in , " Thiel said .
When , instead of stocks moving up six or seven percent a year in a smooth monotonic function ( as the conventional wisdom of the market dictates during our age of information glut ) , they actually got more volatile , this started to intrigue Thiel .
In essence , he argues that each of these booms represent different bets on the singularity , or at least on various things that are proxies for it , like globalization .
What 's more , we 've been seeing them now for over 30 years .
" I think it 's no coincidence that Japan in the 80s was perceived as being on the cutting edge of technology , " Thiel told the audience .
" There was all that fifth generation AI stuff that Japan was pushing and you had all these textbooks about how Japan Incorporated was going to run the world . "
In fact , by the peak of 1989 , Thiel noted that the Japanese stock market was worth more than all the other stock markets in the world put together .
Even the Emperor 's Palace in downtown Tokyo was assessed as being worth more than the entire state of California .
Of course , all of that ended in a massive and extraordinary bust , just like the Long Term Capital hedge fund blow up in 1998 and the collapse of Russia 's currency and banks , and that whole Silicon Valley thing a few years back .
Yet all were bets , according to Thiel .
They were just wrong bets .
" Over the past two or three years , we 've seen a series of new booms ... which one do you believe ? " he rhetorically asked .
Whether there 's any way of knowing or not , Thiel seemed to be saying there 's no harm in betting – especially if that other scenario plays out .
Indeed , his self - described " macro thesis " was that even though it is likely that most of these massive moves are going to be fake , it can't be the case every single one of them can be fake .
" One of them is going to be real , " he concluded , " or the world is going to come to an end . "

What do you think of when someone mentions the Red Cross ?
For some the name conjures images of the recent scandal over video games using their logo .
Others might think of the various good works they do .
Probably very few people think of the cool guerrilla advertising campaigns they have created to raise awareness of various key issues around the world .
Know What to Do :
So you might call these sneaky , or even mean , but what better way to make people wonder how prepared they are for an emergency situation ?
Just imagine : you are walking along , look down before walking a few flights of stairs , and at the bottom is what appears to be an injured person .
What do you first ?
How would you help ?
Not Happening Here , but Happening Now : somewhere in the world , buildings are collapsing , bombs are going off , people are dying .
In short : things are very , very wrong .
Especially in the US this might seem a world away but it is happening on the same planet .
These creative guerrilla interventions bring that message home loud and clear .
Try Living on This for Three Days : we ’re always told that , in a pinch , you can survive without food or water for up to three days … but have you ever tested the theory ?
These empty water bottles communicate a very strong signal about this commonly - repeated saying : yes , it ’s possible , but you really would n’t want to try it .
Before and After :
There are a few great marketing tricks that make this a powerful guerrilla ad soliciting cornea donations .
First , you have to look close to read it , so it forces people to engage from the outset .
Once you read it , you realize the difference you can make for someone : between blindness and sight .
A guilt trip , certainly , but a cleverly done one for sure !
Where ’s the Color ?
The red is there , but just in the lower right - hand corner of the page .
The message : the world is your coloring book .
You can add color to the lives of others .
OK , OK , so it ’s a bit cheesy , sure , but it ’s true too .
Gift and food donations can make a big difference in someone ’s life .
Earthquake Early Warning System : Unfortunately , as the sign suggests , there wo n’t be an actual warning .
Sure , it ’s a messaged drilled into us as kinds , but : you just have to know ahead of time what to do and be prepared .
The Red Cross has also posted clever Craigslist ads in apartment rental sections for earthquake - ravaged buildings to raise awareness about earthquake preparedness .
Volunteers Needed : the Red Cross and other organizations are always in need of blood donors , but most of the time we do n’t think about that on a day - to - day basis .
These handy carrying bags are a creative reminder that donors are always welcome .

The Five Who Had a Good Ride
Of course not everyone had a tough time over the past seven years .
Here are the five who came through their Bush Years relatively footloose and problem - free .
Big Oil
Even as oil companies raked in record profits , the White House fought to make sure they kept $ 7.6 billion in tax subsidies and the legal loophole that lets them dodge paying $ 10.7 billion in royalties from oil found in public U.S. lands in the Gulf of Mexico .
IHT IHT Contractor Mercenaries
President Bush has thrown billions of dollars — and undue faith — behind corrupt contractor mercenaries to fight his wars in Iraq and Afghanistan .
And like members of his administration , the president lets these contractors act outside the law .
Take Blackwater : Top State Department officials knew about incidents of the contractor killing innocent civilians in Iraq for more than two years — and it turned a blind eye .
ABC The Filthy Rich
Welcome to the new Gilded Age .
From 2003 to 2005 , the increase in income from the richest one percent of Americans was higher than the total income of the poorest 20 percent .
How ’d we get this way ?
Bush ’s tax cuts for the uber - wealthy .
NY Times Cronies and Bushies
From the Department of Justice to FEMA , from the Coalitional Provisional Authority to the FDA , Bush has packed his administration with friends and partisans , prizing loyalty over experience and ideology over competence .
Washington Post Washington Post CNN NY Times People Who Fear Human - Animal Hybrids
President Bush was able to keep one promise from his previous State of the Union addresses .
In 2006 , he pledged to fight the creation of “ human- animal hybrids , ” sparking visions of fearsome ManBeasts terrorizing the nation .
As of today , we ’ve spotted no half - man / half - animal creatures .
Breaking News :
We may have given the president credit too soon — just this week , we ’ve discovered , British scientists created a ManCow clone .

Economic Problems
Problem : Staggering National Debt
After declining significantly during the 1990s , the combination of expensive Bush tax cuts and reckless spending pushed the national debt from $ 5.7 trillion in 2001 to $ 9.2 trillion in 2008 .
[ Department of Treasury ]
Problem : Poverty
There are 4.9 million more Americans living in poverty today than there were in 2000 . [ EPI ]
Problem : Bankruptcies
A total of 603,139 Americans filed for bankruptcy in the first three quarters of 2007 , a 40.15 percent increase over the same period in 2006 .
[ American Bankruptcy Institute ] [ Consumer Affairs ]
Problem : Foreclosures
In the third quarter of 2007 , there were 635,159 foreclosure filings in the United States .
When you crunch the numbers , that ’s one foreclosure filing for every 196 U.S. households .
That ’s 100 percent more than in the same period of 2006 .
[ Daily Herald ]
Problem : Credit Card Debt
Today , Americans owe more than $ 813 billion in credit card debt .
Additionally , Americans are falling behind on their credit card payments at an alarming rate , sending delinquencies and defaults surging by double - digit percentages in the last year and prompting warnings of worse to come .
[ American Progress ] [ MSNBC ]
Problem : High Gas Prices
The average price of a gallon of gas has skyrocketed , from $ 1.39 a gallon in January 2000 to $ 3.07 a gallon in January 2007 .
[ Energy Information Administration ]
Problem : Freezing Families
In 2008 , the average U.S. household will have to spend $ 986 to heat their homes in winter , up 11 percent from the year before .
Millions of the elderly and poor rely on the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program to heat their homes , yet in 2007 , President Bush asked Congress to slash funding for LIHEAP by $ 379 million .
[ Associated Press ]
Problem : Starvation
According to the USDA , the number of hungry families in the United States rose 26 percent between 2001 and 2006 .
Worse , the number of families with the least access to enough food rose 32 percent .
That ’s 1.3 million American families , not including the homeless .
[ USDA ]
Problem : Sorry , We Meant to Say “ Low Food Security ”
In 2006 the U.S. Department of Agriculture attempted to sugarcoat the hunger issue by banning the word “ hunger ” from official documents , replacing it with the more opaque “ very low food security . ” [ Washington Post ]
Problem : Small Businesses Struggle
Under the Bush administration , corporate giants like Microsoft and Wal - Mart managed to finagle $ 12 billion in small business grants from the federal government .
Federal law says , based on population , small businesses must receive 23 percent of federal contracts .
The government claims at least a quarter of federal contracts are going to help small business owners ( small business = one employing fewer than 100 people ) , but in reality , it ’s more like 5 percent .
[ Globe and Mail ]
War Problems
Problem : Surge Failure
In January 2007 , President Bush announced a plan to send a 20,000 - troop “ surge ” to Iraq to quell the violence and provide military cover while the Iraqi government took over the ruling of its own nation .
The U.S. military was able to staunch much of the violence in the country — though at the price of 896 American troops killed in 2007 — but the Iraqi government remains in chaos .
The Iraq Inspector General calls government corruption “ the second insurgency , ” Parliament rarely is able to get a quorum together to conduct business , and even the Iraqi Minister of Defense says the government will be unable to take over its own security until at least 2012 .
[ Chicago Tribune ] [ The Guardian ]
Problem : Iraq Reconstruction in Shambles
Despite spending $ 488 billion ( so far ) on the Iraq war , many of the U.S. - led reconstruction projects in Iraq , fraught with corruption , security problems , and inept contractors , “ have been abandoned , delayed or poorly constructed . ”
Hospitals , prisons , and police training centers were all abandoned , while the guard - house for the U.S. Embassy became such a toxic fire hazard , they had to evacuate everyone who tried to move in .
[ Boston Globe ] [ International Herald Tribune ] [ National Priorities Project ]
Problem : The Taliban ’s Resurgence
Today , Al Qaeda along the Pakistan / Afghanistan border is back to pre-9/11 strength .
The Taliban increased the number of roadside and suicide bomb attacks in 2007 to the highest level since the war in Afghanistan began .
The two groups are flush with money from the Afghanistan opium trade , which “ grew by 17 percent in 2007 , reaching record levels for the second straight year . ” [ Mic Check ] [ USA Today ]
Problem : Afghan Women Still Live in Fear
Despite a new constitution that enshrines women ’s rights , insufficient resources devoted to the war in Afghanistan mean “ the state cannot protect women and ensure that they can go about their work safely . ”
In some regions controlled by the resurgent Taliban , they “ have restricted possible employment , education and health care opportunities for women , often resorting to violence to enforce their edicts . ” [ Quazen ]
Problem : Refusing Iraqi Refugees
The number of Iraqis fleeing their homes quadrupled over 2007 , bringing the totals to “ 2.3 million internally displaced persons within Iraq , and over 2.3 million Iraqis who have fled the country . ”
The United States took in only 7,000 . [ CNN ]
Health Care Problems
Problem : Expensive and Inefficient Health Care
In 2006 , America ’s health care costs spiraled to an all - time high of over $ 2 trillion ( or $ 7,026 per person ) .
In a report by the World Health Organization , America ranks 37th in health care quality , despite spending more per person than any other country in the world .
[ LA Times ] [ WHO ]
Problem : No Health Insurance
There were 47 million Americans living without health insurance in 2006 ; that ’s 8.6 million more uninsured than there were in 2000 . [ EPI ]
Problem : Government in Bed with Drug Companies
An independent report found that from October 2005 to December 2006 , “ Food and Drug Administration officials met 112 times with industry representatives but only five times with consumer and patient groups . ”
According to Representative Maurice Hinchey ( D - NY ) , “ the FDA has essentially become the government affairs office of the pharmaceutical industry . "
[ USA Today ]
Problem : Medicare Cheats Off the Hook
A 2007 audit by the Government Accountability Office showed private insurance companies pocketed $ 59 million in overpayments from Medicare that instead should have gone to better benefits and lower co-payments or lower premiums for older Americans .
At the same time , the White House a ) refused to audit these companies and b ) refused to try to recover the missing money .
[ NY Times ]
Problem : Seniors Ca n’t Afford Their Meds
In April 2007 , Bush refused to sign a Senate bill that would have allowed Medicare to negotiate for lower prescription drug prices from pharmaceutical companies .
[ Reuters ]
Problem : Blocked Stem Cell Research
In 2001 , Bush placed a federal ban on future funding of embryonic stem cell research , which holds the promise of developing cures for Parkinson ’s , juvenile diabetes , Alzheimer ’s , and other degenerative diseases .
In 2006 , he used his veto pen for the first time to kill a bill expanding funding for stem cell research .
In 2007 , he again vetoed the Stem Cell Research Enhancement Act. [ Time ] [ MSNBC ] [ Time ]
Problem : Cheating the Disabled
Social Security ’s draconian standards keep even the “ severely disabled ” from receiving Social Security disability benefits .
The source of the problem ?
A poorly managed agency where there are “ doctors making decisions outside their specialties , and inexperienced examiners under pressure to keep costs down . ” [ CBS ]
Problem : Manipulating Access to Health Info
In 2002 , the National Cancer Institute posted on their Web site the scientific conclusion that there was no link between abortion and breast cancer .
The White House removed the analysis and replaced it with a statement which “ erroneously suggested that whether abortion caused breast cancer was an open question with studies of equal weight supporting both sides . ” [ House Government Oversight ]
Planet Problems
Problem : Blocking International Efforts
At the beginning of his presidency , Bush blocked the Kyoto Protocol , a landmark global agreement aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions signed by 174 other nations .
Then , at the 2007 G8 summit , U.S. negotiators attempted to water down the language of a different international climate change declaration .
[ USA Today ] [ Washington Post ]
Problem : Sticking Poor Countries with the Bill
Countless reports have said that poor , developing nations will bear the brunt — think : drought , famine , floods , and disease — of climate change .
Yet , at the recent climate change talks in Bali , U.S. delegates tried to block a proposal that would require rich nations to do more to help poor nations fight global warming .
[ Der Spiegel ]
Problem : Killing Us with Carbon Emissions
After President Bush pledged a cap on carbon emissions in 2000 , Vice President Cheney filled the White House Committee on Environmental Quality with industry representatives .
Following their appointment , the group released a report saying “ the current state of scientific knowledge about causes of and solutions to global warming is inconclusive ” and no caps were needed .
[ Rolling Stone ]
Problem : Killing the Polar Bears
In January of 2008 , the Bush administration missed a deadline requiring a final decision on whether to give polar bears — often the poster children of global warming — federal protection under the Endangered Species Act .
The U.S. Geological Survey ’s September report , meanwhile , found that melting Arctic sea ice could wipe out polar bears in Alaska and kill off two - thirds of the species ’ global population . [ ABC ]
Problem : Destruction of the Alaskan Wilderness
Also in January of 2008 , the federal government decided to open up nearly 46,000 square miles off Alaska ’s northwest coast to petroleum leases , available in February .
Goodbye wildlife , hello oil spills . [ AP ]
Problem : The EPA vs. California
At the end of 2007 , head of the EPA Stephen Johnson denied California ’s quest for a waiver from the Clean Air Act to allow the state and up to 17 others to set stricter regulations on automobile pollution .
Senate investigators later found EPA scientists and career staffers fought for the EPA to grant California ’s waiver .
[ Kansas City Star ] [ AP ]
Problem : Melting the Arctic Ice
Thanks to global warming , the Arctic Sea ice has decreased nearly 20 percent in the past 20 years .
[ USA Today ]
Racial Problems
Problem : Ignoring Civil Rights
The Bush administration changed the civil rights mission of the Justice Department “ by aggressively pursuing religion - oriented cases while significantly diminishing its involvement in the traditional area of race . ” [ NY Times ]
Problem : Affirmative Action Under Siege
Bush has consistently attacked affirmative action policies in higher education , including suing the University of Michigan for taking race into account in its admissions process . [ CNN ]
Problem : Rolling Back Brown v. Board of Education
A half century ago , with the landmark case Brown v. Board of Education , the Supreme Court ordered the nation ’s schools to desegregate .
In 2007 , with two of President Bush ’s Court appointees in the 5 - 4 majority , the Roberts Court rolled back desegregation , ruling local officials “ cannot take modest steps to bring public school students of different races together . ”
[ NY Times ]
Problem : African Americans Without Health Care
Since 2000 , the percent of African Americans without health insurance has increased from 18.5 percent to 20.5 percent .
[ Census Bureau ]
Problem : Hispanics Without Health Care
In 2006 , there were 15.3 million uninsured Hispanics in the United States , an estimated 3.4 million of whom are children .
[ Census Bureau ]
Problem : Disparities in Cancer Treatment
The American Cancer Society finds that , while cancer deaths may be dropping , that statistic does not apply to African Americans .
Experts cite inadequate access to quality health care for minorities as one of the main reasons for the tragedy .
[ Reuters ]
Problem : Minorities and Mortgages
Experts are calling the current economic crisis “ the greatest loss of wealth for communities and individuals of color in modern U.S. history . ”
Black and Hispanic homeowners could lose up to $ 256 billion in the subprime mortgage crisis .
[ Boston Herald ]
Problem : Blocking Immigrants Seeking Citizenship
At the onset of 2007 , the Bush administration jacked up immigration fees by more than 80 percent , shooting up the cost of applying for citizenship to $ 595 .
Also , today more than 1.4 million legal permanent residents are facing an 18 - month delay in their citizenship applications due to administrative backlogs .
[ Washington Post ]
Regulation Problems
Problem : Toxic Lack of Prosecution of Polluters
Under the current administration , the EPA sharply decreased the prosecution of criminal cases against polluters .
New prosecutions , new investigations , and total convictions all plummeted by a third .
[ Washington Post ]
Problem : Toxic Arsenic in Our Drinking Water
In April 2007 , Bush waited until Congress went into recess to appoint Susan Dudley to head the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs .
Dudley , “ who made no secret of her hostility toward government regulation , ” was a corporate insider who said the EPA “ should not value the lives of older people as highly as the lives of younger people when calculating the effect of arsenic in drinking water . ” [ NY Times ] [ LA Times ]
Problem : Toxic , Mutating Weed Killer in the Water
The White House has fought against regulating the weed killer atrizine , even though the chemical has seeped into U.S. water supplies and created a new mutant breed of hermaphroditic frog .
They have no idea what effect the chemical has on humans besides the higher prostate cancer rate among those men who work around the chemical .
[ Washington Post ]
Problem : Toxic Air at Ground Zero
In September 2001 , just days after the attacks on the World Trade Center , the White House pressured the EPA to delete warnings from a press release about air quality at Ground Zero and falsely reassure the public that the air was safe to breathe .
Later studies show roughly 70 percent of workers from Ground Zero now suffer from respiratory illnesses .
[ NY Times ] [ NY Times ]
Problem : Toxic Air on the Highways
In November 2007 , a federal appeals court threw out the federal government ’s fuel efficiency standards for trucks because they were a ) too weak and b ) broke the law , as they “ did n’t properly assess the risk to the environment and failed to include heavier SUVs and trucks , among several other deficiencies the court found . ” [ MSNBC ]
Problem : Testing Pesticides on Kids
The EPA used camcorders to bribe parents into offering up their toddlers as guinea pigs for a study about the dangers of pesticides on children .
The study was paid for in part by the chemical industry .
[ SF Chronicle ] [ Washington Post ]
Military Problems
Problem : A Hobbled National Guard
A congressional report found that the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan had worn down the National Guard so much that almost 90 percent of Army National Guard Units are “ not ready … jeopardizing the Guard ’s ability to respond to crises at home and abroad . ” [ Washington Post ]
Problem : A Hobbled Marine Corps
In 2007 , the commandant of the Marine Corps , Gen. James T. Conway , said the strain of the Iraq war was forcing Marines to skip vital combat training that made up the traditional backbone of the Corps . [ AP ]
Problem : A Hobbled Army
After five long years in Iraq , General George Casey says the Army is “ out of balance ” after the military strategy in Iraq “ sucked all of the flexibility out of the system . ”
He also said the Army is “ so consumed by current operations that we ca n’t do the things we need to do to prepare ourselves organizationally or institutionally . ” [ Army News ] [ WSJ ]
Problem : Squalid Conditions at Vet Hospitals
In 2007 , a Washington Post expose revealed squalid conditions at the Walter Reed Army Medical Center , including “ mouse droppings , belly - up cockroaches , stained carpets , [ and ] cheap mattresses ” in facilities for injured soldiers returning from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan .
A separate investigation revealed a similar pattern of neglect and “ depressing living conditions for outpatients at other military bases around the country , from Fort Lewis in Washington state to Fort Dix in New Jersey . ” [ Washington Post ] [ Washington Post ]
Problem : Habeas Corpus Denied
Article One , Section Nine of the United States Constitution states the basic human right of habeas corpus can not be suspended except for cases “ of rebellion or invasion . ”
In September 2006 , at President Bush ’s urging , the Republican - led Congress passed the Military Commissions Act , which stripped terror detainees of this basic right .
Thirty - three former U.S. diplomats warned “ to deny habeas corpus to our detainees can be seen as prescription for how the captured members of our own military , diplomatic and NGO personnel stationed abroad may be treated . ” [ LA Times ]
Problem : Homeless Veterans
A 2007 study from the National Alliance to End Homelessness found there are nearly 200,000 homeless veterans on America ’s streets .
Many fought in the Vietnam War , but Veterans Affairs also found an increasing number of soldiers returning from Iraq and Afghanistan were using VA homeless shelters .
[ Washington Post ]
Problem : Extended Tours in Iraq
In April of 2007 , the Bush administration announced that it was extending troop tours from 12 months to 15 months .
During these tours , the troops are only allowed a single two - week break to return to their families .
[ Military.com ]
Problem : Veteran Suicides
Fact : Male U.S. veterans are twice as likely to die by suicide than people with no military service .
Tragedy :
A third of returning soldiers seek mental health treatment after returning from combat , but they are welcomed home with military health insurance ( TriCare ) whose mental health coverage is “ hindered by fragmented rules and policies , inadequate oversight and insufficient reimbursement . ” [ Reuters ] [ USA Today ]
Torture Problems
Problem : White House Enables Torture
In January 2002 , then - White House counsel Alberto Gonzales agreed with a memo drafted by the Justice Department ’s John C. Yoo , suggesting “ Mr. Bush should declare the Taliban and Al Qaeda outside the coverage of the Geneva Conventions . ”
In August 2002 , Gonzales signed off on a Justice Department memo stating extreme interrogation techniques on terror suspects abroad “ may be necessary , ” and dramatically narrowed the definition of “ torture ” to actions “ equivalent in intensity to the pain accompanying serious physical injury , such as organ failure , impairment of bodily function , or even death . ” [ NY Times ] [ Washington Post ]
Problem : Defense Department Enables Torture
In November 2002 , then - Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld approved interrogation techniques for terror suspects at Guantanamo Bay .
They included “ ‘ removal of clothing ’ and ‘ inducing stress by use of detainee ’s fears ( e.g. dogs ) ’ ” and “ stress positions . ” [ USA Today ]
Problem : The Horrors at Abu Ghraib
In August 2003 , Maj. Gen. Geoffrey Miller was sent from the prison at Guantanamo Bay to the prison at Abu Ghraib to help “ get more information out of Iraqi prisoners . ”
Once there , he encouraged harsh interrogation methods , including the “ use of dogs . ”
Later , once reports of gross abuse at the prison surfaced , Major General Antonio Mario Taguba , in his classified report , “ blames Miller ’s policies . ”
Miller then won the “ Distinguished Service Medal . ”
No officers have ever been convicted of a crime concerning the atrocities .
[ Washington Post ] [ MSNBC ] [ Army News ] ] [ USA Today ]
Problem : Guantanamo Bay
Since opening its doors in 2004 , the U.S. detention facility at Guantanamo Bay has held — and presumably tortured — more than 500 detainees .
The lack of basic legal rights — such as habeas corpus — at Gitmo has been one of the White House ’s biggest scandals , and has helped to ruin the U.S. reputation around the world .
According to Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Adm. Mike Mullen : “ More than anything else it ’s been the image — how Gitmo has become around the world , in terms of representing the United States . …
I believe that from the standpoint of how it reflects on us that it ’s been pretty damaging . ” [ American Progress ] [ USA Today ] [ AP ]
Problem : Kidnappings and Secret Prisons
The United States is “ secretly transferring terror suspects to locations where they have faced torture and other ill - treatment , enforced disappearances and indefinite detention without charge . ”
A 2004 Washington Post report uncovered “ an elaborate CIA and military infrastructure whose purpose is to hold suspected terrorists or insurgents for interrogation and safekeeping while avoiding U.S. or international court systems . ” [ Amnesty International ] [ Washington Post ]
Problem : The CIA Torture Tapes
In 2005 , lawyers for the CIA gave the green light for the agency to trash hundreds of hours of videotapes documenting the interrogation — and torture — of two lieutenants from Al Qaeda , despite a previous court order requiring the government to keep all materials “ regarding the torture , mistreatment and abuse of detainees ” at Guantanamo .
The tapes allegedly included waterboarding , a practice the U.S. military has prosecuted as torture since the Spanish American war .
[ NY Times ] [ Washington Post ] [ Washington Post ]
Privacy Problems
Problem : Government Tapping Our Phones
Under the Bush White House , the National Security Agency illegally intercepted phone calls of countless Americans without first obtaining court warrants — a direct violation of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act .
Last year , the White House strong - armed a new warrantless wire - tapping bill through Congress that gave Bush even more power — an act that Speaker Pelosi said did “ violence to the Constitution . ” [ Washington Post ]
Problem : Government Reading Our Mail , Checking Our Banks
President Bush gave himself the power to read our mail :
In 2006 , during the Christmas recess , President Bush quietly attached a signing statement to a postal reform bill giving the White House the authority to open U.S. mail without a warrant .
The CIA and Pentagon also gave themselves the power to obtain banking and credit records of hundreds of Americans .

Problem : Losing the Right to Protest
A Defense Department database , known as the Talon program , was designed to catalogue domestic threats to the Pentagon but included data on anti-war demonstrators and peaceful protestors .
[ Washington Post ]
Power Grabbing Problems
Problem : A Presidency Above the Law
Bush has used signing statements — caveats to bills that presidents tack on when they sign them into law — to amend more than 1,100 sections of legislation .
( That ’s more than all other presidents combined . )
Some of the more controversial signing statements : President Bush gave himself the power to bypass a law requiring the Justice Department to report to Congress about how the FBI uses the Patriot Act to search American homes .
In another instance , President Bush gave himself the power to waive the congressional ban on torture .
[ Boston Globe ]
Problem : A Vice Presidency Above the Law
In June 2007 , Vice President Dick Cheney announced he did not have to comply with the law requiring members of the executive branch to report to the National Archives on information his office has classified because , according to the vice president , he was not actually part of the executive branch of the government .
[ Seattle P - I ]
Problem : White House Quest for Secrecy
In 2000 , the federal government spent $ 452,807 on contracts for paper shredding services .
By 2006 , that number skyrocketed to $ 2.9 million .
And what they could n’t shred , they stonewalled .
Since 1998 , the number of exemptions to the Freedom Of Information Act cited to support the withholding of information increased 83 percent .
Two out of five FOIA requests were n’t even processed by 2006 .
[ USA Spending ] [ Coalition of Journalists for Open Government ]
Problem : Politicized the Office of U.S. Attorneys
After the 2004 presidential election , the Bush administration canned eight U.S. attorneys who would n’t play partisan ball even though many of them were working on high - profile corruption cases , and replaced them with political operatives .
[ NY Times ]
Problem : Politicized Executive Branch
At the onset of 2006 , GAO queen bee Lurita Doan threw the Hatch Act to the wind and held a video conference with a Karl Rove deputy to discuss ways to help Republican candidates .
During the January 2006 meeting , Doan apparently asked J. Scott Jennings , the White House deputy political director how they “ could help our candidates in the next elections . ”
Suggestions included “ targeting public events , such as the opening of federal facilities around the country . ” [ Washington Post ]
Problem : Politicized Scientists
In 2004 , White House official Philip Cooney , chief of staff of its Council on Environmental Quality , doctored a report on global warming to downplay scientific warnings .
( He now works for Exxon . )
In 2006 , NASA scientist James Hansen , director of NASA ’s Goddard Institute for Space Studies , accused the White House of preventing his research from reaching the public .
In October 2007 , the administration altered a draft of congressional testimony to be given by Dr. Julie Gerberding , director of Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , on the negative health implications of climate change .
According to a CDC source , her testimony was “ eviscerated . ” [ AP ] [ NY Times ] [ Washington Post ]
Problem : Pre-War Deception
In the two years after 9/11 , Bush and senior administration officials made 935 false statements alleging Iraq had weapons of mass destruction and attempting to connect Saddam Hussein to Al Qaeda .
A non-partisan study by the Center for Public Integrity said they represented “ an orchestrated campaign that effectively galvanized public opinion and , in the process , led the nation to war under decidedly false pretenses . ” [ Center for Public Integrity ]
Problem : Outed Covert CIA
Agent
Bush administration officials leaked the identity of Valerie Plame , an undercover CIA agent , in order to discredit the work of her husband , Ambassador Joseph C. Wilson , after Wilson exposed the White House was bending the truth on Saddam ’s quest for WMD .
[ NY Times ]
Problem : Fake News
The Department of Health and Human Services got caught producing fake “ news ” segments on the prescription drug benefit that were “ sent to TV stations , along with government - prepared scripts for news anchors to read . ”
In 2005 , the Department of Education was discovered paying conservative commentator Armstrong Williams to write columns promoting No Child Left Behind .
In October 2007 , the Department of Homeland Security staged a fake press conference ( complete with staffers posing as reporters ) to offer a glowing report of how well they handled the California wildfires .

There are 8.7 million kids in the United States without health insurance ( that ’s 11.7 percent of all American children ) .
In 2007 , President Bush vetoed SCHIP legislation not once but twice , unwilling to raise taxes on the price of a pack of smokes to add more kids to the program .
The president finally signed the legislation to extend the existing program at the end of December 2007 , but the new , watered - down bill left 9 million uninsured children without coverage .

Researchers working through Carnegie Mellon University 's CyLab have devised a new kind of security system that aims to block observation attacks and could be used to prevent snoopers from catching a glimpse of your PIN when you use an ATM .
The researchers have published a paper ( PDF ) that describes their prototype system and reveals the results of usability study conducted on the machine with 38 participants .
When the researchers created their prototype , which is called Undercover and was built with a Lego Mindstorms robot , they attempted to come up with a system that would be easy to use but would limit vulnerability to common attacks .
Unlike many conventional security systems which use some kind of secret response like a password , the Undercover system partially obfuscates the query instead .
The Undercover system does this by making the query use both visual cues from images and tactile cues which are provided by a rotating and vibrating ball that the user covers with their hand .
" Our proposal is the first to rely on the human ability to simultaneously process multiple sensory inputs to authenticate , and is resilient to most observation attacks , " the study explains .
" Our results show that users can authenticate within times comparable to that of graphical password schemes , with relatively low error rates , while being considerably better protected against observation attacks .
Our design and evaluation process allows us to outline design principles for observation - resilient authentication systems . "
Prior to authentication , the users selects a series of images for their identity portfolio .
These images are displayed to the user during authentication along with other images that are randomly selected as distractors .
During the authentication process , the user will be presented with a selection of images and must hit one of a series of buttons to indicate if any of the images are from their identity portfolio .
The response associated with each of the buttons is variable and is revealed to the user through tactile indicators from the rotating ball .
Since the system changes the user 's response parameters with the obscured ball 's behavior , repeated viewing of multiple authentications will not enable the attacker to ascertain which images are part of the user 's portfolio .
The Undercover prototype unit
The Lego Mindstorms robot inside of the Undercover prototype unit
During extensive testing , the researchers found that the Undercover prototype system was significantly less vulnerable than conventional PINs to over - the - shoulder snooping and other similar kinds of low - tech phishing .
The researchers also discovered that the system provides adequate ease of use for general adoption .
The Undercover prototype was primarily created with the ATM use case in mind , but the researchers note that it could be adapted for use in any number of authentication input scenarios including computer login and unlocking a cell phone .
The researchers also point out that an image - based system is less vulnerable to conventional phishing because it precludes the possibility of creating fake authentication sessions to entrap unwary users .

The Future of Marriage
Any serious discussion of the future of marriage requires a clear understanding of how marriage evolved over the ages , along with the causes of its most recent transformations .
Many people who hope to “ re-institutionalize ” marriage misunderstand the reasons that marriage was once more stable and played a stronger role in regulating social life .
For most of history , marriage was more about getting the right in - laws than picking the right partner to love and live with .
In the small - scale , band - level societies of our distant ancestors , marriage alliances turned strangers into relatives , creating interdependencies among groups that might otherwise meet as enemies .
But as large wealth and status differentials developed in the ancient world , marriage became more exclusionary and coercive .
People maneuvered to orchestrate advantageous marriage connections with some families and avoid incurring obligations to others .
Marriage became the main way that the upper classes consolidated wealth , forged military coalitions , finalized peace treaties , and bolstered claims to social status or political authority .
Getting “ well - connected ” in - laws was a preoccupation of the middle classes as well , while the dowry a man received at marriage was often the biggest economic stake he would acquire before his parents died .
Peasants , farmers , and craftsmen acquired new workers for the family enterprise and forged cooperative bonds with neighbors through their marriages .
Because of marriage ’s vital economic and political functions , few societies in history believed that individuals should freely choose their own marriage partners , especially on such fragile grounds as love .
Indeed , for millennia , marriage was much more about regulating economic , political , and gender hierarchies than nourishing the well - being of adults and their children .
Until the late 18th century , parents took for granted their right to arrange their children ’s marriages and even , in many regions , to dissolve a marriage made without their permission .
In Anglo - American law , a child born outside an approved marriage was a “ fillius nullius ” – a child of no one , entitled to nothing .
In fact , through most of history , the precondition for maintaining a strong institution of marriage was the existence of an equally strong institution of illegitimacy , which denied such children any claim on their families .
Even legally recognized wives and children received few of the protections we now associate with marriage .
Until the late 19th century , European and American husbands had the right to physically restrain , imprison , or “ punish ” their wives and children .
Marriage gave husbands sole ownership over all property a wife brought to the marriage and any income she earned afterward .
Parents put their children to work to accumulate resources for their own old age , enforcing obedience by periodic beatings .
Many people managed to develop loving families over the ages despite these laws and customs , but until very recently , this was not the main point of entering or staying in a union .
It was just 250 years ago , when the Enlightenment challenged the right of the older generation and the state to dictate to the young , that free choice based on love and compatibility emerged as the social ideal for mate selection .
Only in the early 19th century did the success of a marriage begin to be defined by how well it cared for its members , both adults and children .
These new marital ideals appalled many social conservatives of the day .
“ How will we get the right people to marry each other , if they can refuse on such trivial grounds as lack of love ? ” they asked .
“ Just as important , how will we prevent the wrong ones , such as paupers and servants , from marrying ? ”
What would compel people to stay in marriages where love had died ?
What would prevent wives from challenging their husbands ’ authority ?
They were right to worry .
In the late 18th century , new ideas about the “ pursuit of happiness ” led many countries to make divorce more accessible , and some even repealed the penalties for homosexual love .
The French revolutionaries abolished the legal category of illegitimacy , according a “ love child ” equal rights with a “ legal ” one .
In the mid-19th century , women challenged husbands ’ sole ownership of wives ’ property , earnings , and behavior .
Moralists predicted that such female economic independence would “ destroy domestic tranquility , ” producing “ infidelity in the marriage bed , a high rate of divorce , and increased female criminality . ”
And in some regards , they seemed correct .
Divorce rates rose so steadily that in 1891 a Cornell University professor predicted , with stunning accuracy , that if divorce continued rising at its current rate , more marriages would end in divorce than death by the 1980s .
But until the late 1960s , most of the destabilizing aspects of the love revolution were held in check by several forces that prevented people from building successful lives outside marriage : the continued legal subordination of women to men ; the ability of local elites to penalize employees and other community members for then - stigmatized behaviors such as remaining single , cohabiting , or getting a divorce ; the unreliability of birth control , combined with the harsh treatment of illegitimate children ; and above all , the dependence of women upon men ’s wage earning .
In the 1970s , however , these constraints were swept away or seriously eroded .
The result has been to create a paradox with which many Americans have yet to come to terms .
Today , when a marriage works , it delivers more benefits to its members — adults and children — than ever before .
A good marriage is fairer and more fulfilling for both men and women than couples of the past could ever have imagined .
Domestic violence and sexual coercion have fallen sharply .
More couples share decisionmaking and housework than ever before .
Parents devote unprecedented time and resources to their children .
And men in stable marriages are far less likely to cheat on their wives than in the past .
But the same things that have made so many modern marriages more intimate , fair , and protective have simultaneously made marriage itself more optional and more contingent on successful negotiation .
They have also made marriage seem less bearable when it does n’t live up to its potential .
The forces that have strengthened marriage as a personal relationship between freely consenting adults have weakened marriage as a regulatory social institution .
In the 1970s and 1980s , the collapse of the conditions that had forced most people to get and stay married led to dramatic — and often traumatic — upheavals in marriage .
This was exacerbated by an economic climate that made the 1950s ideal of the male breadwinner unattainable for many families .
Divorce rates soared .
Unwed teen motherhood shot up .
Since then , some of these destabilizing trends have leveled off or receded .
The divorce rate has fallen , especially for college - educated couples , over the past 20 years .
When divorce does occur , more couples work to resolve it amicably , and fewer men walk away from contact with their children .
Although there was a small uptick in teen births last year , they are still almost 30 percent lower than in 1991 .
Still , there is no chance that we can restore marriage to its former supremacy in coordinating social and interpersonal relationships .
Even as the divorce rate has dropped , the incidence of cohabitation , delayed marriage and non-marriage has risen steadily .
With half of all Americans aged 25 - 29 unmarried , marriage no longer organizes the transition into regular sexual activity or long - term partnerships the way it used to .
Although teen births are lower than a decade ago , births to unwed mothers aged 25 and older continue to climb .
Almost 40 percent of America ’s children are born to unmarried parents .
And gay and lesbian families are permanently out of the closet .
Massive social changes combine to ensure that a substantial percentage of people will continue to explore alternatives to marriage .
These include women ’s economic independence , the abolition of legal penalties for illegitimacy , the expansion of consumer products that make single life easier for both men and women , and the steady decline in the state ’s coercive power over personal life .
Add to this mix the continuing rise in the age of marriage , a trend that increases the stability of marriages once they are contracted but also increases the percentage of unwed adults in the population .
Stir in the reproductive revolution , which has made it possible for couples who would once have been condemned to childlessness to have the kids they want , but impossible to prevent single women or gay and lesbian couples from having children .
Top it off with changes in gender roles that have increased the payoffs of marriage for educated , financially secure women but increased its risks for low - income women whose potential partners are less likely to hold egalitarian values , earn good wages , or even count on a regular job .
Taken together , this is a recipe for a world where the social weight of marriage has been fundamentally and irreversibly reduced .
The decline in marriage ’s dominating role in organizing social and personal life is not unique to America .
It is occurring across the industrial world , even in countries with less “ permissive ” values and laws .
In predominantly Catholic Ireland , where polls in the 1980s found near - universal disapproval of premarital sex , one child in three today is born outside marriage .
China ’s divorce rate has soared more than 700 percent since 1980 .
Until 2005 , Chile was the only country in the Western Hemisphere that still prohibited divorce .
But in today ’s world , prohibiting divorce has very different consequences than in the past , because people no longer feel compelled to marry in the first place .
Between 1990 and 2003 , the number of marriages in Chile fell from 100,000 to 60,000 a year , and nearly half of all children born in Chile in the early years of the 21st century were born to unmarried couples .
In Italy , Singapore , and Japan , divorce , cohabitation , and out - of - wedlock births remain low by American standards , but a much larger percentage of women avoid marriage and childbearing altogether .
This suggests that we are experiencing a massive historical current that , if blocked in one area , simply flows over traditional paths of family life at a different spot .
The late 20th - century revolution in the role and function of marriage has been as far - reaching — and as wrenching — as the replacement of local craft production and exchange by wage labor and industrialization .
Like the Industrial Revolution , the family diversity revolution has undercut old ways of organizing work , leisure , caregiving , and redistribution to dependents .
It has liberated some people from restrictive , socially imposed statuses , but stripped others of customary support systems and rules for behavior , without putting clearly defined new ones in place .
There have been winners and losers in the marriage revolution , just as there were in the Industrial Revolution .
But we will not meet the challenges of this transformation by trying to turn back the clock .
Instead we must take two lessons away from these historical changes .
First , marriage is not on the verge of extinction .
Most cohabiting couples eventually do get married , either to each other or to someone else .
New groups , such as gays and lesbians , are now demanding access to marriage — a demand that many pro-marriage advocates oddly interpret as an attack on the institution .
And a well - functioning marriage is still an especially useful and effective method of organizing interpersonal commitments and improving people ’s well - being .
But in today ’s climate of gender equality and personal choice , we must realize that successful marriages require different traits , skills , and behaviors than in the past .
Marriages used to depend upon a clear division of labor and authority , and couples who rejected those rules had less stable marriages than those who abided by them .
In the 1950s , a woman ’s best bet for a lasting marriage was to marry a man who believed firmly in the male breadwinner ideal .
Women who wanted a “ Mrs. degree ” were often advised to avoid the “ bachelor ’s ” degree , since as late as 1967 men told pollsters they valued a woman ’s cooking and housekeeping skills above her intelligence or education .
Women who had n’t married by age 25 were less likely to ever marry than their more traditional counterparts , and studies in the 1960s suggested that if they did marry at an older age than average they were more likely to divorce .
When a wife took a job outside the home , this raised the risk of marital dissolution .
All that has changed today .
Today , men rank intelligence and education way above cooking and housekeeping as a desirable trait in a partner .
A recent study by Paul Amato et al. found that the chance of divorce recedes with each year that a woman postpones marriage , with the least divorce - prone marriages being those where the couples got married at age 35 or higher .
Educated and high - earning women are now less likely to divorce than other women .
When a wife takes a job today , it works to stabilize the marriage .
Couples who share housework and productive work have more stable marriages than couples who do not , according to sociologist Lynn Prince Cooke .
And the Amato study found that husbands and wives who hold egalitarian views about gender have higher marital quality and fewer marital problems than couples who cling to more traditional views .
So there is no reason to give up on building successful marriages — but we wo n’t do it by giving people outdated advice about gender roles .
We may be able to bring the divorce rate down a little further — but since one method of doing that is to get more people to delay marriage , this will probably lead to more cohabitation .
We may also be able to reverse last year ’s uptick in teen births and return to the downward course of the late 1990s and first few years of the 21st century — but not by teaching abstinence - only to young people who , if they do delay marriage , are almost certainly going to have sex beforehand .
The second lesson of history is that the time has passed when we can construct our social policies , work schedules , health insurance systems , sex education programs — or even our moral and ethical beliefs about who owes what to whom — on the assumption that all long - term commitments and care - giving obligations should or can be organized through marriage .
Of course we must seek ways to make marriage more possible for couples and to strengthen the marriages they contract .
But we must be equally concerned to help couples who do n’t marry become better co-parents , to help single parents and cohabiting couples meet their obligations , and to teach divorced parents how to minimize their conflicts and improve their parenting .
The right research and policy question today is not “ what kind of family do we wish people lived in ? ”
Instead , we must ask “ what do we know about how to help every family build on its strengths , minimize its weaknesses , and raise children more successfully ? ”
Much recent hysteria to the contrary , we know a lot about how to do that .
We should devote more of our energies to getting that research out and less to fantasizing about a return to a mythical Golden Age of marriage of the past .

When the premise is " Diebold electronic voting machines cannot produce incorrect vote results " , then the logical deduction stream will never reach a contrary conclusion .
Thus " women 's reaction to Clinton 's crying " , the " white racial animus against Obama " , yada , yada , yada , takes the fools downstream downMSMstream fast .

Genuinely forthright and honest politicians such as Dennis Kucinich and Ron Paul are entirely shut out of the debates by the fascist corporate media .

Is n't this enough at this point in time to actually use this as " reasonable doubt " as to the accuracy of these corrupt electronic vote tabulation devices , and furthermore to also group in certain folks in the democratic party ( Which we all have suspected ) as to their reasons for " not giving a shit " about electronic vote tabulation devices . a.)
We know the manufacturers are corrupt .
( e.g. physics and electronics )
b. )
We knew the republicans were affiliated .
( e.g. business deals )
c. )
We suspected the democrats as complicit as well .

The anonymous blogger has the obvious immediate solution :
For all of us who are interested in a recount , there seems to be a real possibility of one .
There were 42 candidates on the Dem +
Rep ballots and any one of them can request a recount .
It seems like Albert Howard , one of those 42 , is inclined to do so .
If we can contact him and offer to raise the money for recount , he will likely request an official recount .
Our chance is now .
( Blogger Anonymous , emphasis added ) .
I will entertain argument that it is impossible to have a recount because the paper ballots have not been counted the first time yet ...
At least by human beings who can make errors but usually do n't in such premises ...
The relevant count so far has been done by diebold machines that " ca n't make errors " but usually do in such premises .

She confirmed that the Ron Paul totals in Sutton were actually 31 , and said that they were " left off the tally sheet " and it was human error .
This is not an acceptable answer , especially because one of the most common forms of fraud in a hand count system is to alter or omit results on the reporting sheet .
Hand count is lovely , transparent .
They then fill out another reconciliation sheet , often in front of witnesses , and it looks fine .
Then they provide a summary or media sheet with the incorrect results .
A Web site here : http://www.wheresthepaper.org has more on fraud techniques with hand counted paper ballots .
You 'll have to dig for it --- or Google , and the excellent research on this is Theresa Hommel from the state of New York . "
It does n't look like Obama is going to stand up and be counted , so if people are truly interested in seeing a recount , the only candidate who has the will to make this happen is Ron Paul .
BRAD , PLEASE CONTACT THE RON PAUL CAMPAIGN , THEY ARE INTERESTED IN YOUR VOICE .

The real problem with politics are people that are so swept up in conspiracy theories that they really appear to have lost all of their mental faculties .

Get a grip !
Exit polls ARE not scientific .
As was shown with the Doug Wilder race in Virginia ( you would have heard this if you actually listened on Hardball ) , the Exit Polls showed that he was winning in a landslide , but the actual count only ended up at 1 % .
NO one !
I mean NO ONE , has asserted that this was a bogus / tampered election .
The fact is bigots do n't want to have to answer to being bigots .

The new definition of credibility is " the ability to bullshit over and over again without anyone caring " .
John Zogby has morphed into that place too , concerning Pre-election polling .
It now has no close basis in relation to what is actually going to happen , but still they are " credible " he says .
Nutcases in the " get over it " crowd confuse Exit Polling with " that credible " form of polling .
They can't get over under or around science .
I posted this after the ' 04 election :
Exit Poll Science
Exit poll science provides tools that have been used for decades successfully .
Accurate predictions are the legacy of these tools .
The 2000 and 2004 official election results were at odds with the exit poll predictions .
Those doing the polls ... were of the popular mindset " it ca n't happen here " .
This mindset is not prepared to entertain any notion of election [ fraud or malfunction ] as the reason for the massive first time discrepancies .
They instead offered the explanation that " republicans were more shy than democrats " and that is why the massive discrepancy .
They did not even consider [ fraud or malfunction ] .
A study done by 8 Phd's and one MS pointed this out and that [ fraud or malfunction ] must not be ruled out ( link here ) .
They said : " 3 . Inaccurate Election Results [ fraud or malfunction ] [ Analysts ] did not even consider this hypothesis , and thus made no effort to contradict it .
Some ... exit poll data may be construed as affirmative evidence for inaccurate election results .
We conclude that the hypothesis that the voters ’ intent was not accurately recorded or counted [ fraud or malfunction ] cannot be ruled out and needs further investigation " ( ibid .
at page 3 , bold and " [ fraud or malfunction ] " added ) .
Other experts have said : " Flaws in any of these aspects of a voting system , however , can lead to indecisive or incorrect election results " ( link here ) .
... the MSM , who used the data , can't bear to even consider that America could be corrupted in its election processes .
A position entirely at odds with common sense and scientific inquiry .
( Olde Bradblog post ) .
Hey , its deja vu all over again .
The machines are infallible in Amurka , and thus fraud or malfunction cannot , as a matter of FAITH , even be considered .
That is the " get over it science " of modern electioneering ... which is actually a psychosis of denial .
Last time it brought us preznit blush and the fiasco of sickness ...
God only knows what it would bring this time around .
No wonder Mac is so happy ... he can stay in Iraq for " a million years " .
Wow !!!!

I am not some wild eyed screw ball , what I am is an engineer ( BSEE ) from a major university , who has been working in and around computers since 1985 - As soon as I heard that physical , verified and back - checked no - audit trail e-tabulation was occurring again , I KNEW we were in serious trouble , and then when the significant delta showed up - that was the ball game .
I must tell you this , and its only me , we must all decide what action we will take - IF Obama ( whom I have been solidly for ) does not challenge this ( and I 'm NOT simply talking sour grapes ) and remains moot , as Kerry did - I 'm done - I 'm moving over to Paul .

A Plunger Flashback : YOUR STOLEN NATION … EXIT POLLS DON’T LIE – GET EDUCATED – ALERT THE MEDIA !
Rove has telegraphed his punch , and now it ’s up to all of us to call BULLSHIT on his BULLSHIT .
Speaking on a recent NPR interview , Rove stated that he actually sees upward of 36 different polls – many of which predict a GOP victory in the coming elections .
He ’s simply lying .
He ’s lying to create a mindset of doubt – in order to better enable the theft of the election through means other than the ballot box .
The GOP has effectively hijacked America .
Bush did not win the election in 2004 .
Exit polls do n’t lie… but Rove does .
Revisit the exit polling data from 2004 and share it with others : http://en.wikipedia.org/...ontroversy%2C_exit_polls
Call it to the attention of the media .
Let the media know that we WILL NOT TOLERATE another stolen election , nor will we tolerate their complicity in disparaging the validity of Exit Polling as a valuable check against election fraud .
CNN ’s Jeff Greenfield was interviewed about the forthcoming elections , and his parting comment at the end of the segment was what would have appeared to be an off - handed disparaging remark about the reliability of Exit Polls .
Greenfield was / is shilling for Rove – and this was a TALKING POINT ordered up by Rove .
“ Exit Polling ” had not been part of the prior discussion , but was something that he slipped in at the end of the segment – as if ordered to do so .
DON ’T LET THEM SWIFTBOAT “ EXIT POLLING ” Learn about the company Rove has hired to conduct and report fraudulent exit poll results – which will stand in sharp contrast to all other exit polls :
The GOP has employed a firm called Penn , Schoen , & Berland to skew exit poll results in the past in order to achieve their own political ends .
They are on Rove ’s payroll : http://www.vheadline.com/readnews.asp?id=70727

Further , exit poll data is virtually SCREAMED at as the data is collected .... not 3 days later ... where was this exit polling on that night , or 2 nights ago , Chrissy - I hate the Clintons - Matthews ?

Pertaining to the issue I mentioned above in comment # 30 , I just sent MoveOn the following email : Dear Noah and friends , I have to be blunt .
You have seriously dropped the ball on this one , and your email makes your organization look extremely ignorant and gullible .
There is serious evidence of election fraud in the New Hampshire results .
Please to go www.bradblog.com and have an open minded look .
In particular , get to the part where people have looked , and found that the counties where votes were tallied by hand match the exit polls , with Obama winning , whereas in the machine - counted counties , there is a huge discrepancy toward Clinton .
This begs to be investigated in these machine - counted counties , where the counting is done via hackable , insecure Diebold optical scanners .
These machines can be preloaded with hacked memory cards having negative totals for some candidates and positive totals for other candidates , and it is not detectable unless the votes from that machine are counted by hand to see if the results match .
This is generally not done , because people are generally ignorant of the possibility .
Your org .

Please , I beg you , it 's just our democracy that is at stake !

This entire sham is specifically designed to abolish the practice of Exit Polling in order to enable election theft :
Does this old posting raise any concerns ?
THE SWIFTBOATING OF “ EXIT POLLING ” Last night it started .
CNN ’s Jeff Greenfield was interviewed about the forthcoming elections , and his parting comment at the end of the segment was what would have appeared to be an off - handed disparaging remark about the reliability of Exit Polls .
Greenfield was / is shilling for Rove – and this was a TALKING POINT ordered up by Rove .
“ Exit Polling ” had not been part of the prior discussion , but was something that he slipped in at the end of the segment – as if ordered to do so .
Rove has been interviewed in recent days proclaiming that HIS polling ( which he proclaims nobody else has access to and is superior to all other polling data ) portrays the key races to be very close , not nearly the blowouts that the REALITY BASED COMMUNITY is seeing .
THIS IS A SET UP .
If you are going to STEAL AN ELECTION VIA VOTE RIGGING – you need to lay the ground work – planting doubt in the minds of the electorate through the media shills .
Exit polling has been a reliable method by which to approximate the result of elections prior to the final votes being tallied .
Exit polling has only been called into question in the last two election cycles – but ONLY because the Exit Polling data were not confirmed by the final “ official ” vote tally .
As has now been proven , it was not the Exit Polling data that was inaccurate or unreliable , it was the reporting of the Official Total ” that had been tampered with .
It ’s time to TAKE THE OFFENSIVE where Exit Polling is concerned and reveal this Swiftboating of “ Exit Polling ” for what it is – a Rovian sham designed specifically to condition the electorate to disbelieve the exit poll results ( which will portray the house and Senate going under Democratic Control ) , and rather to only believe the “ Official ” ( FALSE ) vote count .
The Mainstream Media is fully complicit in the Rovian Brainwashing campaign to discredit “ Exit Polling ” as unscientific hoohah , when in fact it is the smoking gun EVIDENCE of election fraud used throughout the world .
Ask International Elections Observers about the value of Exit Polling .
THE TRICK THEY ARE USING IS TO GET THE AMERICAN PEOPLE TO DEMAND THAT EXIT POLLING BE ABOLISHED - AS IF THE EXIT POLLING WERE THE PROBLEM .

I have long been in favor of adopting this system for the lower houses of our legislatures , including the U.S. House of Representatives .
This would improve on our system of checks and balances .
Instead of the whole government consisting of elected politicians and persons appointed by them , a body made up of average citizens could veto what the politicians and appointees in the rest of the government did ( and the politicians and appointees would serve as a check on the average citizens ) .

I note that the best argument that Clinton actually won the election and all the preelection polls were wrong is because she led , by polls , in all of 2007 .
So polls from last year were accurate , but all polls leading up to the election in the last few days were wrong , and MSNBC 's unadjusted exit poll was wrong too .
Essentially , the poster suggests that old polls were accurate , recent polls are n't .
And Hillary won .
The rest of the arguments have been , essentially , " You are nuts , shut up . "

This situation is not a problem with POLLING , its a problem with the MSM REPORTING of the polling .
Why is no one bringing up margin of error here ?
Why is no one bring up the fact that there was a lot of information on these polls regarding soft support ?
Why are the undecided barely mentioned in the reporting ?
These polls were accurate within their margin of error and when factor in the undecided voters / soft support .
Instead of factoring in these issues , everyone only pays attention to the number next to the candidates name .
This is a nonstory and frankly makes me slightly embarrassed that more people have n’t seen it as such …

I sent the following letter to the Manchester Union Leader this morning .
Perhaps they should hear from more of us .
To The Editor , I am writing to raise a question regarding the recent primary election results in your state .
Many have expressed shock at the big deviation from polls regarding the Obama / Clinton results .
Since a large percentage of votes were counted on Diebold optical scan machines , there is concern being expressed of tampering by the company to affect the outcome .
This data below is very worrying , when comparing the proportion of the vote counted by hand ( which should be correct ) with the machine counted results ( where there is no verification ) .
I wonder why there is nothing being reported on this discrepancy ( my own calculations show that it could affect about 19,000 * votes ) ?
Of course , this is not proof of fraud , but since all the votes were done on paper ballots , including those counted on the machines , it seems like it might warrant a closer examination of the actual ballots , you would think .
There could be reasons the votes in the larger cities , which are largely machine counted , could be different from the smaller towns , where most of the hand counted results are taken .
However , even in those smaller towns , the machine counted vote and the hand counted vote seems to deviate significantly .
It appears that the machines give Clinton a 40 % - 36 % advantage , while the hand count of nearly 55,000 votes gives Obama a 39 % - 35 % advantage .
It would be interesting to look at the raw exit polling data to see what indications that gives to this question .
Certainly it would make sense to arrange something like this if the Republicans want Clinton as their opposition , and fear Obama .
We certainly would have a different scenario today in this race if Obama had gotten 111,500 votes and Clinton had gotten only 99,800 ( which would be true if the hand - counted percentages of votes was an accurate representation of the overall voting ) .
Since a relatively small number of votes in the Democratic primary were counted by optical scan machines ( 228,307 ) , it would seem that calling for a hand count of these paper ballots would go a long way to assuring the public that these privately counted votes can be trusted .
Fortunately , New Hampshire has the actual ballots that were counted by the optical scan machines .
New Hampshire could do our country a great service in confirming the validity of this very surprising result , and allaying some of the fears of many that such unverified tallying of our precious votes is a threat to our democracy .
Thank you .
Jim Oberg
Wilsonville , OR * PS : I think whoever put this chart together miscalculated the number of votes affected .
Instead of the difference in vote counts being based on the total vote , it should be calculated on the total machine count ( 228,307 ) , and assume that the hand counted votes ( 59,157 ) are correctly counted .

The fix was put in by the Rove cadre of the GOP .
They know that they will lose to Obama .
They also know that they can beat Hillary .
Therein lies the motive .
From today 's NYT : First , the problem was not a general failure of polling methodology .
These same pollsters did a superb job on the Republican side .
Senator John McCain won by 5.5 percent .
The last wave of polls found a margin of 5.3 percent .
So whatever the problem was , it was specific to Mrs. Clinton versus Mr. Obama .
Second , the inaccuracies do n’t seem related to the subtleties of polling methods .
The pollsters who overestimated Mr. Obama ’s margin ranged from CBS and Gallup ( who have the most rigorous voter screens and sampling designs , and have sterling records in presidential elections ) to local and computerized polling operations , whose methods are a good deal less refined .
Everyone got it wrong .
Third , the mistakes were not the result of a last - minute trend going Mrs. Clinton ’s way .
Yes , according to exit polls the 17 percent of voters who said they made their decision on Election Day chose Mrs. Clinton a little more than those who decided in the past two or three weeks .
But the margin was very small — 39 percent of the late deciders went for Mrs. Clinton and 36 percent went for Mr. Obama .
This gap is obviously too narrow to explain the wide lead for Mr. Obama that kept showing up in pre-election polls .
Fourth , some have argued that the unusually high turnout may have caused a problem for the pollsters .
It ’s possible , but unlikely .
While participation was higher than in past New Hampshire primaries , the demographic and political profile of the vote remains largely unchanged .
In particular , the mix of Democrats to independents — 54 percent to 44 percent respectively — is close to what it was in 2000 , the most recent New Hampshire primary without an incumbent in the race .

Does n't Rove still command a small cadre of fake Democrats in New Hampshire , the same ones he used to caller - ID those Democratic call centers and jam them ?
So , considering that Rove knows something the rest of us as yet do n't ( Hillary 's " fatal flaw " was never articulated , but it was referenced by the Rovian , so we might assume it 's a trump card held close for the general election ) is it any wonder they might make certain Hillary gets the nomination , so they can skewer her with their dirty little secret (s ) when the time comes ?
And what of the billion - dollar campaign projections that a New Hampshire loss for Clinton would have halved ?
Those media moguls are n't about to give this newest Diebold deception any coverage , Matthews keeps questioning the results , but no one seems to want to make this Diebold connection on the MSM .
And who benefits most from a continuation of Clinton 's campaign ?
1 . The Republicans who think they have some dirt that will bury her in the general , or 2 . the MSM that wants that easy - money campaign advertising revenue ?
Hillary may not even know what happened , but no doubt someone on her staff does .
Something 's rotten in New Hampshire this time around .

It is two steps in one game they have chosen to play .

The headline is misleading : ' Was Ahead an Average of 8 Points , Even in Our Own Exit Polls ' compared to :
What we do n't know is why the victory is so much different in fact , then the polling ahead of time , including what we call the Exit Polls were telling us .
Obama was ahead in those polls by an average of 8 points , and even our own Exit Polls , taken as people came out of voting , showed him ahead .
I read this as saying that the polling before the primary as having Obama +8 , and he definitely does n't say that the MSNBC exit polls showed him +8 , just that he was ahead .
I 'm definitely curious , and I was excited when I saw the headline - maybe we finally had hard exit poll numbers .
But we do n't .

Josh , Nick ,
There 's a very simple solution to this , do n't you think ?
Simply grab 10 % of the machine counted locations and VERIFY the counts were right ...
How long would that take ?
A day ?
Then we'd know if the machines were accurate or not ( but you have to make sure you do a fully random sampling ) .
See , some people went to prison in Ohio for rigging the recount in 2004 , they made sure their ' sample ' fit the desired results before they declared it was a " random sampling " ..
By making sure they only picked places that matched , they made sure no one looked at the machine counts as a whole .
... PRISON , guys .. for rigging a recount to ensure no one looked at the machines ..
That does n't bother you ?
" The real problem with politics are people that are so swept up in conspiracy theories that they really appear to have lost all of their mental faculties . "
Conspiracies happen , that 's a fact .
Conspiracy , like liberal or pie , is not a " bad word " , your using in a negative context shows your intentions .
Theory is a " potential outcome " that is based in fact / evidence , again , not " bad things " .
So , the only thing seeming to be lacking mental faculties is the assertion that " proved hackable machines in the hands of one private company that 's consistently LIED about the vulnerability of the machines could never do anything nefarious " .
The " machine results " do not match the expected results , but the " hand results " do .. explain that , would ya ? ...
Oh , right ... you 'll go off on some distraction because YOU CAN'T ANSWER THE QUESTION with anything REASONABLE ..
If you COULD , we 'd not be having this conversation .. lol ..

The big winner ( in terms of excess votes in machine counted vs hand counted ballots ) is the MITTSTER - Mitt managed to get 16000 + extra votes at the expense of Huckster ( 4500 votes ) McCave ( 7300 votes ) and Rong Paul ( 4000 votes ) .
On the Dem side Clinton got 14000 + extra vptes out of the machines at the expense of Obama ( 7500 votes ) Richardson ( 3500 votes ) and even Kucinich and " other " had statistically significant undercounts compared with the hand counted ballots .
After crunching the numbers , the speculation rises in my mind that the MITTster campaign did a deal with the LHS creeps to insure a win and break Obamas surge , but he sold so poorly in NH that he could n't even steal it !

I note that the best argument that Clinton actually won the election and all the preelection polls were wrong is because she led , by polls , in all of 2007 .
So polls from last year were accurate , but all polls leading up to the election in the last few days were wrong , and MSNBC 's unadjusted exit poll was wrong too .
Essentially , the poster suggests that old polls were accurate , recent polls are n't .
And Hillary won .
The rest of the arguments have been , essentially , " You are nuts , shut up . "
Sorry , but if you believe results of Diebold machines as a matter of faith after the last few elections , you are a fool . " 1 ) Why am I holding up past polls and dismissing current ones ?
a )
Eighty polls ( 80 ) over an extended period of time , or
b ) 10 polls over 4 - 5 days Hmmm ... I wonder which one has the best statistical accuracy ?
Again , where were the exit poll data if we had immediate access to demographic data ?
Voter fraud occurs ... yes .
But for a group of people , and a media which demonizes a woman ( this time ) for LIES and CRAP , and people buy into this sh*t ( fake accent , in the south , pandering ... turns out to be reading passage from a book )
Obama making appearance witha gay homophobe , fading away even as calls were made for him to distance himself ... well , whatever .
Either way they have the IDENTICAL voting records to show for .
Except Obama 's controversial votes are MISSING ; he does n't take a stand because he 's playing it safe ... He has an out on Iraq , because he was n't able to vote ... so of course he verbally disagrees with it because he lives and dies in a DEMOCRAT strong hold .

... Bob In Pacifica said on 1/10/2008 @ 11:16 am PT ...
Here is an explanation for why Obama gave up early and for why Clinton - supporters should demand an immediate investigation , and why it wo n't happen .
1 . When the results came in so incredibly skewed from locations using the Diebold machines Obama and his staff KNEW it had been fixed .
WHAT TO DO :
He could n't demand a recount without looking bad , it was only a few delegates , and while it would have been nice to damage Clinton early in the race the bad publicity would not have been worth it .
The best thing to do in the circumstances was to smile , wave at the crowd and then get out of Dodge .
2 . There is demonstrable evidence that there is something very wrong about the voting results .
Clinton 's own polls showed her losing by 11 points .
However , to presume that the Clinton campaign would be so desperate as to fix the New Hampshire primary is ludicrous .
It says that she would risk her credibility on one primary .
Now imagine we are past the conventions and into the campaign for the general election .
Clinton has won the nomination .
Someone akin to Carl Rove suddenly leaks a story that Clinton stole the New Hampshire primary when she was about to be blown out of the race way back in January .
Thus Clinton 's credibility is ruined .
Who are you going to vote for , a patriot or a thief ?
I 've explained why Obama can't win by asking for a recount .
Clinton can't very well say that the election was stolen for her but she does n't know who did it .
That sounds stupid and unbelievable .
However , who is connected to Diebold et al ?
Who would benefit by a weak Hillary ?
And maybe there is another primary in the coming months that Diebolds results to Obama .
Now both leading Democratic candidates are dirty .
And so there is a ticking timebomb waiting to go off this fall and hurt all Democratic candidates for all offices .
So it goes .

He 's not into taking the right of choice away from a woman and giving it to a backward state government and has a great plan to fight climate change caused by human pollution and the greenhouse effect .
Unfortunatelly Dr. Ron

*** VOTE FRAUD CONFIRMED IN SUSSEX NH BY BEV HARRIS !!!***
Ron Paul was given 0 votes in Sussex and three people who voted for him there raised their voices .
Bev Harris checked up on it and the clerk in that county HAS NOW BEEN FORCED TO ADMIT Ron Paul got 31 votes , not " 0 " .
They are claiming human error but Bev Harris is n't buying it .
http://www.bbvforums.org...gi?file=/1954/71200.html
" UPDATE JAN 9 9am PST : TOWN OF SUTTON CONFIRMS RON PAUL TOTALS WERE 31 , NOT ZERO .
I just got off the phone with Jennifer Call , Town Clerk for Sutton .
She confirmed that the Ron Paul totals in Sutton were actually 31 , and said that they were " left off the tally sheet " and it was human error .
This is not an acceptable answer , especially because one of the most common forms of fraud in a hand count system is to alter or omit results on the reporting sheet .
Hand count is lovely , transparent .
They then fill out another reconciliation sheet , often in front of witnesses , and it looks fine .
Then they provide a summary or media sheet with the incorrect results .
A Web site here : http://www.wheresthepaper.org has more on fraud techniques with hand counted paper ballots .
You 'll have to dig for it --- or Google , and the excellent research on this is Theresa Hommel from the state of New York . "
It does n't look like Obama is going to stand up and be counted , so if people are truly interested in seeing a recount , the only candidate who has the will to make this happen is Ron Paul .
BRAD , PLEASE CONTACT THE RON PAUL CAMPAIGN , THEY ARE INTERESTED IN YOUR VOICE .
Wait , so reverse logic says Hillary could have gotten MORE votes than what were counted because people could have left vote tallies off the record for her ?
Hah .. whatever .
Even if a vote recount show she still won , you people still wo n't be happy .

This is how it will probably be played : First , there will be some rumbling of new evidence of fraud .
Then there will be confirmatory evidence of similar frauds throughout New Hampshire .
Then there will be some kind information indicating a relationship between Clinton 's campaign , or Clinton personally , to the voting machine company .
Maybe some kind of payment from the Clinton campaign to some parallel company , or to maybe a polling service owned by the same guy , which suggests her campaign paid off the Diebold machines ' owner .
Or maybe there will be a picture of her standing next to the Diebold machines ' owner , a la the picture of Rosalyn Carter with John Wayne Gacy .

If there was a fraud , the rational is interesting .
The vendor of the voting services is a notorious winger who would see little value in diddling the election for McCain who was likely to win anyway .
But in what appears to be an obvious fraud how could this entity push votes to do the most damage to the Democrats .
It would seem that to do damage the reputation of the strongest candidate , Senator Clinton could be possible .
An accusation of Clinton fraud would be more damaging than any loss could cause .
If fraud is shown in this , and after the perp is waterboarded , it will be shown that there is an effort to hurt the Clinton campaign .
The campaign should immediately call a press conference and deny the victory until it is shown that it was earned honestly .
A Clinton sponsored recount would be much less expensive than an accusation of vote count fraud .

Wow , that is amazing .
Could n't Hillary do a better job of commiting felonies .
I mean wtf , it is like she got one too many plastic surgeries .
From another site ...
Looking back at the 2004 primaries may give a good idea of how many " other " votes we should see during such an election .
In 2004 , Bush was the incumbent so the Republican results are n't really valid as most Republicans were n't willing to " compete " with their own party .
The Democrats however give us a better picture of what is " normal " perhaps in an open primary .
The data came from : http://www.boston.com/ne...ry_dem_town-by-town.html
We can see the Dems cast a total of 255,277 votes with a total of 1268 " other " votes .
If we carry that out to the current overall total in 2008 of 287,580 votes we would expect to see appx .
1428 " other " votes in NH .
However , we see 4,627 !
This is a 324 % increase of the expected total ...!
Now , let 's look at Republicans ... using the reference point above we should expect to see 1187 " other " votes ... but we see an amazing 5733 !
This is an increase over the expected amount by a ridiculous 483 % !
As a double check to this we can go back and look at the 2000 Republican NH primary , another case where there was no incumbent .
Based on those numbers ( 236,802 votes with 2001 " other " ) we would expect to see 2019 votes on the Republican side or a difference of a still remarkable 284 % !
In other words , SOMETHING IS SERIOUSLY WRONG HERE .

I searched the NH exit polls on a google .
The articles that turned up ask a bunch of questions but NOT who did the people actually vote for .
See NYT article at top of google search .
Does anyone have a link to the breakdown of the percentages of people voting for each candidate from the exit polls .
Can we get that info ?
Why is this not published in MSM ?

From Pollster.com : 1 ) An exit poll is just a survey .
Like other surveys , it is subject to random sampling error and , as those who follow exit polls now understand , occasional problems with non-response bias .
In New Hampshire ( in 1992 ) and Arizona ( in 1996 ) * primary election exit polls overstated support for Patrick Buchanan , probably because his more enthusiastic supporters were more willing to be interviewed ( and for those tempted to hit he comment button , yes , I know that some believe those past errors suggest massive vote fraud --- I have written about that subject at great length ) .
2 ) The networks rarely " call " an election on exit poll results alone .
The decision desk analysts require a very high degree of statistical confidence ( at least 99.5 % ) before they will consider calling a winner ( the ordinary " margin of error " on pre-election polls typically uses a 95 % confidence level ) .
They will also wait for actual results if the exit poll is very different from pre-election poll trends .
So a single - digit margin on an exit poll is almost never sufficient to say that a particular candidate will win .
3 ) Watch out for " The Prior . "
At least two networks are likely to post exit poll tabulations shortly after the polls close that will update as the election night wears on ( try these links for MSNBC and CNN ) .
Those data are weighted to whatever estimate of the outcome the analysts have greatest confidence in at any moment .
By the end of the night , the tabulations will be weighted to the official count .
Typically , the exit poll tabulations are weighted to something called the " Composite Estimate , " a combination of the exit poll data alone and a " Prior Estimate " that is based largely on pre-election poll results .
So if you look to extrapolate from the initial tabulations posted on MSNBC or CNN ( as we did here on Election Night 2006 ) , just keep in mind that in the estimate of each candidate 's standing in the initial reports will likely mix exit poll and the pre-election poll estimates ( not unlike the kind we report here ) .

After the election results , the exit polls are " adjusted " to match the election results .
Perhaps some stalwart citizen will divulge the real exit polls before they were altered .

the difference between exit polls and actual results in hand count and electronic machine precincts look vary familiar , check out stat analysis of 2004 election , below are parts of a reader review on Amazon , of the book Was The 2004 Presidential Election Stolen ? : Exit Polls , Election Fraud , and the Official Count .
Check out the stats quoted in the second bullet point , look familiar ??? : ......
Discrepancies between poll exit interviews and official vote counts are far beyond the limits of statistical probability in many places .
* Exit poles closely tracked vote counts in precincts that used paper ballots in the 2000 and 2004 elections .
* Exit poles diverged by 6 - 7 % from certified vote counts on electronic voting machines .
... *
In 2000 , 2002 and 2004 , virtually all large discrepancies favor Republicans , which coincidence has odds of occurrence of one in millions .
For the past 40 years , poll exit interviews have proven highly reliable checks on integrity of elections .
Exit polling methods have been refined to account for numerous secondary distortions in accuracy , such as different response rates to exit poles by various demographic and political groups .

" That leads people to believe hand counting and Diebold votes were BOTH performed in each district ; that is FALSE . "
The problem with that statement is you came to a conclusion that makes no sense .
It 's CLEARLY noted for anyone reading THIS article , or the SITES WITH THE STATS that " each district " was " either " hand OR machine counted .
...
So , we have " areas that were hand counted " , or " hand counted ballots " nearly MATCHED the " expected results " , while the MACHINE COUNTED areas do NOT .
That SHOULD cause one to at LEAST pause ..
But , since your horse won and you think this is about your horse , you REFUSE to use REASON and look at this objectively .
You DO realize that Billary has MORE delegates than Obama , right ?
Even if she LOST NH ?
Even if she did n't GO to NH ?

Oh and why have the totals changed after they were certified ( seems a bit odd huh ? ) ?
What is Hillary 's obsession with being a coward ?
Why does n't she actually enter an election for once ?
Well it does not matter the recount has already been initiated , now instead of dealing with the over 20 instances of fraud and corruption we can isolate Hillary 's manipulation of the new ballots .
You know the ones she already ordered for the recount .

And at $ 46,000 for a recount , that is pretty cheap compared to other states .
But it would be a huge mistake .
The paul people are going to screw the election intregrity folks by walking into this baited trap .
Step 1 - make a big stink and get media coverage
Step 2 - recount shows paper ballots ( with little or no chain of custody ) match the electronic tabulation
Step 3 - ???
Diebold profits
We all lose .
There will be no fraud found in NH .
If they did rig it on opscan , they had a plan to swap ballots to match .
We are talking about a few delegates ( who cares ) in exchange for having the media ever listen to EI folks again .
I agree with this statement --

http://www.realclearpoli...c_primary-194.html#polls
And the early ( unadjusted ) exit poll had Obama winning : by 8 % .

Once again , as in 2004 and 2006 , the average of the final pre-election polls matched the unadjusted exit poll .

He insulted Hillary during the debate with phrases he 'd learned playing pickup basketball at Harvard - I was struck by a thought :
What if Rove operatives - the fixers of the last three elections - put in the fix to eliminate the candidate Rove fears and help the candidate he thinks Republicans can beat ?

Good point , but might I offer up a foolishly optimistic , but certainly worth considering , alternative to the possible RECOUNT scenario you 've outlined :
1 ) HAND COUNT THE VOTES
2 ) ENSURE the process is random , transparent , and witnessed by the public .
If anyone could insist on and ACTUALLY GET that , it would be the RON PAUL supporters .
They got a blimp .
Betcha they could get a recount , too .
3 ) WATCH THE PROCESS like a paranoid hawk with a videocamcorder in the hen house and a hard - on for hurtin ' the bad guys and a ) if the random sampling / recount is NOT accurate THEN we :
4 ) MAKE A BIG STINK AND GET MEDIA COVERAGE .
... and if the results from the OPEN COUNTING THE VOTES in PUBLIC , and ( emphasis added ) the public is now MILLIONS OF PEOPLE STRONG n' UNIFIED and AWAKE ( interest and participation rates higher than we here in the EI community have ever enjoyed ) -- if these results are valid , then is n't that a GOOD thing ?...
I 'm no Polyanna ... much more of a Cassandra , really .
I , for one , am not expecting any reassurances to come from this recount / I 've lived through a couple ( barely ) and I think when the RON PAUL supporters , and in fact the candidate himself , and hell even OPRAH -- bring their cameras down to the recount -- they wo n't stand for the process as is .
.. we always ask , in this forum , with our fists to the sky : WHERE IS THE OUTRAGE ?
( I would suggest it lives in Kenya , where homeless men , woman and children huddle around thier fires in refugee camps ... watching the New Hampshire election results coming in and call it " rigged " . )
What if a recount in NH further exposes this devilish tyranny ?
What if the election engineering master class did n't prepare for RON PAUL supporters matching funding dollar to dollar on - line , or the tenacity and smarts of BRADBLOG readers , or -- God Forbid -- First AND Second Ammendment people WORKING TOGETHER ... Mets AND

It 's clear that the establishment wants Hillary on that ticket , for potentially various reasons .
If she wins , she 's just a Shrub Light , and shilling for the insurance industry to boot ..
Or , they know " she " is easy to trash ..
Romney cried yesterday when asked about his dead father , not a peep from the media ..
Billary has a - waiver - in her voice , the media implies she was BAWLING ..
I was pretty disgusted when I saw the video of what - actually - happened ..
The media is - definitely - gunning for her .
What 's more disturbing ..
NPR / WPR ( Wisconsin Public Radio ) again today slapped down this conversation ..
They were talking with a guy from a watchdog called Accuracy In Media ( aim.org , I think ) and were talking about how the " media just got it wrong " about NH ..
Apparently some INFORMED called called in and said something about the machine counts ( I did n't hear it ) because Joy Cardine said " we 're not talking about hacked machines or nine eleven or anything like that , we 're just talking about the media " .
.. the " expert 's " assertion of what happened ?
" Democrats just got tired of all these polls and simply lied about who they were going to vote for " ..
* boggle *.. and only the people voting for Hillary and Obama , apparently , since all the other races closely matched their polls ..
Hmmmm ..
How do you have a conversation about the " media getting it wrong " if they DIDN 'T get it wrong ?
.. false premise leads to false conclusions , which helps no one .
And this " expert " not ONCE mentioned how the media is a circus because that 's what makes money ..
He [ rightly ] said Journalists were " lazy " these days , but failed to acknowledge that all the - real - journos are gone ..
The reason we have all these " pundits " and " talking heads " is because THAT'S WHAT SELLS COMMERCIAL SLOTS .
Follow the money , stupid ..
Pretty piss poor watchdog if they are n't pointing their finger right in the face of capitalism ..
The guy 's suggestion ..
" look for other news outlets , do n't bother with the mainstream " ..
Ok , great .. good idea .. saying that on NPR where a very small percentage of people listen ..
And it does n't address the serious problems with our media .. how about some suggestions to fixing things ?
I called in last night and mentioned that part of the massive cost of a campaign these days ( over $ 1 billion is going to be spent on the Presidency , they think ) is ADVERTISING .. and networks # 2 or # 3 revenue stream is political ads ..
The guy said " exactly right " , and did n't address the second part of my statement , " how has this tracked since we lost the fairness doctrine in the 80s and you now pretty much have to buy your votes ? " .. he left that off when he started prattling on about other nonsense .
I 've said it before , I 'll say it again ..
I can draw a direct line to CORPORATIONS for almost EVERY ill we have in our society .
We need more regulation , not less ..
The only difference between Kucinich and Paul is that one issue , for the most part .
They BOTH want to restore the Constitution , undo the trade agreements that have choked the life out of our economy , reestablish the rule of law ..
With Paul wanting to dismantle the Fed and Kucinich wanting to clamp down on Corps .
One works , one causes chaos and pays the boss for doing pretty much nothing .. hmm..

I thought these were both asked at the same time ?
It 's great that Kucinich wrote that letter but if the SecState of NH ignores or denies , it would just be another example how the powers that be ( corporate greed ) do n't want the truth to be known , least they lose their grip on their preceived power over us all !

And if you think that what I presented so far covers just about every ugly word that can be said about homosexuality , you ’re tragically mistaken because there was another set of themes that were explored on Friday morning that I found to be shocking .
I left you last week with Alexey Ledyeav ’s prayer which went , “ In the name of Jesus I curse this phenomenon !
I curse the root of this movement !
In the name of Jesus I curse the culture of death and say to it : DRY OUT !… ” Now I want to share with you two talks which immediately preceded that prayer .
It all began when Scott Lively returned to the stage on Friday morning ( November 16 ) , this time promising a “ university course on the things the homosexual movement does not want you to know . ”
And I have to say that this has to be the most amazing anti-gay talk I have ever heard — and remember , I sat through the Family Impact Summit in Florida last September .
But nothing I heard there prepared me for Lively ’s talk that morning .
I do n’t have the powers of written expression to fully convey how strange his talk was .
That ’s why I strongly encourage you to watch the video yourself .
( Unfortunately , Lively does n’t begin speaking until the 19:30 mark , but you can listen to Russian contemporary Christian music while you ’re waiting . )
But I understand that not everyone can sit still for an hour - long anti-gay speech .
So I ’ll do the best I can with the highlights .
Lively began his talk on the “ secrets ” of the homosexual movement this way :
“ The first thing that the homosexuality community does n’t want you to know , number one , most homosexuals do not want to be homosexual .
Homosexuality is a disorder inside of you .
It ’s when you have an attraction , a sexual attraction , towards someone of the same gender .
Every person that begins to feel this attraction towards someone of the same gender knows that it ’s wrong , because they live in a world where they see what is normal and they can compare the way they feel with what everyone else does .
Lively explained that lots of teens experience same sex attractions during puberty , but most of them pass through this “ phase ” and the feelings go away .
But for some , it ’s becomes more than a phase :
But for some people , for different reasons , they do n’t overcome it .
But all of them know that it ’s wrong , and almost all of them feel ashamed and they do n’t want to have this .
And so they begin to struggle against it .
Inside themselves they struggle against the feelings . …
But it ’s also very difficult to overcome .
And so what happens is they struggle and they struggle and they struggle against the feelings .
And they fail and they fail and they fail and they fail .
And then after a while , they give up struggling because its too hard to keep struggling against something that they ca n’t defeat .
So they give in to the feelings .
This is the secret to why the homosexual movement is so aggressive about making society accept them .
Because they ’re living a lie about who they are .
Their acceptance of a gay identity is an admission of failure .
And so psychologically they turn it around .
Because they feel so much shame , they create “ gay pride . ”
And they insist that they ’re full of pride about who they are .
And it ’s just a gigantic self - delusion .
It ’s a psychological self - defense mechanism .
And it makes these people social activists .
But that ’s the first secret : most homosexuals do no want to be homosexual .
Lively ’s explanation of the first “ secret ” is barely coherent .
He does n’t cite a single study , nor does he provide one scintilla of evidence — not even anecdotal evidence — that gays and lesbians who have come to terms with their sexuality “ do not want to be homosexual . ”
Instead , he simply provides this explanation as though it were established fact .
It ’s a surprising “ secret , ” one which , I have to say , I have never heard in my nearly forty - seven years .
It must be quite a secret indeed , one that even I am not privy to .
I really have no idea whatsoever where he could have gotten such an idea — unless the only gays and lesbians he ’s ever met were members of ex-gay ministries .
( He does mention ex-gays towards the end of this talk . )
By definition , they do n’t want to be gay .
Is that where he got such a preposterous idea about gays and lesbians as a whole ?
If that ’s the case , ex - gays would represent a rather unique echo - chamber which no reasonably intelligent person would mistake for being representative of gays and lesbians broadly .
I suspect that most ex-gays would agree with me on that point at least .
And so we ’re left wondering where he could have discovered such a strange secret .
Lively continues :
The second secret of the gay movement has to do with the word “ hatred . ”
Now , anyone who has stood up against homosexuality has been called a homophobe . … [ T ] here are two reasons for this , and many people know about the first reason .
The first reason that they do this is to silence us .
And that ’s a kind of obvious thing .
But the second and more important thing is a secret .
The homosexual leaders , the leaders of the homosexual movement , they are the ones who push this .
Not the average homosexual .
Of course many of them fall into using it as a tactic .
But this aggressive accusation of hatred is coming from the homosexual leaders because they need to keep the other homosexuals inside of the gay community .
Remember , most homosexuals do not want to be homosexual .
And if they really believed that there was a way to overcome their homosexuality , many of them would leave the gay community .
And the people who have the real hope for change , the ones who have the ability to overcome their sins and their compulsiveness are the Christians .
We ’re the ones who have the power to help them .
But the gay leaders can not let them know that .
And so they have to keep calling us hateful bigots and they have to keep all of these gay people inside of their control .
And they do this by making them afraid of us .
Here , Lively ascribes a degree of power wielded by “ homosexual leaders ” that few actual gay rights leaders would ever dream of .
Lively says that the only reason most of us remain gay is because it ’s the gay rights leaders are able to exercise some sort of mind control to make us afraid of Christians .
Did you get that ?
It ’s the gay rights leaders who make the rest of us fearful .
Not pastors who pray for curses .
Not people who describe gays and lesbians as followers of the father if lies ” or who write revisionist “ history ” books which claims that gays were responsible for Nazism and the holocaust .
Not people who say that gays are subjecting children to “ moral rape , ” and who equate fair treatment in schools to the Nazi ’s throwing children into the holocaust furnaces .
And not people who lie about the gay - bashing death of Santender Singh ..
No , it ’s gay rights leaders who make gays and lesbians afraid of Lively ’s brand of Christianity , according to Lively anyway .
Lively continued with secret number three :
The third secret of homosexuality has to do with this idea that homosexuals are born that way .
Homosexuals are not born gay .
God does not create people to have no choice in a behavior that he condemns .
But it ’s not the same kind of choice as choosing to become a carpenter or a journalist .
Like I said , most homosexuals do n’t want to have those feelings .
But all sex is voluntary , except for rape .
And so if a homosexual is living an active homosexual lifestyle , he is making a choice every single day .
Here , Lively plays a slight of hand , conflating behavior with orientation .
It ’s true that no behavior is compelled by circumstances of birth .
And it is true that all consensual acts , including sex , are voluntary .
But by confusing behavior with orientation , he performs a rhetorical trick which dismisses the very essence of what it means to be gay .
But having done that , it ’s somewhat surprising that he goes back to cover the ground he skipped when he began revealing his thirds “ secret ” :
Why are gay people gay ?
And here ’s the thing that ’s really fascinating .
I ’ve been critical of anti-gay activists who claim that homosexuality is strictly the result of childhood experiences .
I ’ve also been critical of pro-gay activists who claim that science has proved that homosexuality is strictly biological in origin for all gays and lesbians .
The fact is , neither extreme position has been proven to be true , and neither extreme position is likely to be true for all gays and lesbians .
But one thing that cannot be denied : Both sides are keenly interested in proving that their understanding of the origins of homosexuality is correct because they believe their framework bolsters their cause .
And both sides eagerly tout every scientific finding that supports their beliefs while pretending the other findings do n’t exist .
Right ?
Well , no .
Lively has detected a different conspiracy .
Hence the secret :
The real secret is that the gay movement does not want to find the cause of homosexuality .
You understand what I ’m saying ?
The gay movement does not want to find the cause .
Why ?
Because the day that science finds the cause is the day that begins the race for the cure .
Amen ?
Think about it .
If science were to come forward and say , “ it is this gene , ” then all of the secular people who do n’t have any moral values , they would begin using the science , the gene selecting science that already exists to abort the children who have that gene .
And the scientific community would be looking for a way to be able to prevent that gene from influencing the children .
So whatever turns out to be the cause provides a place to begin searching for the cure .
And the gay leaders cannot allow this because they ’re the ones who are so , … they ’re insane , in their minds , because they are so deeply entrenched in this gay identify , they can not leave it .
They ’re like the worst of the worst of the heroin addicts .
Here , at the mention of the word “ addict , ” Lively begins to turn toward the framework often employed by many leaders of the ex-gay movement by characterizing homosexuality as an addiction :
The most powerful addiction of all is sexual because we ’re actually created to be sexual .
Nobody ’s created to be an alcoholic .
When you give up alcohol , there ’s nothing in your body that requires alcohol .
But every body , male and female , is designed for sex .
And the most powerful drug in all the universe is a human orgasm .
It ’s a human orgasm .
Because when you have that sexual experience , it floods you brain with the same addictive chemicals that you get when you ’re an addict .
It ’s like the ultimate pleasurable drug .
Now if you ’re a young person and you ’re experiencing same sex attraction , and someone comes along to you that ’s an older homosexual and invites you to participate in a homosexual act , if you enter into that homosexual act and your first orgasm as a human being is the result of homosexual behavior , you can be locked in to an addiction that will last your whole life .
This strange theory is one which some anti-gay activists promote to explain how children and young adults are “ recruited ” into homosexuality .
It ’s this idea that some parts of our bodies are designed for sexual pleasure , and if our first experiences of that pleasure is associated with homosexual behavior , then presto ! — we become gay due to some kind of Pavlovian conditioning .
Some in the ex-gay movement offer similar theories of recruitment based on sexual molestation .
I heard Christine Sneeringer of the Ft. Lauderdale ex-gay ministry Worthy Creations offer this explanation at last September ’s Family Impact Summit in Tampa .
Lively ended his talk on an “ ex - gay ” who was dying of AIDS .
The Livelys brought “ Sonny ” into their home and took care of him , and “ Sonny ” returned the favor by sharing these “ secrets ” with them before he died — which may partly explain the bizarreness of some of Lively ’s “ secrets . ”
Yet Lively used this story to build credibility for his “ secrets ” — after all , he got them from a pitiful former homosexual himself :
Sonny does not deserve our hate .
He deserves our pity .
And that ’s who most of these people are .
These are people who have become enslaved to a satanically inspired addiction .
But their lives become so much defined by their perversion that they feel completely cut off form anyone else in the world .
For these people the only hope is Jesus Christ and we are the only people that can bring them that message .
But the gay movement tells them that we hate them , we want to kill them and hurt them , and so they are afraid to talk to us .
And so that ’s another major secret .
And you should take these secrets and use them to your advantage .
Lively said that there were more secrets , but he ran out of time and so “ they ’re going to have to wait for the next lecture . ”
That next lecture was given by George Neverov , a Sacramento resident who spoke on “ Homosexuality Unmasked . ”
And just when it seemed that nothing could be more outrageous than Lively ’s talk , Neverov began his talk this way :
… [ The USA ] has a terrible secret and this country is afraid to reveal it .
It caught a horrible virus on which I ’d like to talk with you .
This virus has a damaging impact .
It aims to destroy the family and it ’s name is homosexual culture .
To illustrate what that virus is , Neverov began reading from an essay that was originally titled “ Gay Revolutionary ” ( anti - gay extremists have dubbed it “ The Gay Manifesto “ ) , a satire that was written in 1987 by “ Michael Swift ” and published in the Gay Community News , a radical Boston - based newspaper that went out of business in 1992 .
The more extreme elements of the anti-gay movement like to quote from this fictional call to arms as though it were a real manifesto .
This essay performs a very similar function in anti-gay circles that The Protocols of the Elders Of Zion once served among anti-Semites :
To stir passions and outrage against a hated minority .
You ’ve heard quotations from the so - called “ Gay Manifesto ” before , but it was probably very new and horrifying to that audience in Riga , as it is to many audiences in America .
Neverov read along as a Russian translation of the text appeared on a giant multimedia screen behind him :
“ We shall sodomize your sons , emblems of your feeble masculinity , of your shallow dreams and vulgar lies .
We shall seduce them in your schools , in your dormitories , in your gymnasiums , … ”
And on it goes .
Anti-gay extremists love reading this aloud to shocked audiences .
But when they do , they invariably omit the preface .
Neverov omitted it as well :
This essay is an outré , madness , a tragic , cruel fantasy , an eruption of inner rage , on how the oppressed desperately dream of being the oppressor .
That ’s right .
It ’s a work of fiction , a satire — and the author said so when it originally appeared in the Gay Community News way back in 1987 .
In fact , the anonymous writer used the pseudonym “ Michael Swift , ” which is an obvious tip of the hat to the English language ’s most famous satirist , Jonathan Swift .
But whether Neverov or any of the other Watchmen are aware of this for not , the Latvian audience is almost certain to be uninformed of the nature of this so - called “ manifesto . ”
And so Neverov points to this fictional essay and tells his audience , “ You and me — all of us are ‘ hetero swine ’ — and they tell us to tremble . ”
And then he reflects on what the supposed manifesto means for all of us :
I believe that outside the family , outside God ’s design , a man gets into a psychological state where his soul is like a bucket without a bottom .
No matter how much you pour into it , it ’s impossible to achieve happiness , and that ’s exactly the psychological state of homosexualists today .
This is often the reason why they are reaching for marriages .
They just ca n’t get enough self - satisfaction .
Their heart is on fire like in hell ; they cannot satisfy themselves , so they want to sodomize the whole world — to have a broader choice for partners .
The rest of his talk continues along similarly alarmist lines as he focused on AIDS and other sexually transmitted diseases , complete with grotesque graphics on the multimedia screen :
This is a culture of death !
But I wo n’t ever name homosexuality a culture .
In all my publications you will see the word “ culture ” in quotes .
Homosexuality does not have a culture : it ’s immoral , and immoral means uncultured !
And it destroys the human soul , emotions , healthy families !
As we read in the manifesto , homosexuality aims to turn healthy families into hospital beds .
That ’s why this information is important to you !
Your future depends on what you do with this information !
Neverov then goes though a long recitation ( and butchering ) of statistics and medical information about AIDS , some of it culled from such Cameronesque sources as LifeSite .
Then Neverov closed his talk by issuing a stirring manifesto of his own :
Today those 3 % of the population have dictated to my governor of California what they will teach my kids and it ’s very funny and disgusting , but on the other hand they do not have any rights to my kids !
They do not have any rights to kids at all because they cannot birth children and we will not give them ours kids !
And if you are listening to this information through the Internet – I WON ’T GIVE MY KIDS TO YOU !!!
…
Listen , my dear — I am now speaking to the Church !
You are still standing on your knees and praying and telling me that I need to leave Sacramento !!!
You tell us to leave this struggle for good !
I will not leave it because those are bloody figures , they are written in blood .
And that ’s when Alexey Ledyaev took the stage and offered his prayer for the morning .

I recently posted about the contrast between John McCain and Barack Obama in back to back television appearances made just after the so - called Potomac Primaries .
Obama made a rousing speech in front of a diverse group of 17,000 cheering supporters , followed immediately by McCain in a small , intimate setting backed by the old , white , mostly male GOP support that he 's counting on .
I treated the event as a simple matter of contrasting campaigns , with a juxtaposition of new , fresh , energetic atmosphere to old , stuttering , dusty context .
Frank Rich of the New York Times writes a beautiful piece on the same subject , detailing the racial divide that was symbolically evident on that day .
It 's a very good read , although Republicans in denial may be upset by the characterization Rich presents .
Such is Frank Rich , of course .
I 've been saving my thoughts on John McCain and his spotty record on racial issues until we are ready for a general election campaign , but I could n't seem to hold out any longer because it really bothers me .
This is an overall criticism of the GOP , but it must be particularly aimed in the direction of McCain at this point because he is on the stump running for president .
I could point , as Rich does , to the fact that there have been more African - American faces on stage during GOP events in the Bush administration than there have been in the crowd .
There have been many press events with African - Americans during this administration , deflecting the reality on the ground .
The Bush people have always been more in the business of propaganda than governing .
McCain 's own history has been shaky on the issue of race .
He has been both victim and perpetrator of racial intolerance .
In 2000 , the unscrupulous Bush campaign used McCain 's adopted Bangladeshi daughter to hurt him in South Carolina .
During that same campaign , McCain lashed out against " gooks " in front of reporters .
In fact , it was at that moment that I recognized McCain so vividly for the first time .
Katie Hong , a Korean - American government worker in the state of Washington wrote about the incident for the Seattle Post Intelligencer in March of 2000 saying :
" On his campaign bus recently , Sen . John McCain told reporters , " I hated the gooks .
I will hate them as long as I live . "
Although McCain said he was referring only to his prison guards , there are many reasons why his use of the word " gook " is offensive and alarming .
It is offensive because by using a racial epithet that has historically been used to demean all Asians to describe his captors , McCain failed to make a distinction between his torturers and an entire racial group .
It is alarming because a major candidate for president publicly used a racial epithet , refused to apologize for doing so and remains a legitimate contender . "
McCain later apologized publicly for the comments and promised to never use the term " gook " in public again .
That 's fine , but the cat is out of the bag .
We peeked into McCain 's psyche and saw the ugly truth .
No one will begrudge Senator McCain his ill feelings towards his Vietnamese captors .
No one will deny him the pain and torment that he likely has held since his service and that he will likely hold until his last breath .
The problem is , John McCain entered public service 18 years prior to these remarks .
He had been released from captivity in Vietnam 27 years earlier .
How is it that John McCain had not come to terms with the word " gook " in the 27 years that had passed since his release , and the 18 years that he had been representing Americans in public office ?
Are we to believe that he has privately come to terms with the word , even after his public recognition of its destructive power ?
In his post-victory speech following the Potomac Primary , McCain was flanked by several elder statesmen of the Republican Party .
It did n't make for an effective image , but more than that it was another hint at the racial intolerance of the GOP in general .
With McCain ( out of the picture in this clip ) was George Allen , who McCain introduces as " former Governor , former Senator from Virginia ... a great man " .
You 'll remember George Allen as the candidate that lost re-election in 2006 as a result of the now famous " macaca " clip of YouTube fame .
The moment that made YouTube a political reality in the modern media landscape .
What message does his presence with McCain send ?
His most recent public moment came as a result of racism , yet he is somehow a campaign strength for John McCain ?
Most people would consider George Allen a campaign liability , especially given the idea that the Democrats have opened this election to a new era of diversity .
An era more reflective of the makeup of the United States .
I will write more about this as we move forward .
I wo n't let John McCain dodge this for my part .
The mainstream press largely ignored the " gook " comment of 2000 , and as a result most people are probably unaware that it ever took place .
We 'd likely know nothing of the " macaca " incident were it not for YouTube .
The most democratic forms of media participation ( the internet , blogs , YouTube ) have revolutionized our understanding of politics on the ground and make for a more accountable government .
Hold the GOP accountable in this case .
UPDATE ( 2/18 ) : I came across this little YouTube clip that I was unaware of .
McCain using the term " tar baby " on the 2008 campaign trail .
I 'm sure there was no racial intent behind his utterance of that expression , but it is particularly demonstrative of the out of touch GOP and the power of YouTube ....

" The so - called Christian virtues of humility , love , charity , personal freedom , the strong prohibitions against violence , murder , stealing , lying , cruelty — all these are washed away by war … "
~ John T. Flynn ( 1882 — 1964 ) American Journalist and Author
Far too often the state is viewed through the eyes of Augustine of Hippo , who defined the state as nothing more than “ a multitude of rational creatures associated in common agreement as to the things which it loves ” ( De Civitate Dei 19 . 24 ) .
As such the state ’s existence is neither moral nor immoral ; thus the very concept of governance , by a select few , is cradled in the benign idea that the state is just " worldly . "
However , if the state is “ worldly ” then it is relegated to the temporal and systematically divorced from religion in subject matter , form , or use ; a mistake of diabolical proportions .
To the ancient world the state was a logical extension of their religion which was rooted in the idea that there was an evil entity that had taken over man and creation and as such was the enemy of man , while being the cause of all of man ’s misery .
To Christians this is no mystery and has its roots in the book of Genesis and the evil genius of Lucifer .
The ancient ’s solution to the problem was to make this evil power their gods and goddesses , but to do so meant there had to be a means of intercession between the gods and themselves .
This was accomplished by the respective priesthoods delivering the adherents to a priestly King who stood as the mediator between the gods and man .
Thus the birth of the state !
It then became the duty of the High priest / King , through sacrifice and ritual , to appease the gods , and in so doing preserve the king ’s reign , keep the people from harm , keep foreign enemies at bay and assure good crops and harvests .
All of which were the responsibility of the gods when properly worshipped .
Have you ever questioned why so many " politicians " frequently use the declaration : " God Bless America ? "
You see , every evil that befell the state was attributed to the " gods " not having been honored in the proper way , or being neglected by the head of state .
When the Medes / Persians conquered Babylon in 570 BCE , the Persian King , Cyrus , proclaimed :
" … I am Cyrus .
King of the world .
When I entered Babylon … I did not allow anyone to terrorize the land …
I kept in view the needs of people and all its sanctuaries to promote their well - being … I put an end to their misfortune .
The Great God has delivered all the lands into my hand ; the lands that I have made to dwell in a peaceful habitation … "
So universal was this thinking that as nation / state conquered nation / state , the ruling class would change but rarely would there be any change in the people ’s religion .
As a matter of fact the acceptance of other ’s religions was universally acknowledged .
All that was required of the conquered priesthood was to assure the people ’s acquiescence to the demands of the new priest - king .
The best evidence of this is in Cyrus ’ conquests which eventually brought the Cilicians , the Syrians , the Paphlagonians , the Cappadocians , the Phygians , the Lydians , the Carians , the Phenicians , the Arabians , the Assyrians , the Bactrians , the Sacae , and the Maryandines under Persian rule .
As with the Persians and Greeks , Roman conquests resulted in plunder and were not prosecuted from any religious fervor .
The Romans , like all the empires before them , were not interested in persecuting other religions before the 2nd century AD , or proselytizing the worship of Jupiter .
The reason for this universal tolerance of other ’s religion was simple .
The names of the gods changed but their rituals , symbols , and attributes remained relatively constant as well as being familiar .
However , by the end of the 2nd century AD all this was to change .
After Marcus Aurelius ’s death ( A.D. 180 ) Rome was to be ruled by progressively weak Emperors as illustrated by the stupefying cruelty , bloodlust , vanity and megalomania of Commodus .
To add to Rome ’s problems the small farms , that had once been the backbone of Rome , were being taken over by large , wealthy estates , sending former owners , workers and slaves scurrying to the cities in hopes of finding work .
Agricultural production was further eroded when the irrigation systems were left in disrepair due to the lack of workers .
Soil erosion , the by - product of poor farming techniques , over -use and deforestation further exasperated Rome ’s food woes .
The lack of harvest , in turn , brought mobs into the streets demanding bread and entertainment to relieve their hunger and dull their minds against the spiraling economic problems the empire faced .
In an effort to keep the empire together the state tried to appease the anger of the mobs with more public welfare and gladiatorial games , all from an exhausted treasury .
With deepening recession , scarcity of food staples and lack of work the population of the empire began to flee Italy .
The state reaction was predictable .
In 212 AD Caracalla , in his edict Constitutio Antoniniana , extended Roman citizenship to anyone in the empire , with the exception of slaves , thus increasing his tax base .
Not only did the edict Constitutio Antoniniana increase the tax base , it provided an extended base from which military enlistees could be drawn .
The expansion of the military was needed because Persia was moving against the empire through ancient Syria .
Adding to the emergency , Rome ’s northern borders on the Rhine - Danube frontier saw the barbarians still in rebellion .
It was only natural that the Roman people would begin to ask :
Why is this happening ?
Are the ancient gods of Rome angry ?
Of course the Roman priesthood and elite leadership would answer :
Yes , the gods are angry .
The problem was who or what had made the gods angry ?
The preceding two centuries had seen the rise of a group of people who the Romans called Christians .
These people and their religious beliefs had once been deemed a superstition by Pliny the Younger , during the reign of Trajan ( 98u2014117 AD ) , but now they had come out from the shadow of Judaism and were seen as a real threat to the Roman Empire .
What the Romans found most distasteful were the Christian beliefs that :
They were citizens of Jesus ’ Kingdom first and Roman citizens second .
They were not to personally seek public office but if it was thrust upon them to serve willingly and honestly .
The decaying Roman Empire , like all governments , was the product of the evil one .
The state religion was as evil as the Empire .
The Emperor was not worthy of being called " god , " " lord , " " savior , " or " king " or to be worshipped in any manner .
That military service would put them in opposition to Jesus ’ teaching by killing another human ( called state murder ) and so was to be refused ; even under the penalty of death .
They did n’t owe Caesar anything including taxes ( when they could avoid paying them ) .
The state was not to be the source of their daily bread .
They were to deal honestly with all men at all times but especially in their businesses .
They were to tell the truth even if meant it cost them their lives .
To these the Romans added :
The Christian religion was an illegal religion because it undermined the Roman society and the religious mores of all societies in which Christianity was practiced .
Since Christianity did n’t recognize the pagan gods , including the emperor , as god therefore Christians were atheists .
Christians were immoral because they meet in secret and were said to practice child cannibalism , incest and obscene sexual rites .
Christians were “ the enemy of mankind ” because they taught against and did n’t hold to Rome ’s nor the ancient world ’s religious standards .
What the Romans hated and feared most was :
The Christians held that killing was wrong and therefore they would n’t serve in Rome ’s military , thus they were unpatriotic , and traitors to the state .
The results of adhering to the teaching of Jesus was that by the time Decius became Emperor in 249 AD the Christian community was one the wealthiest groups in the whole of the Roman Empire .
In fact it was the dominating force in Roman society .
William Marina explains how this occurred .
" … Christianity came to dominate , before its own unfortunate co-optation by the State , because it developed a superior ethic based upon natural law and a superior voluntary social organization which , in true interstices fashion , simply bypassed the inefficient State .
The viability of that institutional structure was a reflection of the legitimacy with which its value system came to be regarded … "
" … Christian intersticism dealt with the affairs of this world .
In a period of inflation it invested capital in people .
In plagues and rioting it was the only group capable of providing burial for the dead and organizing food supplies for the living .
Christian philanthropy was supporting 1500 poor and widows in Rome by the year 250 ( AD ) and large sums were contributed to ransom captives from the barbarians .
Several generations earlier the State had already confessed its inability to cope with such problems .
u2018 Plainly , to be a Christian in 250 ( AD ) brought more protection from one ’s fellows than to be a civis romanus . ’ "
The Christian community was not lost on Emperor Decius who was certain that the Empire ’s problems were due to the anger of her gods and that their anger was owing to the Christian influences upon Roman society .
Thus began one of the greatest persecutions of Christianity in Roman history .
Decius desperately wanted to unite the Empire again under one religion so in 250 AD he ordered that ALL Roman citizens were to worship the old state gods .
Failure to do so would result in the penalty of death .
At the point of the sword the Roman military began to force everyone into Roman temples to worship ancient gods .
In return for bowing to Baal the adherents were given a certificate called a libellus which proved their loyalty to Rome , Rome ’s gods , and the Emperor .
Decius ’ persecution only lasted a short two years until his death at the hands of the Goths in the providence of Moesia .
Decius ’ successors were first Gallus then Valerian both of whom it may be said made a half - hearted attempt to continue Decius ’ policies .
However , by 257 AD Rome ’s financial problems had the Empire staggering like a drunken sailor .
It was during this time that Rome did what Rome had always done best and that was to plunder and steal .
Thus , Christian wealth and property became the means to make Rome financially healthy and it evidentially worked .
However , what the Christians had lost to Roman thievery in 257 had been regained by the time Diocletian took the specter of power in 284 AD .
The Christians already had a reputation as subversive because they refused to participate in state sacrifices and prayers .
After problems at imperial ceremonies , Diocletian purged Christians from civil service and the military in 298 .
He went after churches and clergy in 303 , and decreed in 304 that all Christians were to offer sacrifice to the emperor and the Roman gods on pain of death .
This last great persecution of the church by the Roman was spurred on by Diocletian ’s heir , Galienus .
The Christians had recovered from the hardships imposed on them by Diocletian when Constantine took the imperial throne in 307 AD .
But Constantine was no fool ; he knew that he needed the Christian community and its wealth for Rome and his reign to survive .
So for the first time in Church history the state legitimatized Christianity and Christianity voluntarily saved the state : all in direct opposition to Christianity ’s founding teachings and beliefs .
In the grand tradition of the pagan priesthoods , the Christian hierarchy had delivered it ’s adherents into the hands of the state and the results were immediate .
The persecution of the Christians by Diocletian had produced a split in the Christian ranks .
The Donatists of Africa were furious with the Christians of Rome who agreed with the pope that the Church should forgive those who had bowed to Diocletian as a god and who had sacrificed to the ancient Roman gods .
These African Christians elected Donatus , who had endured nine rackings during the persecutions , as a rogue bishop of Carthage .
Widespread riots broke out when Constantine summoned two councils in 313 and 314 and backed their decisions against the Donatists .
Constantine ordered the Donatists suppressed in 314 , but gave up the persecution in 321 in frustration .
Nothing was going to stop what occurred ; Christians were now killing Christians over matters of doctrine .
The final blow came to the original Christian ideals in 380 AD when co-emperors Theodosius of the Eastern Empire and Gratianus of the West issued a joint edict making Christianity the official mandatory state religion .
The metamorphous of Christianity from a religion of peace into a mob of bloodletting goons was complete while in the tradition of their pagan ancestors the state and its perpetual need for war was not endangered again .
If you look closely you will see that the ideas Congressman Paul talks about in many ways closely mirror those adhered to by those Christians of the 1st through 3rd centuries .
Is it any wonder then that statists hate Congressman Ron Paul or those of us who support him ?
Maybe it ’s time we start judging the justness of our ideals not by how many accept them but by how much the state , and its accompanying priesthood hates us .
The time to rejoice is when the elite and their mouthpieces in the press slander us .
The lesson of history is clear .
If you want to stop war then starve the state , the military and their accompanying religious priesthoods .
" The devil is the author of all war , " wrote Justin Martyr ( approx .
138 AD ) and if we do n’t come to our senses quickly we are going to have hell to pay .
The Best of Tim Case
" What if I told you , " Joel Weinstock said , " there were countries where the doctors had never seen hay fever ? "
It is another piece of evidence , another " aha " moment in the global medical mystery that Weinstock - the chief of gastroenterology and hepatology at Tufts - New England Medical Center - has narrowed down to one chief suspect : the worms .
Weinstock , 59 , specializes in studying why immunological diseases - everything from hay fever and asthma to diabetes and multiple sclerosis - are on the rise in developed countries but remain relatively uncommon in undeveloped countries .
He believes these diseases , many of which were almost unheard of 100 years ago , are because of changes in our environment , a lack of exposure to something .
And he thinks that something may be the worms .
" We realized that one thing people always had was intestinal worms , " he said .
" But in the mid-20th century we started deworming children in developed countries .
So we 've developed a theory that perhaps deworming was helping these diseases . "
This theory - which is currently being tested in laboratory trials on how parasitic worms , known as helminths , regulate response to disease - has earned Weinstock the title of " Best and Brightest " from Esquire magazine , which honored him in its recent " Genius Issue . "
The magazine hailed his theory as a glimpse into a " brand - new scientific revolution , a paradigm shift in the way we think about the human body . "
The crux of that scientific revolution is a bit of role reversal .
The parasites that we have been told to avoid - such as hookworm and pinworm - may be the good guys , while excessive hygiene may be the bad guy .
" I get about 5,000 e-mails a year from patients all over the world asking what to do , " he said .
" People know that something is n't right .
They keep their kids in the cleanest environments and they get asthma .
We get all of these things that were rare becoming common .
And a lot of it comes down to hygiene .
Excessive hygiene can potentially lead to disease . "
The " hygiene hypothesis , " which was first proposed nearly two decades ago , argues that aspects of cleanliness prevent the immune system from programming itself to fight off disease .
" The big question is what are those aspects ?
We do n't want to go back to the standards of the 1800s , " Weinstock said .
" Public hygiene and cleanliness are very good for us , but removing ourselves entirely from our natural environment is bad for us .
We need to figure out the aspects of dirt and exposure that are good for us and hopefully we can find a balance . "
Weinstock , who ran a center for digestive diseases at the University of Iowa before arriving at Tufts - NEMC in 2005 , said that being a researcher has always come naturally to him .
" I grew up in the space race .
When other kids went to play sports , I went to the library to read about rocket motors .
My friends and I loved to tinker .
Research was my hobby then , and it has n't gone away , " he said .
He said he hopes his research will soon lead to helminths - based drug therapies and vaccines .
" Will people be afraid to take a worm pill ? " he asked , acknowledging an obvious squeamishness .
" I do n't think so . "
And while he is cautious about advising any of his desperate e-mailers until all of the facts are in , he is comfortable telling parents one thing .
" When people ask me what to do , I tell them to let their kids play in the dirt , " he said .
" And it 's OK if they do n't wash their hands every time . "

Texas Monthy :
The fundamental change in the way people consume the news had to change the way we executed a communications strategy at the White House .
Q. How much attention did you pay to the programs on cable ?
I never worried about a certain cable show .
What I was looking for were trends that were shaping the narrative and the conventional wisdom and whether we had to be in front of or behind those things .
Q. What about the blogs ?
We had to set up a whole new apparatus to deal with the challenges they pose .
Are they real journalists ?
The Washington Post , for example , has journalists who are now bloggers .
Do you treat them as bloggers ?
Do they get credentials ?
Q. Let 's think of it as a practical matter .
If one of those journalists - turned - bloggers , Chris Cillizza , e-mails you to say he needs an interview , and at the same time one of the Post 's print reporters - say , Dan Balz - e - mails you and says he needs an interview , and you can do only one . . .
Balz .
Q. Because the print edition of the Post has more of an impact ?
Because Balz is on multiple platforms .
He 's booked more easily on television .
He 's read by more people .
He influences people a bit more .
Now , the question might not be as much Chris versus Dan as maybe , " Is it Dan Balz or one of the guys at [ the conservative blog ] Power Line ? "
Q. Yeah , or what if [ conservative blogger ]
Hugh Hewitt called ?
That 's when you start going , " Hmm . . . "
Because they do reach people who are influential .
Q. Well , they reach the president 's base .
That 's what I mean by influential .
I mean , talk about a direct IV into the vein of your support .
It 's a very efficient way to communicate .
They regurgitate exactly and put up on their blogs what you said to them .
It is something that we 've cultivated and have really tried to put quite a bit of focus on .
Look out , future , because here we come : scientists say the speed of human evolution increased rapidly during the last 40,000 years – and it 's only going to get faster .
The findings , published today by a team of U.S. anthropologists in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences , overturn the theory that modern life 's relative ease has slowed or even stopped human adaptation .
Selective pressures are still at work ; they just happen to be different than those faced by our distant ancestors .
" We 're more different from people 5,000 years ago than they were from Neanderthals , " said study co-author and University of Utah anthropologist Henry Harpending .
In the study , researchers analzyed genomes from 270 people belonging to four disparate ethnic groups : Han Chinese , Africa 's Yoruba tribe ,
Japanese and Utah Mormons .
By comparing areas of difference and similarity , they determined that about seven percent of the genome has undergone significant change since the end of the last Ice Age .
If human beings had always evolved at such a rapid clip , said the researchers , genetic differences between people and chimpanzees would be 160 times greater than they are .
Driving the changes are environmental fluctuations and population growth .
As the number of people swells , so do the number of mutations generated by random chance .
Further selecting for disparate genetic inheritances are the diverse terrains , climates and social structures inhabited since the glaciers retreated .
The findings contradict the hypothesis that evolution must be slowing down because people who once would have died are sustained by modern medicine and social safety nets .
They also suggest that genetic differences between different ethnic groups can be significant .
" The actual genes that are sweeping have not been thoroughly identified in all cases , but we can see interesting patterns , " said Harpending .
" There are something like 6 genes , all broken African genes , responsible for European light skin , blue eyes , blonde hair , etc .
They are evolving fast in Europe .
Meanwhile , other genes responsible for light skin are sweeping in Asia , and they are different from those in
Europe . "
Asked about James Watson 's controversial claims that intelligence evolved less effectively in people of African descent , Harpending said the study was n't designed to test such characteristics .
He also cautioned against interpreting the findings as suggesting that people are becoming fundamentally better .
" Some of the mutations let us do better .
We can eat simple carbohydrates , which hunter - gatherers never did .
But we may also be accumulating damaging stuff , " said Harpending .
He wondered whether social changes might not cultivate unfortunate tendencies .
" Evolution is a double - edged sword , " he said .
" What evolution cares about is that I have more offspring .
If you can do it by charming and manipulating , and I 'm a hardworking farmer that 's going to feed the kids ten years down the road , then you 're going to win .
Hit - and - run , irresponsible males are reproducing more .
That is n't good for anyone except those males , but that 's evolution . "
The study 's ultimate message , said Harpending : " Whatever changes are happening , they 're happening faster . "

Instaputz is just asking the question : will right wing blogs and congresspeople go nuts about this cover the way they did the MoveOn ad ?
( h/t Agitprop )
The article in question , by historian Andrew J. Bacevich , starts out making a common sense argument , then goes completely mental .
Bacevich says that Petraeus should have been honest rather than political , and gone before Congress not to argue success of the surge .
So far , so good .
But Petraeus should have pressed Congress , not for a tiny lil ' withdrawal based on successful benchmarks , but rather , an urgent need to ... wait for it ... double or triple the forces on the ground in Iraq !
Even Joe Lieberman would laugh at that one , right ?
Right ?
Um , right ?
Nevermind .
[ UPDATE : Several reasonable correspondents have written in directly to my email saying I am misrepresenting Bacevich 's argument .
One of them wrote :
" Bacevich is arguing that if Patreaus was honest and logical , since according to him ( Patreaus ) the surge is working , he ( Patreaus ) would and should have asked for " ... More time .
More money .
And above all , more troops . "
I do n't see how that leads to me being corrected but I want you to know you 've been heard .
UPDATE 2 : Okay I 've read the entire comment thread for this post and I get it .
Bacevich , you 're saying , is writing a hypothetical speech for Petraeus based on reality - based reasoning against the war .
But who is to say that if Petraeus did make this argument , the rubber stamp Congress would not just approve said increase without blinking ?
I hate , hate , hate to say this , but we are now beyond the point where " reasonable people " can disagree about this war .
It 's a quagmire based on a lie , and there is no " there " there on any position which argues that it should continue . ]
You'd think there would at least be a House vote condemning The American Conservative 's editorial board for allowing such treason and disrespect to stand .
The article 's conclusion could have been written by , gasp , yours truly , and I 've been known to wish Fidel Castro a happy birthday at my blog , for crying out loud :
The baby arrived between stations
The mother says she fainted after unexpectedly giving birth , and the baby fell onto the tracks .
Relatives say they alerted railway officials and rescuers later managed to find the baby lying by the track , with her umbilical cord beside her .
Most Indian train toilets have a hole opening directly onto the tracks .
Though the baby survived the drop from the toilet , she is in intensive care because of her premature birth .
A doctor treating the baby at a hospital said the child had a low heart rate and body temperature .
They stopped the train and ran on the tracks to find the baby
Bhuri Kalbi
Baby 's mother
" She was on the rail track for almost one - and - a - half to two hours , " Dr Gautam Jain told the Associated Press news agency .
" We do not expect such children to survive , " he is quoted as saying .
Another paediatrician , Dr Raj Kumar , told The Times of India newspaper : " She is a fighter .
In just 12 hours after the unthinkable accident , she was coming out of the accident quite well . "
Blue with cold
Bhuri Kalbi , the 33 - year - old mother from a village in the state of Rajasthan , said that she fainted on the toilet after the birth .
" My delivery was so sudden , " the mother of the infant , born two months prematurely , told reporters .
" I did not even realise that my child had slipped from the hole in the toilet and onto the railway tracks . "
She said that it was a few minutes before she came round and alerted her family .
" They stopped the train and ran on the tracks to find the baby , " she said , speaking from her hospital bed .
Railway staff at Amblisayan railway station in Rajasthan joined the search and eventually the newborn girl was found lying uninjured on pebbles by the track .
Rescuers said that she was found close to the railway line with her umbilical cord hanging by her side .
She had turned blue because of the cold at night time .
Indian train toilets are notoriously unhygienic .
Users are typically required to stand or squat over a filthy chute that channels the effluent straight onto the tracks .

Hey
I love my Mac and I have hundreds of applications installed on it .
As a result I wanted to do a post on what I believe are the top 100 Mac applications that are essential to any user .
I ’ve picked a variety of applications that I could think of .
I have tried to go for the cheaper free option , but quite a few you have to pay for .
If you think I am missing an application leave a comment with a link to the app and why you should think it should be included , it does n’t have to be long , I just want your opinions .
If you disagree with any leave a comment with your reasons .
Each application will be split into a couple of major sections .
There are some applications that could be in more than one section , but that is not the point of this post .
I will also include a link and a bit of descriptive text on what the application is about .
There may be duplicate items of the same nature i.e word processing , i’ve included this due to the differences each application has .
The list is in no particular order , mostly alphabetical .
If you want to take your knowledge of Mac apps a bit further I recommend these two books on Amazon , Cool Mac Apps and The Little Mac Book they have got some raving reviews and are probably a good read .
I ’m sure if you look through Amazon there is plenty of stuff that you can find .

Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad is at it again : Speaking in the southern Iranian city of Bandar Abbas , Ahmadinejad launched yet another verbal attack on Israel , calling it " a dirty microbe , " " a wild animal " and " the West 's scarecrow " .
" World powers have created a dirty microbe , called the Zionist regime , which they have unleashed on the region 's nations , " said Ahmadinejad in his speech , which was broadcast on Iranian National Television .
Yearning Ahmadinejad :
We have a million more Mugniyahs Dudi Cohen ( Video ) Iranian leader sends letter of condolence to Nasrallah , says assassination of top Hizbullah commander ' casts more shame on the Zionists and their supporters ' ; adds : Occupiers of Jerusalem must know these crimes will not compensate for their humiliating defeat during in Lebanon Ahmadinejad :
We have a million more Mugniyahs
" This ( regime ) is supported by those who created it as their scarecrow , to keep the region 's nations under control . "
Commenting on the assassination of Hizbullah commander Imad Mugniyah , the Iranian president said that " ( Israel ) murders pure and pious men and then celebrates its efforts . "
Earlier this week , General Mohammad Ali Jaafari , commander of the Iranian Revolutionary Guards , sent a letter of condolence to Hizbullah Secretary - General Hassan Nasrallah , saying he believed " the cancerous bacterium called Israel " would vanish soon .
" There is no doubt that the death of this loyal fighter will strengthen the determination of all the revolutionary and warrior Muslims in their battle against the Zionist regime , and particularly the determination of those fighting alongside this shahids , " added Jaafari .
Mugniyah had a known affiliation with the Iranian Revolutionary Guards and especially with their al - Quds force , which has been blacklisted by the US as a terror organization .
In the past , Mugniyah joined forces with Revolutionary Guards ' commanders to train Hizbullah guerillas in Lebanon and Iran , devising various terror attacks around the world .
Would n’t a real President insist on a comprehensive investigation knowing that military grade anthrax held under top security was used in these attacks shortly after 9/11 ?
Why has there been no thorough investigation ?
Chinese boy does 10,000 push - ups in three hours and twenty minutes
From Reuters – Thu Jul 27,11:04 PM ET .
Yikes !
The tyke must be on the same diet as Wang Junxia ; turtle blood and caterpillar fungus , as prescribed by the coach Ma Junren .
“ Lu Di , 6 , flexes his muscles as other students watch at a kungfu school in Songshan , central China ’s Henan Province July 26 , 2006 .
According to the school ’s president Shi Yongdi , Lu did 10,000 push - ups in three hours and twenty minutes on July 22 , 2006 .
Shi said the school was waiving his tuition for ten years due to his outstanding performance , China Daily reported . ”
The International World Record Breakers ’ Club , lists the following ( and many more types ! ) as World Records for Push - Ups :
non-stop : 10,507 ; Minoru Yoshida ( JAP ) , Oct 1980

For those of you who are into functional fitness , bodyweight exercises and / or do n’t go a to a gym , regular push - ups can only get you so far .
When you do a push - up , you lift 65 % of your body weight .
But add some resistance and you can do some serious strength training !
The best item I ’ve come across is Power Push Up – 2 from Lifeline USA .
Here ’s what Matt Furey ( he with the politically incorrect fitness instructions ) has to say about the product :
“ When doing pushups and presses with the Power Pushup 2 , all the stabilizing muscles of the shoulder shake like leaves blowing in the wind .
What you are doing , in addition to strengthening the stabilizers , is adding strength and endurance … not to mention FUNCTIONAL STRENGTH , to all athletic movements . ”
Matt Furey made the Hindu push - up ( and the Hindu squat ) popular in the United States .

It 's time for Hillary Clinton to give up her futile quest for the U.S. presidency .
She needs to get out soon , putting a united Democratic party ahead of personal ambition before her reputation in a sometimes - ugly campaign is further sullied .
After Barack Obama 's blowout victory in Wisconsin last week , the Clinton camp vowed to " go negative " on an opponent who has won more than twice as many primary - season contests as Clinton ; leads her in popular vote and pledged delegates ; is making gains in Clinton 's base of women , blue - collar workers and Hispanics ; and is shown in most polls beating John McCain , the presumptive Republican presidential nominee , in the general election in November , with Clinton trailing the Arizona senator .
Democrats have never nominated a candidate who lost 11 consecutive contests , as Clinton has since Feb .
5 . Turning back the Obama tide is a mathematical improbability , given the Democratic practice of apportioning delegates by popular vote .
To even narrow Obama 's lead in pledged delegates , Clinton has to win the next two delegate - rich states of Texas and Ohio on March 4 by wide margins .
That 's unlikely to happen .
Clinton 's leads in those two must - win states , in double digits as recently as a week ago , have since shrivelled ; in Texas , the New York senator is now tied with Obama .
The last delegate - rich state , Pennsylvania , does n't vote until April 24 .
That gives McCain a two - month head start in developing a plan of attack that has already begun and is focused , tellingly , on Obama .
The media already have written Clinton off , with daily questions about why she is determined to stay in a race she can't win .
Typical of losing campaigns , Clinton campaign coverage is now dominated by obituaries dwelling on the candidate 's misjudgements , overpaid and inept advisers , and misspent funds ( $ 1,200 on Dunkin ' Donuts runs in January ) .
Clinton will need so - called " superdelegates , " party brass who account for about 20 per cent of total delegates , to put her over the top .
She 's also fighting to restore the voting rights of delegates in key states Florida and Michigan , which defied a Democratic National Committee edict not to hold their contests early .
Clinton won both uncontested primaries .
The protracted backroom deal - making by which Clinton would be required to secure the nomination – culminating in a floor fight over the disputed Florida and Michigan delegations at the Democratic National Convention in Denver in August – would yield an outcome widely regarded as illegitimate , a trampling of party regulars by the party establishment and the Clinton machine .
A battle to the finish with Clinton emerging victorious would divide Democrats in a year in which their prospects of winning the White House have seldom been brighter .
The unprecedented number of alienated youths that Obama has brought into politics , along with countless other Democrats and independents , would likely withhold their donations , volunteer efforts and even their votes in the November election .
With her acute mastery of policy and 35 years of political experience , Clinton is one of the strongest candidates to seek the presidency .
Her campaign did n't anticipate , and has not been able to overpower , an Obama candidacy that has become a movement , one that is less about traditional malcontents – the politics of boomer pols like Clinton – than a new unity in tackling challenges like climate change and nuclear proliferation that obviously require communal action .
This year also marks the beginning of the end of " identity politics , " narrow appeals to African Americans , " soccer moms " and white Southern males , an overdue transformation led by a Kenyan - Kansan educated in Jakarta , multiracial Hawaii , New York and Boston , whose formative career years were spent as a community organizer working with poor blacks and Hispanics in Chicago – America 's first " Benetton " candidate , as The New Republic 's Leon Wieseltier has labelled Obama .

There has been talk among Clinton 's peers in the Senate about her attractiveness as a future majority leader .
She also has been mooted as an ideal Supreme Court nominee , a guardian of causes that liberals hold dear .
But nothing like that is in prospect if Clinton holds to her current course , jeopardizing her party in a contest for the White House that is the Democrats to lose .
A graceful exit now would not be the first time a Clinton has had to lower his or her expectations , and emerge the better for it .

Dr. P. Michael Bolger , a toxicologist who is head of the chemical hazard assessment team at the Food and Drug Administration , did not comment on the findings in the Times sample but said the agency was reviewing its seafood mercury warnings .
Because it has been four years since the advisory was issued , Dr. Bolger said , “ we have had a study under way to take a fresh look at it . ”
No government agency regularly tests seafood for mercury .
Tuna samples from the Manhattan restaurants Nobu Next Door , Sushi Seki , Sushi of Gari and Blue Ribbon Sushi and the food store Gourmet Garage all had mercury above one part per million , the “ action level ” at which the F.D.A. can take food off the market .
( The F.D.A. has rarely , if ever , taken any tuna off the market . )
The highest mercury concentration , 1.4 parts per million , was found in tuna from Blue Ribbon Sushi .
The lowest , 0.10 , was bought at Fairway .
When told of the newspaper ’s findings , Andy Arons , an owner of Gourmet Garage , said : “ We ’ll look for lower - level - mercury fish .
Maybe we wo n’t sell tuna sushi for a while , until we get to the bottom of this . ”
Mr. Arons said his stores stocked yellowfin , albacore and bluefin tuna , depending on the available quality and the price .
At Blue Ribbon Sushi , Eric Bromberg , an owner , said he was aware that bluefin tuna had higher mercury concentrations .
For that reason , Mr. Bromberg said , the restaurant typically told parents with small children not to let them eat “ more than one or two pieces . ”
Koji Oneda , a spokesman for Sushi Seki , said the restaurant would talk to its fish supplier about the issue .
A manager at Sushi of Gari , Tomi Tomono , said it warned pregnant women and regular customers who “ love to eat tuna ” about mercury levels .
Mr. Tomono also said the restaurant would put warning labels on the menu “ very soon . ”
Scientists who performed the analysis for The Times ran the tests several times to be sure there was no mistake in the levels of methylmercury , the form of mercury found in fish tied to health problems .
The work was done at the Environmental and Occupational Health Sciences Institute , in Piscataway , a partnership between Rutgers and the Robert Wood Johnson Medical School .
Crayfish body fossils and burrows discovered in Victoria , Australia , have provided the first physical evidence that crayfish existed on the continent as far back as the Mesozoic Era , says Emory University paleontologist Anthony Martin , who headed up a study on the finds .
" Studying the fossil burrows gives us a glimpse into the ecology of southern Australia about 115 million years ago , when the continent was still attached to Antarctica , " says Martin , a senior lecturer in environmental studies at Emory and an honorary research associate at Monash University in Melbourne .
During that era , diverse plants grew in what is today Antarctica and dinosaurs roamed in prolonged polar darkness along southern Australia river plains .
The period is of particular interest to scientists since it is believed to be the last time the Earth experienced pronounced global warming , with an average temperature of 68 degrees Fahrenheit – just 10 degrees warmer than today .
On Feb. 2 , the earth science journal Gondwana Research published online the results of the crayfish study , which was conducted by Martin and a consortium of Australian scientists , including Thomas Rich and Gary Poore of the Museum of Victoria ; Mark Schultz and Christopher Austin of Charles Darwin University ; and Lesley Kool and Patricia Vickers - Rich of Monash .
The crayfish body fossils consist of an abdomen and two claws , and the fossil burrows are nearly identical to those made by modern crayfish in southeastern Australia .
" Comparing these fossil burrows to those made by modern crayfish in Australia shows us that their behavior has n't changed that much , " says Martin , who specializes in trace fossils .
Biologists have long been fascinated by crayfish , due to their wide range – the freshwater decapods are found on almost every continent and have adapted to extremely diverse environments .
Thomas Huxley , a colleague of Charles Darwin , was the first scientist to ponder how crayfish , which cannot survive in saltwater , could have spread to so many continents , according to Martin .
Such studies helped lay the groundwork for plate tectonics , which revolutionized the earth sciences in the 1960s through the theory that the continents were once connected .
More recently , molecular biologists have theorized that all Southern Hemisphere crayfish originated in southeastern Australia .
" The evolution of Southern Hemisphere crayfish has challenged researchers since the 1870s , " Martin says .
" Only now , 140 years later , are we starting to put together the physical evidence for this evolution through the discovery of fossils . "

ONLY two months ago , Hillary Clinton looked unbeatable .
Her lead in the race to capture the Democratic nomination widened by the day .
Some polls put her as much as 30 points clear of Barack Obama , and she led in every one of the early - primary states .
All was sweet in Hillaryland .
No longer .
Mr Obama is now ahead , by a slender margin , in Iowa , which in less than three weeks will be the first state to vote .
This week he seemed to have eliminated the gap in New Hampshire , which will vote five days later ( and where independents crucially can vote in the Democratic primary ) .
Some polls now even show him ahead in South Carolina , the third important Democratic race , where until very recently Mrs Clinton was leading by more than 20 points .
But Mrs Clinton still has a formidable machine behind her .
For Mr Obama to sneak past her , he needs everything to go right ( whilst she just needs him to trip up once ) ; but there is now a real contest .
In principle , this is a good thing .
Democrats deserve a choice .
Even if Mrs Clinton prevails , it is better that she has been tested .
But what about Mr Obama himself ?
His rise is partly due to that familiar part of any presidential race : the front - runner 's wobble .
First , Mrs Clinton prevaricated during a debate ; then she panicked — attacking Mr Obama personally , which has gone down very badly , and tacking abruptly to the left with a startling disavowal of the free - trade policies so effectively promoted by her husband .
Meanwhile , though , Mr Obama has been picking up speed .
The bad news for Mr Obama is that he will now fall under the same degree of scrutiny that Mrs Clinton has endured for ages .
But there also seems to have been a change in mood .
Two months ago , this newspaper hazarded that the quality Americans most wanted was competence , and this remains the point on which the formidably intelligent and hard - working Mrs Clinton remains ahead .
( If she has much less experience than she claims , she still has more than Mr Obama . )
But the campaign is starting to focus on softer issues .
Weary of “ Bush - Clinton ” partisan politics , Americans may prefer someone who can bring their country , and the world , together .
The audacity of hope — and its limitations
This plays to Mr Obama 's strength : he has always been the candidate of “ hope ” .
As America 's first black president , he would show a new face to the world .
As someone who was educated in Indonesia and has an understanding of Islam that no other candidate shares , he could do much to bridge the deadly gulf between Christian and Muslim states .
He admits , bluntly , that “ the world has lost trust in our purposes and our principles ” — though he still reserves the right to use unilateral force .
At home , he would put an end to America 's depressing and vicious version of medieval England 's dynastic Wars of the Roses .
He appeals to Republican voters far more than any other Democrat , especially the detested Mrs Clinton .
This is not just spin .
A President Obama would turn preconceptions upside down : indeed he might be able to achieve far more both at home and abroad than any other candidate .
But hope does not balance budgets , craft alliances or reform schools .
It certainly does not prove that Mr Obama would be the best , or even a good , president .
Mr Obama cannot change his experience deficit ; but he can change his substance deficit .
His economic policies ( like those of the other Democrats , it must be said ) are crowd - pleasing stuff .
He is iffy about free trade .
He wants health insurance for all — and expects the rich to pay for it .
He wants schools to get better , but he panders to his leftist base by eschewing merit pay for teachers and independent charter schools .
On Iraq , he affects not to have noticed that the “ surge ” in and around Baghdad is producing palpable successes , and clings to the idea , beloved of his party base , that all troops should be withdrawn even before he putatively takes office .
There is something rather timid and unhopeful about all this .
Mr Obama is not prepared to break ranks with his party in the same way that John McCain divides Republicans over immigration or Rudy Giuliani does over abortion .
Where he has produced novel policies , they have sometimes been bizarre , such as his plan to fine mortgage - lenders who allow borrowers to get into debt , and to give the money to the “ victims ” .
Offering America a chance to heal its divisions is a powerful selling point .
But like Mrs Clinton 's competence , it is not enough .
Mr Obama still needs to do more to show how he defines change , as opposed just to personifying it .
If he can somehow do that , though , he will be a hard man to beat .
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - The Bush administration will ask the U.S. Congress next week for $ 70 billion to pay for the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and related operations for part of the 2009 fiscal year , the Pentagon said on Monday .

The new request is likely to set up another battle with Democrats who control Congress and are critical of President George W. Bush ’s handling of the Iraq war .
Congress has yet to approve most of Bush ’s fiscal 2008 war funding request .
Pentagon spokesman Bryan Whitman said the administration probably will not submit another war funding request after this one before leaving office next January .
That would make war funding one of the first issues facing the next president .
Since the September 11 , 2001 , attacks on the United States , Congress has approved $ 691 billion to pay for wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and such related activities as Iraq reconstruction , the Congressional Budget Office said last week .
Of the total , the CBO estimated that $ 440 billion had been spent on the war in Iraq .
The new war request will come on top of the administration ’s request for the regular Pentagon budget for fiscal 2009 , which starts on October 1 , 2008 .
But the two will be sent to Congress together next Monday as part of Bush ’s overall budget request .
“ We will ask for $ 70 billion in an emergency allowance to support global war on terror in 2009 , ” Whitman said .
Whitman would not say how long into 2009 the Pentagon believed the $ 70 billion would last but he made clear : “ This emergency request certainly wo n’t cover all of FY 09 . ”
PRESSURE FROM CONGRESS
In past years , members of Congress have pressed the administration to submit full war funding requests together with the regular Pentagon budget so that both can be subjected to the same level of scrutiny simultaneously .
Last year , the administration tried to meet that demand , submitting estimated full - year war costs with its regular budget .
Robert Bixby , the executive director of the Concord Coalition , a non-partisan group that promotes reducing the federal budget deficit , criticized the decision to submit only a partial funding request this time around .
“ The war ’s been going on a quite a long time , ” he said .
“ They have a pretty good idea what a full year costs . ”
He noted that because Bush ’s budget would not include full estimated war costs for 2009 , its deficit projections would look smaller than the likely true figure .
“ That ’s not a good thing , ” he said .
Brian Riedl of the conservative Heritage Foundation also criticized the move for its effect on deficit projections .
“ It would be better budgeting for the Pentagon to estimate the total funding that they would need for the full year , ” said Riedl , the foundation ’s lead budget analyst .
But the White House said Congress seemed to prefer partial funding and war costs were hard to predict far in advance .
“ It is important that the budget remain a reflection of the strategic decisions made by our military commanders -- not vice versa , ” said Sean Kevelighan , spokesman for the White House budget office .
The administration has requested a total of nearly $ 190 billion in war funding for the 2008 fiscal year , but Congress has not approved that amount .
In December , it approved a $ 70 billion “ bridge fund ” to cover part of the current fiscal year .
Democrats say those funds should be sufficient to last until around May or June .
The administration has not yet disclosed the planned size of the 2009 regular Pentagon budget .
For the current fiscal year , Bush requested $ 481.4 billion for the Pentagon and Congress provided about $ 460 billion .

Spring Heeled Jack
Sometimes “ Spring Heeled Jack ” pops up in literature –sometimes as a villain , sometimes as a hero–perhaps even an early ancestor of modern superheroes .
The strange bit is the fact that Spring Heeled Jack is based on real events and a real person from Victorian era England who purportedly leapt over walls and onto rooftops easily , assaulted men , accosted women , blew gouts of flame from his mouth , and always eluded capture while laughing with mad mirth .
The first confirmed sightings of old Spring Heel were in London of September 1837 – though there is speculation that he was in action some twenty years previous .
A man walking home late one night reported a muscular male with devilishly pointed ears and glowing red eyes had leapt over the tall cemetery fence with ease and landed right in front of him .
This witness did not report being attacked or harassed by Jack , making him one of the lucky few .
Shortly later a barmaid named Polly Adams was found laying in the street in a state of semi-undress .
She reported that she ’d been attacked by a man of the same evil features who has ripped off the top of her blouse , grabbed her naked breasts with his corpse - cold hands , and deeply scratched her belly with his claws .
In October , Mary Stevens reported a man leapt out of the shadows , gripped her tightly and began to kiss her face .
She cried out and raised an alarm , but her attacker was never found .
The very next day the character jumped into the road and caused a carriage to run out of control and tip .
Witnesses reported that the perpetrator escaped by bounding over a nine - foot wall and laughing all the way .
A few days later the sinister figure appeared again , and for the first time the police called to the scene found something of interest : a pair of very deep tracks in the mud that indicated that they had been made from a great height .
One of the investigators of the time noted the tracks hinted to some gadgetry on the shoes , and speculated that it might be “ some sort of compressed springs ” .
At the time no one saw fit to make moulds of the prints , but the story got out , and from it the media affixed the name Spring Heeled Jack .
Cover of a Penny Dreadful
Sightings of SHJ continued sporadically through England for the next several years .
Besides accosting women , slapping men , and generally causing traffic mayhem , somewhere on the way Jack acquired the means to belch blue or white fire .
Many , including the Lord Mayor of London were skeptical , but he did receive and heed a letter stating that a nobleman had taken a wager to take on disguises and try to scare women out of their senses .
Spring Heeled Jack came and vanished from notoriety over the years .
His most famous attacks took place in February 1838 , and the last confirmed sighting of him was in 1872 when he jumped amidst a squad of soldiers and slapped one soundly .
One of the soldiers claimed to have shot Spring Heeled , but other than a hollow , metallic sound like shooting a bucket , all it did was tick SHJ off , and send him to chasing the soldiers with his belches of blue flame .
After a few days of bothering the soldiers a mob caught sight of Jack , and laid chase .
Though they too claim to have shot him , he never slowed , and jumped right out of the area .
From 1837 to 1872 is a fairly notable career , but more surprising , there have been more recent reports of Spring Heeled Jack , including a spree in Sheffield in the 1970 ’s , and one in 1986 .
So maybe he was a drunken noble out to win a bet , and became a part of folklore .
The popular reading of the day was a “ Penny Dreadful ” which depicted haunting tales , and these publications could n’t resist .
Perhaps they exaggerated Jack ’s appearance and traits , perhaps those exaggerations melded with real incidents in people ’s minds , leaving history as an amalgam of fiction and truth .
Strangely , when Spring Heeled Jack first appeared in literature , he was unwaveringly a villain , but over the years , he has morphed into a heroic icon .
Maybe Jack did n’t have springs in his heels at all–there is a faction who have him pegged as an alien from a high - gravity world .
The relatively low gravity on Earth would account for his hopping talents , whereas an extra- terrestrial origin could account for his longevity .
I suppose if there were a world with that kind of unforgiving gravity , and the natives all spewed flames , some of them would inevitably seek more hospitable environs .
Who or what Spring Heeled Jack really was are things we may never know .
We ’ll just have to make due with the dozens of police reports that attest that he has , indeed , haunted the streets of London .
YOU are annoying .
MOST Ron Paulbots are annoying .
It 's not the issues that are annoying ... it 's not HIM that 's annoying - IT'S the MAJORITY of his supporters who flocked to THIS site and others , signed up , and NOW puke and preach their support for him on every thread .
IT 'S LIKE SPAM .
And it 's like that old GOP bullying BS that had them all trumpeting Bush and shouting down in unison anyone who would dare critique the scumbag or any of his administration 's policies .
I do n't care how many of you Rontrons are out there or how much money he 's got .
I do n't care that he 's a doctor .
I do n't care about the cutesy little rePAULsive tag - lines his supporters come up with .
I 've read his stances on HIS website .
I 've heard all his SUPPORTERS ' arguments .
Waded through all of THEIR repetitive tripe and heralding of their false messiah .
Witnessed the rabid responses , ridicule , and mob attacks perpetraited by his SUPPORTERS against anyone giving even the tiniest notion that they do not agree with his HERD'S mentality ...
Yeah , so I 'd say , the majority of the Ronbot Paultrons that I 've come across are downright lousy company and more than a little annoying .
I wo n't support a Libertarian .
I wo n't support a Republican .
I wo n't support an Independent who was formerly EITHER of those .
And it 's not my responsibility or obligation to give you a ' better than Dr. Paul candidate ' just because I will not support him , do n't agree with him on every issue , or choose not to throw blood in the water for his followers .
His SUPPORTERS have shown time and again how they treat dissent , opposition , and other viewpoints ...
I 've seen that film before .
NEW YORK ( AP ) -
Two men wheeled a dead man through the streets in an office chair to a check - cashing store and tried to cash his Social Security check before being arrested on fraud charges , police said .
David J. Dalaia and James O'Hare pushed Virgilio Cintron 's body from the Manhattan apartment that O'Hare and Cintron shared to Pay - O - Matic , about a block away , spokesman Paul Browne said witnesses told police .
" The witnesses saw the two pushing the chair with Cintron flopping from side to side and the two individuals propping him up and keeping him from flopping from side to side , " Browne said .
The men left Cintron 's body outside the store , went inside and tried to cash his $ 355 check , Browne said .
The store 's clerk , who knew Cintron , asked the men where he was , and O'Hare told the clerk they would go and get him , Browne said .
A police detective who was having lunch at a restaurant next to the check - cashing store noticed a crowd forming around Cintron 's body , and " it 's immediately apparent to him that Cintron is dead , " Browne said .
The detective called uniformed New York Police Department officers at a nearby precinct .
Emergency medical technicians arrived as O'Hare and Dalaia were preparing to wheel Cintron 's body into the check - cashing store , Browne said .
Police arrested Dalaia and O'Hare there , he said .
Cintron 's body was taken to a hospital morgue .
The medical examiner 's office told police it appeared Cintron , 66 , had died of natural causes within the previous 24 hours , Browne said .
" He was deceased in the apartment when he was removed by these two , " Browne said .
Dalaia and O'Hare , both 65 , were being held by police and faced check fraud charges , Browne said .
A call to a telephone number listed for Cintron at the apartment he shared with O'Hare went unanswered Tuesday evening .
Police said they did n't have an address for Dalaia or attorney information for him or O'Hare .

プログラムの高速化はプログラマにとって永遠の課題です。しかし，そこには知られざる暗黒面が隠れています。そもそも高速化に意味があるのかを調べなければなりません。次に，どの部分をどの程度高速化するのかが重要です。アルゴリズムの効率にも目配りが必要です。
コンピュータの処理速度は驚くべき勢いで向上しています。現在私たちが使っているパソコンは一昔前のスーパーコンピュータをしのぐ性能を備えていますし，半世紀前に登場したばかりの計算機と比較すると数十万倍の性能に相当します。
このように高速なコンピュータを持っているにもかかわらず，人間の欲望は限りがないものです。プログラムの実行速度はプログラマにとっての永遠の課題のようです。プログラムを高速化していると，「そんなに急いでどこに行く」という気になることもあります。
今回は，プログラムの高速化にまつわるさまざまな「秘密」と「限界」，そして「戦略」について解説しましょう。
「 速いことはよいこと 」なのか
プログラムの高速化（パフォーマンス・チューニング）というテーマを考える際，一歩引く必要があります。プログラムの高速化がいつも望ましいとは限りません。他のさまざまな要素と同様，パフォーマンスにもトレードオフが存在します。常に速度が最も重要ならば，常に最高速のマシンを用意しなければなりません。さらに，最も高速なプログラムを記述できる低水準言語（例えばアセンブリ言語）をプログラミングに使用する必要があるかもしれません。
しかし，速度を最優先することが良いとは限りません。予算，開発効率，開発期間などの制約の中，高速化が本当に割に合う場合にだけ，高速化のコストを払うべきです。
例えば，100Mバイトのデータを処理するプログラムをRubyを用いて記述したとします。コーディングに30分かかり，実行に2時間かかったとしましょう。時間の合計は2時間30分です。同じ処理を30分で終えようとして，プログラムをCで記述した場合，8時間かかったとしたらどうでしょうか。実行時間は短くなりましたが，合計は8時間30分です。どちらがおトクかは言うまでもないでしょう。
しかし，この処理を毎日繰り返し実行するとなれば，結果が出るまでに待つ時間が2時間と30分では全然違いますから，C言語で8時間かけて開発する意味が出てくるでしょう。
繰り返しになりますが，パフォーマンスはトレードオフです。通常は，必要な処理が必要な時間内に計算できればそれで十分です。制約も何も考えずに「とにかく速く」と高速化に飛び付くのはあまり賢明とは思えません。
高速化の楽しみと効 率
プログラマにとって，プログラムを高速化する行為そのものが知的なチャレンジです。どこが遅いのかを探し出し，問題点を推測し，改善することでプログラムの実行が次第に速くなっていきます。ある種のパズルを解くような「楽しさ」があります。改良の結果が実行時間というはっきりとした数字で現れます。パフォーマンス・チューニングの達成感はプログラミングの中でも最も充実した部分だと言えるかもしれません。
それはそれで結構なことですが，実務においては達成感だけでは済みません。仮に私のノート・パソコンの値段が20万円で，3年間使えるとすると，1秒当たりの値段に換算すると0.00211円にしかなりません。私の時給が仮に（実際よりもかなり低い数字ですが）760円だとします。実行時間を10秒速くするために1時間使ったとすると，その1時間を取り返すために，高速化したプログラムをよほど繰り返し実行しなければならないでしょう。単純計算でも3万6000回近く繰り返さないと760円を取り返せません。
趣味のプログラミングならともかく，実務ではパフォーマンス・チューニングに取り掛かる前に，本当に高速化が必要なのかを確認しなければなりません。どの程度高速化する必要があるのかを前もって見積もっておく必要があるでしょう。

It was not immediately clear on Thursday what the working model that ARM plans to show at Mobile World Congress in Barcelona would look like or who would supply the parts .
Google plans to deploy phones and services using the Android platform commercially in the second half of this year .
Google and ARM declined to comment on the report .
Google established an alliance of more than 30 carriers , handset makers , software firms and chipmakers in November to develop Android , which is based on open - source software and designed to make the Internet work better on mobile phones .
Deutsche Telekom's DTEGn.DE T - Mobile and Taiwan's High Tech Computer Corp ( HTC ) 2498 .
TW have said that they plan to offer phones based on the Android platform this year .
Internet search leader Google 's entry into the wireless industry will upset established relationships between carriers , cellphone makers and customers and could challenge Nokia NOK1V.HE , Microsoft Corp MSFT.O and Apple Inc AAPL.O , among others .
Google is also bidding for wireless spectrum in the United States in a move that pits it against entrenched carriers like AT&T T.N and Verizon Wireless VZ.NVOD.L .
Its operator partners in the Open Handset Alliance include China Mobile 0941.HK , NTT DoCoMo 9437.T , KDDI 9433.T and Telefonica TEF .MC -- all of which have said they are working with handset makers to develop Google - based phones .
Research firm Strategy Analytics has estimated that Android will be in 2 percent of smartphones this year .
And how do you see it ?
Will you buy a lot and hold on ?
Will it be a fire sale ?
Or will you start drinking early ?

Stocks fell sharply worldwide Monday following declines on Wall Street last week amid investor pessimism over the U.S. government ’s stimulus plan to prevent a recession … ritain ’s benchmark FTSE - 100 slumped 5.5 percent to 5,578.20 , France ’s CAC - 40 Index tumbled 6.8 percent to 4,744.15 , and Germany ’s blue - chip DAX 30 plunged 7.2 percent to 6,790.19 .
In Asia , India ’s benchmark stock index tumbled 7.4 percent , while Hong Kong ’s blue - chip Hang Seng index plummeted 5.5 percent to 23,818.86 , its biggest percentage drop since the Sept. 11 , 2001 , terror attacks .
Canadian stocks fell as well , with the S&P / TSX composite index on the Toronto Stock Exchange down 4 percent in early afternoon trading .
In Brazil , stocks plunged 6.9 percent on the main index of Sao Paulo ’s Bovespa exchange .
Investors dumped shares because they were skeptical that an economic stimulus plan President Bush announced Friday would shore up the economy that has been battered by problems in its housing and credit markets .
The plan , which requires approval by Congress , calls for about $ 145 billion worth of tax relief to encourage consumer spending .
A Black Agenda Radio commentary by Glen Ford
The American disinformation regime - a hermetically sealed " bubble " - convinces its citizens that the U.S. is and forever will be supreme on the planet .
Ignorance may be bliss , but cannot alter the facts of rapid U.S. decline , a spiral that is the inevitable " blowback " of 60 years of undeserved , coerced , and artificially constructed dominance .
The tools and traps that were designed to ensnare the planet in the U.S. corporate / military web , have instead led to American shrinkage in all things except military might .
But weapons of war cannot replace a bulldozed manufacturing base , or reinvigorate a service sector whose services are increasingly unwanted , or repair a U.S. - led financial system that is terminally choked with worthless paper " instruments . "
The West - East , North - South shift is well underway - whether Americans know it or not .
Americans of all races behave as if the United States is the center of the world .
This is quite dangerous , not just to the 95 percent of the world 's people who do not live in the United States , but to the U.S. population , as well .
The planetary financial pyramid atop which the U.S. has perched its over - fat and undeserving butt for over 60 years , is in a state of transformation .
The countries that actually produce things - oil , gas , manufactured goods , minerals , and most of the planet 's agricultural commodities - can no longer support the dead weight of artificial and pretentious U.S. claims to supremacy .
Most of us are somewhat familiar with the dollar 's problems , its ever - falling value .
But the global system , itself , is hopelessly out of balance , and has outlived its usefulness .
The grand schemes and dreams of corporate globalism , centered in the U.S. , have n't worked out as the American ruling elite expected .
Corporate globalism was supposed to open up vast new markets to U.S. companies and money - masters , and to hopelessly entangle foreign governments and elites in a system controlled by U.S. financial institutions and their servant organizations like the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank .
The United States would n't have to manufacture anything anymore , but would remain top dog by " servicing " the world economy - at a premium , of course .
That 's why all those office skyscrapers have replaced factories in American cities .
" The era of U.S. domination is coming to a close , whether the American people know it or not . "
If anybody in the rest of the world did n't like this arrangement , the U.S. military was available to Shock and Awe them into submission .
That 's why the United States spends more money on weapons than all of the rest of the planet , combined .
The dollar was a weapon , too .
Since it was the only world reserve currency , the dollar could be used as a club to beat down resistance among nations that wanted to cut a better deal for themselves in the world market .
But it 's worse than that .
The U.S. and European financial order is paralyzed , having created phony money in the form of hundreds of trillions of dollars in derivatives and other paper instruments that they can't sell to anybody - not even each other .
That 's the real definition of a " paper tiger " - and the world knows it .
The U.S. subprime crisis is only a symptom of a much larger , global sea change .
What will Obama , or Clinton , or McCain do about it ?
They do n't have a clue .
And the American people understand the real world less than citizens of any other industrialized nation .
Which means , as the crisis deepens , we wo n't know what hit us , here in what we thought was the center of the world .
For Black Agenda Radio , I 'm Glen Ford .
GOP Congressman indicted for extortion , money laundering Nick Juliano
Published : Friday February 22 , 2008
|
Print This Email This Republican Rep. Rick Renzi has been indicted for extortion , wire fraud , money laundering and other charges related to a land deal in Arizona .
A 26 - page federal indictment unsealed in Arizona accuses Renzi and two former business partners of conspiring to promote the sale of land that buyers could swap for property owned by the federal government .
The sale netted one of Renzi 's former partners $ 4.5 million .
Nearly a year ago , as RAW STORY reported , the embattled congressman denied newspaper reports and rumors that he planned on resigning , as the FBI probed .
The congressman did relinquish all three of his House committee assignments , including his seat on the House Intelligence Committee .
He has since decided not to run for re-election .
Renzi also is a co-chairman of Republican presidential candidate John McCain 's Arizona leadership team .
And the Arizona Senator aided Renzi 's re-election bid .
Speaking to reporters at a campaign stop in Indiana Thursday , McCain , an Arizona senator , demurred when asked about the indictment .
" I 'm sorry .
I feel for the family ; as you know , he has 12 children , " McCain told reporters , according to the Associated Press .
" But I do n't know enough of the details to make a judgment .
These kinds of things are always very unfortunate ....
I rely on our Department of Justice and system of justice to make the right outcome . "
House Minority Leader John Boehner ( R - OH ) is reportedly urging Renzi to resign , according to The Hill .
" I have made it clear that I will hold our members to the highest standards of ethical conduct , " Boehner is quoted as saying in a statement .
" The charges contained in this indictment are completely unacceptable for a member of Congress , and I strongly urge Rep. Renzi to seriously consider whether he can continue to effectively represent his constituents under these circumstances . "
Renzi was under FBI investigation before the 2006 mid-term elections , but the Justice Department delayed approving necessary investigation tools for federal investigators in Arizona before November .
In April 2007 , federal agents raided a Sonoita , Arizona business owned by Renzi 's wife , Roberta .
At the timeSpeculation mounted that former Attorney General Alberto Gonzales may have intervened to slow down the probe before Renzi was re-elected .
The AP summed up the indictment as follows :
The extensive legal document says Renzi refused in 2005 and 2006 to secure congressional approval for land swaps by two unnamed businesses if they did not agree to buy [ former Renzi business partner James W. ]
Sandlin 's property as a part of the deal .
Renzi had previously owned some of Sandlin 's property , the indictment says .
In early 2005 , one of the businesses seeking surface rights for a copper mining project in Renzi 's district failed to buy Sandlin 's land .
As a result , the indictment says , Renzi allegedly told the business , " No Sandlin property , no bill . "
At the time , Sandlin owed Renzi $ 700,000 out of the land 's selling price of $ 800,000 .
Renzi also allegedly concealed his business relationship with Sandlin , even though the company had expressly asked if there was one .
Meanwhile , Renzi allegedly pushed the land on a second firm , an unnamed investment group , that was trying to secure a federal land swap .
If the firm accepted Sandlin 's property as part of the transaction , Renzi allegedly said investors would receive a " free pass " through the House Natural Resources Committee , according to the indictment .
In April 2005 , the investors reluctantly agreed to the deal .
Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington , an independent ethics watchdog , listed Renzi in its annual " Beyond DeLay " report on corruption in Congress .

The Planning Service website was shut down last week
The websites , including the Planning Service 's , were out of action for a number of days while the attack was investigated .
The Northern Ireland Statistics and Research Agency website still cannot be accessed .
A Department of the Environment ( DoE ) spokesman said no information had been " lost or damaged " .
" Over the weekend of 2 - 3 February an attempt was made to hack into a web server , owned and maintained by the Northern Ireland Civil Service 's IT Shared Service Centre , which hosts a number of government websites including Planning Service's , " said the DoE spokeswoman .
" The security systems in place identified this activity and the server was immediately shut down . "
The Planning Service 's website contains , among other things , information about planning applications being made across Northern Ireland 's 26 council areas .
No information was " lost or damaged "
Environment Minister Arlene Foster said she only learned of the security breach on Monday night .
" It is very concerning to hear of people being able to hack into government sites , " she said .
" Obviously it is something that the government will have to review , just as we did with our data .
" This is another issue which we are going to have to look at very seriously . "
In a statement , the Department of Finance and Personnel said the hacking incident was detected on the Northern Ireland Statistics & Research Agency ( NISRA ) website .
" The site was immediately taken off - line and investigations started .
Because Northern Ireland Civil Service sites are run via clusters of servers , the Planning Service site was also taken off - line , " said the statement .
" We are hoping to get full service restored within the next 48 hours but this is contingent upon the web sites being checked as part of our ongoing security testing activities . "

Geert Wilders , the popular MP whose film on Islam has fuelled the debate on race in Holland , wants an end to mosque building and Muslim immigration .
Ian Traynor met him in The Hague
A TV addict with bleached hair who adores Maggie Thatcher and prefers kebabs to hamburgers , Geert Wilders has got nothing against Muslims .
He just hates Islam .
Or so he says .
' Islam is not a religion , it 's an ideology , ' says Wilders , a lanky Roman Catholic right - winger , ' the ideology of a retarded culture . '
The Dutch politician , who sees himself as heir to a recent string of assassinated or hounded mavericks who have turned Holland upside down , has been doing a crash course in Koranic study .
Likening the Islamic sacred text to Hitler 's Mein Kampf , he wants the ' fascist Koran ' outlawed in Holland , the constitution rewritten to make that possible , all immigration from Muslim countries halted , Muslim immigrants paid to leave and all Muslim ' criminals ' stripped of Dutch citizenship and deported ' back where they came from ' .
But he has nothing against Muslims .
' I have a problem with Islamic tradition , culture , ideology .
Not with Muslim people . '
Wilders has been immersing himself in the suras and verse of seventh - century Arabia .
The outcome of his scholarship , a short film , has Holland in a panic .
He is just putting the finishing touches to the 10 - minute film , he says , and talking to four TV channels about screening it .
' It 's like a walk through the Koran , ' he explains in a sterile conference room in the Dutch parliament in The Hague , security chaps hovering outside .
' My intention is to show the real face of Islam .
I see it as a threat .
I 'm trying to use images to show that what 's written in the Koran is giving incentives to people all over the world .
On a daily basis Moroccan youths are beating up homosexuals on the streets of Amsterdam . '
Wilders is lucid and shrewd and the provactive soundbites trip easily off his tongue .
He was recently voted Holland 's most effective politician .
If 18 months ago he sat alone in the second chamber or lower house in The Hague , his People 's Party now has nine of 150 seats and is running at about 15 per cent in the polls .
His Islam - bashing seems to be paying off .
And not only in Holland .
All across Europe , the new breed of right - wing populists are trying to revive their political fortunes by appealing to anti-Muslim prejudice .
A few months ago the Swiss People 's Party of the pugnacious billionaire Christoph Blocher won a general election while simultaneously running a campaign to change the Swiss constitution to ban the building of minarets on mosques .
Last month in Antwerp , far - right leaders from 15 European cities and from political parties in Belgium , Germany and Austria got together to launch a charter ' against the Islamisation of western European cities ' , reiterating the call for a mosque - building moratorium .
' We already have more than 6,000 mosques in Europe , which are not only a place to worship but also a symbol of radicalisation , some financed by extreme groups in Saudi Arabia or Iran , ' argued Filip Dewinter , leader of Belgium 's Flemish separatist party , the Vlaams Belang , who organised the Antwerp get - together .
' Its minarets are six floors high , higher than the floodlights of the Feyenoord soccer stadium , ' he said of a new mosque being built in Rotterdam .
' These kinds of symbols have to stop . '
Where a few years ago the far right in Europe concentrated its fire on immigration , these days Islam is fast becoming the most popular target .
It is a campaign that is having mixed results .
In Switzerland , the Blocher party has been highly successful .
In Holland , Wilders is thriving by constantly poking sticks in the eyes of the politically correct Dutch establishment .
But when Susanne Winter ran for a seat on the local council in the Austrian city of Graz last month by branding the Prophet Muhammad a child molester , she lost her far - right Freedom Party votes .
For the mainstream centre - right in Europe , foreigner - bashing is also backfiring .
Roland Koch , the German Christian Democrat once tipped as a future Chancellor , wrecked his chances a fortnight ago by forfeiting a 12 - point lead in a state election after a campaign that denounced Muslim ritual slaughter practices and called for the deportation of young immigrant criminals .
Wilders echoes some of the arguments against multiculturalism that have convulsed Germany in recent years .
Like many on the traditional German right , he wants the European Judaeo - Christian tradition to be formally recognised as the dominating culture , or Leitkultur .
' There is no equality between our culture and the retarded Islamic culture .
Look at their views on homosexuality or women , ' he says .
But if Wilders shares positions and aims with others on the far right in Europe , he is also a very specific Dutch phenomenon , viewing himself as a libertarian provocateur like the late Pim Fortuyn or Theo van Gogh , railing against ' Islamisation ' as a threat to what used to be the easy - going Dutch model of tolerance .
' My allies are not Le Pen or Haider , ' he emphasises .
' We 'll never join up with the fascists and Mussolinis of Italy .
I 'm very afraid of being linked with the wrong rightist fascist groups . '
Dutch iconoclasm , Scandinavian insistence on free expression , the right to provoke are what drive him , he says .
He shrugs off anxieties that his film will trigger a fresh bout of violence of the kind that left Van Gogh stabbed to death on an Amsterdam street and his estranged colleague Ayaan Hirsi Ali in hiding , or the murderous furore over the Danish cartoons in 2005 .
The Dutch government is planning emergency evacuation of its nationals and diplomats from the Middle East should the Wilders film be shown .
It is alarmed about the impact on Dutch business .
' Our Prime Minister is a big coward .
The government is weak , ' says Wilders .
' They hate my guts and I do n't like them either . '
And if people are murdered as a result of his film ?
' They say that if there 's bloodshed it would be the responsibility of this strange politician .
It 's almost a self - fulfilling prophecy .
They 're creating an atmosphere .
I 'm not responsible for using democratic means and acting within the law .
I do n't want Dutch people or Dutch interests to be hurt . '
But he does want to create a stir .
' Islam is something we can't afford any more in the Netherlands .
I want the fascist Koran banned .
We need to stop the Islamisation of the Netherlands .
That means no more mosques , no more Islamic schools , no more imams ...
Not all Muslims are terrorists , but almost all terrorists are Muslims . '
Free speech or hate speech ?
' I do n't create hate .
I want to be honest .
I do n't hate people .
I do n't hate Muslims .
I hate their book and their ideology . '
For more than three years , Wilders has been paying for his ' honesty ' by living under permanent police guard as the internet bristles with threats on his life .
He has lived in army barracks , in prisons , under guard at home .
' There 's no freedom , no privacy .
If I said I was not afraid , I would be lying . '
There is little doubt that if Wilders 's film exists - and it's shrouded in secrecy - and is broadcast , it will be construed as blasphemy in large parts of the world and may spark a new bloody crisis in relations between the West and the Muslim world .
He does not seem to care .
' People ask why do n't you moderate your voice and not make this movie .
If I do that and not say what I think , then the extremists who threaten me would win . '
Mechanical Mirrors :
The 4 mechanical mirrors are made of various materials but share the same behavior and interaction ; any person standing in front of one of these pieces is instantly reflected on its surface .
The mechanical mirrors all have video cameras , motors and computers on board and produce a soothing sound as the viewer interacts with them .
Sweet goodness !
What a great idea .
Manufacturing
Beer bottles to convert to brick structures for later use .
This reminds me of the POM bottles that can be used as regular glass cups for home use .
Why ca n’t this come back to reality !
The amount of bottles tossed each year is absurd .
Makes me want to ask photographer Chris Jordan to make a visual map of it for his “ Running Numbers ” series !
( Did ya know in the USA alone we go through 106,000 aluminum cans every 30 seconds !
It ’s absurd ! )
There ’s also the “ 66 Beer Bottle= a cheap solar water heater ” direction .
“ Upcycling is a 21st century term , coined by Cradle to Cradle authors William McDonough and Michael Braungart , but the idea of turning waste into useful products came to life brilliantly in 1963 with the Heineken WOBO ( world bottle ) .
Envisioned by beer brewer Alfred Heineken and designed by Dutch architect John Habraken , the â€œbrick that holds beerâ€ was ahead of its ecodesign time , letting beer lovers and builders alike drink and design all in one sitting .
Mr. Heinekenâ€™s idea came after a visit to the Caribbean where he saw two problems : beaches littered with bottles and a lack of affordable building materials .
The WOBO became his vision to solve both the recycling and housing challenges that he had witnessed on the islands . ”
I want I want !!!
It ’s like buying Lego ’s with your beer bottle as an adult !
or you can just reuse what you have laying around much like the students at Western Washington University . ( their show is in Seattle today , Nov 10th , 5 - 7 pm )

An ignoble anniversary
The past few years , we ’ve taken to highlighting certain anniversaries , many of them painful .
The fifth anniversary of 9/11 , the fourth anniversary of the Iraqi invasion , the third anniversary of the “ Mission Accomplished ” speech , etc .
It has n’t received much recognition in previous years , but today , Aug. 6 , is a noteworthy anniversary as well — six years ago today , the president , on vacation in Crawford , was handed an intelligence briefing document .
It was titled , “ Bin Ladin Determined to Strike in US . ”
In 2004 , Larry Johnson , a former CIA officer and the State Department ’s counterterrorism chief , explained that a Presidential Daily Briefing like that one should have sent Bush back to the Oval Office .
Johnson , who ’d written dozens of PDBs during Bush 41 ’s presidency , said the documents are usually brief and dispassionate .
The one on Aug. 6 , 2001 , was a page and a half , with a title meant to capture the president ’s attention .
“ That ’s the intelligence - community equivalent of writing War and Peace , ” Johnson said .
Johnson added that when he read the declassified document , “ I said , ‘ Holy smoke ! ’
This is such a dead - on ‘ Mr. President , you ’ve got to do something ! ’ ”
He did n’t .
[ A ] n unnamed CIA briefer who flew to Bush ’s Texas ranch during the scary summer of 2001 , amid a flurry of reports of a pending al - Qaeda attack , to call the president ’s attention personally to the now - famous Aug. 6 , 2001 , memo titled “ Bin Ladin Determined to Strike in US . ”
Bush reportedly heard the briefer out and replied : “ All right .
You ’ve covered your ass , now . ”
Top intelligence officials — George Tenet , Richard Clarke , and others — were running around with their “ hair on fire , ” warning that al Qaeda was about to unleash a major attack .
Bush , tragically , treated his intelligence briefings about Osama bin Laden as perfunctory chores that he had to endure .
Based on the “ covered your ass ” comment , it was almost as if the president was humoring the CIA briefer .
Slate ’s Fred Kaplan explained a while back :
The revelation came this morning , when CIA Director George Tenet was on the stand .
Timothy Roemer , a former Democratic congressman , asked him when he first found out about the report from the FBI ’s Minnesota field office that Zacarias Moussaoui , an Islamic jihadist , had been taking lessons on how to fly a 747 .
Tenet replied that he was briefed about the case on Aug. 23 or 24 , 2001 .
Roemer then asked Tenet if he mentioned Moussaoui to President Bush at one of their frequent morning briefings .
Tenet replied , “ I was not in briefings at this time . ”
Bush , he noted , “ was on vacation . ”
He added that he did n’t see the president at all in August 2001 .
During the entire month , Bush was at his ranch in Texas .
“ You never talked with him ? ” Roemer asked .
“ No , ” Tenet replied .
By the way , for much of August , Tenet too was , as he put it , “ on leave . ”
And there you have it .
National Security Adviser Condoleezza
Rice has made a big point of the fact that Tenet briefed the president nearly every day .
Yet at the peak moment of threat , the two did n’t talk at all .
At a time when action was needed , and orders for action had to come from the top , the man at the top was resting undisturbed .
Throughout that summer , we now well know , Tenet , Richard Clarke , and several other officials were running around with their “ hair on fire , ” warning that al - Qaida was about to unleash a monumental attack .
On Aug. 6 , Bush was given the now - famous President ’s Daily Brief ( by one of Tenet ’s underlings ) , warning that this attack might take place “ inside the United States . ”
For the previous few years — as Philip Zelikow , the commission ’s staff director , revealed this morning — the CIA had issued several warnings that terrorists might fly commercial airplanes into buildings or cities .
And now , we learn today , at this peak moment , Tenet hears about Moussaoui .
Someone might have added 2 + 2 + 2 and possibly busted up the conspiracy .
But the president was down on the ranch , taking it easy .
Tenet was n’t with him .
Tenet never talked with him .
Rice — as she has testified — was n’t with Bush , either .
He was on his own and , willfully , out of touch .
Six years ago today , Bush received one of the most important warnings any president has ever received — and he told the CIA official who handed him the warning , “ All right .
You ’ve covered your ass , now . ”
An ignoble anniversary , indeed .
9/11 COMMISSIONERS
The co-chairs of the 9/11 Commission ( Thomas Keane and Lee Hamilton ) said that the CIA ( and likely the White House ) " obstructed our investigation " .
The co-chairs of the 9/11 Commission also said that the 9/11 Commissioners knew that military officials misrepresented the facts to the Commission , and the Commission considered recommending criminal charges for such false statements , yet did n't bother to tell the American people ( free subscription required ) .
Indeed , the co-chairs of the Commission now admit that the Commission largely operated based upon political considerations
9/11 Commission co-chair Lee Hamilton says " I do n't believe for a minute we got everything right " , that the Commission was set up to fail , that people should keep asking questions about 9/11 , that the 9/11 debate should continue , and that the 9/11 Commission report was only " the first draft " of history .
9/11 Commissioner Bob Kerrey said that " There are ample reasons to suspect that there may be some alternative to what we outlined in our version . . .
We did n't have access . . . . "
9/11 Commissioner Timothy Roemer said " We were extremely frustrated with the false statements we were getting "
Former 9/11 Commissioner Max Cleland resigned from the Commission , stating : " It is a national scandal " ; " This investigation is now compromised " ; and " One of these days we will have to get the full story because the 9 - 11 issue is so important to America .
But this White House wants to cover it up " .
9/11 Commissioner John Lehman said that “ We purposely put together a staff that had – in a way - conflicts of interest " .
The Senior Counsel to the 9/11 Commission ( John Farmer ) who led the 9/11 staff 's inquiry , said " I was shocked at how different the truth was from the way it was described ....
The tapes told a radically different story from what had been told to us and the public for two years ....
This is not spin .
This is not true . "
CONGRESS
According to the Co-Chair of the Congressional Inquiry into 9/11 and former Head of the Senate Intelligence Committee , Bob Graham , a U.S. government informant was the landlord to two of the hijackers for over a year ( but the White House refused to let the 9/11 inquiry interview him ) .
Current U.S. Senator ( Patrick Leahy ) states " The two questions that the congress will not ask . . . is why did 9/11 happen on George Bush 's watch when he had clear warnings that it was going to happen ?
Why did they allow it to happen ? "
Current Republican Congressman ( Ron Paul ) states that " we see the [ 9/11 ] investigations that have been done so far as more or less cover - up and no real explanation of what went on "
Current Democratic Congressman ( Dennis Kucinich ) hints that we are n't being told the truth about 9/11
Former Democratic Senator ( Mike Gravel ) states that he supports a new 9/11 investigation and that we do n't know the truth about 9/11
Former U.S. Democratic Congressman ( Dan Hamburg ) says that the U.S. government " assisted " in the 9/11 attacks , stating that " I think there was a lot of help from the inside "
Former U.S. Republican Congressman and senior member of the House Armed Services Committee , and who served six years as the Chairman of the Military Research and Development Subcommittee ( Curt Weldon ) has shown that the U.S. tracked hijackers before 9/11 , is open to hearing information about explosives in the Twin Towers , and is open to the possibility that 9/11 was an inside job
MILITARY LEADERS
Bronze Star , Silver Star , and Purple Heart ( General Wesley Clark )
" I am 100 % convinced that the attacks of September 11 , 2001 were planned , organized , and committed by treasonous perpetrators that have infiltrated the highest levels of our government ....
Those of us in the military took an oath to " support and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies , foreign and domestic " .
Just because we have retired does not make that oath invalid , so it is not just our responsibility , it is our duty to expose the real perpetrators of 9/11 and bring them to justice , no matter how hard it is , how long it takes , or how much we have to suffer to do it .
We owe it to those who have gone before us who executed that same oath , and who are doing the same thing in Iraq and Afghanistan right now .
Those of us who joined the military and faithfully executed orders that were given us had to trust our leaders .
The violation and abuse of that trust is not only heinous , but ultimately the most accurate definition of treason ! "
" This is n't about party , it is n't about Bush Bashing .
It 's about our country , our constitution , and our future .
...
Your countrymen have been murdered and the more you delve into it the more it looks as though they were murdered by our government , who used it as an excuse to murder other people thousands of miles away .
If you ridicule others who have sincere doubts and who know factual information that directly contradicts the official report and who want explanations from those who hold the keys to our government , and have motive , means , and opportunity to pull off a 9/11 , but you are too lazy or fearful , or ... to check into the facts yourself , what does that make you ?
....
Are you afraid that you will learn the truth and you can't handle it ? ... "
INTELLIGENCE PROFESSIONALS
SCIENTISTS
Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense under President Ronald Reagan ( Col. Ronald D. Ray ) said that the official story of 9/11 is " the dog that does n't hunt " Director of the U.S. " Star Wars " space defense program in both Republican and Democratic administrations , who was a senior air force colonel who flew 101 combat missions ( Col. Robert Bowman ) stated that 9/11 was an inside job .
He also said : U.S. Army Air Defense Officer and NORAD Tac Director , decorated with the Purple Heart , the Bronze Star and the Soldiers Medal ( Capt. Daniel Davis ) stated : President of the U.S. Air Force Accident Investigation Board , who also served as Pentagon Weapons Requirement Officer and as a member of the Pentagon 's Quadrennial Defense Review , and who was awarded Distinguished Flying Crosses for Heroism , four Air Medals , four Meritorious Service Medals , and nine Aerial Achievement Medals ( Lt. Col. Jeff Latas ) is a member of a group which doubts the government 's version of 9/11 U.S. General , Commanding General of U.S. European Command and Supreme Allied Commander Europe , decorated with thesaid " We've never finished the investigation of 9/11 and whether the administration actually misused the intelligence information it had .
The evidence seems pretty clear to me .
I 've seen that for a long time . "
Air Force Colonel and key Pentagon official ( Lt. Colonel Karen Kwiatkowski ) finds various aspects of 9/11 suspicious Lieutenant colonel , 24 - year Air Force career , Vice Chancellor for Student Affairs at the Defense Language Institute ( Lt. Colonel Steve Butler ) said " Of course Bush knew about the impending attacks on America .
He did nothing to warn the American people because he needed this war on terrorism . "
Two - Star general ( Major General Albert Stubbelbine ) questions the attack on the Pentagon U.S. Air Force fighter pilot , former instructor at the USAF Fighter Weapons School and NATO ’s Tactical Leadership Program , with a 20 - year Air Force career ( Lt. Colonel Guy S. Razer ) said the following U.S. Marine Corps lieutenant colonel , a fighter pilot with over 300 combat missions flown and a 21 - year Marine Corps career ( Lt. Colonel Shelton F. Lankford ) believes that 9/11 was an inside job , and said U.S. Navy ' Top Gun ' pilot ( Commander Ralph Kolstad ) who questions the official account of 9/11 and is calling for a new investigation , says " When one starts using his own mind , and not what one was told , there is very little to believe in the official story "
The Group Director on matters of national security in the U.S. Government Accountability Office said that President Bush did not respond to unprecedented warnings of the 9/11 disaster and conducted a massive cover - up instead of accepting responsibility Additionally , numerous military leaders from allied governments have questioned 9/11 , such as : Canadian Minister of Defense , the top military leader of Canada ( Paul Hellyer ) Assistant German Defense Minister ( Andreas Von Bulow ) Commander - in - chief of the Russian Navy ( Anatoli Kornukov ) Chief of staff of the Russian armed forces ( General Leonid Ivashov ) Former military analyst and famed whistleblower Daniel Ellsberg recently said that the case of a certain 9/11 whistleblower is " far more explosive than the Pentagon Papers " .
He also said that the government is ordering the media to cover up her allegations about 9/11 .
And he said that some of the claims concerning government involvement in 9/11 are credible , that " very serious questions have been raised about what they [ U.S. government officials ] knew beforehand and how much involvement there might have been " , that engineering 9/11 would not be humanly or psychologically beyond the scope of the current administration , and that there 's enough evidence to justify a new , " hard - hitting " investigation into 9/11 with subpoenas and testimony taken under oath .
A 27 - year CIA veteran , who chaired National Intelligence Estimates and personally delivered intelligence briefings to Presidents Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush , their Vice Presidents , Secretaries of State , the Joint Chiefs of Staff , and many other senior government officials ( Raymond McGovern ) said “ I think at simplest terms , there ’s a cover - up .
The 9/11 Report is a joke ” , and is open to the possibility that 9/11 was an inside job A 29 - year CIA veteran , former National Intelligence Officer ( NIO ) and former Director of the CIA 's Office of Regional and Political Analysis ( William Bill Christison ) said “ I now think there is persuasive evidence that the events of September did not unfold as the Bush administration and the 9/11 Commission would have us believe .
...
All three [ buildings that were destroyed in the World Trade Center ] were most probably destroyed by controlled demolition charges placed in the buildings before 9/11 . " ( and see this ) . 20 - year Marine Corps infantry and intelligence officer , the second - ranking civilian in U.S. Marine Corps Intelligence , and former CIA clandestine services case officer ( David Steele ) stated that " 9/11 was at a minimum allowed to happen as a pretext for war " , and it was probably an inside job ( see Customer Review dated October 7 , 2006 ) .
A decorated 20 - year CIA veteran , who Pulitzer - Prize winning investigative reporter Seymour Hersh called " perhaps the best on - the - ground field officer in the Middle East ” , and whose astounding career formed the script for the Academy Award winning motion picture Syriana ( Robert Baer ) said that " the evidence points at " 9/11 having had aspects of being an inside job The Division Chief of the CIA ’s Office of Soviet Affairs , who served as Senior Analyst from 1966 - 1990 .
He also served as Professor of International Security at the National War College from 1986 - 2004 ( Melvin Goodman ) said " The final [ 9/11 Commission ] report is ultimately a coverup .
" Professor of History and International Relations , University of Maryland .
Former Executive Assistant to the Director of the National Security Agency , former military attaché in China , with a 21 - year career in U.S. Army Intelligence ( Major John M. Newman , PhD , U.S. Army ) questions the government 's version of the events of 9/11 .
The head of all U.S. intelligence , the Director of National Intelligence ( Mike McConnel ) said " 9/11 should have and could have been prevented " A number of intelligence officials , including a CIA Operations Officer who co-chaired a CIA multi-agency task force coordinating intelligence efforts among many intelligence and law enforcement agencies ( Lynne Larkin ) sent a joint letter to Congress expressing their concerns about “ serious shortcomings , ” “ omissions , ” and “ major flaws ” in the 9/11 Commission Report and offering their services for a new investigation ( they were ignored ) .
A prominent physicist with 33 years of service for the Naval Research Laboratory in Washington , DC ( Dr. David L. Griscom ) said that the official theory for why the Twin Towers and world trade center building 7 collapsed " does not match the available facts " and supports the theory that the buildings were brought down by controlled demolition
A world - renowned scientist , recipient of the National Medal of Science , America 's highest honor for scientific achievement ( Dr. Lynn Margulis ) said :
The former head of the Fire Science Division of the government agency which claims that the World Trade Centers collapsed due to fire ( the National Institute of Standards and Technology ) , who is one of the world ’s leading fire science researchers and safety engineers , a Ph.D. in mechanical engineering ( Dr. James Quintiere ) , called for an independent review of the World Trade Center Twin Tower collapse investigation .
" I wish that there would be a peer review of this , " he said , referring to the NIST investigation .
" I think all the records that NIST has assembled should be archived .
I would really like to see someone else take a look at what they 've done ; both structurally and from a fire point of view .
... I think the official conclusion that NIST arrived at is questionable . "
The principal electrical engineer for the entire World Trade Center complex , who was " very familiar with the structures and [ the Twin Towers ' ] conceptual design parameters " ( Richard F. Humenn ) , stated that " the mass and strength of the structure should have survived the localized damage caused by the planes and burning jet fuel . . . . the fuel and planes alone did not bring the Towers down . "
Former Director for Research , Director for Aeronautical Projects , and Flight Research Program Manager for NASA 's Dryden Flight Research Center , who holds masters degrees in both physics and engineering ( Dwain A. Deets ) says :
A prominent physicist , former U.S. professor of physics from a top university , and a former principal investigator for the U.S. Department of Energy , Division of Advanced Energy Projects ( Dr. Steven E. Jones ) stated that the world trade centers were brought down by controlled demolition
A U.S. physics professor who teaches at several universities ( Dr. Crockett Grabbe ) believes that the World Trade Centers were brought down by controlled demolition
An expert on demolition ( Bent Lund ) said that the trade centers were brought down with explosives ( in Danish )
A Dutch demolition expert ( Danny Jowenko ) stated that WTC 7 was imploded A safety engineer and accident analyst for the Finnish National Safety Technology Authority ( Dr. Heikki Kurttila ) stated regarding WTC 7 that " The great speed of the collapse and the low value of the resistance factor strongly suggest controlled demolition . "
A 13 - year professor of metallurgical engineering at a U.S. university , with a PhD in materials engineering , a former Congressional Office of Technology Assessment Senior Staff Member ( Dr. Joel S. Hirschhorn ) , is calling for a new investigation of 9/11
A Danish professor of chemistry ( Dr. Niels Harrit ) said , in a mainstream Danish newspaper , " WTC7 collapsed exactly like a house of cards .
If the fires or damage in one corner had played a decisive role , the building would have fallen in that direction .
You do n't have to be a woodcutter to grasp this " ( translated )
A former guidance systems engineer for Polaris and Trident missiles and professor emeritus , mathematics and computer science at a university concluded ( Dr. Bruce R. Henry ) that the Twin Towers " were brought down by planted explosives . "
A mechanical engineer with 20 years experience as a Fire Protection Engineer for the U.S. Departments of Energy , Defense , and Veterans Affairs , who is a contributing Subject Matter Expert to the U.S. Department of Energy Fire Protection Engineering Functional Area Qualification Standard for Nuclear Facilities , a board member of the Northern California - Nevada Chapter of the Society of Fire Protection Engineers , currently serving as Fire Protection Engineer for the city of San Jose , California , the 10th largest city in the United States ( Edward S. Munyak ) believes that the World Trade Center was destroyed by controlled demolition .
The former Chief of the Strategic and Emergency Planning Branch , U.S. Department of Energy , and former Director of the Office of Engineering at the Public Service Commission in Washington , D.C. , who is a mechanical engineer ( Enver Masud ) , does not believe the official story , and believes that there is a prima facie case for controlled demolition of the World Trade Center .
STRUCTURAL ENGINEERS AND ARCHITECTS
A professor of mathematics ( Gary Welz ) said " The official explanation that I 've heard does n't make sense because it does n't explain why I heard and felt an explosion before the South Tower fell and why the concrete was pulverized "
A prominent engineer with 55 years experience , in charge of the design of hundreds of major building projects including high rise offices , former member of the California Seismic Safety Commission and former member of the National Institute of Sciences Building Safety Council ( Marx Ayres ) believes that the World Trade Centers were brought down by controlled demolition ( see also this )
Two professors of structural engineering at a prestigious Swiss university ( Dr. Joerg Schneider and Dr. Hugo Bachmann ) said that , on 9/11 , World Trade Center 7 was brought down by controlled demolition ( translation here )

Former FBI agent ( Robert Wright ) says " The FBI , rather than trying to prevent a terrorist attack , was merely gathering intelligence so they would know who to arrest when a terrorist attack occurred . "
Former FBI translator , who the Department of Justice 's Inspector General and several senators have called extremely credible ( free subscription required ) ( Sibel Edmonds ) , said " If they were to do real investigations we would see several significant high level criminal prosecutions in this country .
And that is something that they are not going to let out .

Human rights activists will lead rallies across the United States today to build pressure on the Bush administration and Congress to end the detention of foreign prisoners at the Guantanamo Bay military camp .
From Washington , DC to Boise , Idaho , civil libertarians plan to hold more than 20 demonstrations and sit-ins across the country and have encouraged their supporters to wear orange as an expression of opposition to indefinite detention and torture .
Orange is the color of the jumpsuits worn by the first Guantanamo detainees .
Their photographs were first released by the Department of Defense in 2002 .
 We believe people will turn out in force to express their opposition to the symbol and reality of Guantanamo ,  said Jameel Jaffer of the American Civil Liberties Union ( ACLU ) , one of the nations largest and most influential rights advocacy groups , which is sponsoring the day of action .
In a statement , Jaffer , who is director of the ACLUs national security project , described the Bush administrations policy of indefinite detention of Guantanamo Bay prisoners as a violation of the U.S. Constitution and international human rights system that has been going on since 2002 .
The ACLUs  Close Guantanamo Bay day marks the six anniversary of the arrival of prisoners at the U.S. military base in Cuba , where hundreds of foreigners continue to languish behind bars without any trial in the U.S. courts .
In all about 800 people have been held at the Guantanamo prison  some of them for years on end  since it opened in January 2002 .
The Bush administration justifies their detention by stating that the naval base in Guantanamo is outside U.S. territory so constitutional protections do not apply , an argument that has been consistently challenged by United Nations experts and human rights groups at home and abroad .
In May 2006 , a UN panel that monitors compliance with the worlds anti-torture treaty urged the United States to close its prison at Guantanamo and avoid using secret detention facilities in what George W. Bush and his allies call the war on terror . 
The Bush administration dismissed those arguments , saying the UN experts lacked accurate information .
Last month , a UN investigator said he strongly suspected the Central Intelligence Agency of using torture on prisoners at Guantanamo , adding that many prisoners were likely not being prosecuted to keep the abuse from emerging at trial .
On a visit to Guantanamo , Martin Scheinin , UN special rapporteur on protecting human rights while countering terrorism , attended a pre-trial hearing of Salim Ahmed Hamdan , Osama bin Ladens former driver .
Scheinin said U.S. authorities told him that out of about 300 detainees currently held at Guantanamo , 80 were expected to face military trials for suspected crimes .
Another 80 inmates had been cleared for release .
President George W. Bush says the United States does not engage in torture .
However , he remains unwilling to disclose what interrogation methods are being used at Guantanamo and elsewhere .
The  Close Guantanamo campaign initiated by the ACLU and other rights advocacy groups will include events across the United States throughout the month of January , but it will reach its climax today with rallies and demonstrations in major towns and cities including Boston ; New York ; Philadelphia ; Pittsburgh ; San Francisco ; St. Louis ; Tampa ; and Washington , DC .
Organizers said some of the nations most popular performing artists have expressed their willingness to participate in the rallies .
Among others , musician Henry Rollins , actress Gloria Reuben , and singer - songwriter Meshell Ndegeocello said they will wear orange to express their outrage against illegal detentions .
 I am wearing orange to help bring back the dignity our country has lost as a result of Guantanamo ,  said Ndegeocello in a statement .
 We must join together in solidarity to demand the immediate closure of this shameful prison .
It has tarnished Americas image in the world and continues to be a symbol of torture and injustice . 
According to the ACLU , in the past few weeks , hundreds of Internet users have subscribed to its Close Guantanamo pages on Facebook and MySpace.com , including campaigners from both parties  presidential campaigns .

Hold on to your hats kids , it looks like Guillermo del Toro is directing The Hobbit .
Not just one , but BOTH of the upcoming Lord of the Rings prequels !
We ’ve known for some time that it was either going to come down to Guillermo del Toro or Sam Raimi , and it looks like for one reason or another , Guillermo del Toro is going to be the one heading back to the Shire !
The folks at Yahoo News give us this :
Guillermo del
Toro is in talks to direct back - to - back installments of J.R.R. Tolkien ’s “ The Hobbit , ” which is being co-financed by New Line and MGM .
Few filmmakers have the cachet that del Toro has , as well as a deep love for the source material , an assured grasp of fantasy filmmaking and an understanding and command of geek culture as well as its respect .
Del Toro has built that goodwill through such films as the Oscar - nominated “ Pan ’s Labyrinth , ” “ Hellboy , ” “ Blade 2 ” ( which was made by New Line ) and “ The Devil ’s Backbone . ”
All I can say is ..
WOW !
This is probably the ideal situation .
I ’ve personally been very big on the idea of either a Raimi or perhaps a Frank Darabont vision of middle earth , but in reality there probably is n’t anyone better for this particular job on the face of the earth than Guillermo del Toro ( with the understanding that Jackson was n’t going to do it himself ) .
del Toro has a visionscape for an imagination and knows how to completely NAIL the idea of darker fantasy without it seeming childish at the same time ( Pan ’s Labyrinth is one of the best fantasy / fairy tale movies I ’ve ever seen ) .
This is terrific news !
So what do you think ?
Excited to see del
Toro take the reigns , or was there another director you were really hoping for ?

Barack Obama is a secret Muslim who refuses to say the Pledge of Allegiance .
During the Democratic primary campaign , the junior senator from Illinois has been hit repeatedly by virulent viral emails pushing false claims like these .
The latest : Obama , due to his Muslim background , secretly favors Palestinians over Israelis .
An unsourced email being disseminated claims that “ someone taped former Muslim Barack HUSSEIN Obama at a black church when he was in South Carolina ” and that Obama said :
It ’s clear that we give too much money to Israel .
[ cheers ]
Why … do you know that every American gives approx .20 cents A DAY to Israel ? [ jeers ]
We keep hearing how tough the Israelis are … how great an ‘ ally ’ they are … –but what if we gave the SAME AMOUNT of money we gave THEM to the poor Palestinians –I bet THAT would bring them finally to the table .
We could have a two - state solution … a two - state solution–just like former President Carter outlined in his latest book .
We ca n’t have peace in the Middle East until we solve that problem down in Palestine .
George Bush should have thought about that before he went into Iraq … [ etc . ]
The email goes on to note that Obama sounds “ a GREAT DEAL like Malcolm X . ”
It asks , “ Instead of the ‘ Manchurian Candidate , ’ is Obama the secret ‘ Farrakan Candidate ' ” ?
It then seeks to explain his purported anti-Israel bias :
Will Barrack ’s [ sic ]
Muslim roots cause him to favor the Palestinians against Israel ?
Because he ’s a “ person of color , ” will Obama be more sympathetic to 3rd World Peoples ’ struggles in that they have “ darker skin ” like him ?
Does Obama distrust the lighter - skinned , more “ European ” - looking Israelis and tend to favor the “ darker complexioned ” Palestinians and other Arabs ( al Qaeada ? [ sic ] ) because his Muslim African father and cousins ?
Obama ’s father was raised as a Muslim but was not a practicing Muslim as an adult .
He was either agnostic or an atheist .
He left Obama and Obama ’s mother when Obama was two years old .
Obama has said he has never worshipped in a mosque–which would mean he is not a former Muslim .
And he has recently moved to demonstrate his pro-Israel credentials .
The email is not just anti-Obama ; it ’s racist : “ Will his election in America temper or EMBOLDEN the 3rd World Terrorist Groups he physically resembles around the world ? ”
This missive clearly is directed at Jewish American voters .
It calls on the “ pro-Israeli lobby ” to investigate Obama : “ He DOES have Muslim roots , you know !
Is he a Trojan Horse for anti-Israeli interests ?
Maybe the American Jewish community ought to THINK about all that . ”
The email adds , “ We already KNOW the Clintons are pro-Israeli . ”
Bill Burton , an Obama spokesman , says that Obama campaign was unaware of the email until Mother Jones asked about it .
And the campaign issued a statement : “ This is the latest in a string of outlandish and false attacks against Barack Obama .
Obama has a strong and consistent record of speaking out for and voting for economic and security assistance for Israel because he believes in a strong U.S. - Israel alliance . ”
The note yields no clues as to who ’s behind it .
For what it ’s worth , it does seem to encourage American Jews to vote for HIllary Clinton instead of Obama .
But there ’s no telling what that says about its origins .
( Could someone be trying to make the Clinton camp look bad ? )
But it ’s another sign of how easy it is for political dirty tricksters to spread malicious and untrue innuendo .
Should Obama become the Democrats ’ presidential nominee , he can expect a flood of similar attacks .
In the meantime , the unknown author of this email says , “ We ’re putting [ the tape of Obama at the South Carolina church ] up on YouTube . ”
So far , nothing is there .

Every religion has unique beliefs .
This is a list of odd LDS beliefs .
Each Item on the list quotes LDS scripture so you can be sure it is authentic .
10 . Tithing
While tithes are not uncommon among religion , rarely are they mandatory .
LDS theology states that in order to make it to the highest kingdom of heaven , you must pay a full and honest tithe .
D&C 119 : 3 - 6
3 And this shall be the beginning of the tithing of my people .
4 And after that , those who have thus been tithed shall pay one - tenth of all their interest annually ; and this shall be a standing law unto them forever , for my holy priesthood , saith the Lord .
5 Verily I say unto you , it shall come to pass that all those who gather unto the land of Zion shall be tithed of their surplus properties , and shall observe this law , or they shall not be found worthy to abide among you .
6 And I say unto you , if my people observe not this law , to keep it holy , and by this law sanctify the land of Zion unto me , that my statutes and my judgments may be kept thereon , that it may be most holy , behold , verily I say unto you , it shall not be a land of Zion unto you .
9. Pleasure in Life
This is one of the most famous pieces of LDS doctrine .
It ’s also the cause of many myths about Mormons .
Basically ; no coffee , no drugs , no tobacco .
D&C 89 : 5-13
5 That inasmuch as any man drinketh wine or strong drink among you , behold it is not good , neither meet in the sight of your Father , only in assembling yourselves together to offer up your sacraments before him .
6 And , behold , this should be wine , yea , pure wine of the grape of the vine , of your own make .
7 And , again , strong drinks are not for the belly , but for the washing of your bodies .
8 And again , tobacco is not for the body , neither for the belly , and is not good for man , but is an herb for bruises and all sick cattle , to be used with judgment and skill .
9 And again , hot drinks are not for the body or belly .
10 And again , verily I say unto you , all wholesome herbs God hath ordained for the constitution , nature , and use of man —
11 Every herb in the season thereof , and every fruit in the season thereof ; all these to be used with prudence and thanksgiving .
12 Yea , flesh also of beasts and of the fowls of the air , I , the Lord , have ordained for the use of man with thanksgiving ; nevertheless they are to be used sparingly ;
13 And it is pleasing unto me that they should not be used , only in times of winter , or of cold , or famine .
8. Spirits
This one is very unique to the LDS faith .
Basically , everyone on earth now was a spirit in the pre-existence .
When we die , our spirits are separated from our bodies and if we were good they go to “ spirit paradise . ”
If we were bad they go to “ spirit prison . ”
The spirit world exists as a place for spirits to go while awaiting the second coming .
D&C 138 : 8-14
8 “ By which also he went and preached unto the spirits in prison ;
9 “ Which sometime were disobedient , when once the long - suffering of God waited in the days of Noah , while the ark was a preparing , wherein few , that is , eight souls were saved by water . ” ( 1 Peter 3:18 — 20 . )
10 “ For for this cause was the gospel preached also to them that are dead , that they might be judged according to men in the flesh , but live according to God in the spirit . ”
( 1 Peter 4:6 . )
11 As I pondered over these things which are written , the eyes of my understanding were opened , and the Spirit of the Lord rested upon me , and I saw the hosts of the dead , both small and great .
12 And there were gathered together in one place an innumerable company of the spirits of the just , who had been faithful in the testimony of Jesus while they lived in mortality ;
13 And who had offered sacrifice in the similitude of the great sacrifice of the Son of God , and had suffered tribulation in their Redeemer ’s name .
14 All these had departed the mortal life , firm in the hope of a glorious resurrection , through the grace of God the Father and his Only Begotten Son , Jesus Christ .
7. Modern Revelation
Almost everyone who knows anything about the Mormon religion knows they have a prophet .
What many do n’t know , is anything that the prophet says in official capacity is considered official canon .
D&C 43 : 2- 9
2 For behold , verily , verily , I say unto you , that ye have received a commandment for a law unto my church , through him whom I have appointed unto you to receive commandments and revelations from my hand .
3 And this ye shall know assuredly — that there is none other appointed unto you to receive commandments and revelations until he be taken , if he abide in me .
4 But verily , verily , I say unto you , that none else shall be appointed unto this gift except it be through him ; for if it be taken from him he shall not have power except to appoint another in his stead .
5 And this shall be a law unto you , that ye receive not the teachings of any that shall come before you as revelations or commandments ;
6 And this I give unto you that you may not be deceived , that you may know they are not of me .
7 For verily I say unto you , that he that is ordained of me shall come in at the gate and be ordained as I have told you before , to teach those revelations which you have received and shall receive through him whom I have appointed .
8 And now , behold , I give unto you a commandment , that when ye are assembled together ye shall instruct and edify each other , that ye may know how to act and direct my church , how to act upon the points of my law and commandments , which I have given .
9 And thus ye shall become instructed in the law of my church , and be sanctified by that which ye have received , and ye shall bind yourselves to act in all holiness before me —
6. Jesus visited the Americas
The Book of Mormon is a book of LDS scripture that takes place during the same time as the Bible and takes place on the American continent .
It follows the stories of two tribes who descended from the family of Lehi .
After Jesus ’ resurrection LDS people believe he visited the peoples of the Americas .
3 Nephi 11 : 7-12
7 Behold my Beloved Son , in whom I am well pleased , in whom I have glorified my name — hear ye him .
8 And it came to pass , as they understood they cast their eyes up again towards heaven ; and behold , they saw a Man descending out of heaven ; and he was clothed in a white robe ; and he came down and stood in the midst of them ; and the eyes of the whole multitude were turned upon him , and they durst not open their mouths , even one to another , and wist not what it meant , for they thought it was an angel that had appeared unto them .
9 And it came to pass that he stretched forth his hand and spake unto the people , saying :
10 Behold , I am Jesus Christ , whom the prophets testified shall come into the world .
11 And behold , I am the alight and the life of the world ; and I have drunk out of that bitter cup which the Father hath given me , and have glorified the Father in taking upon me the sins of the world , in the which I have suffered the will of the Father in all things from the beginning .
12 And it came to pass that when Jesus had spoken these words the whole multitude fell to the earth ; for they remembered that it had been prophesied among them that Christ should show himself unto them after his ascension into heaven .
5 . The Nature of God
While most religions believe in God , the LDS religion believes in God , Jesus and the Holy Spirit as separate beings .
They also believe that God , Jesus and resurrected beings have bodies of “ flesh and bone . ”
D&C 129:1-5
1 There are two kinds of beings in heaven , namely : Angels , who are resurrected personages , having bodies of flesh and bones —
2 For instance , Jesus said : Handle me and see , for a spirit hath not flesh and bones , as ye see me have .
3 Secondly : the spirits of just men made perfect , they who are not resurrected , but inherit the same glory .
4 When a messenger comes saying he has a message from God , offer him your hand and request him to shake hands with you .
5 If he be an angel he will do so , and you will feel his hand .
D&C 130 : 22-23
22 The Father has a body of flesh and bones as tangible as man ’s ; the Son also ; but the Holy Ghost has not a body of flesh and bones , but is a personage of Spirit .
Were it not so , the Holy Ghost could not dwell in us .
23 A man may receive the Holy Ghost , and it may descend upon him and not tarry with him .

4. Priesthood
In the LDS religion any worthy male can be given the priesthood and is given specific duties .
Black people were not allowed to have the priesthood until 1978 .
Females are not allowed to have the priesthood .
D&C 107 : 1 - 5
1 There are , in the church , two priesthoods , namely , the Melchizedek and Aaronic , including the Levitical Priesthood .
2 Why the first is called the Melchizedek Priesthood is because Melchizedek was such a great high priest .
3 Before his day it was called the Holy Priesthood , after the Order of the Son of God .
4 But out of respect or reverence to the name of the Supreme Being , to avoid the too frequent repetition of his name , they , the church , in ancient days , called that priesthood after Melchizedek , or the Melchizedek Priesthood .
5 All other authorities or offices in the church are appendages to this priesthood .
Official Declaration – 2 , 1978
Aware of the promises made by the prophets and presidents of the Church who have preceded us that at some time , in God ’s eternal plan , all of our brethren who are worthy may receive the priesthood , and witnessing the faithfulness of those from whom the priesthood has been withheld , we have pleaded long and earnestly in behalf of these , our faithful brethren , spending many hours in the Upper Room of the Temple supplicating the Lord for divine guidance .
3. Multiple Heavens
In LDS doctrine there are three heavens : the Celestial Kingdom , Terrestrial Kingdom , and Telestial Kingdom .
The Celestial is the highest , where God and the ones who followed his law reside .
The Terrestrial is the middle , where people who followed the Law of Moses reside .
The Telestial is the lowest , where the ones who followed carnal law reside .
D&C 76 : 94-98
94 They who dwell in his presence are the church of the Firstborn ; and they see as they are seen , and know as they are known , having received of his fulness and of his grace ;
95 And he makes them equal in power , and in might , and in dominion .
96 And the glory of the celestial is one , even as the glory of the sun is one .
97 And the glory of the terrestrial is one , even as the glory of the moon is one .
98 And the glory of the telestial is one , even as the glory of the stars is one ; for as one star differs from another star in glory , even so differs one from another in glory in the telestial world ;
2. Forgiveness
In LDS theology you can be forgiven for any sin , save two .
First , denying the Holy Spirit , and second , murder .
Also ,
God is infinitely forgiving , until the second coming .
After that , you end up where you end up , no matter what .
There are no second chances .
Period .
D&C 76 : 43-45
43 Who glorifies the Father , and saves all the works of his hands , except those sons of perdition who deny the Son after the Father has revealed him .
44 Wherefore , he saves all except them — they shall go away into everlasting punishment , which is endless punishment , which is eternal punishment , to reign with the devil and his angels in eternity , where their worm dieth not , and the fire is not quenched , which is their torment —
45 And the end thereof , neither the place thereof , nor their torment , no man knows ;
D&C 18 : 42
18 And now , behold , I speak unto the church .
Thou shalt not kill ; and he that kills shall not have forgiveness in this world , nor in the world to come .
D&C 76 : 111-112
111 For they shall be judged according to their works , and every man shall receive according to his own works , his own dominion , in the mansions which are prepared ;
112 And they shall be servants of the Most High ; but where God and Christ dwell they cannot come , worlds without end .
1. Multiple Worlds and Multiple Gods
This deserves some explanation .
Mormons believe that God created multiple worlds and each world has people living on it .
They also believe that multiple Gods exist but each has their own universe .
We are only subject to our God and if we obtain the highest level of heaven we can become gods ourselves .
D&C 76 : 24
24 That by him , and through him , and of him , the worlds are and were created , and the inhabitants thereof are begotten sons and daughters unto God .
D&C 93 : 10
10 The worlds were made by him ; men were made by him ; all things were made by him , and through him , and of him .
Moses 1 : 33
33 And worlds without number have I created ; and I also created them for mine own purpose ; and by the Son I created them , which is mine Only Begotten .
D&C 76 : 108
108 Then shall he be crowned with the crown of his glory , to sit on the throne of his power to reign forever and ever .
D&C 131 : 1 - 5
1 In the celestial glory there are three heavens or degrees ;
2 And in order to obtain the highest , a man must enter into this order of the priesthood [ meaning the new and everlasting covenant of marriage ] ;
3 And if he does not , he can not obtain it .
4 He may enter into the other , but that is the end of his kingdom ; he can not have an increase .
5 ( May 17th , 1843 . )
The more sure word of prophecy means a man ’s knowing that he is sealed up unto eternal life , by revelation and the spirit of prophecy , through the power of the Holy Priesthood .
Contributor : Mystern
If the ongoing turmoil in the world ’s financial markets has made anything clear , it ’s that the list of things that can go wrong in those markets is a very long one .
Month after month , it seems , another potentially disastrous problem rises to the surface .
The latest looming crisis is the possible implosion of a group of companies called monoline insurers .
If you have n’t heard of monoline insurers , do n’t worry : until recently , few people , even on Wall Street , were all that interested in them .
Yet their problems have become a serious threat to global markets .
Rumors that monoline insurers , like M.B.I.A. and Ambac , were in serious trouble helped spark the vast market sell - off that prompted the Federal Reserve ’s interest - rate cut two weeks ago , and , only a few days later , rumors of a government - orchestrated bailout of these companies set off a six - hundred - point rally in the Dow .
CHRISTOPH NIEMANN
Monoline insurers do a straightforward job : they insure securities — guaranteeing , for instance , that if a bond defaults they ’ll cover the interest and the principal .
Historically , this was a fairly sleepy business ; these companies got their start by insuring municipal bonds , which rarely default , and initially they confined themselves to bonds with relatively predictable risks , which were easy to put a price on .
Unfortunately , a sleepy , straightforward business was n’t good enough for the insurers .
Like everyone else in recent years , they wanted to cash in on the housing and lending boom .
In order to expand , they started insuring the complex securities that Wall Street created by packaging mortgages , including subprime ones , for investors .
This was a lucrative business — M.B.I.A. ’s revenues rose nearly a hundred and forty per cent between 2001 and 2006 — but it rested on a false assumption : that the insurers knew how risky these securities really were .
They did n’t .
Instead , they gravely underestimated how likely the loans were to go bad , which meant that they did n’t charge enough for the insurance they were offering , and did n’t put away enough to cover the claims .
They ’re now on the hook for tens of billions of dollars in potential losses , and some estimates suggest that they ’ll need more than a hundred billion to restore themselves to health .
Obviously , this is bad news for the insurers — at one point , M.B.I.A. ’s and Ambac ’s stock prices were down more than ninety per cent from their all - time highs — but it ’s also very dangerous for credit markets as a whole .
This is because of a peculiar feature of bond insurance : insurers ’ credit ratings get automatically applied to any bond they insure .
M.B.I.A. and Ambac have enjoyed the highest rating possible , AAA .
As a result , any bond they insured , no matter how junky , became an AAA security , which meant access to more investors and a generally lower interest rate .
The problem is that this process works in reverse , too .
If the insurers lose their AAA ratings — credit agencies have made clear that both companies are at risk of this , and one agency has already downgraded Ambac to AA — then the bonds they ’ve insured will lose their ratings as well , which will leave investors holding billions upon billions in assets worth a lot less than they thought .
That ’s why so many people on Wall Street are pushing for a bailout for the insurers .
It may be an abandonment of free - market principles , but no one has ever accused the Street of putting principle above profit .
Normally when companies make bad decisions and fail to deliver value , it ’s just their workers and investors who suffer .
But monoline insurers ’ desire to grab as much new business as they could , risks be damned , quickly radiated across global markets and will have huge consequences for millions of people who have never heard of M.B.I.A. or Ambac .
The situation illustrates a fundamental paradox of today ’s financial system : it ’s bigger than ever , but terrible decisions by just a few companies — not even very big companies , at that — can make the entire edifice totter .
In that sense , the potential collapse of monoline insurers looks like a classic example of what the sociologist Charles Perrow called a “ normal accident . ”
In examining disasters like the Challenger explosion and the near - meltdown at Three Mile Island , Perrow argued that while the events were unforeseeable they were also , in some sense , inevitable , because of the complexity and the interconnectedness of the systems involved .
When you have systems with lots of moving parts , he said , some of them are bound to fail .
And if they are tightly linked to one another — as in our current financial system — then the failure of just a few parts cascades through the system .
In essence , the more complicated and intertwined the system is , the smaller the margin of safety .
Today , as financial markets become ever more complex , these kinds of unanticipated ripple effects are more common — think of the havoc wrought a couple of weeks ago when the activities of one rogue French trader came to light .
In the past thirty years , thanks to the combination of globalization , deregulation , and the increase in computing power , we have seen an explosion in financial innovation .
This innovation has had all kinds of benefits — making cheap capital available to companies and individuals who previously could n’t get it , allowing risk to be more efficiently allocated , and widening the range of potential investments .
On a day - to - day level , it may even have lowered volatility in the markets and helped make the real economy more stable .
The problem is that these improvements have been accompanied by more frequent systemic breakdowns .
It may be that investors accept periodic disasters as a price worth paying for the innovations of modern finance , but now is probably not the best time to ask them about it . ♦

Here 's a cool idea realized : a Sydney , Australia - based art collective called The Glue Society has re-created scenes from the Bible as if captured by Google Earth 's ubiquitous satellites .
Says Glue Society 's James Dive : " We like to disorientate audiences a little with all our work .
And with this piece we felt technology now allows events which may or may not have happened to be visualized and made to appear dramatically real .
As a method of representation satellite photography is so trusted , it has been interesting to mess with that trust . "
Let 's see what they created !

SOLDIERS GROVE , Wis. -
The Kickapoo River bridge is a big structure with a small price tag : one buck .
Village officials fear the nearly century - old bridge , which has n’t hosted traffic in 31 years , will collapse into the river and want to get rid of it quickly .
Village board member Vicki Campbell said they hope high scrap prices help attract a buyer who may want to sell the bridge ’s steel parts .
“ With the steel prices what they are right now , we thought this was an opportune time to sell it , ” Campbell said .
They previously tried a similar offer , she said , but the buyer backed out .
The overhead truss bridge was built in 1910 and was a major connection for the community .
Over the years , a new route into Soldiers Grove was built , and the bridge became a fishing spot .
In 1976 , the state Department of Transportation recommended closing the bridge , saying its age and condition posed a hazard .
Laurel Hestetune , village president , said he still remembers the rattling sound of the boards as travelers passed over the span .
“ Once it ’s gone — if it goes — I ’m going to miss it , ” he said .

The Causes of Global Warming : A Graphical Approach by Loren Cobb Note :
This is an updated edition of this essay , dated 28 March 2008 .
To see the original essay , click here .
without the assistance of super - computers running advanced three - dimensional geophysical models of atmospheric and oceanic dynamics .
The latter style of modeling has provoked quite a substantial controversy around the world , as it is based on methods that are nearly impossible for ordinary citizens to use and evaluate .
Figure 1 : Global mean temperatures , from the University of East Anglia .
Instead of joining this rhetorical debate , my goal in this essay is to show a simple way to evaluate the major hypothetical causes of global warming , such as solar sunspot activity and greenhouse gases produced by the use of fossil fuels ( coal , petroleum , and natural gas ) .
Figure 1 shows the trend in global mean temperatures , from the mid-18th century to the present .
The data come from the well - respected Climate Prediction Unit of the University of East Anglia .
The curve clearly shows fluctuating global temperatures , culminating in a sustained rise in global mean temperature from about 1980 to 2006 , with a dip in 2007 .
The specific data series that we will use in the graphs and analyses to follow is known as the HadCrut3v series , up to date as of March , 2008 .
This series is based on historical land and sea measurements , which correlate very well with satellite measurements of temperatures in the lower atmosphere ( but this area has been controversial  click here for a discussion ) .
Solar Activity as a Cause of Global Temperature Changes Figure 2 : Global warming ( blue ) and solar sunspot activity ( red , smoothed , right - hand scale ) .
One contributing cause of changes in global mean temperature is fluctuations in solar activity , which changes not only the total amount of radiant energy received on earth , but also the amount of cosmic radiation absorbed by the atmosphere .
The numbers of sunspots visible on the surface of the sun is a useful proxy for solar activity of all kinds .
Sunspots follow a somewhat irregular eleven - year cycle that has been in place with varying amplitude for three centuries .
Figure 2 shows annual midyear sunspot numbers , as reported by the Royal Observatory of Belgium , after smoothing with an eleven - year trailing average .
The eleven - year solar cycle is only faintly visible in this smoothed data , but long - term fluctuations in overall solar activity are clearly visible .
From 1850 up to about 1990 the two curves move up and down in rough synchrony , indicating that solar activity is a powerful cause of fluctuations in global mean temperature .
Then , after 1990 , the two curves begin to diverge somewhat .
The correlation between smoothed solar activity and global mean temperature over the time span from 1850 to 2007 is about 0.61 , indicating that solar activity alone may account for as much as 37 % of the variance in global mean temperatures .
The " anthropogenic hypothesis " of global warming is that the burning of fossil fuels by humanity has released enough greenhouse gases of various types ( especially carbon dioxide and methane ) into the atmosphere as to have caused a rise in global mean temperatures .
The anthropogenic hypothesis implies that the ever - increasing use of fossil fuels will destabilize the temperature balance of the planet , with dramatic and extremely dangerous potential consequences for all life on earth .
Is evidence for the anthropogenic hypothesis visible in data of this type shown above ?
To answer this , we need to add a new variable based on the burning of fossil fuels .
Fossil Fuel Consumption as a Cause of Global Warming Figure 3 : Global warming ( blue ) and fossil fuel consumption ( red , right - hand scale ) .
Figure 3 displays the consumption of fossil fuels ( coal , petroleum , natural gas ) , together with the curve of global mean temperatures .
Fossil fuel consumption is measured in gigabarrels of oil equivalent per year , shown on the vertical scale on the right - hand side of the graph .
The " elbow " in the curve that occurred in 1950 is due to the sudden post - World War II acceleration in the use of fossil fuels .
If the anthropogenic hypothesis is correct , then the rise in global temperatures from about 1980 to present was in major part caused by greenhouse gases released by the combustion of fossil fuels .
If real , this rise seems to occur after some time delay , somewhere between ten and thirty years .
Indeed , the relationship between fossil fuel consumption and global mean temperature is strongest * when the fossil fuel series is lagged behind temperature by 25 years .
The two curves are shown in Figure 4 .
The red curve ( fossil fuel consumption ) has been shifted to the right by 25 years , so that one can see how the rise in temperatures could plausibly have been caused by the increase in fossil fuel use 25 years earlier .
Observe that the elbow in the red line now coincides with the beginning of the recent upward trend in global mean temperature ( about 1980 ) .
Figure 4 : Global warming ( blue ) and fossil fuel consumption delayed by 25 years ( red , right - hand scale ) .
A comparison of Figures 2 and 4 raises some immediate questions :
Which is the cause of global warming , solar activity or fossil fuels ?
If they both are , which has the stronger influence ?
How well can statistical predictions from these two hypothetical causes explain the observed changes in global warming ?
We can provide at least preliminary answers to these questions with nothing more complicated than multiple regression .
The statistical results of this procedure are quite clear , though of course subject to interpretation .
Predicting Global Temperatures from both Solar Activity and Fossil Fuels
When global mean temperature is statistically fitted to a simple linear combination of solar activity and lagged fossil fuel consumption , then the predicted temperatures fit the observed data much better than for either solar activity or fossil fuels alone .
If we truncate the data at 1985 , i.e. before global warming began in earnest , then fossil fuel consumption has an influence on global temperature that is about twice as strong as solar activity .
If , however , we include all the data from 1850 through 2007 , then the influence of fossil fuel consumption is almost three times stronger than solar activity , though the latter remains a powerful influence .
Figure 5 : Actual global mean temperatures ( blue ) and as recreated by an autoregressive statistical model ( orange ) , using solar activity , fossil fuel consumption , and previous year 's global mean temperature .
Figure 5 shows how well the two causes acting together predict annual global mean temperatures .
The red curve of predicted temperatures based on : solar activity , fossil fuel consumption , and the previous year 's temperature , explains fully 87 % of the variance in global mean temperatures over the time span 1850 2007 .
As statistical models go , that is an extremely good fit !
The details of the model and its input data are given here .
My conclusion from this little exercise in statistical curve fitting is that both solar activity and fossil fuels are powerful causes of fluctuations in global mean temperatures .
There is indeed an anthropogenic component , and it is very strong .
Note :
The predicted line ( orange ) and the observed line ( blue ) in Figure 5 display a very high degree of conformance in part due to the presence in the prediction equation of the previous year 's temperature .
Statisticians call this model auto - regressive , because it includes this term .
While there are excellent physical and statistical reasons for making the model autoregressive , it does have one unfortunate side - effect : it makes the graph of predicted and observed values look deceptively good .
If we were to use a model that omits the auto - regressive term  less physically realistic but also less deceptive to the eye  then the comparable graph of predicted and observed temperatures would look like this ( click here ) .
This simpler model explains 78 % of the total variance in global mean temperatures from 1850 - 2007 .
What Happens Next ?
For the graph in Figure 6 , I have extended the prediction into the future by using the known fossil fuel consumption figures for the last 25 years , i.e. out to 2032 .
Beyond 2032 the prediction uses future fossil fuel consumption rates predicted by me in TQE 155 , based on Hubbert analyses of coal , natural gas , and petroleum ( including extra - heavy oil from Canada and Venezuela ) .
In TQE 155 , I presented my best guess on the future of human energy consumption .
If those guesses are correct , then fossil fuel consumption will rise to about 77 billion barrels of oil equivalent per year in about 2025 .
That would imply a further rise in global warming from the present until about 2055 , when temperatures will be about 1.2°C ( that is , about 2.1 °F ) higher than they were in 1950 , followed by a decline thereafter .
Figure 6 : Predicted global temperatures ( orange ) out to 2100 .
Of course , all of the above analysis is purely statistical , using no physical principles whatsoever .
That is a weakness if one believes in the geophysical models developed by climate scientists , but it may be a strength if one prefers instead to see the raw phenomenon displayed in simple graphs and analyzed with elementary and easily reproducible statistical methods .
Feedback Effects
If the actual rise in temperature causes more greenhouse gases to be released , for example from methane hydrates on the ocean floor or from arctic tundra , or the loss of the reflectivity of melting arctic ice , then the actual rise in temperature will be much greater .
Self - reinforcing effects of this nature are not included in the simple statistical model used here .
" If nothing else were changed by warming , a doubling of carbon dioxide would ultimately lead to a temperature change of about 1.2 degrees C , " says atmospheric physicist Gerard Roe of the University of Washington ( quoted in Scientific American , October 2007 ) .
" In fact , because of internal processes within the climate system , such as changing snow cover , clouds and water vapor in the atmosphere , our best estimate is that the actual warming would be two to four times larger than that . "
In other words , the earth may warm between 2.4 and 4.8 degrees C. And therein lies the problem .
Any increase of more than 1.5 degrees C may result in the mass extinction of up to a third of all biological species known to science .
At this level of extinction , what will happen to the food chain that supports human existence ?
Worse , this is just one of the dire consequences envisioned in " State of the Science : Beyond the Worst Case Climate Change Scenario " ( Scientific American , November 2007 ) .
* Note 1 : When global mean temperature is statistically predicted from solar activity and lagged fossil fuel consumption , then the fit of the model is best when fossil fuel consumption is lagged by 25 years .

** Note 2 : The temperature data series display some serial dependence , which implies that the standard measures of statistical significance given by a multiple regression package will not be accurate unless some form of " autoregressive " model ( or equivalent ) is used .

Figure 5 in this issue is astonishing !
I hope that it can be publicized outside of TQE since beyond " An Inconvenient Truth " and others , it is the most dramatic portrayal I have seen , demonstrating the influence of fossil fuels .
Fine work indeed .
 Roger Conant , Pelham MA , Mount Toby Friends meeting . [ 3 Dec 07 ]
I appreciate your enthusiasm , but Figure 5 is really not quite as impressive as it looks .
The key to understanding how the predicted line echoes the observed line so closely lies in the caption , which states that the model is an AR ( 1 ) .
Having used such models my entire professional career , I stupidly forgot that they are not everyone 's bread and butter .
I will try to explain here , and then I will go back to the original and insert a few explanatory sentences .
When trying to construct an appropriate model for a dynamic process , it is always a good idea to build into the model the idea that external influences ( e.g. solar activity and CO 2 emissions ) cause the state variable ( temperature of the earth ) to change somewhat from its previous state .
Typically , the state variable has a certain inertia  it only gradually moves away from the previous state , and towards a new equilibrium .
Therefore , it behooves the modeler to include an inertial term in the prediction equation .
We call such models " autoregressive " .
The terminology AR ( 1 ) is intended to communicate the idea that the model is autoregressive with exactly one such inertial term .
There are many physical and statistical reasons why this is a good thing to do , but it does have one disadvantage : the graph showing predictions and observations will necessarily appear to show a very good fit to the data ; the more inertia the better the apparent fit .
In effect , the goodness of the prediction based on external variables is being confounded with ( i.e. lumped together with ) the strength of the inertia .
There are ways of disentangling these two distinct influences for those who are not proficient enough do it by eyeball , but I do n't normally make such distinctions in my technical papers .
In this case I should have , clearly .
To summarize , the model is good but not brilliant .
Some of the tight parallelism between the red and blue lines is due to the inertial term , not the all - important external variables .

The NYT ’s Adam Nagourney captures the current state of the Republican landscape pretty well today .
On the most tangible level , the vote [ in Tuesday ] on Tuesday was proof from the ballot box of what polls have shown : this is a party that is adrift , deeply divided and uninspired when it comes to its presidential candidates and unsure of how to counter an energized Democratic Party .
One need not look too hard to find similar descriptions elsewhere .
I ’ve seen some describe the state of the Republican race as “ chaos . ”
Others call it a “ free - for - all . ”
Others still are talking about unprecedented “ disarray . ”
Oddly enough , it might get worse .
Ron Paul Flatlines
James Joyner · · 63 comments
Ron Paul ’s ability to attract enthusiastic support among young people , especially online , has been quite impressive and unexpected .
The degree to which that has translated into fundraising capability has been nothing short of spectacular .
But look at the national polling trend lines for the past year :
Ron Paul ’s numbers are flatlined .
He ’s the only one of the remaining quartet that is n’t up substantially from six months ago .
Despite the field winnowing from ten candidates to four , Paul continues to appeal to no more than 5 - 6 percent of Republicans .
With most candidates , the obvious explanation would be that their support has shifted to one of the frontrunners in a strategic move to avoid “ wasting ” their vote .
Given the depth of Paul ’s support , though , that strikes me as incredibly unlikely .
The hard - core libertarians who back Paul are mostly dead - enders who would rather write in Paul ’s name than deign to compromise for one of the Establishment candidates .
Could it be that hard - core libertarians are just a relatively small group ?
That , despite being organized and enthusiastic , there are n’t enough of them to elect a president ?
Barring a better explanation , I ’m leaning in that direction .
Inventor - link is represented by Dozier Internet Law -- the same law firm that t hreatened to sue for copyright infringement if one of its demand letters were posted on the Internet .
Once again , Dozier sent a strongly worded demand letter identifying a bunch of statements that it alleged to be defamatory , most of which appear to be statements of opinion .
The letter goes on to invoke the website 's user agreement :
With these terms , Inventor - link purports to prohibit visitors to the site from using the company 's name , linking to the site , or even " refer[ring ] " to it without permission .
Although the enforceability of these terms is extremely dubious , the company is nevertheless invoking them in an attempt to stop criticism of the company that appears on InventorEd.org , a website that provides information about invention promotion businesses and scams .
By using this site you agree and understand that the HTML code , look , feel , content , company name , logo , text , and any likeness or derivative of such content is the sole property of Inventor - Link LLC and may not be used in any manner without the expressed written permission of Inventor - Link LLC .
Furthermore , we strictly prohibit any links and or other unauthorized references to our web site without our permission .
Inventor - link is a company that promises to help inventors get their inventions to the marketplace .
A link at the bottom of the company 's home page leads to the site 's " Privacy and User Agreement , " which includes the the following terms :
You have not received permission to use text from our client ’s website , and yet you have republished the following text :
“ Official Site of Inventor - Link LLC - Your Link to Success for Your ...
We know how to get your idea from a rough sketch to a finished product in the marketplace .
If your idea has what it takes , we can help you get the results you want .
...www.inventor-link.com”
You have associated your disparaging remarks with bona fide text from our client ’s website with the purpose of harming our client ’s business and diverting actual and potential customers .
By using legitimate text that rightfully belongs to our client you are in violation of its website User Agreement .
Presumably , the author realizes that copying such a small amount of text for purposes of criticism is a pretty obvious case of fair use and could not support a claim for copyright infringement .
But , by framing the issue as one of contract law , Direct - link 's lawyer is able to assert that all use of its website , fair or otherwise , is prohibited .
Dozier apparently believes in the enforceability of this kind of agreement , because the firm 's own website includes similar terms .
The firm's " User Agreement " prohibits linking to its website , using the firm 's name " in any manner " without permission ( the license specifically provides that even clients cannot say they are represented by the firm without asking ) , or making " any copies of any part of this website in any way since we do not want anyone copying us . "
These terms would appear to prevent even criticizing the terms themselves , as this post does , by linking to and quoting from them .
And , very strangely , the terms prohibit even looking at the website 's HTML code :
We also own all of the code , including the HTML code , and all content .
As you may know , you can view the HTML code with a standard browser .
We do not permit you to view such code since we consider it to be our intellectual property protected by the copyright laws .
You are therefore not authorized to do so .
Inventor - link 's and Dozier 's " User Agreements " are known as " browse - wrap " agreements , a derivation of the " shrinkwrap " licensing terms that appear inside packaged software .
Browse - wrap agreements are the legalese contained in a website 's terms of use , usually buried behind a link on a company 's home page .
The theory behind these agreements is that , just by reading a website , a consumer becomes bound by the company 's contractual terms .
These contracts often include forum - selection or arbitration clauses that visitors to the site have never read .
Depending on the circumstances of the case , browse - wrap agreements may or may not be enforceable .
Where a company has included a provision prohibiting fair use for purposes of criticism , however , it is hard to see how any court would enforce the agreement .
Readers of a site have little opportunity to review and agree to such terms , and a reasonable consumer who had reviewed the terms would be unlikely to agree to them .
Nevertheless , terms of use like these are commonly used by companies .
AT&T was recently subjected to a round of harsh commentary on the Internet when it amended its terms of service to provide that it could terminate customers ' accounts for conduct that " tends to damage the name or reputation of AT&T , or its parents , affiliates and subsidiaries . "
After a widespread backlash in the blogosphere , the company claimed that it would not use the clause to against critics , and eventually removed the offending terms altogether .
And in 2002 , the New York Attorney General filed suit against McAfee , the maker of anti-virus software , for including terms in its software license agreements that prohibited " product reviews " or " benchmark tests . "
The lawsuit claimed that the terms constituted a deceptive act or practice under New York law , and a court eventually enjoined further use of the provisions .
No matter how unlikely these kinds of terms are to be enforced , however , they are often successful in accomplishing their intended result .
Consumers who receive threats of litigation over purportedly binding contractual terms are often more likely to shut up than to bear the expense of retaining an attorney and defending their rights .

We feel sorry for poor NEC .
While everyone at CES is busy buzzing about Alienware 's gorgeous curved DLP display us ) , NEC is quietly showing off its CRVD - 42DWX + display that 's more or less identical : a 2880x900 ( double WXGA + ) panel with a contrast ratio of 10000:1 .
We 're assuming they 're both built by the same ODM , Ostendo , so hopefully some healthy competition will help bring one of these two beauties within your meager gaming budget .

Abstract
Ponderings on how to build an efficient mapreduce system that keeps up - to - date ( aka reaches consistency eventually ) even if the data underneath changes , without recomputing from scratch .
I 'm also including a visual overview of mapreduce that may help fellow visual / spatial thinkers understand the topic better .
Background
So Google has their MapReduce , the people behind CouchDB are throwing around their ideas .
I spent some time thinking about incremental mapreduce around July 2007 , and it 's time I type out that page full of scribbles .
First of all : I think the ideas thrown out by Damien above are n't really mapreduce , As Google Intended .
The real power of mapreduce is in its inherent combination of parallelism and chainability , output of one mapreduce is input to another , each processing step can run massively in parallel with each other , etc .
The proposed design is like a one - iteration retarded cousin of mapreduce .
With that bashing now done ( sorry ) , here 's what I was thinking :
The way I imagined building an incremental mapreduce mechanism , without storing the intermediate data and just recomputing chunks that are out - of - date ( which would be lame ) , is to add one extra concept into the system : call it " demap " .
It will basically create " negative entries " for the old data .
This is basically what Damien did by providing both the old and new data map calls , all the time , just said differently , and I think my way might make the average call a lot simpler .
And I do n't see any reason why my version would n't be parallelizable , chainable , and generally yummy .
Visualizing mapreduce
Here 's a " whiteboard demo " of plain old mapreduce ( not incremental yet ) .
This would be one " step " in the chain I mentioned .
As usual for mapreduce , user defines two functions :
map ( in_key , in_val ) -> list ( out_key , intermediate_val ) reduce ( out_key , list ( intermediate_val ) ) -> list ( out_value )
Let 's run through calling mapreduce with the following input data :
{ K1 : S , K2 : T , K3 : X , K4 : Y , K5 : Z }
Map
The map function is called for each input value .
For example :
map ( K1 , S ) -> [ ( A , S1 ) , ( B , S2 ) ]
Note how map can return multiple items -- it could also return an empty list .
Rotate
rotate reorganizes outputs from the map calls , grouping items by key .
Note that sometimes one key can have multiple partitions -- the work is split into bite - size chunks .
rotate is provided by the framework .
Reduce
reduce is called for each partition .
Once again , reduce can return zero or multiple values .
For example :
reduce ( A , [ S1 , T1 , X3 ] ) -> [ H , I ]
Rotate again
A new rotate run .
Because reduce can return multiple items , we might not be done yet .
We wanted one output value per key from the reduce part -- so keep running it until the data simplifies to that !
First , a new rotate .
Reduce again
A new reduce run .
A second run of reduce finally reaches a point where each key has only a single item .
Completion
The final output for this mapreduce call is :
{ A : N , B : O , C : M }
Making it incremental
So , now that we hopefully have an understanding of mapreduce basics , and a nice notation to express the operations , how does one make mapreduce incremental ?
Recomputing the results from scratch every time the input changes is just not a smart idea .
We could store all the intermediate values , and only re-run those calculations where the input changed .
With a smart partition algorithm , this might even be doable .
But it still means wasting a lot storage space for something you do n't really , directly , care about .
So , my idea hinges on this concept : you can only do incremental mapreduce when you know how to " undo " earlier results .
If your problem space does not have that property , you 're pretty much going to just have to store the intermediate values and try to recompute as little as possible .
However , if you are able to build a function like this :
demap ( in_key , in_val ) -> list ( out_key , out_val )
That looks very much like map , but has one important property : the effect of running your reduce on the output of demap must be semantically comparable to it having never seen the original map output !
If we can accommodate that , here 's how an update would go .
Let 's say we just did the mapreduce run above .
Now we mutate the X to X ' , and want to incrementally update our result .
We 'd run demap on the old value and map on the new , feeding the results into the mapreduce machinery .
Map and demap
map and demap calls .
For example :
demap ( X ) -> [ ( B , X1_de ) , ( C , X2_de ) , ( A , X3_de ) ] map ( X ' ) -> [ ( B , X ' 1 ) , ( C , X ' 2 ) ]
Rotate
Mix in the previous output and rotate .
Reduce
And finally reduce to get updated output .
Completion
The final output for this mapreduce call is :
{ A : P , B : Q , C : R }
A more concrete example
As a final example , to hopefully make this more concrete , consider Damien 's example of computing the number of people known to have each profession .
Here are definitions that should work , making updates of that data incremental ( I'm assuming all the records are persons ) :
function map ( in_key , in_val ) { return [ ( in_val.job , 1 ) ] } function demap ( in_key , in_val ) { return [ ( in_val.job , - 1 ) ] } function reduce ( out_key , values ) { return [ sum( values ) ] ; }
Simple , huh ?
For CouchDB , you might think of skipping that in_key argument to map , just using docid , but consider this :
It ’s an old story : the “ hunger lobby ” gets its food stamps so long as the farm lobby can have its subsidies .
Similar , if less lavish , terms are now being offered to the public health and environmental “ interests ” to get them on board .
That ’s why there ’s more money in this farm bill for nutrition programs and , for the first time , about $ 2 billion to support “ specialty crops ” — farm - bill - speak for the kind of food people actually eat .
( Since California grows most of the nation ’s specialty crops , this was the price for the state delegation ’s support .
Cheap indeed ! )

Lloyd Miller
There ’s also money for the environment : an additional $ 4 billion in the Senate bill to protect wetlands and grasslands and reward farmers for environmental stewardship , and billions in the House bill for environmental cleanup .
There ’s an important provision in both bills that will make it easier for schools to buy food from local farmers .
And there ’s money to promote farmers ’ markets and otherwise support the local food movement .
But as important as these programs are , they are just programs — mere fleas on the elephant in the room .
The name of that elephant is the commodity title , the all - important subsidy section of the bill .
It dictates the rules of the entire food system .
As long as the commodity title remains untouched , the way we eat will remain unchanged .
The explanation for this is straightforward .
We would not need all these nutrition programs if the commodity title did n’t do such a good job making junk food and fast food so ubiquitous and cheap .
Food stamps are crucial , surely , but they will be spent on processed rather than real food as long as the commodity title makes calories of fat and sugar the best deal in the supermarket .
We would not need all these conservation programs if the commodity title , by paying farmers by the bushel , did n’t encourage them to maximize production with agrochemicals and plant their farms with just one crop fence row to fence row .
And the government would not need to pay feedlots to clean up the water or upgrade their manure pits if subsidized grain did n’t make rearing animals on feedlots more economical than keeping them on farms .
Why does the farm bill pay feedlots to install waste treatment systems rather than simply pay ranchers to keep their animals on grass , where the soil would be only too happy to treat their waste at no cost ?
However many worthwhile programs get tacked onto the farm bill to buy off its critics , they wo n’t bring meaningful reform to the American food system until the subsidies are addressed — until the underlying rules of the food game are rewritten .
This is a conversation that the Old Guard on the agriculture committees simply does not want to have , at least not with us .

Anti-gay books suck
by Jeremy Hooper
Say you 're an anti-gay Anglican whose JOB it is to deal a BLOW to the queer community by writing a book .
And say you wanted to ensure that book does n't SUCK , so that your potential readers will be convinced to SWALLOW your logic and SPIT it out to their friends .
What might the cover for said book look LICK like ?
Well , as the boys at Box Turtle Bulletin have shown us , it would look something like this :
Because apparently they feel the book lends itself to oral readings .
But if you think that 's suggestive , you should really see what 's going on on the back flap !

You might have seen this shaded gray squares illusion before .
Squares A and B are the same shade of gray .
( It was created by Edward H. Adelson , Professor of Vision Science at MIT .
Here 's a similar illusion with colored squares .
The " blue " tiles on the top face of the left cube are the same color as the " yellow " tiles in the top of the right cube .
Do n't take my word for it .
Use an image editing program with a eyedropper to see for yourself .
I used Photoshop 's eyedropper tool to take 5×5 samples and found that both the " yellow " and the " blue " tiles are C:50 M:40 Y:40 K:5 .
Take a look at the brown tile in the center of the top face and the yellow tile in the center of the side facing slightly to the left .
They 're the same color .
UPDATE : The color tile illusion is one of many excellent illusions created by R. Beau Lotto .

Legal voters thrown off rolls
Five years after passage of a federal law to create electronic registration databases to deter voter fraud , the new technology is posing hurdles that could disenfranchise thousands of legal voters , a USA TODAY examination finds .
From Florida to Washington , voters have been challenged because names or numbers on their registration forms did not exactly match other government databases , such as Social Security and motor vehicle agencies .
" We know that eligible people have been thrown off the rolls , " says Justin Levitt , a lawyer with the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University School of Law .
POLL PROBLEMS : Process fraught with flaws
The databases are only as good as the information fed into them by applicants and election officials .
That can lead to human errors as well as variations from state to state .
Colorado , for instance , knocked nearly 20 % of its voters off the rolls between the 2004 and 2006 elections .
Arkansas purged 3 % , according to Election Assistance Commission data .
Voters who have problems at the polls can cast " provisional " ballots .
Election officials rule later whether those votes were properly cast and should be counted .
But even that backup system varies greatly from state to state .
More than nine in 10 provisional ballots cast in New Jersey , Oregon , Maine , Montana and Alaska were approved in 2006 .
Michigan , Massachusetts , Kentucky , Oklahoma , Delaware and Hawaii counted fewer than 25 % , the Election Assistance Commission says .
After Florida's " hanging chads " in 2000 and Ohio 's long lines in 2004 , registration problems " could be the sleeper issue of 2008 , " says Doug Chapin of electionline.org , which tracks voting issues .
" These new databases make it possible to make more mistakes faster , " he says .
A day before voters begin choosing the next president , there are signs of database troubles .
In Wisconsin , Elections Board Executive Director Kevin Kennedy says , " the users keep complaining that it 's too complex . "
In Texas , Henderson County opted out of the database after voters griped about being dropped from the list .
" I was just afraid to trust it , " says voter registrar Milburn Chaney .
Perhaps the worst problems are in Florida , where a Gannett News Service analysis found more than 14,000 people whose voter registrations were disputed by the state because they did n't match other databases ; about 75 % are minorities .
A federal district court ruled last month that the state could n't deny registrations based on database matching .
Federal officials say the system is evolving — and improving .
" Even with the top - notch best database in the world , you 're still going to have human error , " says Thomas Wilkey , the election commission 's executive director .

DEUTSCHNEUDORF , Germany ( CNN ) --
Digging has resumed at a site in the southeastern German town of Deutschneudorf , where treasure hunters believe there are almost 2 tons of Nazi gold and possibly clues to the whereabouts of the legendary Amber Room , a prize taken from a Russian castle during World War II .
Treasure hunters use modern technology to try to locate the lost Nazi gold .

Heinz Peter Haustein , one of the two treasure hunters and a member of Germany 's parliament , said : " We have already hit a hollow area under the surface , it 's filled with water and we are not sure if it is the cave we are looking for . "
Digging was stopped more than a week ago amid safety concerns , as authorities and the treasure hunters feared that the shaft might collapse and that the cave -- if it is there -- may be rigged with explosives or poisonous booby traps .
At a news conference Friday , Christian Hanisch , the other treasure hunter , said that geological surveying equipment had located a possible cave about 30 feet under the surface containing " precious metals that can only be either gold or silver .
The instruments would not have reacted to any other metal like copper . "

Hanisch pointed out that his father , who was a navigator in the Luftwaffe , the Nazi air force , was one of the troops said to have been involved in hiding art , gold and silver as the Nazis realized that they would lose the war .
He said that when his father died , he left coordinates leading to the spot in Deutschneudorf .
" It 's not about getting the reward , " Hanisch said at the site .
" I just want to know if my father was right and if my instincts were right . "
Haustein , who is paying for the expedition , said he hopes that finding the gold could lead to the Amber Room , whose interior is made completely of amber and gold .
It was looted by the Nazis from a castle in St. Petersburg , Russia , after Adolf Hitler 's forces invaded the Soviet Union in 1941 .
The room looked so majestic , many called it " the eighth wonder of the world . "
It disappeared after the war , and today a replica stands in its place in St. Petersburg .
Although parts of the Amber Room have resurfaced , the vast majority remains missing .
Haustein has been looking for the room for more than 12 years .
Watch hunt for Nazi gold at German mountain »
" I am certain that large parts of the Amber Room are buried somewhere here , " he said .
He said he has collected much circumstantial evidence suggesting that the Nazis hid the Amber Room in old copper mines around Deutschneudorf , but he has no proof .
Haustein said the Nazis began bringing valuables including art , gold and silver to the region around Deutschneudorf as early as summer 1944 .
Deutschneudorf is in Germany 's Ore Mountains , and the mountain where the treasure hunters claim to have found the Nazi gold was a copper mine until the 19th century .
Although the mine was shut down in 1882 , geologists found evidence that soldiers from Hitler 's Wehrmacht -- the German armed forces -- had been there .
The machine guns , parts of uniforms and explosives are on display at the town 's museum .
Though both treasure hunters say they are certain they will find cultural goods , both admit that they fear disappointment .
" Of course , if you embark on something like this , you ask yourself : ' What if we find nothing again ?
What if I was fooled ? ' " Haustein said .
" But every man has to go his own way , for better or for worse . "
If they do find the treasure , Haustein says , it would legally belong to Germany , although he would recommend that Germany give any Amber Room parts back to Russia .
Treasure hunters have typically received rewards of 10 percent of the value of the goods found , but Hanisch says there are no laws dictating the reward amount .

I know , I know .
Saving and investing your money for the future is one of the most practical things you can do .
This is solid advice , but when you do decide to spend your hard earned money it should be spent on something practical , useful , and meaningful to the wellbeing of your existence .
So many people either save their money or blow it on worthless crap .
Here are 11 practical ways to spend your money on something useful :
Travel to See the Significant People in Your Life – There may be no better way to spend your money than to use it to nurture and rekindle personal relationships with the most significant people in your life .
As time quickly passes , we sometimes forget how essential strong personal relationships are to our mental wellbeing .
The older we get the more we need true friends and family to be regular parts of our lives .
Hire a Personal Trainer – Your health is your life .
Without it , all the success and affluence in the world is meaningless .
Committing yourself to a regular exercise routine is one of the best ways to maintain the health of your body and mind .
Sometimes it ’s hard to tackle this endeavor on your own .
Spending money on a knowledgeable personal trainer who can set you on the right course creates priceless results .
Make sure you stick with the trainer until you are committed to exercising on your own .
Fix What Is Broken – Have you been ignoring your screeching brakes ?
What about the excessively loud hum from your AC compressor ?
Or the scratching noise coming from your computer system ?
Sooner or later these small annoyances will wear down the reliability of the product and you will be left with a completely broken product instead of just a halfway broken one .
Use your money wisely to fix and maintain your belongings .
Educate Yourself – Use your money to purchase educational courses or books pertaining to your career , or to a miscellaneous topic that interests and intrigues you .
Remember , knowledge is power and your brain is the container of that knowledge .
There are few options for spending money on something more practical than the development and facility of your brain .
Add Value to Your Home – Your home should be your sanctuary , the place on this planet where you feel the most comfortable .
Adding value to your home , be it personal value or increased monetary value , is always a practical choice for spending your money .
If the additions you make increase your level of comfort for years to come , you win .
If they increase the value of the home to a third party someday when you sell , you win .
If both occur , you win big .
Take a Healthy , Relaxing Vacation – A vacation revitalizes your mind by pulling you away from the daily stress factors in your life .
It can spark creative thought by stimulating your brain with new material .
And finally , a vacation allows you to be yourself without the external influences present in your typical surroundings .
Does that sound like something worth spending money on ?
It should .
Upgrade Something You Use Regularly –
There is nothing wrong with splurging on a practical item that you actually use on a regular basis .
If you are a hardcore movie buff that loves to watch movies on Saturday nights with your family and friends , having a 65 inch HDTV and a Blue - ray player makes sense .
If you love computer games , purchasing a powerhouse laptop gaming rig makes sense .
The idea is to never waste money on stuff you do n’t use .
Spending money on upgrading your hobbies is one of the reasons you work so hard in the first place .
Buy Meaningful Gifts for Key People in Your Life –
One of the most rewarding acts in life is the act of giving ; especially to those key people you truly care about the most .
Spend a little money every now and then on a sensible gift for some of the key people in your life .
Surprise them .
It does n’t have to be their birthday or a holiday .
Remember , there is no better gift than an unexpected gift .
You will make them feel special .
For instance , my buddy Donny brought me back a cool souvenir from Amsterdam a few months back and it just made me feel good .
Update Your Wardrobe –
You do n’t have to waste money on the latest overpriced fashion line to look good .
However , if you are still wearing the same ratty shirts , slacks and shoes from 5 years ago , it might be time to go shopping .
While appearance is n’t everything , it can make you look older , smarter and more emotionally mature .
First impressions for job interviews , dates , and the like are heavily weighted on the way you look .
Sometimes it is practical to dress to impress .
Buy Healthier Food – “ You are what you eat . ”
There is a great deal of truth in that statement .
It is impossible to maintain a healthy body and mind if you pump your body full of junk food .
Fresh , healthy food is usually more expensive , but this is an expense with priceless benefits to the longevity and wellbeing of your future .
Eating healthy goes right along with bullet number 2 about hiring a personal trainer .
Your health is your life .
Pay Down Debt –
This one is a no brainer , so I just could n’t bring myself to leave it off the list .
If you have a great deal of high interest debt it would be foolish not to pay it down before you go off and splurge on additional purchases .
There is nothing less practical than being a slave to your debts .
Are RESTful Web Services Like Functional Programming ?
This comment by bew caught my attention on a recent post of mine .
It ’s a bit funny that someone interested in Haskell is that negative about REST .
With REST , GET and PUT are like pure functions .
You will always get the same result , irrespective of how often you call them with the same parameters .
It ’s interesting to me , not so much as a statement about REST , but as a statement about ways of understanding functional programming .
Ultimately , it boils down to why functional programming languages are a good idea in the first place .
So here ’s a quiz .
Question :
Why are functional programming languages a good idea ?
( Select all that apply . )
Because one can safely do the same thing over and over again .
Mutation belongs in comic books , and has no place in programming .
They provide powerful tools for building abstractions .
They provide powerful tools for analysis of programs .
My answers : 3 and 4 only .
I really do n’t fundamentally care about answers 1 and 2 .
The definition of referential transparency and the lack of mutation are by all means obvious and visible aspects of functional programming , but the importance of functional programming is not tied to any desirability , in and of itself , of idempotence or lack of mutation .
Functional programming is worth anyone ’s attention only because it occupies a nice space in which powerful abstraction and powerful analysis , two goals that are often in strong tension , are both near at hand at the same time .
That , rather than anything else , is why they are important and successful .
As bew says , some REST methods are idempotent , and mutation is clearly marked .
Unfortunately , the more interesting bits are missing .
Indeed , there is active resistance in the “ REST is cool ” groups toward building any further abstractions at all on top of REST , and I see only limited support for an argument that transforming , manipulating , or analyzing REST services is particularly powerful either .
REST is n’t alone in sharing some characteristics with functional languages ( to the extent that it does , which is a stretch ) but missing the benefit .
It ’s not even the best example .
XSLT is way more purely functional in nature , and at least as fundamentally uninteresting to boot , as RESTful web services .
So my answer to the subject line : Are RESTful web services like functional programming ?
No , at least in any interesting way .
Does any of this mean I ’m beelining toward SOAP ?
No ; after all , no one could say with a straight face that SOAP provides powerful tools for abstraction or analysis either .
RESTful web services may be a good idea for purely pragmatic reasons — poor quality of implementation of SOAP , ambiguous specifications , etc .
That is n’t the popular claim though .
The popular claim is that REST is some kind of ideal ; a set of principles that should be applied to any communication delivered over HTTP .
I still say hogwash .

I 've been working ( part - time ) on an existing Rails application for the last month or so , getting comfortable with it , modifying some sections to support needed functionality , and beginning an all - out , carpet - bombing " shock and awe " assault on it 's test suite .
However , a significant portion of the system is ( or rather was , since I 've already gutted a lot of it ) a chunk of rather messy and unpleasant auto - generated code .
I 've always been a bit iffy about code generation tools , ever since my first encounters with them whilst working on some $ DEITY - awful access application years ago .
( First encounters with anything Microsoft usually have that effect on me , though ) .
Since then , I 've never found any reason to change my mind , and dealing with this particular chunk of auto - generated code has pushed me over the edge into " wild - eyed extremist " territory .
Please note that when I say " code generator " , I 'm talking here about programs or wizards or whatever that create a block of code that you 're then expected to tweak to suit your conditions .
If it 's just a mechanical transformation of an input format to an output format , where a human is never expected to maintain the output by hand , that 's not code generation in my book -- that 's just a compiler being used for it 's intended purpose .
I like compilers .
I 'm fairly sure you do too .
Code generators , though ?
EVIL .
Consider what you get out of your generator : A big blob of code in your application that you then have to understand and maintain .
It 's like you gave a commit bit to some random person who dropped a 5000 line change into your tree and then ran away into the night , cackling .
If there 's bugs in the generated code ( and remember , there 's always bugs in software ) , when they get fixed upstream you 're up the creek unless you have n't modified the code at all ( and thus can regenerate ) , or you 're willing to apply the necessary patches to your modified version , often by hand .
Hand - patching is error - prone , and if you 've modified the code at the same place that has to be patched , things can get unpleasant .
In the case of the generator I 'm dealing with at the moment , I 'm not even blessed with it being decent code .
It 's ugly code , in every possible sense of the word .
There 's inconsistent formatting , poor commenting , it uses some totally whack coding constructs [ 1 ] , the hard - coded text strings are ungrammatical , it 's got very few ( and poorly covering ) test cases , the methods are huge and unwieldy , and it 's got security bugs ( not so hot for something that 's supposed to be guarding your application ) .
In short , it looks like some quick - and - dirty internal hack that escaped one night and is now wreaking havoc on the world .
There 's probably some really good code generators out there .
I 've been poking around a bit , and there 's some written for Rails by people who I know produce good code .
However , no matter how good the author of the code generator is , the very best you can hope for is solid , clean code that is the equivalent of some portion of your application having been coded by some member of your team who you ( and nobody else ) has ever met , who did n't follow your team 's coding conventions , and who has never looked at any other part of your application to make sure that everything hung together in a consistent manner .
Which you now have to maintain .
I 've read a lot of books , articles , blog posts , and mailing list messages , and participated in no shortage of " why software sucks " discussions with other programmers , but I 've never heard anyone advocate that the way to clean code , minimal bugs , and happy programmers was to drop a big chunk of unknown code right in the middle of things .
Before you start charging up the e-mail - delivered tasers , ready to fry my delicate braincells for the twin crimes of Xenocodophobia and a vicious case of Not Invented
Here syndrome , though , please understand that I 'm not against code reuse in the right place .
That right place is a library , component , or other abstract , documented , fairly static , and presumably - replaceable chunk of code .
By using a library , you get a relatively simple interface to somebody else 's complexity .
This is a good thing , for all the reasons that everyone should already be able to recite .
Items such as a comprehensible interface , minimal learning curve , and so on .
Things you do n't get with generated code because , pretty much by definition , the entire chunk of code is you " interface " .
There are some times , though , when what you want to do can't be done in a library .
Either the thing has too many tentacles to be able to easily encapsulate behind an abstracted interface , or you need to modify it 's behaviour in too many places to be able to get away with a few simple callbacks to get the job done .
Hence , it might be tempting to fire up the code generator to get yourself out of a hole quickly .
Do n't do it though .
Do n't succumb to the temptation of saving yourself a little bit of time by firing up a code generator .
What you 're doing there is just making pain for yourself , by inheriting a big chunk of code that you do n't fully understand , probably does n't solve your problem particularly well , and which you ( or whichever poor slob gets the job after you ) will have to maintain into perpetuity -- most likely by gradually rewriting large pieces of it so that it fits your application better .
The output of a code generator is likely to be the least maintainable code in your tree -- either by virtue of the fact that it 's crap code , or at the very least because you just do n't understand it .
The general principle of good codebase hygiene is that you get rid of unmaintainable code quickly , so it does n't infect everything else ( a la the " broken window theory " ) .
With that in mind , why would you ever consider deliberately introducing a huge chunk of unmaintainable code into your application ?
The closest I can come to a defence of code generators is something like Rails ' scaffolding , where the controller and views for a set of simple CRUD operations on a table are auto - generated .
The key word there , though , is scaffolding .
It 's very name suggests that it 's temporary , to be replaced with something more robust and useful as soon as is reasonable .
The default scaffolding is ugly as sin , besides , which encourages you to replace it , and -- as of Rails 1.1 ( I think ) , there 's a ' scaffold ' method which creates the scaffolding output at runtime , so you never , ever need to generate scaffolding code any more .
Anyone planning on producing any significant piece of their application through the use of code generators is , in my book , committing a crime against software decency .

Today 's New York Times leads with the revelation that " The chief judge of the military commissions at Guantanamo Bay once wrote a paper criticizing the use of such tribunals to try suspects held there . "
I guess they paid him enough to cross over to the dark side .
An excerpt from the Times article :
Back in 2002 , a master 's degree candidate at the Naval War College wrote a paper on the Bush administration 's plan to use military commissions to try Guantanamo suspects , concluding that " even a good military tribunal is a bad idea . "
It drew little notice at the time , but the paper has gained a second life because of its author 's big promotion : Col. Ralph H. Kohlmann of the Marines is now the chief judge of the military commissions at the naval base in Guantanamo Bay , Cuba .
The system , Judge Kohlmann wrote in 2002 , would face criticism for the " apparent lack of independence " of military judges and would have " credibility problems , " the very argument made by Guantanamo 's critics .
He said it would be better to try terrorism suspects in federal courts in the United States .
" Unnecessary use of military tribunals in the face of reasonable international criticism , " he wrote , " is an ill - advised move . "
The paper is becoming a reference work of sorts in the curious history of Guantanamo , which includes a number of former officials who have become outspoken critics , including several former intelligence officers and a former chief military prosecutor .
Judge Kohlmann may be the only one who has switched the order , first delivering a fervent attack on Guantanamo and later becoming one of its officials .
Now that 's one serious flip - flop .
Amnesty International and other human rights groups have long criticized the kangaroo court system at Guantanamo .
But , unfortunately , passage by Congress last year of the Military Commissions
Act turned that bad policy into bad law .
With this current system , there is no real justice for the detainees .
I 'm sure some of them are indeed " the worst of the worst " .
But we have reason to believe that some are there by mistake -- having simply been at the wrong place at the wrong time , or arbitrarily sold to U.S. troops by bounty hunters .
Under the current system , there is no fair way to sort them out .
Why can't we just give each of them a good old - fashioned fair trial ?
Then we can justly punish the guilty ones and let the innocent ones go home to their families .
I have asked this before , and I must ask again :
Why is a fair trial so unacceptable to the Bush administration ?

The 150 million - year - old specimen was found on Spitspergen , in the Arctic island chain of Svalbard , in 2006 .
The Jurassic - era leviathan is one of 40 sea reptiles from a fossil " treasure trove " uncovered on the island .
Nicknamed " The Monster " , the immense creature would have measured 15 m ( 50 ft ) from nose to tail .
A large pliosaur was big enough to pick up a small car in its jaws and bite it in half
Richard Forrest , plesiosaur palaeontologist
The expedition 's director Dr Jorn Hurum , from the University of Oslo Natural History Museum , said the Svalbard specimen is 20 % larger than the previous biggest pliosaur - another massive pliosaur from Australia called Kronosaurus .
" We have carried out a search of the literature , so we now know that we have the biggest [ pliosaur ] .
It 's not just arm - waving anymore , " Dr Hurum told the BBC News website .
" The flipper is 3 m long with very few parts missing .
On Monday , we assembled all the bones in our basement and we amazed ourselves - we had never seen it together before . "
The Monster 's flipper alone measures 3 m in length
Pliosaurs were a short - necked form of plesiosaur , a group of extinct reptiles that lived in the world 's oceans during the age of the dinosaurs .
A pliosaur 's body was tear drop - shaped with two sets of powerful flippers which it used to propel itself through the water .
" These animals were awesomely powerful predators , " said plesiosaur palaeontologist Richard Forrest .
A second large pliosaur has now been found on the Arctic island
Enlarge Image
" A large pliosaur was big enough to pick up a small car in its jaws and bite it in half . "
" There are a few isolated bones of huge pliosaurs already known but this is the first find of a significant portion of a whole skeleton of such a giant , " said Angela Milner , associate keeper of palaeontology at London 's Natural History Museum
" It will undoubtedly add much to our knowledge of these top marine predators .
Pliosaurs were reptiles and they were almost certainly not warm - blooded so this discovery is also a good demonstration of plate tectonics and ancient climates .
The Monster was excavated in August 2007 and taken to the Natural History Museum in Oslo .
Team members had to remove hundreds of tonnes of rock by hand in high winds , fog , rain , freezing temperatures and with the constant threat of attack by polar bears .
They recovered the animal 's snout , some teeth , much of the neck and back , the shoulder girdle and a nearly complete flipper .
Unfortunately , there was a small river running through where the head lay , so much of the skull had been washed away .
A preliminary analysis of the bones suggests this beast belongs to a previously unknown species .
Unprecedented haul
The researchers plan to return to Svalbard later this year to excavate the new pliosaur .
A few skull pieces , broken teeth and vertebrae from this second large specimen are already exposed and plenty more may be waiting to be excavated .
" It 's a large one , and has the same bone structure as the previous one we found , " said Espen Knutsen , from Oslo 's Natural History Museum , who is studying the fossils .
Excavations have also yielded long - necked plesiosaurs
Dr Hurum and his colleagues have now identified a total of 40 marine reptiles from Svalbard .
The haul includes many long - necked plesiosaurs and ichthyosaurs in addition to the two pliosaurs .
Long - necked plesiosaurs are said to fit descriptions of Scotland 's mythical Loch Ness monster .
Ichthyosaurs bore a passing resemblance to modern dolphins , but they used an upright tail fin to propel themselves through the water .
Richard Forrest commented : " Here in Svalbard you have 40 specimens just lying around , which is like nothing we know .
The 2007 fieldwork took place in challenging conditions
The fossils were found in a fine - grained sedimentary rock called black shale .
When the animals died , they sank to the bottom of a cold , shallow Jurassic sea and were covered over by mud .
The oxygen - free , alkaline chemistry of the mud may explain the fossils ' remarkable preservation , said Dr Hurum .
The discovery of another large pliosaur was announced in 2002 .
Known as the " Monster of Aramberri " after the site in north - eastern Mexico where it was dug up , the creature could be just as big as the Svalbard specimen , according to the team that found it .
But palaeontologists told the BBC a much more detailed analysis of these fossils was required before a true picture of its size could be obtained .

And as TPM Muckraker points out , he probably was n't wrong .
In fact , even the FBI agents sent to Iraq to investigate Blackwater will be guarded by none other than ...
Blackwater .
... apparently it 's not so hypothetical of a scenario .
From The New York Daily News :
When a team of FBI agents lands in Baghdad this week to probe Blackwater security contractors for murder , it will be protected by bodyguards from the very same firm , the Daily News has learned .
Half a dozen FBI criminal investigators based in Washington are scheduled to travel to Iraq to gather evidence and interview witnesses about a Sept. 16 shooting spree that left at least 11 Iraqi civilians dead .
The agents plan to interview witnesses within the relative safety of the fortified Green Zone , but they will be transported outside the compound by Blackwater armored convoys , a source briefed on the FBI mission said .
" What happens when the FBI team decides to go visit the crime scene ?
Blackwater is going to have to take them there , " the senior U.S. official told The News .
The absurdity of this scenario would n't pass in most quality mob movies .
And yet we have a situation where crooks are guarding the cops .
But the focus should really be on Darrell Issa .
What he effectively said is that it is no longer safe for Congress to perform its constitutionally mandated function of government oversight to investigate private , mercenary armies .
As Naomi Wolf argues in her groundbreaking book , The End of America and her must - read diary , Blackwater :
Are you scared yet ?
the rise of tyranny is almost always accompanied by the use of a paramilitary force .
Every effective despot -- from Mussolini to Hitler , Stalin , the members of the Chinese Politburo , General Augusto Pinochet and the many Latin American dictators who learned from these models of controlling citizens -- has used this essential means to pressure civilians and intimidate dissent .
Mussolini was the innovator in the use of thugs to intimidate what was a democracy , if a fragile one , before he actually marched on Rome ; he developed the strategic deployment of blackshirts to beat up communists and opposition leaders , trash newspapers and turn on civilians , forcing ordinary Italians , for instance , to ingest emetics .
Hitler studied Mussolini ; he deployed thugs -- in the form of brownshirts -- in similar ways before he came formally to power .
Darrell Issa is a two - bit thug .
And his comments serve more to intimidate than to reflect any real danger to Mr. Waxman if he were to return to Iraq .
But Henry Waxman , and indeed all of us , should heed his warning carefully .
Because what he was really saying , with all seriousness , is that a private , mercenary army , available to anyone with a big enough checkbook , including the executive branch , is more powerful , in some circumstances , than the U.S. House of Representatives .
Regardless of the viability of Darrell Issa 's threat , it underlines the extreme danger of allowing these private security firms so much power , and the real threat they pose to our democratic way of life .

Gitmo ex-prosecutor : ' Full , fair , open ' trials not possible Mike Sheehan

The chief prosecutor for Guantanamo Bay 's military commissions has revealed that he relinquished his position after concluding that " full , fair and open trials " for the accused were impossible .
" I resigned , " writes Morris D. Davis in the Los Angeles Times , " because I felt that the system had become deeply politicized and that I could no longer do my job effectively or responsibly . "
Davis , an Air Force officer and lawyer , says " it is absolutely critical to the legitimacy of the military commissions that they be conducted in an atmosphere of honesty and impartiality .
" Yet the political appointee known as the ' convening authority , ' " a position he noted that had no civilian counterpart , " was not living up to that obligation . "
In early 2007 , Secretary of Defense Robert Gates replaced Maj. Gen. John Altenburg as the convening authority with civilian lawyer Susan Crawford .
" Altenburg 's staff had kept its distance from the prosecution to preserve its impartiality , " writes Davis .
" Crawford , on the other hand , had her staff assessing evidence before the filing of charges " by drafting charges against the accused and assigning prosecutors , among other things .
" How can you direct someone to do something and later make an impartial assessment of whether they behaved properly ? "
Davis says .
" Intermingling convening authority and prosecutor roles perpetuates the perception of a rigged process stacked against the accused . "
Davis cited other reasons for his resignation , effective October 4 , most notably that he instructed prosecutors to " not offer any evidence derived by waterboarding , one of the aggressive interrogation techniques the administration has sanctioned " but felt his instructions had been superceded by a senior commanding officer .
Excerpts from the column , available in full here , follow ... #
The second reason I resigned is that I believe even the most perfect trial in history will be viewed with skepticism if it is conducted behind closed doors .
Telling the world , " Trust me , you would have been impressed if only you could have seen what we did in the courtroom " will not bolster our standing as defenders of justice .
Getting evidence through the classification review process to allow its use in open hearings is time - consuming , but it is time well spent .
Crawford , however , thought it unnecessary to wait because the rules permit closed proceedings .
There is no doubt that some portions of some trials have to be closed to protect classified information , but that should be the last option after exhausting all reasonable alternatives .
Transparency is critical .
Finally , I resigned because of two memos signed by Deputy Secretary of Defense Gordon England that placed the chief prosecutor -- that was me -- in a chain of command under Defense Department General Counsel William J. Haynes .
Haynes was a controversial nominee for a lifetime appointment to the U.S. 4th Circuit Court of Appeals , but his nomination died in January 2007 , in part because of his role in authorizing the use of the aggressive interrogation techniques some call torture .
I had instructed the prosecutors in September 2005 that we would not offer any evidence derived by waterboarding , one of the aggressive interrogation techniques the administration has sanctioned .
Haynes and I have different perspectives and support different agendas , and the decision to give him command over the chief prosecutor 's office , in my view , cast a shadow over the integrity of military commissions .
I resigned a few hours after I was informed of Haynes ' place in my chain of command . #

Partners have just been granted preliminary permission to start construction on this volcano - shaped superstructure in Moscow , which will be dubbed “ Crystal Island ” .
In terms of efficiency monolithic buildings like this seem unnecessary , but the proposed dimensions are amazing : it will be 1,500 foot tall with 26,909,776 foot squared of floor space , that ’s enough room to house 30,000 people .
As you would expect from a Foster +
Partners project , the self - contained city within a city has green energy management at the very heart of the design .
Crystal Island will generate low carbon energy from solar arrays and wind turbines located on the building with vast atriums to regulate the internal air temperature during the extremes of the Russian summer and winter .
Fosters +
Partners say :
Crystal Island will have a range of cultural , exhibition and performance facilities , approximately 3000 hotel rooms and 900 serviced apartments , as well as offices and shops , designed to maintain a dynamic and animated public realm throughout the day .
Residents are able to work and live within a densely planned area where every amenity is within easy walking distance , including an international school for 500 students .
Mixed - use also presents a strong case for energy balance , with individual components using energy at different times , while reinforcing the breadth of economic and social activity of the area .
The building ’s spiraling form emerges majestically from a newly landscaped park , rising in converse directions to form a diagonal grid .
This distinctive geometry extends throughout the project into the park .
The result is that the scheme is seamlessly integrated into a new park landscape , which provides a range of activities throughout the year , including cross country skiing and ice skating in the winter .
The internal built volumes of over one million square metres ( more than ten million square feet ) assume a staggered formation within the triangulated steel mega frame , extending flush against the sloping facetted glazed outer skin .
This terracing creates a series of winter gardens , which form a breathable second layer and thermal buffer for the main building , shielding the interior spaces from Moscow ’s extreme summer and winter climates .
A vertical louvre system sheaths the internal facades to ensure privacy for the individual apartments .
Enclosure panels on a dynamic geometry are slotted into the structural framing to allow daylight to penetrate deep into the heart of the scheme and can be controlled to modify the internal environment – closed in winter for extra warmth and opened in summer to allow natural ventilation .
Energy management is at the heart of the design , with additional strategies to include on - site renewable and low - carbon energy generation .

A bold beginning
KDE 4.0 was officially released last week after extensive development .
The long - awaited 4.0 release ushers in a new era for the popular open - source desktop environment and adds many intriguing new features and technologies .
Unfortunately , the release comes with almost as many new bugs as it does features , and there is much work to be done before it sparkles like the 3.5.x series .
KDE 4 is largely built with Qt 4 , the latest version of Trolltech 's commercial open - source development platform .
Qt 4 brings significant performance improvements to KDE and offers a lot of really sophisticated new features for developers , like the Arthur painting framework and Scribe text layout system .
KDE 4 also inherits many of Qt 4's most valued attributes , particularly its high portability .
As a result of KDE 's migration to a powerful new CMake - based build system and beneficial changes in Trolltech 's licensing model for Qt 4 , the KDE developers can finally leverage Qt 's inherent cross-platform compatibility to make KDE a truly platform - neutral desktop environment .
One of the most exciting advancements brought about along with the move to Qt 4 is the emergence of a KDE Windows port and a Mac OS X port .
Some equally exciting additions in KDE 4.0 include the new Oxygen visual style , the Plasma desktop shell , the Dolphin file manager , the Phonon multimedia system , the Solid hardware layer , the Kross scripting framework , elaborate compositing visual effects , and the Strigi indexing system .
The developers also performed extensive reorganization of the core KDE libraries to improve the platform APIs .
There are so many new features that no single article could ever hope to address them all with adequate depth .
For this review , I have attempted to narrow down the list and focus on a selection of core components .
This article describes key features , evaluates various design decisions , provides insight into the developers ' long - term vision and enumerates some current weaknesses and limitations .
While reading this article , it is important to keep in mind that KDE 4 is still largely incomplete .
Many of the details provided in this article reflect the fact that the 4.0 release is not a finished product .
The KDE development team controversially decided to release 4.0 in a premature state in order to stimulate user interest and promote accelerated development .
The result is that KDE 4.0 is , in many ways , like a preview for developers and technical enthusiasts rather than a release for enterprise desktops and production environments .
My extensive testing shows that KDE 4.0 can be used on a day - to - day basis , but there are many inconveniences posed by the software 's current limitations .
In this article , I will try to provide a balance of forward - looking analysis and detailed descriptions of the software 's current state .
I conducted the vast majority of my testing with OpenSUSE 10.3 using the one - click KDE 4.0 installation method .
I also tested briefly with Kubuntu 7.10 by installing from the Kubuntu KDE 4.0 installation ISO .
Kubuntu and OpenSUSE both provide an adequate test environment for KDE 4.0 , but I chose OpenSUSE for review testing because I feel that OpenSUSE currently provides a slightly more polished KDE 4.0 environment .
Doing a full installation was quite time - consuming with both distributions , so those of you who just want a taste of the KDE 4.0 experience without having to install anything should consider trying the Live CDs .
I did not have compositing enabled during any of my tests .
I could not get KWin compositing to work on either my desktop computer or my Dell Inspiron 1420n laptop .
Compiz works out of the box in Ubuntu on the laptop , so I was quite surprised to find that KWin does not .
It is worth noting that compositing is disabled by default in KDE 4.0 .
Those of you who want to explore the visual effects supported by KWin should be able to find some good videos on YouTube without much difficulty .
This review will not address the subject further , though I will likely revisit it in a future article .
This review will primarily focus on Oxygen , Plasma , Dolphin , Phonon , and Solid .
Hillary Clinton today moved to secure her position as the most hawkish Democrat in the 2008 presidential race , saying she would consider the use of force to compel Iran to abandon its nuclear programme .
In an article for Foreign Affairs magazine intended as a blueprint for the foreign policy of a future Clinton White House , the Democratic frontrunner argues that Iran poses a long term strategic challenge to American and its allies , and that it must not be permitted to build or acquire nuclear weapons .
" If Iran does not comply with its own commitments and the will of the international community , all options must remain on the table , " Ms Clinton said .
Elsewhere , Ms Clinton took the edge off her steely posture by saying she would abandon the Bush administration 's policy of isolating its enemies , and would deploy diplomacy .
" True statesmanship requires that we engage with our adversaries , not for the sake of talking but because robust diplomacy is a prerequisite to achieving our aims . "
She says she would even consider offering incentives to Iran in return for a pledge to disarm .
However , she sets out a series of stringent conditions that are virtually identical to current White House policy .
" If Iran is in fact willing to end its nuclear weapons programme , renounce sponsorship of terrorism , support Middle East peace , and play a constructive role in stabilising Iraq , the United States should be prepared to offer Iran a carefully calibrated package of incentives , " Ms Clinton wrote .
The article , the latest in a series of position papers from the leading Democratic and Republican contenders for the White House , offers a glimpse at Ms Clinton 's efforts to appeal to Democrats seeking a repudiation of the current regime 's world view when they begin voting in primaries next January , as well as to the broader electorate that will vote in November 2008 .
It arrives only days after Ms Clinton was severely criticised by her Democratic rivals for backing a Senate resolution calling on the US government to declare Iran 's Revolutionary Guards , the elite division of Tehran 's military , a terrorist entity .
The measure has been argued strenuously by the vice - president , Dick Cheney , and other neocons , but such a sweeping designation does not appear to have the support of the state department .
Ms Clinton was the only Democratic candidate to support the resolution , and her rivals said her vote could help the Bush administration make a future case for war against Iran .
Unlike the five other candidates to sketch out their vision of foreign policy to date , Ms Clinton gave little indication of her comprehensive world view .
However , she pledged to avoid the " ideologically blinkered " policies of the current presidency .
" Avoid false choices driven by ideology , " she wrote .
On Iraq , Ms Clinton offered a small variation on her promises on the campaign trail , saying she would instruct her Pentagon chief and other military leaders to draw up a withdrawal plan within 60 days of her inauguration .
However , she would consider leaving behind a residual force in the Kurdish areas of northern Iraq .
CHICAGO -–
On the morning after Super Tuesday , as ballots were still being counted in some states and delegates were still being tripled - checked , Senator Barack Obama conceded -– reluctantly -– the term “ underdog ” may no longer be an apt description .
“ We are less of an underdog than we were two weeks ago , ” Mr. Obama told reporters here .
“ Two weeks ago , we were a big underdog , now we ’re a slight underdog . ”
In a news conference here today , Mr. Obama walked through the election results from the biggest day of the 2008 Democratic presidential race .
He professed it to be an “ extraordinary night , ” but continued to assert that Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton holds the advantages in the protracted fight for the nomination .
“ I think the Clinton camp ’s basic attitude was that the whole calendar was set up to deliver the knockout blow on Feb. 5 , ” Mr. Obama said .
“ And not only did we play them to a draw , we won more delegates and we won more states .
What that means is that we are in a fierce competition and we ’ve got many more rounds to fight . ”
But Mr. Obama said most of that fighting would be done on the ground in the next voting states , not in debates .
When asked whether he would accept the invitation from Mrs. Clinton to attend four more debates in the coming weeks , he laughed .
“ I do n’t think anybody is clamoring for more debates , ” he said .
“ We ’ve had 18 debates so far .
I think we ’ve had 10 more than we ’ve had in the last Democratic contest . ”
He said he would agree to at least one debate , but noted , “ It ’s very important for me to spend time with voters . ”
As the Republican nominating fight appears far closer to reaching a conclusion , Mr. Obama said he was not concerned that the Democratic contest would soldier on .
“ I think it would be a problem if Senator Clinton ’s voters disliked me or my voters disliked Senator Clinton , ” he said .
“ I do n’t think that ’s the case .
I think our voters are passionate about bringing about change . ”
His campaign strategists outlined a list of states they believe he holds advantages , beginning with Louisiana , Nebraska and Washington state , which have contests on Saturday .
Next Tuesday , Virginia , Maryland and the District of Columbia are strong for Mr. Obama , his aides believe , followed the next week by Wisconsin .
“ We are in a fierce competition and we have many more rounds to fight , ” Mr. Obama said .
With a smile , he added : “ We ’re turning out to be a scrappy little team . ”
In a 20 - minute news conference at an airport hotel , before Mr. Obama flew back to Washington , he urged voters – and , more specifically , the party super delegates – to begin thinking about how Democrats would take on Senator John McCain of Arizona , the front - runner for the Republican nomination .
The race , he said , could turn on independent - minded voters .
“ If you ’ve got a lot of voters who are choosing between me and McCain , but not choosing between McCain and Senator Clinton , then we ’ve got a problem , ” Mr. Obama said .
“ And that ’s part of what the super delegates are going to have to consider is who matches up best with a John McCain , who can appeal to independents in an effective way and who can even peel off some Republicans . ”
Mr Woolas warned the problem was " the elephant in the room "
Phil Woolas said health workers were aware such marriages were creating increased risk of genetic problems .
The claims infuriated the Muslim Public Affairs Committee ( MPAC ) which called on the prime minister to " sack him " .
MPAC spokesman Asghar Bukhari said Mr Woolas ' comments " verged on Islamophobia " .
Mr Woolas , an environment minister who represents ethnically - diverse Oldham East and Saddleworth , risked sparking a major row after warning the issue was " the elephant in the room " , Mr Bukhari said .
Expert analysis
Mr Woolas said cultural sensitivities made the issue of birth defects difficult to address .
The former race relations minister told the Sunday Times : " If you have a child with your cousin the likelihood is there 'll be a genetic problem .
Awareness does need to be raised but we are very aware of the sensitivities
Phil Woolas
" The issue we need to debate is first cousin marriages , whereby a lot of arranged marriages are with first cousins , and that produces lots of genetic problems in terms of disability [ in children ] . "
Mr Woolas stressed the marriages , which are legal in the UK , were a cultural , not a religious , issue and confined mainly to families originating in rural Pakistan .
But he also told the paper : " If you talk to any primary care worker they will tell you that levels of disability among the ...
Pakistani population are higher than the general population .
And everybody knows it 's caused by first cousin marriage . "
" Awareness does need to be raised but we are very aware of the sensitivities , " he added , pointing out that many of the people involved were the products of such marriages .
' Islamophobia '
His comments come at a sensitive time for community relations following the furore over the Archbishop of Canterbury 's comments about accommodating aspects of Sharia law in Britain .
This is to do with a medieval culture where you keep wealth within the family
Ann Cryer MP
Mr Bukhari told BBC News : " After his comments , MPAC UK is asking will Prime Minister Gordon Brown back him or sack him .
Mr Bukhari said it was " bizarre " Mr Woolas has spoken about a sensitive health issue which has no relation to his environment brief , and accused him of ignoring links between pollution and birth defects .
However , Mr Woolas was defended by cabinet minister Geoff Hoon who said expert analysis was needed on the extent of the problem .
" But it obviously is a very sensitive matter and no one , no one , would suggest this is a problem for the wider Muslim community , " he told Sky News .
' Recessive disorders '
" I am confident that what he has said will have been said with sensitivity and with proper regard to his Muslim constituents and Muslims right across the United Kingdom . "
The call for action was also supported by Labour MP Ann Cryer who raised the issue two years ago after research showed British Pakistanis were 13 times more likely to have children with recessive disorders than the general population .
Mrs Cryer , who represents Keighley in West Yorkshire , told the Sunday Times : " This is to do with a medieval culture where you keep wealth within the family . "
" I have encountered cases of blindness and deafness .
There was one poor girl who had to have an oxygen tank on her back and breathe from a hole in the front of her neck , " she added .
" The parents were warned they should not have any more children .
But when the husband returned from Pakistan , within months they had another child with exactly the same condition . "
Research for BBC2's Newsnight in November 2005 showed British Pakistanis accounted for 3.4 % of all births but have 30 % of all British children with " recessive disorders " .
Other fledgling lawyers may toast the news that they ’ve passed the bar exam by popping open a chilled bottle of champagne .
Not Kathleen Holtz .
When results of the most recent California bar exam are released next month , the 18 - year - old law school grad will be too young to drink legally .
And , as the youngest practicing attorney in California -- if not the nation -- Holtz is loath to break the law .

At an age when most of her peers are just finishing high school and heading to college , the Whittier native is already punching the clock at a Century City law firm .
She has no doubts about acing July ’s grueling law exam -- the final hurdle to becoming a bona fide lawyer .
“ I felt the bar exam went very well , ” she said .
That kind of bravado can be expected from someone who started college at age 10 and entered law school at 15 .
Holtz graduated from the UCLA School of Law this year .
People are stunned to learn she is only 18 .
Most assume she is in her late 20s .
She is content to let them think that .

“ Most of my friends are older , ” said Holtz , of Westwood .
“ Even when I was younger , I was told I was very mature for my age . ”
Other students at Cal State L.A. , where she enrolled in an early entrance program , figured she was older than she really was .
They had no clue that she only spent three weeks in first grade before skipping to second grade , or that she ’d planned since age 8 to start college as early as she could .
By age 10 , Holtz had by - passed fifth grade and was ready to trade middle school for part - time studies at Cal State L.A .
She enrolled full time at age 11 .
Holtz said she does n’t regret skipping high school .

“ I was bored in school .
I do n’t feel like I missed out on anything by not going to high school .
I was n’t going to be bored eight more years in order to go to a high school prom , ” she said .
She graduated from Cal State L.A. magna cum laude with a degree in philosophy .
At UCLA ’s law school , she was a Law Review editor and Moot Court participant .
But she was n’t old enough to drive or sign the lease for her off - campus apartment .
She had to skip the monthly law school beer bashes and the Thursday night “ bar reviews ” -- in which law students traveled to bars around Los Angeles to take a break from the rigors of case law and classwork .
Dean of Students Elizabeth Cheadle said Holtz e-mailed her before starting school .
“ She said , ‘ By the way , I ’m only 15 . ’
I was somewhat concerned .
She did n’t want other students to know .
She wanted people to get to know her as a person . ”

Holtz managed to keep her secret -- for a while .
“ People thought I was 21 or 22 , ” she said .
“ But I was 15 . ” After a month or so , word got out that the class of ’07 had a youngster in its ranks .
When Holtz was found out , some students gave her the cold shoulder .
“ A select few were supportive -- it did n’t change how they reacted to me .
Maybe 90 % were hostile .
They stopped talking to me and were suddenly very condescending , ” she said .

But school administrators and her professors stood behind her .
“ She came in and talked to me .
I was very surprised , ” said law school Dean Michael Schill .
“ Law school is a very challenging environment for anyone .
“ It takes a lot of gumption to go to law school at such a young age . ”
Professor Eugene Volokh , who graduated from college at age 15 but worked as a computer programmer for six years before entering law school , said Holtz actively participated in class discussions and was “ obviously intellectually prepared ” to keep up with older students .
Advertisement
“ If you did n’t know her age , you would n’t even think about her age , ” he said .
“ It ’s easier for girls to look older than their age than it is for boys . ”
Holly Williams , now an attorney with the Latham & Watkins law firm in Los Angeles , was a third - year law student when she met Holtz .
They remain friends .
Williams said Holtz did not dwell on the cold shoulders she received from some .
“ She blended in perfectly , ” said Williams , now 28 .
Holtz organized hiking trips and dinner outings for other students who did n’t go drinking on Thursday nights .
“ She handled it with a lot of grace , ” Williams said .

In California , where individuals must be at least 18 to practice law , the average age for bar admittance is 30 .
Spokeswomen for the State Bar of California and the American Bar Assn. said they know of no lawyers younger than Holtz .
Holtz ’s parents , Bradley and Jane Holtz , say they have been supportive of their daughter ’s decisions to go to college and then on to law school .
They helped her settle into graduate - student housing before moving her into a studio apartment near UCLA .
“ She was n’t your typical 15 - year - old , ” Jane Holtz said .
“ She seemed so ready and was so anxious to go to law school .
My husband and I talked about it and decided it would be interesting to see how that first year went . ”
They were surprised that “ when word spread around the law school that there was a 15 - year - old there , some of the students were on a mission to find out who it was , ” she said .
Advertisement
“ Some embraced her and were wonderful to her .
There were also some others who had attitudes . ”
Kathleen Holtz ’s age was no secret when an attorney at the Century City firm of TroyGould recommended that she be hired .
She started work last month .
Until she passes the bar , she is being supervised by a licensed lawyer .
“ Today we were meeting and talking about how to prepare a case for a jury and Kathleen had some interesting ideas about using visual aids to make the case more understandable , ” said Jeffrey W. Kramer , who is 56 and heads the litigation department at the firm where he has worked for 31 years .
“ The interesting thing will be in four or five years where she ’s in a position where she ’ll be supervising less experienced lawyers who are older than she is . ”

Lawyer Chris Lilly , 35 , said only one issue arose when Holtz was hired .
“ We wondered about child labor laws , ” he said .
“ She was only 17 when we recruited her . ”

House stands up to Bush pressure for quick wiretap bill David Edwards
Published : Wednesday February 13 , 2008

This A move to temporarily extend a controversial spy law hit a snag Wednesday , as the House voted to debate for three more weeks while failing to concurrently pass a temporary extension of a stop - gap measure .
The president has vowed to veto any legislation updating the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance
Act that does not essentially retroactively legalize his warrantless surveillance program and free phone companies from facing lawsuits .
The bill faces stiff opposition from some Democrats in the House , particularly as it offers blanket legal immunity to telecommunications companies for possible violations of US law if they participate in the measures .
By a vote of 206 to 199 votes , the House agreed Wednesday to prolong its debate for three more weeks .
But a bill to extend the Protect America Act , a temporary law that temporarily expands the government 's surveillance powers failed 229-191 .
The fate of the surveillance law remains unclear .
The votes followed Bush 's admonishment earlier in the day , demanding that the House pass new rules for monitoring terrorists ' communications , saying " terrorists are planning new attacks on our country ... that will make Sept. 11 pale by comparison . "
Bush said he would not agree to giving the House more time to debate a measure the Senate passed Tuesday governing the government 's ability to work with telecommunications companies to eavesdrop on phone calls and e-mails between suspected terrorists .
The bill gives phone companies retroactive protection from lawsuits filed on the basis of cooperation they gave the government without court permission  something Bush insisted was included in the bill .
About 40 lawsuits have been filed against telecom companies by people alleging violations of wiretapping and privacy laws .
The House did not include the immunity provision in a similar bill it passed last year .
" In order to be able to discover ... the enemy 's plans , we need the cooperation of telecommunication companies , " Bush said .
" If these companies are subjected to lawsuits that could cost them billions of dollars , they wo n't participate .
They wo n't help us .
They wo n't help protect America . "
The 68 - 29 Senate vote Tuesday to update the 1978 Foreign Intelligence Surveillance
Act belied the nearly two months of stops and starts and bitter political wrangling that preceded it .
The two sides had battled to balance civil liberties with the need to conduct surveillance on potential adversaries .
Bush said the Senate bill was passed with wide , bipartisan support , and the House should pass it too  before the current law expires at midnight on Saturday .
" Congress has had over six months to discuss and deliberate , " said Bush , who stood alongside Director of National Intelligence Mike McConnell .
" The time for debate is over .
I will not accept any temporary extension .
They have already been given a two - week extension . "
Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid accused the president and Senate Republicans of being more interested in politicizing intelligence than resolving the debate .
Reid said that the issue would not be before Congress if Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney " in their unyielding efforts to expand presidential powers , " had not created a system to conduct wiretapping , including on U.S. citizens , outside the bounds of federal law .
" The president could have taken the simple step of requesting new authority from Congress ... but whether out of convenience , incompetence , or outright disdain for the rule of law , the administration chose to ignore Congress and ignore the Constitution , " Reid said .
Reid said if the president chooses to veto a short - term extension , he , not Congress will have to take the blame for any gaps in collecting intelligence of terrorists ' communications .
" Due to months of White House foot - dragging , the relevant House committees have only just gotten important documents related to whether the Bush Administration followed the law and the Constitution , " he said .
" They need some time to review and analyze them .
We must not let this critical issue be resolved by White House bullying . "
Doubtful they can work out the differences in the bills by the time the law expires , Democrats in the Senate and the House prepared short - term extensions that would keep the law in effect for several more weeks .
Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky blocked an extension attempt Tuesday .
Rep. Lamar Smith of Texas , the senior Republican on the House Judiciary Committee , said Republicans in the House would fight another extension .
" The one thing we 've learned about Congress is they wo n't act until forced to , " White House press secretary Dana Perino told reporters after Bush 's statement .
" We 're not going to pass extensions into perpetuity . "
House Judiciary Committee Chairman John Conyers said Tuesday he still opposes retroactive immunity .
" There is no basis for the broad telecommunications company amnesty provisions advocated by the administration , " Conyers wrote in a letter to White House Counsel Fred Fielding asking for documents about the wiretapping program .
The documents have been withheld from Congress .
While giving the White House what it wanted on immunity , the Senate also expanded the power of the court to oversee government eavesdropping on Americans .
The amendment would give the FISA court the authority to monitor whether the government is complying with procedures designed to protect the privacy of innocent Americans whose telephone or computer communications are captured during surveillance of a foreign target .
The bill would also require FISA court orders to eavesdrop on Americans who are overseas .
Under current law , the government can wiretap or search the possessions of anyone outside the United States  even a soldier serving overseas  without court permission if it believes the person may be a foreign agent .
This video is from CNN's Newsroom , broadcast February 13 , 2008 .
( with wire reports ) Transcript as provided by White House : Director , thank you for joining me .
Good morning .
At this moment , somewhere in the world , terrorists are planning new attacks on our country .
Their goal is to bring destruction to our shores that will make September the 11th pale by comparison .
To carry out their plans , they must communicate with each other , they must recruit operatives , and they must share information .
The lives of countless Americans depend on our ability to monitor these communications .
Our intelligence professionals must be able to find out who the terrorists are talking to , what they are saying , and what they 're planning .
To help our intelligence agencies do this , Congress passed the Protect America
Act last year .
Unfortunately , Congress set the law to expire on February 1st  and then failed to pass new legislation that would keep these tools in effect over the long run .
And so at the 11th hour , Congress passed a temporary 15 - day extension of the current law which will expire at midnight this Saturday .
I signed that extension .
I did so to give members of the House and Senate more time to work out their differences .
Well , the Senate has used this time wisely .
I am pleased that last night , senators approved new legislation that will ensure our intelligence professionals have the tools they need to make us safer  and they did so by a wide , bipartisan majority .
The Senate bill also provides fair and just liability protections for companies that did the right thing and assisted in defending America after the attacks of September the 11th .
In order to be able to discover enemy  the enemy 's plans , we need the cooperation of telecommunication companies .
If these companies are subjected to lawsuits that could cost them billions of dollars , they wo n't participate ; they wo n't help us ; they wo n't help protect America .
Liability protection is critical to securing the private sector 's cooperation with our intelligence efforts .
The Senate has passed a good bill , and has shown that protecting our nation is not a partisan issue .
And I congratulate the senators .
Unfortunately , the House has failed to pass a good bill .
And now House leaders say they want still more time to reach agreement with the Senate on a final bill .
They make this claim even though it is clear that the Senate bill , the bill passed last night , has significant bipartisan support in the House .
Congress has had over six months to discuss and deliberate .
The time for debate is over .
I will not accept any temporary extension .
House members have had plenty of time to pass a good bill .
They have already been given a two - week extension beyond the deadline they set for themselves .
If Republicans and Democrats in the Senate can come together on a good piece of legislation , there is no reason why Republicans and Democrats in the House cannot pass the Senate bill immediately .
The House 's failure to pass the bipartisan Senate bill would jeopardize the security of our citizens .
As Director McConnell has told me , without this law , our ability to prevent new attacks will be weakened .
And it will become harder for us to uncover terrorist plots .
We must not allow this to happen .
It is time for Congress to ensure the flow of vital intelligence is not disrupted .
It is time for Congress to pass a law that provides a long - term foundation to protect our country .
And they must do so immediately .
Thank you very much .

CHICAGO ( Reuters ) - A new system for scoring the nutritional value of foods will find its way to grocery store shelves next year , the latest attempt to come up with a standard way to make healthier food choices .

A new system for scoring the nutritional value of foods will find its way to grocery store shelves next year , the latest attempt to come up with a standard way to make healthier food choices .
REUTERS / Feature Photo Service
The Overall Nutritional Quality Index ( ONQI ) was developed by a group of nutrition and health experts , led by David Katz , chairman of the Yale Prevention Research Center .
ONQI takes into account a number of factors in assigning a score of 1 to 100 for each food , including negatives like the amount of saturated fat , sugar and cholesterol in a food , and positives like fiber , nutrients , omega 3 fatty acids and the quality of the proteins .
The system will be introduced to grocery stores across the U.S. in 2008 by Topco Associates LLC , a grocery distribution and services cooperative owned by a number of independent grocers , including Wegmans , IGA , Hy - Vee and Food City , Topco said .
The grocers that own Topco own about 13,000 stores .
The grocers are not obligated to use the scoring system , but it will be made available to them .
“ You really should n’t need a PhD in nutritional biochemistry to figure out which kids ’ breakfast cereal is healthier , ” Katz told Reuters during an interview this week .
The scoring system will let consumers compare different types of the same food , so they will be able to tell not only that fruit is healthier than candy , but which fruits or candy are more or less healthy .
“ It ’s all candy , none of it is going to compare to broccoli , ” Katz said .
“ But face it , when you want candy , broccoli is n’t going to do the job . ”
THE ROLL - OUT
The scoring initially will be featured on a handful of Topco ’s private label brands in the second half of 2008 and could be made available to other manufacturers that might want to use the system , Katz said .
But regardless of whether a manufacturer puts the score on its packages , grocers could put the scores on store shelves , next to price information , said Ric Jurgens , chairman of Topco and chief executive of Hy - Vee , in an interview .
Jurgens said Hy - Vee is considering putting the information on shelves next to the price of a product .
“ ONQI creates a clear and concise measuring system and makes it easier for consumers to evaluate everyone ’s products , ” Jurgens said .
But Katz ’s group is n’t the only one trying to develop a standard , comprehensive nutritional scoring system .
Producers also are trying to get a seat at the table .
The Nutrition Rich Food Coalition , whose members include the National Dairy Council , National Pork Board and other commodity organizations , also is developing a system .
The nutrient - rich foods model also goes beyond things like sugar , fat and calories to look at the entire nutrition profile of foods .
That index is currently in consumer research and the coalition hopes to have it in use by the middle of 2008 .
U.S. consumers are seeing more food labels indicating health claims .
For example , Kraft Foods
Inc , the world ’s largest food company , has a “ sensible solutions ” label for some products ; General Mills splashes the words “ whole grain ” on its cereal boxes and its 100 - calorie pack has become ubiquitous on store shelves .
MIT Professor Harry Winston every year gives a famed lecture on " The Art of Speaking " .
Cal Newport attended the lecture this year and posted the notes .
They ’re awesome – some of the best advice on speaking I ’ve read .
Read the whole thing , excerpted below are my favorite parts .
In particular , I found the advice " do n’t thank your audience at the end " pretty interesting .
How to Start Some advice for starting your talk .
Do n’t start with a joke .
The audience is not accustomed to you or your speaking style yet .
Humor will be difficult at this point .
Do start with a menu .
Tell them exactly what you ’ll be speaking about and in what order .
Do provide an empowerment promise .
Explain why your audience will come away from the talk better than when they entered .
The Big Four A collection of four heuristics that make a talk work .
Cycling .
Deliver ideas first in brief , then in detail , then in summary .
To use the lingo of artificial intelligence : let your audience load the schema , then fill in the details , then let them know what ’s worth indexing for future reference .
Verbal Punctuation .
Provide a mechanism to help people who “ fogged out ” to easily rejoin the talk .
For example : “ We have just finished talking about the first heuristic , cycling , I am now going to talk about the second heuristic for helping to make your talks more interesting … ” Near Miss .
When explaining an idea , also describe other ideas that are close but not quite the same .
This will help people understand what the important points are that define your idea .
Ask Rhetorical Questions .
Do n’t make them too easy .
Do n’t make them too hard .
Wait 6 seconds for an answer .
The Tools Four tools that can make or break your presentation .
Time and Place .
If it ’s in your control : mid-morning is the best time .
Choose a location that will look full with your expected audience size .
Make sure it is well - lit .
Do n’t let them turn down the lights .
( “ It ’s easier to see slides in a light room then to seem them through closed eyelids . ” )
Slides .
Do n’t use anything less than 24 - point type .
If you ca n’t fit the information at this font size then you have too much .
Follow these four rules :
Do n’t read the slides !
“ A special circle in hell for those who … ”
Do n’t stand far away from the screen .
This requires divided attention from your audience .
Have one meaningful picture per slide .
If it ’s found in Microsoft ’s clip art gallery , it ’s not meaningful .
No pointers .
Laser or otherwise .
These are distractions .
You ’ll play with them .
They ’re annoying .
Stand by the screen and point with your hand or refer to visual anchors on the slide .
How to Stop Some things to keep in mind about concluding a talk : Deliver on your promise made at the beginning .
Remind them what it was and summarize how you satisfied it .
Tell a joke .
They know you now .
And if they leave happy they will assume the entire talk made them happy .
Call for questions .
Do n’t thank the audience .
It makes it seem like they did you a favor by listening to your boring babble .
End with a salute .
Compliment without thanking .
( i.e. , “ You ’ve been a great audience , I hope you learned a lot about how to give a great talk . ” )

Top 10 Cheapest Ways To Exercise
We all want to be fit and trim and to keep fit and stay healthy , but there are a few things that keep us from looking and feeling our best : inertia , laziness , a hectic schedule , and maybe even a limited budget .
As for me , I ’ve invested in a stationary bike that I use almost daily while I catch the news on television to relax the brain while I work the body .
I did spend a pretty penny on that bike but at least it is well used .
I ’m not alone about spending on exercise though , since the workout of choice by many of my colleagues involves a gym membership or a mountain bike or an exercise system of some kind or other .
The truth is , you can use any excuse to get out of exercise except perhaps that it is “ expensive ” , since it does n’t really take much to get yourself into better shape .
Here are some absolutely free ways to move your body !
You can even make a bit of money on a few of these activities .
No Excuses !
Ways To Exercise For Free
# 1 Go jogging .
You can jog almost everywhere — parks , streets and even in place .
When nobody ’s looking , I lightly jog at my own space at work .
That and I perform some stretching exercises … it ’s good for ergonomics and helps keep the energy up throughout the day .
# 2 Take a hike .
Those who live in the city have everything at their fingertips .
You do n’t even have to have the requisite two cars a household to be mobile .
Just by walking to wherever you need to go , you ’re a healthier leg up over everyone else !
Those who live in the country can find a trail or two and incorporate hikes in their schedule .
And wherever you go , take the stairs .
# 3 Rent exercise videos …. from the library .
The library is a treasure trove for a lot of cool stuff .
With the variety it offers , you can borrow quite a few exercise videos and books to help you pin down your workout of choice .
# 4 Check out free television and internet exercises .
Even more encouraging are the free workouts you can get from various forms of media these days .
There are internet sites that can provide you with step - by - step instructions and videos for routines you can regularly use .
Television programs devoted to workouts have been around since time immemorial and cheesy or not , they do the job ( if you ’re shy about following along with the show , just watch it in private ) .
# 5 Babysit .
If you have your own kids , then you ’ll probably agree that handling kids can help keep you fit .
If you do n’t , you can experience the wonderful world of toddlerhood by volunteering or signing up for a babysitting job .
The best ages to babysit for the purpose of getting yourself moving are those toddler years ( 2 through 5 ) because you ’re compelled to carry , lift , run , chase and follow these little people around all day .
Here are also some suggestions for incorporating your baby into your exercise routine .
# 6 Maintain your yard .
Be your own gardener .
Work on your yard all year long and you ’ll have more than your heart going — best exercise of all is to push that lawnmower around especially if you have a large lawn .
Or even better , install your own drainage .
All that digging should be great for upper body strength and endurance .
# 7 Clean out or organize your house .
Have you checked your attic , basement and closets lately ?
Well , from first - hand experience , I can say that hauling all the clutter from their previous storage areas and turning them into an organized system of boxes for sale , donation pick ups or just further storage will get your blood pumping .
Even just pushing around a several pound vacuum cleaner instead of relying on a Roomba , or sweeping your garage floor should oil your joints .
But make sure your back is n’t too vulnerable .
# 8 Use someone else ’s sports or exercise equipment .
Have you checked under your bed lately ?
All around the nation , there is a glut of unused exercise equipment sitting around in garages and hiding in spare rooms and basements .
You could have these things right under your very nose — if not at your own home , they could be sitting somewhere in a friend ’s or relative ’s home , sadly unused .
It may be a good idea to resurrect these neglected items for active use once more .
# 9 Volunteer or get active work ( full or part - time ) .
If you have a desk job , then doing some volunteer work for the community that may involve a little activity may not only be good for your conscience but also for your health .
And if you ’re able to , maybe that choice to apply a little bit of your own muscle into your work schedule by choosing a more active job could actually serve as the backbone ( pun intended ) of your healthy lifestyle .
and last but definitely not least ….
# 10 Have sex .
According to a fellow blogger , sex can be pretty financially rewarding ( ummm … not in the way you think of course ) .
Many studies show that it ’s pretty good exercise :
This activity performed at least three times a week can cut the risk of a heart attack in half .
Researchers started out studying the benefits of vigorous exercise , looking at an activity lasting 20 minutes or longer and making the exerciser sweaty or out of breath .
Most of the men they questioned thought that sex fit this description just as well as soccer .
How To Exercise and How Not To !
And now for a little fun .
This is the way to exercise once you have kids .

While this is what you call cheating !

An archaic act of largesse
Imagine this :
You 've got a couple of unfulfilled ambitions .
You have n't been able to get to where you want to be in life .
Something - family history or obligations , business failures , your inability to get a loan - has held you back .
Unwilling to accept all of this , you take off .
Light out for the territory , as they say .
You scratch around on a desolate scrap of land until you find gold , or silver , or a valuable mineral .
You plunge a couple of stakes into the earth .
Now it belongs to you - and so , once again , do your dreams .
This probably sounds a little fantastic .
After all , we live in Silicon Valley , where it seems like the only wilderness we have to fight through is the tangle of electronic wires pooling on the floor .
But something of that fantasy must still live in us as Westerners - why else would it have taken so long for our leadership to decide it was time to reform the General Mining Act of 1872 ?
If you 've never heard of the Mining Act , prepare to be disturbed .
According to its summary , the Act " provides that all valuable mineral deposits in lands belonging to the U.S. , both surveyed and unsurveyed , are free and open to exploration and purchase by U.S. citizens ... the lands in which the minerals are found are open to occupation and purchase by U.S. citizens . "
Furthermore , as currently interpreted by the federal government , the law means that mining is the " highest " use for public lands .
In practice , that has meant that mining companies - many of them foreign - owned - have trotted off with billions of dollars in gold and other minerals from public land in the last several years .
They 've left American taxpayers to clean up their abandoned mines ( more than $ 275 million for three mines alone that closed in the 1990s , for instance ) and deal with the impact of poisoned streams , blasted mountaintops , and a cratered landscape .
About 40 percent of Western waterways ' headwaters are polluted by mining - and the cost of cleanup could total $ 32 billion or more .
Mining companies do n't need to worry about that .
Do n't think they pay into the Treasury for their privileges , either - miners do n't pay taxes on what they take away .
In fact , Congress gave them a tax break worth $ 823 million for this decade .
It 's like a bad dream .
What 's worse is that even reasonable attempts at reform have met with failure .
Late last year , the House passed a bill that would impose some basic environmental protections as well as a royalty on hardrock mineral production , similar to the ones paid by the coal , oil , and gas industries .
The bill has n't gotten past the Senate .
Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid comes from Nevada , which accounts for 87 percent of American gold production .
Other senators have been fumbling and bumbling along , offering amendments to water the thing down , mumbling about being fair to businesses that have watched the price of gold skyrocket to nearly $ 700 an ounce and the price of uranium triple over the past three years .
Pitiful .
I believe that our leadership has managed to get away with this for a couple of reasons .
The first one , and the most obvious , is that citizens have n't been paying attention .
Now that they finally are - now that companies are attempting to open mines just a few miles away from major urban centers or national parks - the second reason may be a psychological one .
Maybe Westerners - and that includes Californians - just are n't ready to let go of our romantic image of the lone miner with a pan in his hand .
I 'll confess that there 's a little part of me that still likes that image .
Some days , when I 'm at the end of a very long work week and have a weekend full of housecleaning and grocery shopping to look forward to , I like to think about what it would be like to make a big score .
Maybe not in gold prospecting , but maybe the modern - day , generation - appropriate equivalent ( the Internet startup , the hedge fund ) that might work for me .
Surely I 'm not the only one out there who feels that way .
I can't be , or otherwise we'd have a 1972 General Mining Act .
Or a 1992 General Mining Act - something , anything , in the last 136 years that offered a pragmatic response to the environmental degradation and financial absurdity of American mining practices .
How long will our dreams and fantasies be more valuable to us than our reality ?
Probably as long as we 're all still imagining our big score .
DOUBLE DEVICES DOUBLE DEVICES
Share of business travelers who regularly carry more than one : Cellphone 15 % Laptop 10 % PDA / other 6 % Source : In - Stat SAN FRANCISCO 
About 31 % of business travelers lug more than one cellphone , laptop or other electronic device , says a study out Monday from researcher In - Stat .
Cellphones are the most duplicated electronic : 15 % of business travelers carry two or more , says the survey of 1,402 people .
But a surprising number of frequent travelers — defined by In - Stat as those on the road at least 20 % of the time — schlep two laptops .
Duplication is common even with similar devices .
One in four owners of Palm 's high - end Treo cellphone said they also carry another Palm personal digital assistant .
The results " surprised me , " says In - Stat analyst Bill Hughes .
" Multiple laptops are really heavy . "
The study shows that multipurpose devices are too unreliable and hard to use , Hughes says .
There 's still years before they reach their potential , he says .
Samsung , Apple , ( AAPL ) Sony and others are working on it .
The Treo , Apple 's iPhone , Research In Motion 's BlackBerry and other " smartphones " include Web access , e-mail , and other PC - like features .
Sony 's PlayStation Portable video game system has a Web browser and video player .
That 's not enough for travelers such as Troy Steward , 39 .
The computer systems architect from Amherst , N.Y. , carries multiple electronics , including two cellphones ( a Motorola ( MOT ) RAZR for work and Treo for personal calls ) .
He uses his PSP only for video games , and an Apple iPod for movies and music .
" I ( carry ) whatever it takes , " he says .
Why folks lug around so much stuff : • Battery life and storage .
Putting a movie on the PSP would take up too much space on its storage card , Steward says .
That 's why he needs the iPod .
About 36 % of smartphone users surveyed said battery life kept them from using the phone too often , Hughes says .
• Interface and synchronization .
About 41 % of smartphone owners said they wanted a better keyboard , while 30 % wanted an expandable screen .
About 35 % demanded automatic synching with a PC or other electronic device .
" It has to be easy " to use and update an all - in - one device , Hughes says .
• Connectivity issues .
Steward says having two cellphones also helps ensure that he can always get an Internet connection .
Matt Holdrege , a 45 - year - old telecom executive from Los Angeles , similarly uses his iPhone to connect to the Web when his laptop is offline .
Holdrege , working in Kenya , also carries a second phone .
The iPhone has service through cell carrier AT&T , ( T ) which is " very expensive " outside the USA and Europe , he says .
He needs the other phone to receive calls .

In a free - speech case that has drawn widespread attention , a New Jersey judge has upheld the right of a blogger to criticize county officials anonymously by telling those officials to take their subpoena seeking the author ’s identity and put it where the sun do n’t shine .
His honor used legalese , of course , but it ’s Jersey and that ’s what he meant .
From the Asbury Park Press :
Judge Terence Flynn in Freehold ruled to quash a subpoena filed by Manalapan Township against Google , seeking the name and account information of the author of the blog — daTruthSquad -- calling the request " an unjust infringement on the blogger 's First Amendment rights . "
The subpoena is part of an ongoing lawsuit filed in June against Stuart Moskovitz , a former township attorney and mayor .
The township contends Moskovitz botched negotiations for a recreational land purchase in 2005 .
Attorneys for the township believe Moskovitz is the owner of the blog .
Personally , I am of the opinion that there ’s far too much anonymity – and hence lack of accountability – on the Internet .
I ’ve gone so far as to argue that there are indeed cases where outing an anonymous blogger can be justified – especially by private parties such as the press .
However , the bar for the government doing it , in particular , needs to be extraordinarily high , and in this case does n’t appear to have even gotten off the ground .
From the jump this has been one of those disputes where a distant observer keeps waiting for the other shoe to drop : Certainly the county would have a compelling libel or slander case to make against the anonymous blogger such that a reasonable man – or judge – could entertain the notion of ripping the mask off him .
Not so here .
The best the county could offer was speculation that the target of its public lawsuit , attorney and former mayor Moskovitz , is indeed daTruthSquad and that his denial of that fact , if shown to be untrue , would speak to his lack of credibility in their ongoing legal dispute .
" The fact of the matter is that you read that thing and you come to the conclusion that it 's either Moskovitz or it's his alter ego , " a country attorney said in court .
" When you read these blogs . . . da-Mosked Man is da hero of da blog and everybody else is da bad guys . "
Call me capricious , but if I ’m the judge I rule to quash the county ’s subpoena just because its attorney is talking like a juvenile delinquent , even if daTruthSquad uses da same kind of annoying tone on da blog .
However , Judge Flynn had better cause to tell the public officials to buzz off , namely that they had zippo for evidence of their contention , never mind that even if true it would n’t rise to justification for denying the blogger his anonymity .
The Electronic Frontier Foundation has been front and center in keeping Manalapan Township officials off the throat of this lonely pamphleteer .
You can read all of the EFF ’s legal filings about the case here .
" We 're grateful that Judge Flynn upheld the First Amendment rights of our client and recognized that anonymous speakers should not be intimidated into silence through the discovery process , " said EFF Staff Attorney Matt Zimmerman in a press release .
" Now ' daTruthSquad ' can continue to discuss township business without fear of government reprisal . "
As for daTruthSquad , well , let ’s just say he ’s savoring victory .
“ Let daTruthSquad make this point perfectly clear to everyone , ” writes the still - anonymous blogger .
“ This is not a victory for just daTruthSquad .
It is a victory for all bloggers in the United States and any citizen who has a comment to make that any ego - bruised politician may not like .
This is a victory for the First Amendment of the Constitution of the United States , and it should show all weak - minded politicians you cannot mess with the Founding Fathers of this great nation . ”
And that ’s da truth .
A University of British Columbia astronomer with an international team has discovered the largest structures of dark matter ever seen .
Measuring 270 million light - years across , these dark matter structures criss - cross the night sky , each spanning an area that is eight times larger than the full moon .
“ The results are a major leap forward since the presence of a cosmic dark matter web that extends over such large distances has never been observed before , ” says Ludovic Van Waerbeke , an assistant professor in the Dept. of Physics and Astronomy .
To glimpse the unseen structures , the team of French and Canadian scientists “ X - rayed ” the dark matter , an invisible web that makes up more than 80 per cent of the mass of the universe .
The team used a recently developed technique called “ weak gravitational lensing , ” which is similar to taking an X - ray of the body to reveal the underlying skeleton .
The study relied on data gathered from the world ’s largest digital camera .
“ This new knowledge is crucial for us to understand the history and evolution of the cosmos , ” says Van Waerbeke .
“ Such a tool will also enable us to glimpse a little more of the nature of dark matter . ”
The astronomers observed how light from distant galaxies is bent and distorted by webs of dark matter as it travels toward Earth .
They then mapped dark matter structures by measuring the distortions seen in these galaxy light patterns .
The study involved 19 researchers from 11 institutions and was led by UBC , the Institut d'Astrophysique de Paris , the Universite Pierre and Marie Curie ( UPMC ) and the University of Victoria .
Van Waerbeke and his co-authors will publish their findings in a forthcoming issue of the journal Astronomy and Astrophysics .
The submission can be seen at : arxiv.org/abs/0712.0884 .
The team spent several years developing the gravitational lensing tool , which is one of the major goals of the Canada - France - Hawaii - Telescope ( CFHT ) Legacy Survey .
The gravitational lensing technique also played a pivotal role in another recent study : Astronomers produce first detailed map of dark matter in a supercluster -- www.physorg.com/news119182387.html

Abu Dhabi has about 9 percent of the world ’s oil and 0.02 percent of its population .
The result is a surfeit of petrodollars , much of which is funneled into a secretive , government - controlled investment fund that is helping to shift the balance of power in the financial world .
After decades in the shadows , the fund , the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority , is turning heads on Wall Street and in Washington by making high - profile investments in the United States and elsewhere .
Known as ADIA ( pronounced ah - DEE - ah ) , the fund recently formed a small team that is now buying big stakes in Western companies .
This unit masterminded ADIA ’s $ 7.5 billion investment in Citigroup , the nation ’s largest bank , in November .
It has also taken a large position in Toll Brothers , one of the country ’s biggest home builders .
“ There is an idea that Abu Dhabi should not be the underdog of the map , ” said Frauke Heard - Bey , a historian who has written a book about the political emergence of the United Arab Emirates .
“ They have the money to buy companies that are ailing , and why should they not ?
Why not make a mark ? ”
Still , it was n’t the size of their respective vocabularies so much as the frequent winsomeness of their word usage that captivated us : the way that even the simplest impromptu phrasings from them could give us sudden glimpses into the minds of other beings , into the motive and mindfulness behind language in creatures that do n’t happen to speak our own .
The moment with Washoe that still resonates most is one that occurred outside the laboratory , when she happened to notice a swan adrift on a nearby lake .
She turned to her caretakers and signed “ water , ” then “ bird ” : perhaps the first documented incident of another creature freely assigning our words to an observed phenomenon .
It was , the Harvard psychologist Roger Brown noted at the time , “ like getting an S O S from outer space . ”
Image Washoe Credit ... Central Washington University
Skeptics insisted that Washoe and subsequent primate research subjects were not using language in the thoughtful , abstract , spontaneous way humans do , that their utterances were all merely rote , reward - based responses .
The evidence , however , repeatedly suggested otherwise .
When Washoe ’s caretakers arrived in the morning , she ’d sign crude sentences like “ Come hug , feed me , gimme clothes , please out , open door . ”
Once , upon seeing a small doll inside a cup , she signed , “ Baby in my drink ”  as near to an original , unscripted sentence as any language - learning child might utter .
And then there was that shoe fixation of hers .
She was always checking people ’s feet to see what shoes they were wearing .
Whenever anyone came in with a new pair , she ’d immediately request to see them and then sign her assessment .
Of course , with chimps it ’s not so big a leap to imagine them having cognitive and linguistic powers at least kindred to our own .
It would , somehow , take a parrot long the very icon of mindless mimicry , with a brain no bigger than a walnut to give full voice to Washoe ’s silent signaling and force us to rethink our narrow , anthropocentric conceptions of language and thought .
Alex ’s cognitive abilities tested as high as those of a 4 - to - 5 - year - old child .
He understood concepts like presence and absence , making him very adept at the shell game .
He frequently cajoled and coached the other parrots in Pepperberg ’s lab .
And he never hesitated to express his frustrations and affections .
When Pepperberg returned to the lab after a three - week absence , Alex turned his back on her and commanded , “ Come here ! ”
As she put Alex back in his cage the night he died , he signed off with : “ You be good , see you tomorrow .
I love you . ”
They were not unusually gifted members of their respective species , Washoe and Alex .
But armed with our words , they opened our minds , making us aware of the pervasive and protean nature of the linguistic impulse across species .
Of the many tales they told us , the most universal tells of an early ancestor of our own , standing hundreds of thousands of years ago on a lakeshore somewhere , seeing a large winged creature drift by and signing or saying outright , in whatever language it might have been : “ water , ” then “ bird . ”

In this first post in what I hope will be a series of weekly posts titled “ Money Mistake Monday ” , I wanted to share with you a little something called “ The Fancy High - End Wants Everything And Does n’t Care How You Pay For It Girlfriend Syndrome ” .
A few years back ( about 8 years ) I was dating this girl who was an attorney .
She owned her own house , drove a new fancy car , had the nicest shoes and clothing a girl could ever want .
What the hell she wanted to do with me was anyone ’s guess ; I guess I was a bit of a fixer - upper project .
I had a bunch of earrings , I played guitar in a rock band , I drove a piece of crap Honda Civic .
I was , by no means , rich .
In fact , I was not even living comfortably … I was struggling to pay back thousands of dollars in credit card debt and student loans , spending way too much time figuring how who I was while at the same time trying to maintain a “ Me? No worries ” lifestyle .
But I digress …
This girl wanted to be treated like royalty .
We went to expensive dinners , we went away on expensive weekends , etc .
I even traded in my paid - off but still drivable Honda for a brand new leased Audi in order to impress her .
I acted like I could afford everything … and I could .
On credit .
And for the entire time we were together , I pretended that nothing was wrong and I was made of money .
I paid for everything and when the relationship was over , I paid even more handsomely .
My credit card debt had ballooned to way more than I owed before I met her and I was left holding the bag after a failed relationship .
The thing that I took away from this relationship was that I could no longer pretend to be living the high life while struggling just to live the low life .
I was no longer going to allow another person to make me feel like I needed more stuff , needed to make more money , or needed to support their lifestyle .
If someone did not like the way I lived my life and the amount of money that I made , then the relationship just would not only not work out ; it would not even get started in the first place .
So my Money Mistake for this Monday is allowing another person dictate my lifestyle , whether I could afford it or not .
Let this be a warning – it could happen to you !

How does consciousness evolve ?
How well do you understand the workings of the universe ?
Do you live in the present moment ?
There is NO way to intellectually understand how the universe works ; as a result , BEING is the only way to intimately connect to the source of understanding , to experience how the universe unfolds .
Now this may sound somewhat esoteric , but it is anything but .
Without being in sync with reality , with " what is " , there will always be incongruence .
Can you imagine telling someone what chocolate tastes like without having tasted it ?
And even when you have tasted it - look how difficult it is to explain what it tastes like to someone who has not .
Consciousness is like chocolate - only by truly tasting it can you know what it is .
Eating chocolate is a present moment experience ; it forces you to stay squarely in the moment , because without that , you miss it .
When you are in the past or the present you are in your head and always one step away from the action .
The action of life - the joy of life - comes from the heart and is always in the present moment .
But being present is not for the weak at heart .
Being present requires great bravery , a willingness to FEEL your life rather than think about it .
When you are willing to connect to your soft underbelly , that part of you that you keep hidden ( from yourself as well as the rest of the world ) - only then does being present have a chance .
Integrating the dark side as well as the light automatically makes your present and only by being totally and completely in the moment do you have an opportunity to " see " to the core to things .
This " seeing " is NOT an intellectual exercise but a state of being .
It is unequivocal , not up for debate .
It acknowledges the failures as well as successes , the valleys as well as the peaks , the losses as well as the wins .
It recognizes life 's wholeness - all of it - as perfection .
The ability to " observe " your life , to know on a gut level that you are always in the right place at the right time , and to know that every " mistake " is a step towards greater awareness and authenticity is how consciousness evolves .
The more present you are , the more you are aligned with the workings of the universe and more connected you are to the SOURCE .
Group Seeks Consumers ' Help in Enlisting Companies to Take " No - Spy Pledge "
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
NEW YORK -
The government is rapidly increasing its ability to monitor average Americans by tapping into the growing amount of consumer data being collected by the private sector , according to a major report released today by the American Civil Liberties Union .
" The U.S. security establishment is reaching deeper and deeper into our private lives by forcing the corporate sector to inform on the activities of individuals , " said Anthony D. Romero , Executive Director of the ACLU .
" The government has always recruited informers to help convict criminals , but today that recruitment is being computerized , automated , and used against innocent individuals on a massive scale that is unprecedented in the history of our nation . "
The release of the 38 - page report , entitled " The Surveillance - Industrial Complex : How the American Government is Conscripting Businesses and Individuals in the Construction of a Surveillance Society , " marks the launch of the ACLU 's Surveillance Campaign , which is designed to regain consumers ' personal privacy rights by mobilizing people to contact prominent companies - such as drugstore chains , insurance companies and retailers - to ask them to take a " no- spy pledge " to defend their customers ' privacy against government intrusion .
A list of suggested companies for consumers to contact is available online at www.aclu.org/privatize.
" An important step in regaining control of our personal privacy is to demand that businesses not acquiesce in being drafted into adjuncts of a surveillance state , " said Barry Steinhardt , Director of the ACLU 's Technology and Liberty Program , which produced the report .
" If a big company wo n't defend its customers ' privacy , then consumers should take their business to a company that will . "
The report makes the case that , across a broad variety of areas , the same dynamic of the " privatization of surveillance " is underway .
Different dimensions of this trend are examined in - depth in four separate sections of the report :
Recruiting Individuals .
Documents how individuals are being recruited to serve as " eyes and ears " for the authorities even after Congress rejected the infamous TIPS ( Terrorism Information and Prevention System ) program that would have recruited workers like cable repairmen to spy on their customers .
Recruiting Companies .
Examines how companies are pressured to voluntarily provide consumer information to the government ; the many ways security agencies can force companies to turn over sensitive information under federal laws such as the Patriot Act ; how the government is forcing companies to participate in watchlist programs and in systems for the automatic scrutiny of individuals ' financial transactions .
Mass Data Use , Public and Private .
Focuses on the government 's use of private data on a mass scale , either through data mining programs like the MATRIX state information - sharing program , or the purchase of information from private - sector data aggregators .
Pro-Surveillance Lobbying .
Looks at the flip side of the issue : how some companies are pushing the government to adopt surveillance technologies and programs based on private - sector data .
" Government security agencies all too often act on the false premise that they can stop terrorism by tracking information about everyone , while at the same time , private companies are increasingly collecting more information on their customers , " said Jay Stanley , Communications Director of the ACLU 's Technology and Liberty Program and the author of the report .
" Sometimes willingly , sometimes not , the private sector is playing a key role in the push toward a frightening new surveillance society . "
As part of the public awareness component of its Surveillance Campaign , the ACLU recently released an online video to dramatize how new technologies and weak privacy laws may over time be used to strip us of our privacy .
In the video , a pizza parlor uses its access to a wide variety of sensitive information to guide its treatment of a customer calling to order dinner .
To view the video , go to / pizza / index.html?orgid=EA071904&MX=1414&H=1 .
" The amount of direct surveillance that government security agencies can conduct , and the number of people they can hire , will always be limited , " said Stanley .
" But leveraging the private sector vastly expands the government 's capacity to invade our lives . "
The report ends with six conclusions , including the need for individuals to take action , the need for the legal system to catch up to a fast - changing reality , and the fact that mass surveillance is not only intrusive but also a poor way to fight terrorism .
" With this report we want to help people see beyond particular stories to grasp the big picture , " said Steinhardt .
" If we want to preserve the privacy Americans have always enjoyed , we need to act now . "
The report is available online at www.aclu.org/surveillance

THE DREAM AND THE REALITY
( compiled by Dee Finney )
6-28-2001
updated 11-17-05
Read the article written by k.t. Frankovich that appeared in Nexus Magazine .
Be aware though , this is a true story based on the Hurricane Andrew cover - up .
This is not for the weak hearted .
This is how FEMA and the cops really handle emergencies when the chips are down .
You will read about the RED / BLUE lists below : Somehow I managed to put up a page about this earlier on this topic .
RED LINE / BLUE LINE DREAM AND THE REALITY
I knew that the secret guns were trained on Madison , WI ( The capitol city of our state ) and these children were going to be used as hostages .
I was watching the other mothers who were n't able to find their children and rescue them before they were marched away to camp .
I helped to hold one mother up from collapsing .
She was devastated that her daughter had n't been seen .
It was a well kept secret but I had been chosen as mediator between sides between our country and the Overtakers .
The schools were being organized at this moment to march the children to government camps and take them away from their parents .
I managed to sneak up to the 20th street school where my youngest son was in 1st grade .
I spotted him and grabbed him by the arm and we rushed down the street together .
He said , " I 've been calling you all day , hoping you 'd come and get me . "
The men were huddled around the bars , not drinking but checking the stock market , worrying themselves sick to see if they had lost everything .
There were no longer stores along the main city streets , they were in clusters at intervals , like mini-malls .
There were big government offices everywhere .
Along 17th street , lawns were being reconstructed and I tried to assist but there was n't enough grass to go around .
It 's a two part movie , which originally was a 4 part mini series written for TV .
The video is shorter than the original version .
Apparently there 's a 90 - meter wide fragment heading for Dallas next , where Elliot and the astronomer 's father live .
When the astroid pieces finally do come down , it causes extreme destruction in Dallas as well and kill many , many people .
The chic 's astronomer friend from Boulder , Colorado calls again and says the bigger asteroid is heading for Earth too .
Michael Biehn 's drama scene falls between the two asteroids .
So everybody freaks out , knowing that this huge Earth - Killer asteroid is coming .
They formulate a plan , which involves everybody staying indoors and waiting it out while the US Air Force sends up three jets with lasers on them to blow up this four - mile - wide asteroid .
Little laser beams coming out of the nose - cones of F16 fighters managed to blow up this four - mile - diameter asteroid .
But instead of the asteroid being destroyed , it breaks up into fragments still headed toward the planet .
The next scene shows people on a rollercoaster , and a little asteroid piece blows up above them .
Looked like a big firecracker to me .
In the movie the director of FEMA is flying around on a helicopters rescuing people off of burning rooftopsl .
The astronomer , who also plays the mother of a son named Elliot ( not the same as in ET - The extraterrestrial ) discovers a bunch of asteroid fragments following a comet into the path of the Earth .
The comet passes nicely , but all these fragments will not .
There 's like ... two major asteroids heading toward the Earth , and so the chic and Biehn get together and figure out how to handle everything .
The smaller chunk comes in first , and they evacuate Kansas City and everything ... and the small chuck burns up ; leaving a small piece to come in and blow up a dam .
I looked for a movie review on ASTEROID , and could n't find anything positive on it .
I then came across a movie review which coincidentally was written on Aug. 11 , 1999 , the day of the big eclipse .
In Asteroid , starring Annabella Sciorra , Michael Biehn , Michael plays Jack , the director of FEMA ( Federal Emergency Management Agency ) .
FEMA is the agency belonging to the US Government that handles disasters and things like that -- like hurricane damage , tornado damage , taking care of the people in bombing disasters , and most oddly ... making sure the United States remains operational after a nuclear attack .
NOTE : A big coincidence occurred on 7-2-2001 .
While we were talking about FEMA and the water_coincidence page I had just done , this movie showed again .
Is this a subliminal warning ?
In a very short period of time , they also came out with Deep Impact and Armageddon .
This is not to mention that dire warnings were coming from NASA about close encounters with a large asteroid , and then they told us they would not be telling us in advance of these events because it would cause more deaths due to panic than to the event itself .
I think it 's time to talk about it again .
Read my dream and then peruse the facts below :
I used to have a subscription to the newspaper SPOTLIGHT when I lived in Wisconsin , and I was more into the conspiracy issues then , especially after the assassination of J.F.K. , after the deaths of R.F.K. and Martin Luther King , the WACO horror , Ruby Ridge , and then after the Okalahoma City bombing of the Murrah Building .
One can't help but think there is something wrong when these types of things occur .
However , I would toy with the idea , and then drop it again .
Then the movie ASTEROID came out and it showed FEMA taking all the people in the area where the meteor was going to come down to a large camp which was already set up , supposedly for that purpose .
We already know that every major city has places for emergencies where people can go in case of hurricanes , tornadoes , etc. , but camps is another story .
Huge numbers of people can be housed at a moments notice .

SUBJECT : Executive Orders APPLICABLE EXECUTIVE ORDERS
The following = Executive Orders= , now recorded in the Federal Register , and therefore accepted by Congress as the law of the land , can be put into effect at any time an emergency is declared : 10995 -- All communications media seized by the Federal Government .
10997-- Seizure of all electrical power , fuels , including gasoline and minerals .
10998-- Seizure of all food resources , farms and farm equipment .
10999 -- Seizure of all kinds of transportation , including your personal car , and control of all highways and seaports .
11000 -- Seizure of all civilians for work under Federal supervision .
11001 -- Federal takeover of all health , education and welfare .
11002 -- Postmaster General empowered to register every man , woman and child in the U.S.A .
11003 -- Seizure of all aircraft and airports by the Federal Government .
11004 -- Housing and Finance authority may shift population from one locality to another .
Complete integration .
11005 -- Seizure of railroads , inland waterways , and storage facilities .
11051-- The Director of the Office of Emergency Planning authorized to put Executive Orders into effect in " times of increased international tension or financial crisis " .
He is also to perform such additional functions as the President may direct .
" THESE EXECUTIVE ORDERS GROSSLY AND FLAGRANTLY VIOLATE ARTICLE 4 SECTION 4 OF THE CONSTITUTION OF THE UNITED STATES .
" THE UNITED STATES SHALL GUARANTEE TO EVERY STATE IN THIS UNION A REPUBLICAN FORM OF GOVERNMENT , AND SHALL PROTECT EACH OF THEM AGAINST INVASION ; AND ON APPLICATION OF THE LEGISLATURE , OR OF THE EXECUTIVE ( WHEN THE LEGISLATURE CANNOT BE CONVENED ) AGAINST DOMESTIC VIOLENCE . "
" REGIONAL GOVERNMENT IS NOT A REPRESENTATIVE REPUBLICAN FORM OF GOVERNMENT ! "
Stated simply : the dictatorial power of the Executive rests primarily on three basis : Executive Order 11490 , Executive Order 11647 , and the Planning , Programming , Budgeting System which is operated through the new and all - powerful Office of Management and Budget .
E. O. 11490 is a compilation of some 23 previous Executive Orders , signed by Nixon on Oct. 28 , 1969 , and outlining emergency functions which are to be performed by some 28 Executive Departments and Agencies whenever the President of the United States declares a national emergency ( as in defiance of an impeachment edict , for example ) .
Under the terms of E. O. 11490 , the President can declare that a national emergency exists and the Executive Branch can : * Take over all communications media * Seize all sources of power *
Take charge of all food resources * Control all highways and seaports * Seize all railroads , inland waterways , airports , storage facilities * Commandeer all civilians to work under federal supervision * Control all activities relating to health , education , and welfare * Shift any segment of the population from one locality to another *
Take over farms , ranches , timberized properties * Regulate the amount of your own money you may withdraw from your bank , or savings and loan institution
All of these and many more items are listed in 32 pages incorporating nearly 200,000 words , providing and absolute bureaucratic dictatorship whenever the President gives the word .
Executive Order 11647 provides the regional and local mechanisms and manpower for carrying out the provisions of E. O. 11490 .
Signed by Richard Nixon on Feb. 10 , 1972 , this Order sets up Ten Federal Regional Councils to govern Ten Federal Regions made up of the fifty still existing States of the Union .
WHERE IS FEMA LOCATED ?
Not far from the nation 's capital there is a large natural feature known as Mount Weather , located on Hwy .
601 , just outside the bucolic town of Berryville , VA .
Inside this mountain the FEMA develops its plans and collects information on US citizens while ensconced in what the FEMA euphemistically calls the " Special Facility " .
This facility is equipped with all the computer power and satellite uplinks necessary to control all the communications systems in our country and beyond .
The security measures are so stringent at Mount Weather that anyone entering is subject to searches for such contraband as cameras , note pads , or any other item capable of recording information such as its interior layout .
Although only a handful of insiders know exactly how big the facility is , those who have gotten a glimpse inside Mount Weather describe a huge underground city .
It is known that contained within the mountain are all the supplies necessary to keep the FEMA running for months without contact with the outside world .
Mount Weather contains a working duplicate of the Executive Branch of the Federal government , ready to swing into action at a moment 's notice .
Mount Weather personnel also maintain a database of information on U.S. citizens .
But relatively little is publicly known about this facility .
" Mount Weather is a virtually self - contained facility .
Aboveground , scattered across manicured lawns , are about a dozen buildings bristling with antennas and microwave relay systems .
An on - site sewage - treatment plant , with a 90,000 gal . - a- day capacity , and two tanks holding 250,000 gal .
of water could last some 200 people more than a month ; underground ponds hold additional water supplies .
Not far from the installation 's entry gate are a control tower and a helicopter pad .
The mountain 's real secrets are not visible at ground level . "
The mountain's " real secrets " are protected by warning signs , 10 foot - high chain link fences , razor wire , and armed guards .
Curious motorists and hikers on the Appalachian trail are relieved of their sketching pads and cameras and sent on their way .
Security is tight .
Mount Weather is the self - sustaining underground command center for the Federal Emergency Management Agency ( FEMA ) .
The facility is the operational center -- the hub -- of approximately 100 other Federal Relocation Centers , most of which are concentrated in Pennsylvania , West Virginia , Virginia , Maryland and North Carolina .
Together this network of underground facilities constitutes the backbone of America 's " Continuity of Government " program .
In the event of nuclear war , declaration of martial law , or other national emergency , the President , his cabinet and the rest of the Executive Branch would be " relocated " to Mount Weather .
What Does Congress Know about Mount Weather ?
According to the Senate Subcommittee on Constitutional Rights hearings in 1975 , Congress has almost no knowledge and no oversight -- budgetary or otherwise -- on Mount Weather .
Retired Air Force General Leslie W. Bray , in his testimony to the subcommittee , said " I am not at liberty to describe precisely what is the role and the mission and the capability that we have at Mount Weather , or at any other precise location . "
The underground city contains a parallel government - in - waiting : " High - level Governmental sources , speaking in the promise of strictest anonymity , stated that each of the Federal departments represented at Mount Weather is headed by a single person on whom is conferred the rank of a Cabinet - level official .
Protocol even demands that subordinates address them as ' Mr. Secretary . '
Each of the Mount Weather ' Cabinet members ' is apparently appointed by the White House and serves an indefinite term ... many through several Administrations ....
The facility attempts to duplicate the vital functions of the Executive branch of the Administration . "
The same source states : " As might be expected , there is also an Office of the Presidency at Mount Weather . "
The Federal Preparedness Agency ( precursor to FEMA ) apparently appoints a special staff to the Presidential section , which regularly receives top secret national security estimates and raw data from each of the Federal departments and agencies .
Play War Games
This is the main daily activity of the approximately 240 people who work at Mount Weather .
The games are intended to train the Mount Weather bureaucracy to managing a wide range of problems associated with both war and domestic political crises .
Decisions are made in the " Situation Room , " the base 's nerve center , located in the core of Mount Weather .
The Situation Room is the archetypal war room , with " charts , maps and whatever visuals may be needed " and " batteries of communications equipment connecting Mount Weather with the White House and ' Raven Rock ' -- the underground Pentagon sixty miles north of Washington -- as well as with almost every US military unit stationed around the globe .
All internal communications are conducted by closed - circuit color television ... senior officers and ' Cabinet members ' have two consoles recessed in the walls of their office .
Civil Crisis Management Mount Weather personnel study more than war scenarios .
Domestic " crises " are also tracked and watched , and there have been times when Mount Weather almost swung into action .
Officials who were at Mount Weather during the 1960s say the complex was actually prepared to assume certain governmental powers at the time of the 1961 Cuban missile crisis and the assassination of President Kennedy in 1963 .
The installation used the tools of its ' Civil Crisis Management ' program on a standby basis during the 1967 and 1968 urban riots and during a number of national antiwar demonstrations .
Studies conducted at Mount Weather involve the control and management of domestic political unrest where there are material shortages ( such as food riots ) or in strike situations where the FPA determines that there are industrial disruptions and other domestic resource crises .
According to Daniel J. Cronin , former assistant director for the FPA , Reconnaissance satellites , local and state police intelligence reports , and Federal law enforcement agencies are just a few of the resources available to the FPA [ now FEMA ] for information gathering .
" We try to monitor situations and get to them before they become emergencies , " Cronin said .
" No expense is spared in the monitoring program . "
What is Mount Weather 's Ultimate Purpose ?
We have seen that Mount Weather contains an unelected , parallel " government - in - waiting " ready to take control of the United States upon word from the President or his successor .
The facility contains a massive database of information on U.S. citizens which is operated with no safeguards or accountability .
Ostensibly , this expensive hub of America 's network of sub- terran bases was designed to preserve our form of government during a nuclear holocaust .
Mount Weather is not simply a Cold War holdover .
Information on command and control strategies during national emergencies have largely been withheld from the American public .
Executive Order 11051 , signed by President Kennedy on October 2 , 1962 , states that " national preparedness must be achieved ... as may be required to deal with increases in international tension with limited war , or with general war including attack upon the United States . "
Executive Order 11490 , drafted by Gen. George A Lincoln ( former director for the Office of Emergency Preparedness , the FPA 's predecessor ) and signed by President Nixon in October 1969 , tells a different story .
EO 11490 , which superceded Kennedy 's EO 11051 , begins , " Whereas our national security is dependent upon our ability to assure continuity of government , at every level , in any national emergency type situation that might conceivably confront the nation ... "
Nixon 's order makes no reference to " war , " " imminent attack , " or " general war . "
These quantifiers are replaced by an extremely vague " national emergency type situation " that " might conceivably " interfere with the workings of the national power structure .
Furthermore , there is no publicly known Executive Order outlining the restoration of the Constitution after a national emergency has ended .
Unless the parallel government at Mount Weather does not decide out of the goodness of its heart to return power to Constitutional authority , the United States could experience a coup d'etat posing as a national emergency .
Mount Weather facility is buried in secrecy .
Public awareness of the facility and its purpose would raise serious questions about who holds the reins of power in this country .
The Constitution states that those reins lie in the hands of the people , but the very existence of Mount Weather suggests an entirely different reality .
As long as Mount Weather exists , these questions will remain .
This is G o o g l e's cache of http://www.abovetopsecret.com/pages/camps.html.
There over 600 prison camps in the United States , all fully operational and ready to receive prisoners .
They are all staffed and even surrounded by full - time guards , but they are all empty .
These camps are to be operated by FEMA ( Federal Emergency Management Agency ) should Martial Law need to be implemented in the United States .
The Rex 84 Program was established on the reasoning that if a mass exodus of illegal aliens crossed the Mexican / US border , they would be quickly rounded up and detained in detention centers by FEMA .
Rex 84 allowed many military bases to be closed down and to be turned into prisons .
Operation Cable Splicer and Garden Plot are the two sub programs which will be implemented once the Rex 84 program is initiated for its proper purpose .
Garden Plot is the program to control the population .
Cable Splicer is the program for an orderly takeover of the state and local governments by the federal government .
FEMA is the executive arm of the coming police state and thus will head up all operations .
The Presidential Executive Orders already listed on the Federal Register also are part of the legal framework for this operation .
The camps all have railroad facilities as well as roads leading to and from the detention facilities .
Many also have an airport nearby .
The majority of the camps can house a population of 20,000 prisoners .
Currently , the largest of these facilities is just outside of Fairbanks , Alaska .
The Alaskan facility is a massive mental health facility and can hold approximately 2 million people .
A person named Terry Kings wrote an article on his discoveries of camps located in southern California .
His findings are as follows :
Over the last couple months several of us have investigated three soon - to - be prison camps in the Southern California area .
We had heard about these sites and wanted to see them for ourselves .
The first one we observed was in Palmdale , California .
It is not operating as a prison at the moment but is masquerading as part of a water facility .
Now why would there be a facility of this nature out in the middle of nowhere with absolutely no prisoners ?
The fences that run for miles around this large facility all point inward , and there are large mounds of dirt and dry moat surrounding the central area so the inside area is not visible from the road .
There are 3 large loading docks facing the entrance that can be observed from the road .
What are these massive docks going to be loading ?
We observed white vans patrolling the area and one came out and greeted us with a friendly wave and followed us until we had driven safely beyond the area .
What would have happened had we decided to enter the open gate or ask questions ?
This facility is across the street from the Palmdale Water Department .
The area around the Water Department has fences pointing outward , to keep people out of this dangerous area so as not to drown .
Yet , across the street , the fences all point inward .
Why ?
To keep people in ?
What people ?
Who are going to be its occupants ?
There are also signs posted every 50 feet stating : State of California Trespassing Loitering Forbidden By Law Section 555 California Penal Code .
The sign at the entrance says : Pearblossom Operations and Maintenance Subcenter Receiving Department , 34534 116th Street East .
There is also a guard shack located at the entrance .
We didnt venture into this facility , but did circle around it to see if there was anything else visible from the road .
We saw miles of fences with the top points all directed inward .
There is a railroad track that runs next to the perimeter of this fenced area .
The loading docks are large enough to hold railroad cars .
I wonder what they are planning for this facility ?
They could easily fit 100,000 people in this area .
And who would the occupants be ?
Another site is located in Brand Park in Glendale .
There are newly constructed fences ( all outfitted with new wiring that point inward ) .
The fences surround a dry reservoir .
There are also new buildings situated in the area .
We questioned the idea that there were four armed military personnel walking the park .
Since when does a public park need armed guards ?
A third site visited was in the San Fernando Valley , adjacent to the Water District .
Again , the area around the actual Water District had fences logically pointing out ( to keep people out of the dangerous area ) .
And the rest of the adjacent area which went on for several miles was ringed with fences and barbed wire facing inward ( to keep what or who in ? )
Also , interesting was the fact that the addition to the tops of the fences were fairly new as to not even contain any sign of rust on them .
Within the grounds was a huge building that the guard said was a training range for policemen .
There were newly constructed roads , new gray military looking buildings , and a landing strip .
For what ?
Police cars were constantly patrolling the several mile perimeter of the area .
From the parking lot of the Odyssey Restaurant a better view could be taken of the area that was hidden from site from the highway .
There was an area that contained about 100 black boxes that looked like railroad cars .
We had heard that loads of railroad cars have been manufactured in Oregon outfitted with shackles .
Would these be of that nature ?
From our position it was hard to determine .
In searching the Internet , I have discovered that there are about 600 of these prison sites around the country ( and more literally popping up overnight do they work all night ) .
They are manned , but yet do not contain prisoners .
Why do they need all these non-operating prisons ?
What are they waiting for ?
We continuously hear that our current prisons are overcrowded and they are releasing prisoners because of this situation .
But what about all these facilities ?
What are they really for ?
Why are there armed guards yet no one to protect themselves against ?
And what is going to be the kick - off point to put these facilities into operation ?
What would bring about a situation that would call into effect the need for these new prison facilities ?
A man -made or natural catastrophe ?
An earthquake , panic due to Y2 K , a massive poisoning , a panic of such dimensions to cause nationwide panic ?
Once a major disaster occurs ( whether it is a real event or manufactured event does not matter ) Martial Law is hurriedly put in place and we are all in the hands of the government agencies ( FEMA ) who thus portray themselves as our protectors .
Yet what happens when we question those in authority and how they are taking away all of our freedoms ?
Will we be the ones detained in these camp sites ?
And who are they going to round up ?
Those with guns ?
Those who ask questions ?
Those that want to know whats really going on ?
Does that include any of us ?
The seekers of truth ?
When first coming across this information I was in a state of total denial .
How could this be ?
I believed our country was free , and always felt a sense of comfort in knowing that as long as we didnt hurt others in observing our freedom we were left to ourselves .
Ideally we treated everyone with respect and honored their uniqueness and hoped that others did likewise .
It took an intensive year of searching into the hidden politics to discover that we are as free as we believe we are .
If we are in denial , we dont see the signs that are staring at us , but keep our minds turned off and busy with all the mundane affairs of daily life .
We just dont care enough to find out the real truth , and settle for the hand - fed stories that come our way over the major media sources television , radio , newspaper , and magazines .
But its too late to turn back to the days of blindfolds and hiding our heads in the sand because the reality is becoming very clear .
The time is fast approaching when we will be the ones asking " What happened to our freedom ?
To our free speech ?
To our right to protect ourselves and our family ?
To think as an individual ?
To express ourselves in whatever way we wish ? "
Once we challenge that freedom we find out how free we really are .
How many are willing to take up that challenge ?
Very few indeed , otherwise we wouldnt find ourselves in the situation that we are in at the present time .
We wouldnt have let things progress and get out of the hands of the public and into the hands of those that seek to keep us under their control no matter what it takes , and that includes the use of force and detainment for those that ask the wrong questions .
Will asking questions be outlawed next ?
Several instances have recently been reported where those that were asking questions that came too near the untold truth ( the cover up ) were removed from the press conferences and from the publics ear .
Also , those that wanted to speak to the press were detained and either imprisoned , locked in a psychiatric hospital , slaughtered ( through make - believe suicides ) or discredited .
Why are we all in denial over these possibilities ?
Didnt we hear about prison camps in Germany , and even in the United States during World War II ?
Japanese individuals were rounded up and placed in determent camps during the duration of the War .
Where was their freedom ?
You dont think it could happen to you ?
Obviously those rounded up and killed didnt think it could happen to them either .
How could decent people have witnessed such atrocities and still said nothing ?
Are we going to do the same here as they cart off one by one those individuals who are taking a stand for the rights of the citizens as they expose the truth happening behind the scenes ?
Are we all going to sit there and wonder what happened to this country of ours ?
Where did we go wrong ?
How could we let it happen ?
From : http://www.geocities.com/SouthBeach/Lagoon/1780/concentration.html
There are over 100 primary and secondary concentration camps across the US .
Each houses about 20,000 prisoners .
Currently the largest of these facilities is the just outside of Fairbanks , Alaska .
The Alaskan facility is a gigantic mental health facility and can hold approximately 2 million people .
The majority of these facilities have no prisoners but are currently staffed by military personal .
The camps all have have railroad facilities , as well as roads , coming and going out of them , to get there .
Also quite a few are closed down military bases and are adjacent to airport facilities .
The Rex 84 program is documented in the public record and civilian internment camps were publically admitted by Congressman Henry Gonzales in 1997 .
With the influx of of foreign military equipment into the United States as well as the Executive Orders registered on the Federal Register it would be impudent to ignore this information .

Gulag America ( New World Order's Concentration Camp Program )
During the 1950's , the elitists planning for world government made plans to use occupation forces in every country that did not submit to their greedy , arrogant ambitions .
Their plan called for using Chinese troops in America .
This fact is documented by Dr. Dennis Cuddy in his book , Secret Records Revealed .
It is also ocumented by Willard Cantelon in his book , Money Master of the World .
Now that American soldiers have been used in Kuwait , Somalia , Haiti , Bosnia , and Kosovo , a precedent has been set to bring the red Chinese here .
The UN could justify such an action if the Black Muslims instigate a race war .
I expect this scenario if the Democrats loose the White House and Congress in the 2000 elections .
Comrade Clinton could not be slicker in making himself Commandant of Gulag America .
In 1997 , there were already 43 concentrations camps ready to imprison Christians and other patriotic people , who want to be governed by the Constitution .
If the Clintons ' hatred for Christians and other constitutionalists seems incredible to you , then ask yourself why the White House instructed the FBI this year to regard us as terrorists .
Under this guise , Comrade Clinton can raid the homes of innocent saints and patriots , take them away to never be seen again as in Nazi Germany , and the media will make everyone think they were criminals .
In 1997 , 20 more concentration camps were under constrction .
Their locations are revealed on the link above , as excerpted from Jim Keith 's book , Black Helicopters II :
From : http://users.rcn.com/andrew2265/deathcamps.html
- Photos are missing on this site STALAG U.S.A .
In the spring of 1997 , Professor Ian Stewart , met with " Mr. Sea " [ Al Cuppet ] to discuss what he has learned first - hand about the coming persecution at the hands of the New World Order operatives .
With a seven - inch thick portfolio filled with photographs , news articles , correspondence , etc. , Mr. Sea revealed disturbing information about New World Order efforts to destroy and enslave America .
The following are some of Mr. Sea 's comments .
But first , let 's take a look at the man who made the comments .
Mr. Sea , a committed Christian , is a former inspector for the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the Department of Defense , with 31 years of federal service in the military , nine with the Department of Defense , including two years with the Air Staff .
He 's a holder of the Bronze Star , the Purple Heart , the Defense Meritorious Service Medal , three awards of the Joint Service Medal , all of the Vietnamese awards , as well as the Joint Meritorious Unit Medal .
When he retired a few years ago , he was awarded the Secretary of Defense Civilian Service Medal .
He 's been around the world to 31 countries on four continents , and speaks five languages .
Mr. Sea spoke of the coming American Holocaust of the Government 's plans for dealing with the non-New World Orderites .
He spoke of the infrastructure that has already been set up to incarcerate and execute Americans , and the locations of the facilities that will be used for these purposes -- all with photographs , leaving little to the imagination .
An interview with Mr. Sea regarding New World Order plans for the U.S. and its citizens " The infrastructure is set up .
There are at least 130 concentration camps , quietly modified facilities which have sprung up and continue to spring up across the country , seemingly devoid of activity , yet requiring strange accoutrements such as barbed wire - topped fencing ( with the tops turned inward ) and helicopter wind socks .
Most have good logistical supportability , with major highways and railroad transport facilities adjacent to the sites .
" These facilities , many in remote areas across our country , are set up to become concentration / detention camps , complete with gas chambers , for resisters and dissidents .
Generally speaking , they 're set up for dissenters who will not go along with the New World Order .
The " resisters " are gun owners who refuse to give up their weapons ; the " dissidents " are Christians , Patriots and Constitutionalists .
These camps are set up .
I 've seen many of them .
" On August 6 , 1994 , I toured the Amtrak Railcar Repair Facility at Beech Grove , Indianapolis , Indiana .
There are at least ten maintenance barns at this facility , covering 129 acres , with two separate fences with the tops leaning inward .
The windows of several buildings have been bricked up .
Hence , you have three levels of security for Amtrak repair barns !
" There are three helicopter 25 - knot aviation wind socks ( which are n't the correct ones to use for chemical spills which require 10 - knot wind socks ) .
There are high security NSA - style people turnstiles , and high intensity / security lighting for 24 - hour operation .
The box car ( gas chamber ) building fence is marked with special " RED / BLUE Zone " signs [ visible in the photo ] .
This corresponds to the " mission " of the RED / BLUE Lists which surfaced in June and July of 1996 .
" Under martial law , this will become a death camp .
They 're only going to handle category one and two ( RED and BLUE ) people there .
This box car facility will be used for execution .
" One of the barns is large enough to put four box cars into .
There are powered vents on the top of the barn to vent the gas out of the building after the box cars have been fumigated .
All of the buildings have newly installed six - inch gas pipes and furnaces installed in all " railroad barns . "
" Since the photo was taken in August 1994 , FEMA has allocated $ 6 million to make the walls and roofs of the buildings " airtight . "
Under martial law , this facility could be immediately used as an SS - style " termination " gas chamber .
" On January 27 , 1995 , The Indianapolis News ran an article titled , " Amtrak Lays off 212 at Beech Grove : 170 Lose Jobs at Maintenance Center Today . "
Why perform $ 6 million worth of renovations , and then lay off 212 people ?
Because the people doing the final executions will not be Americans .
Thus , the " slots " of the 212 will be filled with non-Americans .
" They 'll hire foreigners for this " cappo " task .
Cappo ( " chief " in Italian ) was the title of the trustee prisoners who actually killed many Jews for the SS butchers at Dachau , and at other Nazi crematoria across Europe .
" The news article also said , " . . . hopes the yard may be able to solicit work repairing private train cars , and perhaps subway cars from Washington , DC , or other urban areas . "
The repairing of private trains is a dead giveaway to death cars !
" The article went on to say , " Late last year , Congress ordered Amtrak to spend at least $ 5.9 million patching holes in the roof and fixing masonry on the walls of the giant machine sheds at Beech Grove . "
These buildings have been " sealed . "
They 're airtight .
The facility is constructed to allow gas to be blown into all the buildings via the newly installed , two - story , hot air heating furnaces . "
Next , Mr. Sea elaborated on the two categories , the RED and BLUE Lists , and what they mean : " The RED List is for pick - up and execution before unobtrusive preparations for martial law are initiated .
The BLUE List is also for execution , but at a later date within six weeks of martial law declaration .
There are no " re-education " plans for either category -- just execution .
" When you get picked up on a RED pick - up , they 'll take you from your home at night -- probably around 4 a.m. -- and put you in a black van , then drive you to a helicopter waiting to fly you to an intermediate point .
There , you 'll be loaded onto a big 64 - passenger CH - 47 Chinook helicopter -- all black , unmarked and illegally operating under the Treaty on Open Skies .
" Then they 'll fly you to one of 38 cities where you 'll board a 747 , 737 , or 727 .
" You may be taken straight to a temporary detention facility .
When you 're RED listed , you 'll be taken to a red camp .
Then you 'll be executed .
" At some point , martial law will be declared .
( Martial law is when the writ of Habeas Corpus -- to have a trial by jury -- is suspended .
Instead of going to the judge , you go straight to jail for a limited time . )
I suspect there will be a major outage , or some other crisis which will be the reason to declare martial law .
At this point , the BLUE listed people will be picked up .
At that time , the country will be regionalized into ten regions , which are already designated by FEMA .
" Be advised that it has been proven ( in Wyoming and at least one other location ) that the black choppers have state - of - the - art radio ( RF ) frequency wideband jammers , and can jam cell phones and CBs while they 're executing black operations missions ( i.e. , in your area ) .
This means that your cell phone could be jammed just before and / or during any action against you .
" In June of 1996 , an FBI agent got hold of the Region Three BLUE List ( from a CIA agent ) , and found his own name on it , and those of several others he knew in Virginia .
The Regional BLUE List stated that the names on the BLUE List would be picked up " within six weeks of the actual martial law declaration . "
" This parallels the Nazi RED / BLUE List policy almost to the letter .
The parallel Nazi plan was published by Heinz Hohne in his 1966 book , The Story of the Nazi SS : The Order of the Death 's Head .
" People say , " It wo n't work . "
But it will work if the 300,000 Soviet troops which are ALREADY HERE can get the guns .
The name of the game is to blackball the people to get the guns . . . make the militia look bad , make guns look bad , make everybody give up their guns .
Once they get your gun , they 've got you , UNLESS you 've got the angel of the Lord at your door .
" The ones doing all of this are operating out of the highest places in the Federal Government .
They 're cooperating with " spirit guides and mediums " and using astrology and numerology .
The spirit guides are telling them what to do , and the entire thing is being orchestrated at the highest spiritual levels .
Every base has been covered .
They 've thought of everything .
" If you notice , they often do things on the 13th of the month .
Mr. Clinton does a lot of things on the 13th .
On September 13 , 1993 , the brokered Israeli- PLO peace accord was signed .
He waited 14 days , until September 13 , 1994 to sign the Crime Bill .
On June 13 , 1995 , he stated he'd veto the national debt authorization ceiling .
On November 13 , he did veto it .
On January 13 , 1996 , he made a speech to Bosnia .
" There will be an interim of probably just days from the time they launch the RED List , to the declaration of martial law when they 'll start coming after those on the BLUE List .
It 'll work the same way it did with the Nazis who had a list of people to pick up , on June 30 , 1934 , before they declared their " mobilization . "
" It 's the same blueprint being used because it 's the same spirit leading the Fourth Reich as led the Third Reich .
In Germany , they used trains , here it will be helicopters and 747s .
" When Hitler was villainizing the Jews , he hired thugs and dressed them in black uniforms .
He was building concentration camps and setting up a transport system .
In this country , they 're now in the process of villainizing Christians , Patriots , Constitutionalists , and outspoken talk - show hosts , etc .
" Who will be doing the actual picking up ?
Foreign " cops " ( United Nations Internal Security Forces ) .
Over 30 foreign military bases under the United Nations flag are already set up in the US . , all with the approval of special appointees in high Federal positions .
These bases are already manned with over ONE MILLION troops from Russia , Poland , Germany , Belgium , Turkey , Great Britain , Nicaragua , and Asian countries .
" Why are they here ?
Because unlike our own troops -- many of which along with the Guard and Reserve of 24 states are being deployed overseas - - will have no qualms about firing on U.S. citizens when the time comes .
" There are more than 2,000 Russian tanks , military trucks and chemical warfare vehicles just outside Gulfport , Mississippi .
They began arriving in January of 1994 .
" There are 180 foreign troops at Fort Reilly which was confirmed to me by a Brigadier General .
There are 300 who came into the Birmingham , Alabama airport on a big white Russian cargo plane on December 13 , 1995 .
" As of 1995 , there were 10,000 plus foreign troops at Fort Chafee , Arkansas reportedly making preparations for 20,000 " detainees . "
" Also in 1995 at Fort Polk , Louisiana ( U.S. Army Post ) , Russian and Eastern European troops were deployed under the U.N. flag .
[ When questioned about this , the legislative aide of the congressman who resides over Fort Polk , stated , " Yes , they were there undertaking broad , joint training exercises .
And , yes , the U.N. flag was flying .
There may still be some there today . " ]
" At the Aberdeen Proving Grounds , there are many Russian tanks .
One of the NCOs told his father that he'd been maintaining them .
" This is going on all over the country .
German troops are known to be at Holloman Air Force Base in New Mexico , Wright - Patterson Air Force Base in Ohio , and Fort Hood , Texas .
Chinese troops are known to be at the Long Beach Naval Station in California .
" There 's not going to be some future event when the invading troops are going to show up .
They 're already here !
When martial law is implemented , these foreign U.N. troops will be policing our country , carrying out the plans of the New World Order . "

Short excerpt posted here under applicable copyright laws [ Oliver ]
North managed to network himself into the highest levels of the CIA and power centers around the world .
There he lied and boastfully ignored the constitutional process , Bradlee writes .
Yet more terrifying is the plan hatched by North and other Reagan people in the Federal Emergency Manpower Agency ( FEMA ) : A blueprint for the military takeover of the United States .
The plan called for FEMA to become ``emergency czar '' in the event of a national emergency such as nuclear war or an American invasion of a foreign nation .
FEMA would also be a buffer between the president and his cabinet and other civilian agencies , and would have broad powers to appoint military commanders and run state and local governments .
Finally , it would have the authority to order suspect aliens into concentration camps and seize their property .
When then - Attorney General William French Smith got wind of the plan , he killed it .
After Smith left the administration , North and his FEMA cronies came up with the Defense Resource Act , designed to suspendend the First Amendment by imposing censorship and banning strikes .
Where was it all heading ?
The book 's answer : ``REX - 84 Bravo , a National Security Decision Directive 52 that would become operative with the president 's declaration of a state of national emergency concurrent with a mythical U.S. military invasion of an unspecified Central American country , presumably Nicaragua . ''
Bradlee writes that the Rex exercise was designed to test FEMA 's readiness to assume authority over the Department of Defense , the National Guard in all 50 states , and ``a number of state defense forces to be established by state legislatures . ''
The military would then be ``deputized , '' thus making an end run around federal law forbidding military involvement in domestic law enforcement .
Rex , which ran concurrently with the first annual U.S. show of force in Honduras in April 1984 , was also designed to test FEMA 's ability to round up 400,000 undocumented Central American aliens in the United States and its ability to distribute hundreds of tons of small arms to ``state defense forces . ''
Incredibly , REX 84 was similar to a plan secretly adopted by Reagan while governor of California .
His two top henchmen then were Edwin Meese , who recently resigned as U.S. attorney general , and Louis Guiffrida , the FEMA director in 1984 .
If the review makes you nervous , you should read the book !

Reagan Orders Concentration Camps
Mass detention facilities -- otherwise known as concentration camps -- are being set up at a number of major U.S. military installations on the secret orders of President Ronald Reagan .
The SPOTLIGHT has learned that on April 5 the White House issued a highly classified National Security Decision Directive ( NSDD ) which sets forth urgent instructions for the " activation " of 10 huge prison camps at key defense commands located across the nation .
Less than 24 hours before this edition went to press , on April 11 , The SPOTLIGHT received information from two trustworthy confidential sources -- patriotic career Army officers -- stationed at Ft. Benning , Georgia , and Ft. Chaffee , Arkansas , revealing that preparations were being set in motion for an unprecedented roundup of aliens and " sercurity suspects " coast to coast .
According to these sources , the primary goal of the vast police operation , codenamed " Rex 84 , " is to detain and deport illegal immigrants .
But these sources say " Rex 84 " has another , even more closely guarded and carefully orchestrated objective :
To apply so - called " C&C " ( " capture and custody " ) measures against political opponents , resisters or even outspoken critics whom the administration considers " dangerous . "
According to the information obtained -- and substantially confirmed -- by The SPOTLIGHT , the four principal civilian concentration camps to be established under the " Rex 84 " program will be located at Ft. Chaffee , Arkansas ; Ft. Drum , New York ; Ft. Indian Gap , Pennsylvania and at Camp A.P. Hill in Virginia .
Each one of these camps is being laid out to hold 25,000 civilian prisoners under the guard of American troops .
Additional emergency custodial facilities are being readied at Oakdale , California ( reportedly for 15,000 detainees ) and at Eglin Air Force Base in southern Florida , at Vandenberg AFB in California , at Ft. McCoy , Wisconsin ; Ft. Benning , Georgia ; Ft. Huachuca , Arizona ; and finally at the southern Justice Department detention and interrogation center known as Camp Krome near Miami , Florida .
A major national task force of federal intelligence and law - enforcement agencies -- including the FBI , the CIA , U.S. marshals , the Immigration and Naturalization Service , Customs , Coast Guard , and so forth -- will join with local and state police in massive roundups to haul in lists of suspects who will fill these improvised stockades .
" The first roundup - - and the publicly announced one -- will be of illegal aliens and refugees , " a military source told The SPOTLIGHT .
" But under the secret provisions of ' Rex 84 ' there will be also broad arrests of security suspects , who can be held in these centers , under this emergency order , whether they 're U.S. citizens or not . "
Americans whom the administration suspects of belonging to so - called " violence - prone " groups , or of " supporting " such groups -- which may mean only that a citizen subscribes to the wrong newsletter -- may find themselves hauled in with hordes of illegal immigrants if the bureaucrats find them " dangerous . "
Suspected or " potential " terrorists , subversives and draft resisters may eventually also find themselves caught in the broad " Rex 84 " net , according to these sources .
Another category of anti-bureaucratic activists which may be bound for administrative detention under this directive is that of " major , organized tax resisters , " one source close to the program has told The SPOTLIGHT .
This informant --a Pentagon policy analyst assigned to the National Security Council ( NSC ) in the White House - - has identified Kenneth de Graffenreid , a special assistant to President Reagan , as the NSC official temporarily in charge of coordinating the preparatory phase of " Rex 84 . "
Not a single source interviewed by The SPOTLIGHT could cite a Constitutional or legal precedent for such a staggering mass roundup of civilians by American authorities in peacetime .
The nearest analogy provided by one expert emerged from the security sweeps ordered by the Austrian government of Chancellor Engelbert Dollfuss in the late 1930s .
Prefiguring " Rex 84 , " these crackdowns were officially targeted at " illegal aliens " -- that is , the many German - born residents of Austria whom the Dollfuss government suspected of being sympathetic to the National Socialist government of Adolf Hitler .
But the Austrian authorities ' aim soon shifted to their own citizenry .
They began tossing into camps like the giant Mollersdorf Center tens of thousands of Austrians whom the regime considered opponents or " subversives " -- i.e. , adherents of the banned National Socialist Party .
What criteria will be used in deciding who's " dangerous " and who is n't ?
Will it be based on the " hate list , " drawn up by the Anti-Defamation League ( ADL ) of B'nai B'rith ( SPOTLIGHT , Jan. 4 -11 , 1982 ; March 28 , 1983 and others ) ?
In 1980 , the United States Commission on Civil Rights ( USCCR ) signed a contract with the ADL to prepare a report for the USCCR on " hate " groups in America .
For $ 20,000 in taxpayer money , the ADL produced a report that focused on groups that support the Constitution .
The report was completed , submitted to and accepted by the USCCR .
But , following standard procedure , the commission sent portions of the report to various groups mentioned , soliciting comments .
The responses were scathing , and the groups did not stop at letting the USCCR know their feelings , but wrote their elected representatives as well .
As a result of the responses from groups mentioned , and inquiries from Capitol Hill , the USCCR decided not to publish and disseminate the ADL - written report .
But in early 1983 , the ADL came out with its own report , which was a re-write of the report submitted to the USCCR .
Interestingly , the report carries no mention of the Jewish Defense League , best known for perpetrating violence against those with whom it disagrees .
In response to an inquiry by a SPOTLIGHT reporter , Robert Blair , a spokesman for the Federal Emergency Management Agency ( FEMA ) , admitted that " Rex 84 " was the designation of a " classified project " initiated only a week before our inquiry .
But Blair denied any knowledge of planned mass arrests .
" I 'm not aware of anyone having been detained , " he told The SPOTLIGHT .
" What you have ( learned ) may have been generated at a lower level or staff level - - it 's all mixed up . "
But other sources confirmed that " Rex 84 " was " the secret appendix " -- as one official put it , asking not to be named -- of a series of executive orders concerning emergency preparedness and national security being issued by the White House .
The first phase of what is described as a complete revision of emergency and security preparations by the Reagan administration was marked on April 3 with the promulgation of Executive Order 12473 , detailing the reorganization and federal control of national telecommunications systems in case of a major national emergency .

STILL THINK IT'S SCIENCE - FICTION ?
Well , read on ... ( as posted in an egroup mailing list ) From : william Monday , August 02 , 1999 Subject : specifics of camps GOVERNMENT AGENCIES COMPILE HUGE DATA BASE American Citizens Will Become Slaves Of The New World Order Concentration Camps Located Throughout USA .
Since 1985 , the IRS has been compiling an enormous data bank of information on all Americans and by 1991 that project was virtually complete .
A computer profile now exists on virtually every American family and individual , enabling the federal government to monitor virtually all of your activities , to trace , track , and perhaps eventually directly assess your bank accounts based on your computerized financial profile , electronically debiting your bank account for the taxes due .
NOTE : The government can take money out of your account without your knowledge any time they please already .
It has happened to Dee and Joe and other friends already .
The completion of the data base now makes it possible for numerous federal agencies to watch and control you from the cradle to the grave .
If this sounds a lot like George Orwell 's 1984 , Nicolia Ceaucescu 's Romania , Hitler 's Third Reich or Gorbachev's or Deng Xiaoping 's communist " paradises " - it is because they are identical , having been engineered by the same people !
The New World Order / New
Age government of the future will be able to watch and control its " subjects " more completely and efficiently than any totalitarian power in the past .
The computer will help them do it !
As an example of the kind of people - tracking information now being amassed on computers by the federal government , we present the following information provided by an employee of one large government agency charged with tracking and monitoring Americans and their finances :
" We now have available to us a new source of background information called METRONET which provides information on over 111 million people in 80 million households across the country .
Not only does it eliminate the need for time - consuming progressive manual searches since ATLAS was originally purchased from METRONET by the credit bureau , it also allows for the following variety of searches : " " PHONE SEARCH - provides a complete name and address report which is provided in accordance with US Postal Service standards .
As mentioned above , it is the same as ATLAS except that the record search can continue further once the name and address of the subject have been determined .
" ADDRESS SEARCH - requires that the Zip Code , street address and last name be entered in order to verify an address and receive the subject 's current phone number .
If it is a single family dwelling and your subject has moved , METRONET lists the current resident .
" HOUSEHOLD PROFILES - provides the time at current residence , type of dwelling , the subject 's age and year of birth .
It also provides the names , ages and year of birth of up to four additional family members .
" NEIGHBOR SEARCH - requires only the address to obtain details on up to 30 neighbors at new or old addresses .
These details include names , addresses , phone numbers , dwelling types and length of residence .
It also provides the current resident at the subject 's last - known address .
" CHANGE OF ADDRESS ALERT - automatically searches the US Postal Service 's National Change of Address files which is updated every two weeks .
With 20 % of the population moving to a new residence annually and the fact that 30 % of these people never notify the postal service of their new address , METRONET also checks for any change of address that a subject has provided to a publisher or marketing company to make sure that their magazines or other products will be forwarded .
" STREET NAME SCANNING helps obtain the correct street name abbreviations by checking an alphabetical table of all street names in any given Zip Code that begins with a specified letter .
" SURNAME SEARCH - allows the investigator to search an entire geographic region ( i.e. , state , county , city , zip codes etc. ) when the only information known is the last name of the subject . "

THE HIDDEN SIDE OF FINCEN FINANCIAL NETWORK : THE FINANCIAL CRIME ENFORCEMENT NETWORK
As part of the thrust to monitor and control the American people , the Bush Administration has established the financial crime center ( FINCEN ) in Arlington , VA whereby , through the use of sophisticated computers , the federal government has combined more than 100 data bases on bank records , criminal suspects , driving records , census data , and myriads of business and financial activities of million of honest law abiding citizens .
FINCEN is the largest government run artificial - intelligence data base ever established .
Fincen has over 200 employees from the IRS , the FBI , the Secret Service , and the FDIC and works closely with the BATF , the CIA , and the Defense Intelligence Agency .
Fincen acts as a collection point , clearing and distribution center of computerized data for virtually all other government agencies .
Data which it receives and redistributes comes from : bank deposits , Fed bank reports , comptroller of the currency bank reports , FDIC bank reports , census income figures , Customs monetary reports , Secret Service credit reports , and FBI and DEA drug data .
FINCEN currently has access to over 35 financial data bases and they will create another 100 , including computerized land records , real estate records , credit reports , CTRs , Form 8300 , bank reports , etc .
The models , data , financial patterns , and individual names generated by Fincen are being shared with the IRS , its Criminal Investigation Division , and state and local governments .
Before a recent amendment to the " Right to Financial Privacy Act " passed , these activities were illegal .
Virtually all of the activities of Fincen violate the U.S. Constitution 's 4th Amendment guarantee of the right to privacy .
FINCEN and U.S. government officials admit that Fincen is a trial run for a world system of financial tracking , surveillance and control .
...( McAlvany Intelligence Advisor ) .
THE FINCEN FINANCIAL MENACE : Ceaucescu would be impressed with the latest accomplishment of the U.S. government 's cash Securitate , the largest government - run artificial intelligence data base ever established .
The feds admit that they want all bank employees to function as virtual spies for the government .
If they refuse to treat their customers like potential criminals , they will be punished .
The people pushing FINCEN in the Bush Administration ( were ) William Bennett , Attorney General Richard Thornburgh , and Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady .
All three see Fincen as the key to the war on drugs , the war against cash , and the war against financial privacy .
The director of Fincen ( was ) Brian M. Bruh , a 24 - year IRS man .

FINCEN MILITARY HIDDEN SIDE :
The FINCEN MISSION is a United Nations / United States Program for a " House to house search and seizure of property and arms , " a " Separation and categorization of men , women and children as prisoners in large numbers , " especially those who will be considered by the government authorities as dangerous for the " Law and Order " because they will not be ready to fully collaborate with the implementation of a New World Order , " and transfer to detention facilities of mentioned prisoners . "
It 's also a " Network " of city , State and Federal Police Forces with the United Nations Multi-Military Forces having direct orders to bring into the United States and Canada foreign Military and Secret Police Forces for deployment against the North America population .
Most identified Fincen Units are at Company Strength , 160 plus .
Some are as large as Brigade Strength , 2600 plus .
REX - 84 : CONCENTRATION CAMPS & UNITED NATIONS RE-EDUCATION FACILITIES : Mass detention facilities , otherwise known as concentration camps , have been set up at a number of major U.S. military installations on the secret orders of Ex-President Reagan .
The Executive orders which established these camps have been canceled because the camps are now in place .
The White House issued a highly classified NATIONAL SECURITY DECISION DIRECTIVE ( NSDD ) which set forth urgent instructions which ' activated ' ten huge prison camps at key defense command locations across America .
Two trustworthy sources , patriotic career Army officers , revealed that preparations were set in motion for an unprecedented roundup of " security suspects " coast to coast .
According to these sources , one of the primary goals of the vast police operation , code named REX - 84 is to apply " C&C ( " Capture and Custody " ) measures against political opponents , resisters , and outspoken critics whom our bureaucratic government considers " dangerous . "
Four of the principle civilian concentration camps established under the REX - 84 program are located at Fort Chaffee , Arkansas ; Ft. Drum , New York ; Ft. Indian Gap , Pennsylvania and at Camp A. P. Hill in Virginia .
Each of these camps is designed to hold at least 25,000 civilian prisoners .
Additional emergency custodial facilities are being readied at Oakdale , California on Highway 120 ( reportedly for 15,000 detainees ) and at Eglin Air Force Base in southern Florida ; at Vandenberg AFB in California ; at Ft. McCoy , Wisconsin ; Ft. Benning , Georgia ; Ft. Huachuca , Arizona ; and finally at the southern Justice Department detention and interrogation center known as Camp Krome near Miami , Florida .
A major national task force of federal intelligence and law enforcement agencies , including the FBI , the CIA , U.S. Marshals , INS , Customs , Coast Guard , National Guard , and so forth , will join with local and state police in massive round ups to haul in lists of suspects who will fill these improvised stockades .
" The first roundup and the publicly announced one will be of illegal aliens and refugees , " according to a military source .

Americans whom the administration suspects of belonging to so called " violence - prone " groups , or of " supporting " such groups - which may mean only that a citizen subscribes to an anti-government / pro-freedom newsletter - may find themselves hauled off with hordes of illegal immigrants .
Another category of anti-bureaucratic activists which may be bound for administrative detention under this directive is " major , organized tax resisters , " one source close to the program said .
Not a single source interviewed could cite a Constitutional or legal precedent for such a staggering mass roundup of civilians by American authorities in " peacetime . "
If the president ordered a direct strike into the heartland of America , which was to be code named " OPERATION NIGHT TRAIN " ( we have the document on it ) , federal agents would set up a concomitant domestic exercise or war games scenario called REX - 84 , the main rationale of which was to round up 400,000 undocumented Central American aliens during a two week period of time and incarcerate them in ten military detention camps ( some of these camps are shown and documented in the movie " COVERUP " which has been playing at theaters on the West Coast .

OPERATION DRAGNET : THE UNITED NATIONS PITFALL : According to The Washington Report something called " Operation Dragnet " is authorized under Title II of the McCarran Act .
According to this act , any president of the United States is authorized to suspend the Bill of Rights with a single telephone call .
If either an invasion , a state of war , or , more probably , an " insurrection " is certified by the head of the current government , Operation Dragnet will be initiated .
Currently a Univac computer located in a secret place somewhere near Washington contains at least 1,000,000 names and , with the proper signal , the computer will begin printing one million arrest warrants !
Those whose names are stored in the computer will be picked up by the FBI and state and local police .
17 prison camps , known in WWII as " concentration camps " have already been constructed to hold the mass arrestees .
Three of these camps are being held in current readiness , two are on standby and the rest could be activated rapidly .
( American Information Newsletter , 2408 Main St. Boise , ID 83702 Sept l993 )
Strategically placed across the country from Elmondorf , Alaska to Avon Park , Florida , three of these " detention centers " are now operational in a slightly different guise , two others are on a stand - by basis , and the rest are ready and available with a minimum of preparation - and all that 's needed to fill these camps with thousands of Americans is for somebody to launch " Operation Dragnet . "
" It will be swift and legal , " federal agents stated .
" The law is already on the books .
They represent every shade of political and social opinion from right to left and include a big span of middle - of - the- road citizens who have never committed an offense more heinous than having subscribed to an unapproved periodical . "

CIVILIAN CONCENTRATION CAMPS ANOTHER GULAG IS DISCOVERED AND PHOTOGRAPHED IN OKLAHOMA CITY INTEL UPDATE : 12 May 94 Subject : New Prisoner Sorting and Transfer Center , Oklahoma City .
Source : Most Reliable
On 5 May 94 one recon team infiltrated the area surrounding the new " Federal Transfer Facility " located on the southwest perimeter of Will Rogers Airport in Oklahoma City , Oklahoma .
This facility is being built on land formerly owned by Monarch Oil Company .
The building is a six story reinforced concrete structure .
There are few windows and doors .
It appears to have pie- shaped high - rise cell blocks that connect at a central rotunda control center .
The rear of the building has a jetway - type enclosed passenger ramp that extends onto airport property and is capable of handling large commercial airliners up to and including the 747 Jumbo Jet .
It should be noted that an aircraft rebuilding firm is located almost directly across the runway that is currently rebuilding 747s , increasing the passenger seating and painting them all white with no other markings .
When they leave , the planes fly west .
Another source has reported that Amarillo Air Force Base , a former SAC site - now closed - has several plain white 747s on the flight line .
These are not moth - balled aircraft as they are maintained on a constant status in airworthy condition .
The Federal " cover story " is that the facility is a medium prisoner transfer facility that is centrally located in the central United Stares and is to be used for prisoner transfers between prisons .
Prisoners will be flown in by air , stay one or two nights , then fly out to other prisons for permanent incarceration .
The second cover story , given to Oklahoma City police officers who have enquired , is that it is a high security transfer point to handle high risk prisoners such as Noriega or Colombian drug lords .
It was obvious to the officers that this was not true due to the sheer size of the structure .
Structure is located on west perimeter road of Will Rogers airport , directly south of the FAA 's Monroney Aeronautical Center and the Oklahoma Air National Guard facility , which is a C - l30 squadron with global capabilities .
On 8 May 94 , a second recon team infiltrated the facility disguised as construction workers , and penetrated the interior .
They managed to photograph some of the interior .
They described the facility as capable of housing a large number of prisoners in the cells with a huge mess hall and kitchen facility .
Holding estimate : 2,500 + prisoners in cells designed only for " temporary housing . "
INTELLIGENCE SYNOPSIS :
It would appear that the facility was designed to handle large quantities of prisoners , all to be flown in and out by large aircraft .
By the design , families could be handled by being sorted by sex and age , then segregated in separate cell block wings and on separate floors .
Common dining would not be an issue as the site of the dining facility could rotate groups of cells , cell blocks or floors without one area 's inmates meeting another's .
The location , which is extremely rural , is well suited to non-discovery or complaint by locals .
There would be little vehicular traffic to draw attention to the facility and all ingress and egress could be controlled by simply closing the ends of a single two - lane road .
Closing the road would not interfere with airport operations and would not attract attention .
It appears that this facility , which is simply marked " Federal Transfer Center , " ( and then , only after numerous public inquires ) , is the central civilian prisoner sorting and relocation center ( concentration camp ) we have sought in the Oklahoma City area .
It now becomes apparent that the original suspicion that such a facility was to be located at Tinker AFB is no longer valid .
This location would also tie in well with the information that the Bums Flat Air Force Facility located near Weatherford , Oklahoma , is being improved for prisoner handling .
Bums
Flat has the third largest runway in the nation and serves as an alternate landing location for Space Shuttle operations .

From Daniel Sheehan 's Speech I learned in the second week of April 1984 , that President Reagan , on April 6 , 1984 , had signed a highly classified National Security Decision Directive , initiating a highly secret readiness exercise in the United States .
But this was a readiness exercise which was to be undertaken domestically to determine what types of steps had to be taken by various federal agencies here , stateside , in the event that the President was required to undertake direct military action in Central America .
The readiness exercise was going to be code - named " Rex 84 . "
The operation in Central America -- the direct military operation in conjunction with which this readiness exercise was to be undertaken -- was to be code - named " Operation Night Train . "
As we began to investigate this , we discovered that the whole readiness exercise ws going to be undertaken and supervised by the Federal Emergency Management Agency ( FEMA ) .
That came as somewhat of a surprise to us since the Federal Emergency Management Agency was supposed to be involved in hurricane relief , flood relief , and civil defense .
These are the geniuses who brought you the post - nuclear war scenario : how they would re-establish the phone system after an all - out nuclear attack on the United States ; how they would move the entire population of Los Angeles out to , I think , one of the small towns out here in the mountains in a couple days , which is what they figured it would take them .

UNDERGROUND EARTHBASES
" ... A great deal of UFO research has also led to the conclusion that various ... species of aliens have set up secret underground bases in the United States and other countries .
It is logical to assume that such bases have also been established elsewhere in the solar system .
If such bases exist , where would we find them ?
Existing information allows us to make a few educated guesses .
" EARTH BASES : UNDERGROUND -
The dark , cavernous world beneath out feet is the source of many baffling mysteries .
Clandestine UFO bases may be hidden deep within the earth in natural and / or artificial caverns .
As a former member of the National Speleological Society ( NSS ) , I am well aware of the vast extent of cave systems within the United States .
In my own native state of Missouri , for example , there are over 2,500 known caves and dozens of new ones being discovered every year .
Many of these caves are intricately linked together by numerous passageways and interconnecting chambers .
" One particular species of blind white ( albino ) cave fish , the TYPHLICHTHYS , has been found in many widely separated cave systems over several states .
It has been found in caves that make a great arc through Kentucky , Indiana , Illinois and UNDER the Mississippi River extending into Missouri , Arkansas , and Oklahoma !
A VAST SECTION OF THE CENTRAL AND SOUTHERN UNITED STATES MUST LIE ABOVE ONE IMMENSE CAVERN SYSTEM !
" Many caves possess rooms hundreds of feet in length , width , and height .
In most cases , these huge natural caverns can only be reached and explored with the utmost skill and perseverance .
There are only a few thousand NSS members in the United States and only a few hundred of this number are active spelunkers .
With so few spelunkers spread over such a large area , only a very small fraction of the tens of thousands of known caves in this country have been carefully mapped and explored .
Thousands of other caves remain undiscovered and unexplored .
" Extensive evidence indicates that caves in the United States may be connected with caves in other parts of the world .
In Mexico , the cave known as ' Sotano de las Golondrinas ' , ( or ) basement of the swallows , in the Municipio de Aquismo , S.L.P. , reaches a depth of 1100 feet ( 334 meters ) .
The cave is actually a giant ' sinkhole ' or ' hole ' in the ground with a nearly circular opening at the top , hundreds of feet in diameter .
It is impossible to climb down the sides of Golondrinas because the walls of the opening are too smooth and " belled - out " .
To reach the bottom of the cave , a special rope over 1100 feet long must be secured at the top of the opening and dropped into the sinkhole .
Explorers must then descend into the yawning hole one at a time using special cave repelling gear and climbing techniques .
At the bottom of Sotano de las Golondrinas are numerous ' leads ' or openings to a multiplicity of different crevices , passages , crawlways , and rooms which have never been mapped or investigated .
" The entrance to Golondrinas is located in one of the most primitive and uncivilized areas of Mexico and local inhabitants are afraid to approach the cave because they believe it is full of ' evil spirits ' which lure people to their deaths .
They tell stories of people mysteriously disappearing never to be heard from again while passing near the cave entrance .
These stories may be based more on fact than fiction : they are similar in some respects to UFO abduction reports .
Because of its huge size , remote location , and unique geological structure , Golondrinas would be an ideal UFO base .
Naturally camouflaged caves in other parts of the world may serve as excellent natural bases , way stations , and ' depots ' for UFOs .

The response was tremendous : there was standing room only in the back of the meeting location !
I enjoyed the kind Hawaiian reception and people immensely .
I appreciated their attentive attitude and seriousness with which they recieved this information .
While lecturing , I personally learned from the antendees much regarding what they knew about coming martial law , to Hawaii .
They informed me that SMOKESTACKS HAVE ARISEN OVER HAWAII !!!
As I discussed the documented concentration camps scattered across America , a look of recognition came upon many faces .
Several attendees interrupted me to share how three investigators had researched a suspected martial law future internment area , and uncovered an evident internment prison camp with crematory oven facilities incuded in the security fenced - in faciility located in Pearl City on Oahu .
Large smokestacks rise up over the facility .
Although it was empty until recently , government officials have now been using part of it to intern domestic sex offenders ... apparently to take away the suspicions of the islanders as to the facility 's TRUE purpose under coming martial law .
But the Patriot researchers who researched this facility and videotaped it are satisfied with their final conclusion as to the true nature of Hawaii 's future deathcamp facilityunder COMING MARTIAL LAW .
One attendee who researches MARTIAL LAW shared at the meeting how one man , with prophetic gifting , had been warning Islanders about coming martial law , and shared how God had shown him that CHINESE MILITARY WOULD BE USED TO SEIZE THE HAWAIIAN ISLANDS FOR THE NEW WORLD ORDER .
This vision would confirm what I factually know about COMING CHINESE CONQUEST OF AMERICA FOR THE NEW WORLD ORDER ( WORLD GLOBALIST COMMUNISM . )
A while ago , the British BBC sent a camera crew to the Straits of Formosa to film Chinese Naval maneuvers .
They were permitted to board the boats and to observe .
Some went to the young Chinese crewmen and interviewed them .
The broadcast was then aired on British television .
What came forth on the documentary was shocking .
The camermen asked the young Chinese crewmen , " What are you practicing for ? "
The reply ?
" We are PREPARING FOR THE INVASION OF AMERICA ! "
The Chinese government demanded , after the first airing on British television , that this documentary be pulled and no longer aired over British television .
It had been scheduled to air two consecutive nights ( Saturday and Sunday . )
But following the Saturday night broadcast , it was never shown again on British television .
( Source : a military veterans ' watchdog group whose leader I personally know . )
The reader MUST understand that both China and Russia are joined with the traitorous NWO takeover elements of America through the TRILATERAL ALLIANCE TREATY .
This treaty makes provision for both CHINESE and Russian troops to work with the traitorous elements of our mililtary when martial law comes down , to conduct door - to - door " search , seizure and arrest " maneuvers , to march arrested Americans off to the deathcamps , and secure America under martial law for the New World Order .
Now ... the Hawaiian Islands are truly a part of America .
And they are the CLOSEST part of America to the Chinese mainland !
I can only imagine what an ideal " test case scenario " the Chinese military and Navy would find the Hawaiian Islands to be ... on the way to their conquest of mainland AMERICA .
There is much evidence of Chinese , Russian and German military presence on the islands and around them , with Russian military and Chinese military naval vessels often conducting military exercises in the surrounding waters .
There is a German military presence on the American military bases here , as the Patriot leader Jack informed me .
He said , " German military ( Bundeswehr ) are often stationed in the security gate entrances of our military bases , and you KNOW they are German because their names and where they are from are posted on the welcome board , so you can address them by name .
We often see German military posted at the security gate entrances of some bases ... "
I light of my researching in Germany for the past six months , and uncovering their massive role in the FUTURE MILITARY MARTIAL LAW TAKEOVER OF AMERICA , I find this yet another ominous warning signal of the NATURE OF THE BEAST regarding coming events in our nation .

" For we are opposed , around the world , by a monolithic and ruthless conspiracy that relies primarily on covert means for expanding its sphere of influence ; in infiltration instead of invasion ; on subversion instead of elections , on intimidation instead of free choice ; on guerillas by night instead of armies by day .
It is a system which has conscripted vast human and material resources into the building of a tightly knit , highly efficient machine that combines military , diplomatic , intelligence , economic , scientific , and political operations .
Its preparations are concealed not published .
Its mistakes are buried , not headlined , its dissenters are silenced , not praised ; no expenditure is questioned , no rumor is printed , no secret is revealed .
It conducts the cold war , in short , with a wartime discipline no democracy would ever hope to wish to match . ... " .
- Massive increases in unemployment , particularly among racial minorities , were engineered while the government manipulated the unemployment statistics .
As a result there was an eruption of major riots in the poorest inner city areas .
- Police tactics that had been fine - tuned through years of practice in Northern Ireland were rolled out in full public view ; the years of false flag attacks in Ireland had conditioned the public mind to the need for massive militaristic police violence to " defend law and order " .
- Union leaders were put in place whose subsequent behaviour could only be described as " craven " thus weakening unity amongst the unions .
- Strikes in the industries with the strongest unions were deliberately generated through provocation , A " war of attrition " was fought with scattered attacks by the government on a piecemeal basis .
None of these was severe enough for the grassroots union members to realize that they were being set up for a major confrontation in the future .
- New laws limiting the rights of workers to strike were introduced where unions had been successful .
Thus the government had successfully probed its enemy , observed its reaction and essentially made much of that reaction illegal ; removing in great swathes the ability of workers to exercise their rights and neutralizing their power .
1. M Sarkozy will seek to set the agenda and ensure that the media focus public attention on the reform where the unions are weakest and public sympathy least likely .
2 . In order to further marginalize the workers in the public mind , violent events will be manipulated to occur or staged ( false flag operations ) so as to alienate the strikers from " ordinary people " .
The media will spin these issues out of all proportion for the facts of the events involved .
3 . Union leaders will seem to stand frozen like rabbits in headlights while the media focuses on the " evil " of these manufactured events .
4. 1 , 2 and 3 above will cause a splitting in the opposition to the reforms - this will be played up by the media when in all likelihood the " split " is over details and not principles .
The focus of the media will be on those opposing the strikes and not those who have valid grievances that can only be defended by striking .
5 . Government ministers will be given ample media space and airtime to denounce the strikers for their " selfishness " and " lack of social responsibility " .
Strikers will be accused of " threatening the greatness of France " , " refusing to modernize " , " putting lives at risk " , " holding the country to ransom " , " causing economic chaos " .
6 . Violence will flare as key points of contact between those striking and those officially opposing the strikes .
In all cases the violence will be blamed on the strikers .
The police will be brought in to " suppress the violence " while in fact inflaming it .
7 . In poor working class areas events will be staged to manufacture a violent response from the " masses " and condition the public mind to the need for violence from police and CRS " to defend France " .
8 . The terms of the negotiations between government and unions will either be kept secret or simply withheld from the public .
The real terns will be so disadvantageous to workers that they cannot possibly accept them , all the while the public mind will be focused on an " unwinnable issue " , one that garners little public sympathy .
The workers will strike again and take to the streets .
9 . At this point violence will break out on the picket lines and the CRS will be sent in against strikers .
Small groups of strikers will be shown to be very violent .
These individuals ( possibly agent provocateurs ) will be used to discredit the entire labour movement and union leaders will be required to distance themselves from the violence thereby handing M Sarkozy victory in the arena of the public mind and in the minds of moderate workers .
French Strikes Wind Down
AP - 24th Nov 2007
PARIS - French President Nicolas Sarkozy focused on a winnable fight , divided the opposition and appears to have come out on top after nine days of strikes by seething rail drivers .
Yet tensions lingered as the walkout wound down and train traffic began resuming Friday .
Violence by protesting students prompted the Sorbonne university to shut down , and highlighted worries about how Sarkozy and his compatriots will weather his painful plans to remake stagnant , reform - resistant France .
Sarkozy scored what was seen as a necessary victory for his broader reform agenda by facing down rail workers angry over his plans to make them work longer to earn a pension .
" This reform , I promised it , I stuck to it , " he said in a confident speech Friday .
On Thursday , train workers agreed to return to work on the promise of talks that could soften - though not compromise - the retirement reform .
By holding firm against the rail drivers , Sarkozy was hoping to break the unions ' instinctive recourse to strikes , as Margaret Thatcher did in standing down coal miners and Ronald Reagan did with air traffic controllers in the 1980s .
Sarkozy craftily drove a wedge between moderate and militant labor unions during the protracted transport strike , and the opposition Socialists were at a loss to resist his methodical war - waging tactics .
Sarkozy expressed hope that in the future , unions " will always prefer negotiations to confrontation . "
That would mark a major change for France .
Sarkozy 's election in May - on a platform of dramatic " rupture " with the past - showed that most French are ready for change .
Commuters long accustomed to labor walkouts lost patience quickly with this transport strike , and were quick to slam the striking train drivers for defending privileges most see as unfair .
" At the moment when the strike is ending , when reason is prevailing , my first thoughts go to the millions of French who ... can't take it anymore after 10 days of mess .... to those millions of French who had the feeling of being taken hostage in a conflict that does n't concern them , " he said .
But millions voted against Sarkozy , and are not ready to give him free rein .
The talks with the rail drivers are certain to be tense , and some unions are threatening new strikes if they do n't produce enough concessions .
And the retirement reform is just one small thing Sarkozy has up his sleeve for France 's future .
He says France has too many civil servants who are dragging down the indebted government .
France 's 5 million civil servants do n't all agree , and many are resisting job cuts and demanding better pay .
They held their first strike Tuesday and are threatening more .
Sure to be sensitive is Sarkozy 's plan to jettison the complicated and rigid system of job contracts that underpin France 's work force .
And then there are the restive universities .
The Sorbonne campus was shut down Friday after violence between students protesting a university financing reform and other students trying to get to class .
Students have been blocking the landmark Left Bank building for days , but on Friday resorted to " physical violence , " the administration said , shutting the school until Monday .
High school and university students are planning new protests Tuesday .
Travelers welcomed improved traffic Friday , though restoring full service to the nationwide rail service and public transport in Paris and other cities was expected to take days .
In a clear sign the strike was ending , some Metro stations started collecting tickets again Friday .
During the strike , transport on the few operating subway trains was free .
Citizens of France , How would you feel if :
You had to borrow 5 or 10 times your annual salary to be able to have a home ?
You had to purchase expensive private medical insurance to be sure of having any medial care ?
Every hospital denied all medical care to those without private medical insurance ?
There was no social safety net , no unemployment insurance for yourself , your family , and your children ?
You had to work 40 to 60 hours per week with only one week of holiday per year - and even that only after you have worked for a year or two ?
You had to borrow money every year just to feed your family and keep a roof over their heads ?
You had to borrow 100,000 Euros to pay for a university education for your child ?
You had a credit card debt so huge you would never be able to repay it and could never stop working until you die ?
Universities were financed by corporations and obliged to teach only what those corporations decide is important ?
All of France 's infrastructure and national wealth was " privatized " for the benefit of a few wealthy elites who tell you what you can and can't do in your own country , and charge you for the natural resources that are presently the community property of all ?
If you can imagine what life would be like under such circumstances , then you know what life is like today for a majority of Americans .
Americans think it is normal to work 50 hours a week with only one week of vacation per year .
There are many horror stories of Americans without insurance being turned away from hospitals .
The American Education system has resulted in a 50 % literacy rate and only the wealthy can attend university .
American 's believe that such a life - a life based on how much money you have - is the epitome of freedom because they have been brainwashed into believing that money makes the man .
Do you want the same for France ?
You do n't know me personally , but to paraphrase a line from the movie " V for Vendetta , " I am " Edmond Dantés ... and I am your father .
And your mother ... your brother ... your friend .
I am you ... and me .
I am all of us .
" In real life , I am a former investment banker with one of your biggest banks .
I have degrees in economics and I have spent most of my adult life observing the flow of international capital and how it is manipulated by governments and large corporations to suit their own agenda .
I am also an international editor of www.sott.net because I see it as the clearest voice of Truth on the internet .
But , enough about me .
It is you , it is France , I want to talk about .
Many French citizens remember how France slept through the 1930s while Germany rearmed and made its plans for European domination , plans that were not hidden , but proudly announced by Hitler and his Nazis , yet France slept and suffered the inevitable horrific consequences .
People of France , your President - a representative of the cabal of power - hungry global and corporate elite - has stated his plans clearly just as Hitler did , and yet you sleep now .
You are being invaded not by an army but by malicious and repugnant ideas spread by your political leaders and the media .
The goal is to infect your minds with these ideas and make the French people the architects of their own destruction .
When your President speaks of a " rupture " with the past what he means is a rupture of French society ; the destruction of the French way of life and it will be no less horrific than the previous invasion by Hitler and his hordes .
John Fitzgerald Kennedy famously said : Your enemy is well organized , has unlimited financing , is global , ruthless and has almost total control of the media .
Your enemy is amongst you and in many ways within you for you have been conditioned to think in limited and thereby self - limiting ways .
Your enemy plans to destroy your paternalistic social structures with the ushering in of what is being called a " neo-liberal American " economic model ; or , as journalist Naomi Klein calls it " Disaster Capitalism " .
You have been led to believe that France is somehow exempt from the predations of neo-liberal economics .
In large part this has been achieved by keeping you ignorant of the truth via the barrier of language .
The English speaking world is replete with warnings of what neo-liberal economics means yet there is limited literature available in France on this most important of topics .
Why is this ?
Why is it that you actually know so little about what really goes on outside of France ?
M
Sarkozy is attempting to manipulate this ignorance and foster an exaggerated self - interest and jealousy that is anathema to the French psyche .
While loath to admit it , many of the middle class supporters of M Sarkozy are motivated by jealousy .
They are jealous of the employment benefits enjoyed by state workers and are being manipulated by M Sarkozy into supporting policies that would strip state workers of those benefits .
What the middle classes fail to understand is that in supporting government action against the working classes now , they are setting themselves up for similar treatment in the near future .
Make no mistake , the only winners that will emerge from M Sarkozy 's " rupture " will be the ruling elite , large international corporations and foreign vultures that will pick over the bones of France .
The middle / professional classes that presently support M Sarkozy will also lose their comforts , they just do n't know it yet .
They believe that through some miraculous mechanism they will become richer at the expense of the ordinary worker and that this is " just " , " necessary " and " modern " .
The ruling elite may allow a little of the wealth of France to be " loaned " to the middle classes in the short term , and the middle classes may be bought for a few Euros , but it will be transient and ultimately illusory .
Believe me , I know .
Banking is my business .
In the US and the UK the mechanism used to bribe the middle classes was property inflation .
Over the past few years a massive boom in property values was engineered to provide the illusion of wealth .
Yet today , as prices start to fall , this wealth is vanishing while the debt that was incurred to acquire that property remains very real and increasingly expensive and will in the end be the death of the middle classes in those countries .
M
Sarkozy is a clever and ruthless man .
He knows that he cannot persuade France to accept neo-liberalism ( 1 ) , and ultimately Fascism directly .
He has to manipulate France into a position where the outcome is a " fait accompli " .
How will this manipulation be achieved ?
It was this topic that was being discussed amongst SOTT editors just prior to the commencement of the recent French strikes .
We noted that a similar situation existed in the UK when Margaret Thatcher came to power in 1979 " committed to an unambiguous program of reducing trade union power and influence " ( 2 ) and with carefully formulated plans to " rupture " British working class power .
We speculated that similar tactics might be used in France .
And so , since banking is my business , I was asked to research the matter and present , to you the people of France , an outline of your future .
The key to Margaret Thatcher 's success in " rupturing " the UK and foisting Neoliberalism on the British people was long term preparation :
Eventually , Thatcher was ready for the final battle .
Her government had been re-elected on the back of the national euphoria generated by the Falklands War and her strategists were ready for all out conflict with the unions and the working classes .
Union weakness and the new laws that prevented strikes without a majority vote in a union ballot gave the government the resolve and public support needed to finally take on the most vulnerable industry in the country , the Coal Miners .
The parallels for France seem too much to ignore .
The ground work has been laid in very similar ways .
Like Margaret
Thatcher in 1982 , M Sarkozy is at the beginning of a new term and is claiming a popular mandate .
Margaret
Thatcher famously said " There is no alternative " and " The lady is not for turning " ; while M Sarkozy has said " We will not surrender and we will not retreat ...
France needs reforms to meet the challenges imposed on it by the world .
" Speculating that M Sarkozy will have learned from not only the British but also from labour confrontations around the world , two weeks ago we speculated that : - Events over the past two weeks have proved us right .
M Sarkozy 's strategy has followed our speculations to the letter , but this is only the beginning .
M Sarkozy was allowed to set the agenda of pension reform .
The provision for early retirement among workers in strenuous jobs such as the railways was fair when the work was harder but is now widely accepted as being outdated .
Conveniently staged " sabotage " split the unions and public opinion , the union leaders froze and broke ranks last Friday under the media glare generated by the " sabotage " .
Violence " erupted " at universities and 5 nights ago 3 people were killed in an " accident " with the police , and the predictable " riots " ensued for three nights .
All playing out according to plan !
A recent mainstream press article illustrates much of this :- It is essential that everyone in France understands that these strikes are not about whether or not a railway worker gets a particular pension .
These strikes are the knife - edge of the neo-liberal economic wedge being driven into the soul of socialist France .
Yet it seems that France is again asleep and oblivious to the dangers .
France has been tricked into thinking that the issue is pension reform .
One look at the relative media space given to the SNCF and Metro strikes shows the extent of M Sarkozy 's control .
For while part of the rail workers strike was about pensions , numerous other workers are opposing " reforms " that illustrate far better the real nature of the Sarkozy agenda .
In allowing M Sarkozy and the media to focus principally on pension reform , the unions handed M Sarkozy a massive advantage .
In backing down at the crucial point when the people of France were starting to see the value of the workers whose rights many people seem happy to destroy , the unions handed him victory and split the previously united opposition .
M
Sarkozy is a bully who has stated categorically that he does not have to listen to the will of the people .
This is the way that Tony Blair treated the British and the way that George W. Bush treats the Americans .
Is that what you want for France ?
It is painful for many of us who cheered wildly when the much disliked Jacques Chirac thumbed his nose at the Americans and said " Non ! " to the illegal invasion of Iraq to see what is happening in France ; it is in fact disturbing to realize that M Sarkozy receives any support at all .
Surely it is obvious that the United States is collapsing , the world financial system is hovering on the brink of chaos and the neo-liberal economic model has been exposed as nothing more than a modern day version of the pillage and plunder of the unenlightened past .
So has M. Sarkozy lost his mind ?
Or does he have an agenda to drag France down into the dog pit with the rest of the Disaster Capitalists ?
Despite what M Sarkozy may declare , based on my interactions with French citizens , the people of France do not accept the warmongering global hegemony of the US and do not want the American Nightmare in France .
More than ever before in their history , the people of France must stand up for Liberte , Egalite and Fraternite .
Make no mistake , this is a war for France 's freedom - a covert war of wills - that must be faced head on .
But above all else , you must resist with your hearts , your voices and your very bodies any and all attempts to sow division among you .
United you stand , divided you will fall .

Pentagon Hacked by Chinese Military
The story seems to have started yesterday in the Financial Times , and is now spreading .
Not enough details to know what ’s really going on , though .
From the FT :
The Chinese military hacked into a Pentagon computer network in June in the most successful cyber attack on the US defence department , say American officials .
The Pentagon acknowledged shutting down part of a computer system serving the office of Robert Gates , defence secretary , but declined to say who it believed was behind the attack .
Current and former officials have told the Financial Times an internal investigation has revealed that the incursion came from the People ’s Liberation Army .
One senior US official said the Pentagon had pinpointed the exact origins of the attack .
Another person familiar with the event said there was a “ very high level of confidence … trending towards total certainty ” that the PLA was responsible .
The defence ministry in Beijing declined to comment on Monday .
EDITED TO ADD ( 9/13 ) : Another good commentary .

Consumption of resveratrol did not cause serious adverse events Past News Releases RSS Biotivia Has Dramatically Increased ...
Dr. Joseph C. Maroon , neurologist and professor at the University of Pittsburgh medical school , and a leading scholar on resveratrol , stated recently that he would not be surprised to see the scientists who discovered resveratrol " standing together in Stockholm . "
Whether this remarkable molecule 's discovery will bring Harvard 's Dr. Sinclair and his colleagues a Nobel prize or not remains to be seen however the fact that resveratrol has galvanized the attention of physicians and scientists worldwide in virtually every field of medicine is indisputable .
Accidental death notwithstanding , a person 's life span is determined by three factors ; avoidance of the principal diseases of aging , particularly cardiovascular disease , cancers , and diabetes ; genetic and epigenetic factors ; and finally the limit on the number of times cells can divide or replicate without incurring fatal DNA errors or consuming the chromosome 's telemere .
Resveratrol , the so called " Miracle Molecule " , has been shown in animal trials to have potential benefits in three of the four anti-aging categories ; preventing the diseases of aging , inducing DNA repair , and activating the anti-aging gene Sirt 1 .
No other drug or natural compound has been associated with all of these potential effects .
In studies and trials at major universities and research centers since the mid 1990s resveratrol has been shown to have an incredible range of potential health benefits .
Although there is a clear and pressing need for additional human studies , given the evidence to date and the absence of reported adverse effects , adding this compound to your daily supplement mix may now be worth considering .
If you decide to start taking resveratrol there are some important factors you should be aware of when choosing a specific supplement .
Following are some of the more important considerations .
Red wine skins or extract as it is called is not the best source resveratrol .
In spite of resveratrol often being referred to as the " Red Wine Molecule " the source of the resveratrol used in virtually all studies , including the Dr. Sinclair and Dr. Auwerx studies , is Polygonum cuspidatum commonly known as Giant Knotweed .
Red wine simply does not contain sufficient concentrations of the key trans - resveratrol isomer .
Only low potency and unnecessarily high priced products can be produced from red wine skins .
Red wine skins also often contain traces of pesticides and other agricultural chemicals which are extremely difficult to either detect or remove .
Resveratrol should not be combined with the nutrient Quercetin .
A number of recent studies have shown conclusively that Quercetin blocks the critical metabolites of resveratrol .
These metabolites account for up to 80 % of the beneficial effects of resveratrol and extend its half life by over 400 % .
If both supplements are taken they should be separated by at least 8 hours .
In November of 2007 an independent consumer organization , Consumer Lab , tested the major resveratrol brands for potency , purity and compliance with label claims and found that not all products contained the amount of resveratrol claimed on their labels and web sites .
Life Extension brand , for example contained less than 27 % of the claimed resveratrol .
Biotivia Bioforte was the best value per 100mg and second highest potency product and Biotivia Transmax was the highest potency supplement of those which passed the ComsumerLab.com evaluations .
Biotivia was the only company with two approved products .
The test was open to all manufacturers however many chose not to subject their products to independent scrutiny .
Several of the companies who declined to have their products tested refused comment when contacted about their reasons for this decision .
The issue of what is the safe and effective dosage of resveratrol to take on a daily basis is an important one as too low a dose may be simply a waste of money .
Some light was thrown on this topic recently by a study done by doctors in England .
In this trial subjects given as much as 5000 mg per day had no serious adverse effects after a prolonged period of usage .
The doctors concluded that " Consumption of resveratrol did not cause serious adverse events " even at these extremely high doses .
No evidence of toxicity has been found in any major resveratrol trial or study .
Based upon the Dr. Sinclair study , which was published in the journal Nature in November 2006 , the equivalent human dosage adjusted for body mass , metabolism and other factors is between 300mg and 400 mg for a 170 pound person .
Virtually all studies note that effects are dose dependen , that is higher doses produce greater effects .
Many physicians recommend a dose of between 500mg and 1000 mg per day .
Limited Bio availability seems to be a problem with resveratrol and other polyphenols however this problem may have been resolved by one company .
Biotivia Ltd. researchers in Austria recently announced a breakthrough in overcoming the naturally low bio availability of resveratrol .
This iwas accomplished by complexing organic resveratrol with a natural patented adjutant and utilizing a proprietary multi-stage processing system to enhance certain properties of the compound .
Specific details of the process are a trade secret .
Over the past ten to fifteen years a huge amount of study has been done on various polyphenols and their potential for health benefits in humans .
Some of the most promising candidates to date are curcumin ( extract of Tumeric ) , Silymarin , Astralagus , especially Astragaloside IV , and a new class of super antioxidants derived from exotic fruits such as Goji berry , Mangosteen , and Acai , as well as extracts of Apple and Tangerine peel , blue berry and elder berry .
Biotivia has recently announced the availability of a longevity supplement which combines high - potency resveratrol with silymarin , curcumin and astralagus , and a new patent pending super antioxidant which contains a complementary blend of the most potent extracts of this new class of polyphenols .

The very first step in every successful parallelization effort is always the same : you take a look at the problem that needs to be solved and start splitting it into tasks that can be computed in parallel .
This sounds easy , but I can see from my students reactions that at least for some of them it is not .
This article shows five ways to do just that .
It is a short version for a blog article , the long version can be found in the book Introduction to Parallel Computing by Grama and others .
Let ’s start with a short paragraph on terminology : what I am describing here is also called problem decomposition .
The goal here is to divide the problem into several smaller subproblems , called tasks that can be computed in parallel later on .
The tasks can be of different size and must not necessarily be independent ( although , of course , that would make your work easier later on 🙂 ) .
If many tasks are created , we talk about fine grained decomposition .
If few tasks are created it is called coarse grained decomposition .
Which one is better heavily depends on the problem , as many tasks allow for more concurrency and better scalability , while fewer tasks usually need less communication / synchronization .
There are several ways to do problem decompositions , the most well - known probably being recursive decomposition , data decomposition , functional decomposition , exploratory decomposition and speculative decomposition .
The next few paragraphs will shortly explain how they are carried out in practice .
Recursive Decomposion
Divide - and - Conquer is a widely deployed strategy for writing sequential algorithms .
In it , a problem is divided into subproblems , which are again divided into subproblems recursively until a trivial solution can be calculated .
Afterwards , the results of the subproblems are merged together when needed .
This strategy can be applied as is to achieve a recursive problem decomposition .
As the smaller tasks are usually independent of one another , they can be calculated in parallel , often leading to well - scaling parallel algorithms .
Parallel sorting algorithms often use recursive decompositions .
Data Decomposition
When data structures with large amounts of similar data need to be processed , data decomposition is usually a well - performing decomposition technique .
The tasks in this strategy consist of groups of data .
These can be either input data , output data or even intermediate data , decompositions to all varieties are possible and may be useful .
All processors perform the same operations on these data , which are often independent from one another .
This is my favorite decomposition technique , because it is usually easy to do , often has no dependencies in between tasks and scales really well .
Functional Decomposition
For functional decomposition , the functions to be performed on data are split into multiple tasks .
These tasks can then be performed concurrently by different processes on different data .
This often leads to so - called Pipelines .
Although this decomposition technique is usually easy to do as well , it often does not scale too well , because there is only a limited amount of functions available in each program to split up .
Exploratory Decomposition
Exploratory decompostion is a special case for algorithms , who search through a predefined space for solutions .
In this case , the search space can often be partitioned into tasks , which can be processed concurrently .
Exploratory decompostion is a special case decomposition that is not generally applicable , an example is breadth - first search in trees .
Speculative Decomposition
Another special purpose decomposition technique is called speculative decomposition .
In the case when only one of several functions is carried out depending on a condition ( think : a switch - statement ) , these functions are turned into tasks and carried out before the condition is even evaluated .
As soon as the condition has been evaluated , only the results of one task are used , all others are thrown away .
This decompostion technique is quite wasteful on resources and seldom used ( personally , I have never used it ) .
The different decomposition methods described above can of course also be combined into hybrid decompositions .
I think these are the most common techniques .
Do you happen to know any other important ones ?
Then please do n’t hesitate to share it in the comments !

RELEASE : 08-036
NASA Calls for Suggestions to Re-Name Future Telescope Mission
WASHINGTON - NASA announced Thursday that members of the general public from around the world will have a chance to suggest a new name for the cutting edge Gamma -ray Large Area Space Telescope , otherwise known as GLAST , observatory before it launches in mid-2008 .
The satellite will observe some of the most powerful forces known in the universe .
"
The idea is to give people a chance to come up with a name that will fully engage the public in the GLAST mission , " said Steve Ritz , the mission 's project scientist at NASA 's Goddard Space Flight Center , Greenbelt , Md . The mission 's scientific objectives are to :- Explore the most extreme environments in the universe , where nature harnesses energies far beyond anything possible on Earth - Search for signs of new laws of physics and what composes the mysterious dark matter -
Explain how black holes accelerate immense jets of material to nearly light speed -
Help crack the mysteries of the stupendously powerful explosions known as gamma-ray bursts -
Answer long - standing questions about a broad range of phenomena , including solar flares , pulsars and the origin of cosmic rays " We 're looking for name suggestions that will capture the excitement of GLAST ’s mission and call attention to gamma-ray and high - energy astronomy .
We are looking for something memorable to commemorate this spectacular new astronomy mission , " said Alan Stern , associate administrator for Science at NASA Headquarters in Washington .
" We hope someone will come up with a name that is catchy , easy to say and will help make the satellite and its mission a topic of dinner table and classroom discussion .
" Suggestions for the mission 's new name can be an acronym , but it is not a requirement .
Any suggestions for naming the telescope after a scientist may only include names of deceased scientists whose names are not already used for other NASA missions .
All suggestions will be considered .
The period for accepting names closes on March 31 , 2008 .
Participants must include a statement of 25 words or less about why their suggestion would be a strong name for the mission .
Multiple suggestions are encouraged .
To submit a suggestion for the mission name , visit : Anyone who drops a name into the " Name That Satellite ! " suggestion box on the Web page can choose to receive a " Certificate of Participation " via return e-mail .
Participants also may choose to receive the NASA press release announcing the new mission name .
The announcement is expected approximately 60 days after launch of the telescope .
NASA 's GLAST mission is an astrophysics and particle physics partnership , developed in collaboration with the U.S. Department of Energy , along with important contributions from academic institutions and partners in France , Germany , Italy , Japan , Sweden , and the U.S.

At least nine people are believed to have died in the inferno , five of them children

Bob is fretting .
The small steel thermometer he has dipped into the smoking oil is telling him it's too hot to start cooking the small blobs of batter that will soon be malasadas .
Burned malasadas – the name Portuguese immigrants to Hawaii gave to what are essentially doughnuts – do n't taste so good .
His stall in Kapiolani Park on the edge of Waikiki soon attracts a long queue of takers .
But it is not just a good appetite that is drawing them .
Everyone in this corner of the park this morning has come for another reason : to show support for a local boy who may be about to do something extraordinary ; win the Democratic Party 's nomination to be the first black ( and first surfer ) American President .
" Hot Obamasadas ! " exclaim two large signs strung over the table where Bob is working .
A lawn sign is planted in the ground next to him with a life - sized black - and - white headshot of a middle - aged African - American guy with familiar big ears and wide smile .
A flower lei is hung around the photograph above the words , written in bright felt - pen colours , " Hawaii's Native Son " .

By rights , Barack Obama should prevail in caucus voting in Hawaii today and fatten slightly his delegate lead over Hillary Clinton .
The remarkable early narrative of Obama 's life – the child of a white woman from Kansas and a Kenyan father who abandoned the family when the boy was just two – mostly played out here in the Pineapple State , save for four years between the ages of six and 10 in Indonesia .
Hawaii imbued in Obama the quality that may be the most compelling of his candidacy .
His promise to transcend racial and social differences .
Few places better qualify as a true melting pot than Hawaii , its streets still teaming with a cosmopolitan mix of whites , Asians , Chinese , Japanese and ( a few ) blacks .
" The opportunity that Hawaii offered – to experience a variety of cultures in a climate of mutual respect – became an integral part of my world view , " Obama himself wrote in the 1999 issue of the newsletter published by the elite Punahou School , where he was a pupil from aged 10 until college .
Or as the US representative Neil Hargreaves , a close friend of Obama 's parents , more pithily put it while addressing the crowd of 100 supporters here in Kapiolani Park : " Our diversity defines us , rather than divides us . "
Obama 's attachment to the archipelago survives .
His surfing and fish - spearing days may be done , but he spends most Christmases here .
If he becomes President , Waikiki could be his Crawford , Texas .
( Which would make for a tanned but sadly jet - lagged White House press corps . )
Yet not everything about Obama 's formative years here – particularly as one of only a few black students at Punahou , a cradle of academic privilege that led him to a financial scholarship – were glorious .
It 's maybe why " Obamasada " Bob resists being interviewed in any detail about his memories of the young Obama even though they were friends who loved shooting hoops on the basketball courts on the school campus .
" I have been let down by the press , " he says , refusing to reveal his last name .
" We 've been told not to talk to reporters , " volunteers John Cheever , himself an old boy of Punahou and now a sociology teacher there .
" He was n't that much of a distinguished student but everyone will tell you he was a good guy , very popular , someone who was always comfortable with the other kids . "
Cheever knows though that there are some not so comfortable memories for Obama from his Punahou years , the kind of stuff that gets the media digging .
In searching for the real Barack Obama – or , as they used to call him at school , " Barry O'Bomber " because of his elegant hook shots on the basketball courts – the murk is more likely to be about drugs , including marijuana and cocaine , and slipping grades .

Over a decade ago , however , Obama did something out of the ordinary .
Fresh out of Harvard Law School , he took time off to write a book about his youth – here , in Indonesia and at colleges both in California and in New York .
He was not coy .
What he revealed in Dreams From My Father about his Punahou years was greeted by many who knew him here with some shock .
He wrote about the pain of reconciling the mythology that was spun around his father with the reality that he had been ditched by him , about his struggles of self - identity as a black boy entering a school where one of his first experiences was being asked by another student if his father " ate people " .
He wrote about the drugs too .
He recalled , for instance , standing in the freezer room of grocery shop with a friend , Micky – " my potential initiator " – and watching as he " pulled out the needle and the tubing " before injecting .
Obama described a feeling of panic witnessing this .
He did not partake .
But there was , before he pulled himself out of it , a period of pot and the cocaine .
An entry by Obama in the 1979 school paper , The Ohauan , includes a thank you to the " Choom Gang " .
" Chooming " in Hawaii means smoking marijuana .
" Junkie .
Pothead .
That 's where I 'd been headed : the final fatal role of the young would - be black man .
Except the highs had n't been about that , me trying to prove what a down brother I was .
Not by then , anyway .
I got high for just the opposite effect , something that could push questions of who I was out of my mind , something that could flatten out the landscapes of my heart , blur the edges of my memory . "
There are no plaques to Obama on the Punahou campus or photos of him to celebrate the new - found political prominence of an old boy .
At least not yet .
Rather , on a small terrace outside the cafeteria there is something which , in a moment of naughtiness , he left behind himself .
There scratched into a patch of cement is his name , " OBAMA " .
Some say another boy scrawled it there because the name seemed funny
But school press officer Laurel Husain , my guide around the stately campus , believes he wrote there himself .
Husain , once a Punahou student herself , confirms what others have said : that none of Obama 's teachers , many of whom are still teaching , knew of the turmoil he suffered .
" They only found out from the reading the book and were surprised .
They did not see it .
He was outgoing and friendly and well - liked and was n't someone sticking with cliques . "
As for the experimenting with drugs as a student there , she points out that the Seventies were a particular time .
" It would have been odd if he had n't . "
Lawrence Tavares played with Obama on the school 's basketball team , which went on to win the state championships .
Now an inheritance planner at the First Bank of Hawaii , he too was taken aback by the book , he confesses .
" He just seemed a normal person , " he said over the weekend .
" We did n't notice much , I guess .
At school , he just seemed one of the boys . "
A boy , by all accounts , who when not in class dribbled a basketball constantly and went to practise with pals on the courts whenever he had the chance .
Obama was a jock , who , unusually , also cut something of a literary figure on campus .
Among poems submitted to the school magazine , one began : " I saw an old forgotten man / On an old , forgotten road " .
The man , seemingly a reference to his grandfather is " staggering and numb " but finally " pulls out forgotten dignity from under his flaking coat /
And walks a straight line along the crooked world " .
But what of the book , published in 1995 ?
Was it wise of Obama to write so candidly of his youthful indiscretions and internal struggles ?
Maya Soetoro - Ng , his half - sister and 16 years his junior , who has been campaigning for him across the Aloha islands ahead of today 's caucus votes , and who also takes the microphone at the park rally , has no doubts .
" I think he could n't be a politician if he could n't be honest about who is and has been , " she said afterwards .
" He would n't be able to do it .
Part of what makes him a leader is his courage .
He is glad he wrote it . "
Words are important to both of them .
When they meet they make sure to set aside time for Scrabble , she says .
Obama has also written that the restless ambition that propelled him into the US Senate and his quest for the presidency first struck him after leaving Hawaii , notably while at Columbia University in New York .
But Cheever , the teacher , says Punahou may also have had a lot to do with it .
" The kids at the school see how others who graduated from it did exceptional things .
And they get to think , ' I am kind of not doing anything ' . "
( Graduates include the AOL founder Steven Case and an astronaut . )
Meanwhile , the unusual challenges that the young Obama faced , he adds , surely also helped form him .
Cheever , who is wearing a " Buff and Blue for Obama " badge ( the colours of Punahou ) is talking not just about Obama 's struggles over his mixed race but also the shortfalls of his home life .
His father had vanished and his mother , Ann , was still mostly absent , leaving her parents , Stanley and Madelyn , to raise her son in their small Honolulu apartment while she remained in Indonesia .
Madelyn still lives in the home , though at 84 years old is frail and has refused all interviews .
" Having a single mother and being raised by your grandparents , that has to give a certain resiliency , the power to overcome , " he suggests .
But then there were the influences of his parents themselves .
Few knew them as well as Neil Abercrombie , who , in particular , has memories of Obama 's father , also named Barack , that go much beyond the shorthand of his once being a goatherd in his native Kenya .
He came to study in Hawaii after being singled out to help Kenya shed its colonial past .
At university that he met Ann .
( Ann , who died of cancer in 1995 , was actually named Stanley , because of the disappointment of her father – Gramps to Barack – at having had a girl instead of a boy .
Naturally she preferred Ann . )
" His father was truly a force of nature and a brilliant intellectual , " Abercrombie offers .
" The intellectual apple did n't fall far from the tree . "
Just as his father was sometimes fiery , so his mother , Ann , he added , was calm and contemplative .
" He has the voice of his mother . "
But Abercrombie , like so many of his supporters here , soon returns to the multicultural , multi-ethnic influences of the islands of his teenage years and the lessons of tolerance they taught him .
" The culture of Hawaii , the values of Hawaii , these are things that shaped the foundations of his life . "

A drama about a teenage girl who commits suicide has been pulled from BBC3's schedule following the spate of deaths in Bridgend , south Wales .
Dis /Connected , which tells the story of a group of young people thrown together after the suicide of a mutual friend , was due to air on the digital youth channel on Monday night at 9 pm .
However , this week 's discovery of the body of the 17th young person to have committed suicide in the Bridgend area since the beginning of last year has prompted BBC executives to postpone the drama .
The media has already faced criticism from local police , the parents of some of the deceased and academics over its coverage of the apparent spate of suicides in the Bridgend area .
A BBC spokesman said : " Dis / Connected is a drama aimed at a young audience which deals with the emotional build up to the suicide of a teenage girl and the effects which this has on her friends .
" While the drama deals with the issue with sensitivity , after careful consideration we have decided , given the recent tragic events in Bridgend , to postpone the transmission of Dis/ Connected until a later date . "
The spokesman said no new date had yet been confirmed for the drama 's BBC3 transmission .
Dis /Connected , which has been made by Elisabeth Murdoch 's independent production company , Shine , is one of six new dramas commissioned by the BBC3 controller , Danny Cohen .
Others include Phoo Action and Being Human , which have already been broadcast .

The Taleban have carried out numerous attacks in Kandahar
Enlarge Image
The massive blast hit a crowd of people watching a dog- fighting contest .
" This suicide attack was the work of the Taleban , " said Governor Assadullah Khalid , saying the death toll may rise .
Southern Afghanistan is a Taleban stronghold and last week the Kandahar governor himself was the target of an attempt on his life .
The Taleban have not claimed responsibility for the blast , but it bears all their hallmarks , says the BBC's Jon Brain in the Afghan capital , Kabul .
Among those killed was Abdul Hakim , a local police chief fiercely opposed to the Taleban who is thought to have been the target of the attack .
Body parts
Excitement was mounting among the 500 - strong , male - only crowd when the huge blast struck .
I counted over 40 people on the ground dead
Abdul Karim ,
Dog - fight spectator
Dog-fighting competitions , which were banned under the Taleban regime , are a popular pastime in Afghanistan .
" Fighting had just started between two dogs , " said one spectator , Abdul Karim .
" Suddenly I heard a huge explosion next to a police vehicle .
Then I saw lots of people dead and wounded .
" I counted over 40 people on the ground dead , " Mr Karim , 53 , told the AFP news agency .
Twisted car and bicycle parts littered the ground as shawls and shoes lay scattered among the bodies of the dead and wounded .
MAJOR TALEBAN ATTACKS 29 Dec 2007 : 16 policemen killed in Kandahar 6 Nov 2007 :
At least 70 die in attack on sugar factory in Baghlan province 29 Sep 2007 :
At least 30 soldiers killed in bus attack in Kabul 16 Jan 2006 :
At least 24 people killed in two attacks in Kandahar
Deadliest Afghan attacks
In pictures : Afghan blast
Scores of wounded were packed into civilian cars and rushed to hospitals in the city centre , some 15 km ( nine miles ) away .
Estimates of the death - toll from Sunday 's attack varied .
While Governor Assadullah Khalid stood by his original estimate of 80 killed , Kabul 's interior ministry , which originally said more than 80 died , later dropped its toll to 65 , saying more than 50 were wounded .
Last November , a suicide bombing in the northern Baghlan province killed 79 people - mostly school pupils - in the bloodiest bombing since the Taleban were ousted in 2001 .
Taleban influence
Aside from Abdul Hakim , several policemen were reported to be among the victims of Sunday 's blast .
The Taleban claim to have influence across most of the country and have extended their area of control from their traditional heartland in the south .
They have a significant presence around Kandahar from where they carry out suicide attacks and roadside bomb blasts .
The militants are even able to operate freely in Wardak province , neighbouring the capital Kabul .
Last year , violence in Afghanistan reached its highest levels since the Taleban were forced from power in 2001 , analysts say .
But for several years , E.A. has been facing criticisms that it is not doing enough to create new hit games .
Its new chief executive , John Riccitiello , has vowed to turn that around and , indeed , the company says it has more new titles coming out this year than at any time in its history .
The Take Two bid has analysts asking whether E.A. is having so much trouble building new hits on its own that it must spend $ 2 billion for someone else ’s ideas .
To some , it suggests that the company faces more challenges in developing new hit games than it has let on .
“ The proposed acquisition of Take Two now opens the possibility that it comes from a place of weakness , which is a very different message than Electronic Arts has sent to the Street in the last month , ” said Evan Wilson , an industry analyst with Pacific Crest Securities , who has a hold rating on the shares of Take Two .
Daniel Ernst , an analyst with Soleil Hudson Square Research who has a $ 30 price target on Take Two ’s stock , said Electronic Arts could sorely use the new intellectual property .
He said that during the fiscal year ending next month , the video game industry will have grown 51 percent on a global basis , while E.A. will have grown only 25 percent .
Moreover , he argued , E.A. has had trouble developing breakaway hits and the quality of the company ’s new games has consistently lagged behind that of other publishers .
“ They have n’t created new franchises that bring new customers to them , ” he said .
Take Two has balked at E.A. ’s $ 26 - a- share offer , even though it is a 50 percent premium over the stock ’s closing price Friday of $ 17 a share .
Its executives said they would not even enter negotiations until April 29  the date of the release of Grand Theft Auto IV , the next iteration of the company ’s crown jewel .

Seeing classic arcade game machines lined up next to each other is an easy way to have a wave of nostalgia smack you in the face harder than a hurled barrel compliments of Donkey Kong himself .
It brings you back to a time when games were simple , fun , and fairly cheap to play for the most part .
Whether it was laughing at how all the enemies bullets traveled 75 % slower than your own or enjoying the cheesy digitized voices , there 's no denying the classic games had something special .
But there is something about arcade games that we do n't think gets enough credit .
While everybody has their picks for the best games , most people do n't give too much thought about the artistry that was put into the cabinets which held these games .
It is with that in mind that I - Mockery is paying tribute to what we consider to be the The 50 Greatest Arcade Cabinets In Video Game History !
Keep in mind , this list is n't ranking the games themselves , but the unique designs for the cabinets and cockpits which encased them .
Chances are , you 'll see some games on here that you 've never even heard of , and that 's likely because some of them sucked more than E.T. on the Atari 2600 .
But hey , at least their outer shell designs were damned nice to look at !
Furthermore , if there are some games you feel should be on the list , let us know and we might eventually add them !
# 50 : Space Invaders
Nobody can deny the desire to pop a quarter into this ol ' machine should they be lucky enough to spot it .
The inviting drawings on this cabinet helped catch people 's attention and made Space Invaders hugely successful .
What 's nice is how some of the artwork on the faceplate actually bleeds into the screen area .
At first glance you might think that it would be distracting but it 's not .
It just helps draw you into the game that much more .
And let 's be honest , it 's a very simple game and it's not like the artwork would be covering up some vital detail anyway .
Another noteworthy thing is that there is no joystick on this cabinet , the left & right movement controls are all buttons , just like the fire button .
# 49 : Crystal Castles
Crystal Castles tried a couple different things with this colorfully decorated cabinet .
Most arcade games used joysticks for moving the player around , especially when movement is limited to the four cardinal directions , along with their four half - and - half cousins .
Not Crystal Castles , though ; the designers decided that the player should have to use a trackball to navigate the grid - like mazes in the game .
It 's an ingenious way to make your game seem unique , while simultaneously drawing extra cash out of the customer by causing a lot of cheap game overs .
The game also came in a cocktail - style cabinet , in case you could convince someone else to join you in getting screwed out of your quarters .
Hey , at least the trackball was backlit .
That 's cool , right ?
# 48 : Crossbow
They used to have this game at an old roller rink in town .
The premise for the game is that you have to protect your friends from harm by picking off bad guys and flying debris with your trusty crossbow .
To fully immerse you in the game , you had to actually use a small mockup of a crossbow .
In a way , it was sort of like a primitive version of Silent Scope , except that there was no scope , just a couple notches in the thing that you lined up .
The point is , the game allowed children to finally experience the elegant killing power of a crossbow ( the H- bomb of the Middle Ages ) .
Incidentally , there was a sharp increase in the number of crossbow - related injuries around the time this game came out , and the politicians of the day sought to pin the blame on video games .
Frankly , I do n't see the connection .
# 47 : A.P.B .
Being a cop requires certain specialized equipment .
To that end , the designers of A.P.B. created a machine with a few special features to more accurately simulate the hectic life of a police officer .
The game is almost all driving , so it 's only natural that there be pedals and a steering wheel on the cabinet .
However , the game also included one of the most memorable features of a cop car : the lights .
Whenever you hit the " siren " button in the game , a set of red and blue lights at the top of the cabinet would begin flashing , giving you the chance to annoy and distract people from all the way on the other side of the arcade .
Thankfully , though , the actual siren itself was in - game only .
Also worth noting is that a platform seat could be attached to the cabinet , in case you felt your customers might not want to stand on one foot , with the other on the gas and / or brake , for an extended period of time
# 46 : Tapper
When making a simulator - type game , it is important that you nail down as many details of the experience as possible to completely immerse the player .
One of the most basic steps you can take is to include a controller that looks and feels just like the real thing .
That said , it 's just common sense that Tapper , a bartender simulator , would have an actual pour spout to let you get the full feel of life as a bartender .
Of course , you 're not much of a bartender , as you only serve beer at your bar , and you only serve one kind of beer : Budweiser .
Still , you got to experience bartender - dom in all of its glory .
The cabinet even came with drink holders and a brass railing so that you could play as a bartender while still enjoying the amenities afforded to those on the opposite side of the bar .
The bad news : no tips .
It should also be noted that there actually was an alternate version of this game created for more family - oriented places ( ie : Chuck - E - Cheese ) and was renamed " Root Beer Tapper " .
Unfortunately the nice add - ons such as the brass railing and drink holders were not included with this version of the game .
# 45 : Fonz
There are many motorcycle racing arcade games out there , but none of them were based on the most memorable character from " Happy Days " , Fonz !
In addition to having handlebar controls that functioned exactly like a real motorcycle , you had the Fonz giving you a big thumbs up on the side of the machine .
His visage alone makes this 1976 Sega classic worthy of our list .
Eeeeyyyyy !
# 44 : Two Tigers
Here 's another fun one from days past .
The idea was that you 'd sink your opponent 's battleship not by randomly guessing a letter and a number , but by blasting through it with bombs and flaming plane wreckage .
It even had steering controls just like an old - fashioned fighter plane , or so I assume .
Of course , it was a little hard to control the plane with these controls since the action took place from a side view , and not a cockpit view like you 'd expect from games with controls like this , but still , it added a certain degree of realism to the experience .
Not quite enough realism to offset the fact that you had an unlimited number of planes and that each one only flew about 10 miles an hour , but it was still fun .
# 43 : Bazooka
The game name ?
Bazooka .
Your controller ?
A bazooka .
Need I say more ?
# 42 : Super Off - Road
I 've said it before on this list , and I 'm bound to say it again : I generally do n't care for racing games .
The sitting down is nice , but rarely do arcade racing games come with comfy chairs .
Ivan " Ironman " Stewart saw this , and decided to save a little money on his racing game by simply doing away with uncomfortable plastic chairs and creating an entirely upright racing game .
To some , this must seem like a bad move .
Quite the contrary : indeed you are bound to get tired after standing for a while with one foot on the ground and the other tapping a squeaky metal pedal .
That 's where the " Ironman " part of the game comes into play .
It was a race within the game , and a test of endurance without .
One player toughs it out while his buddies crack from the strain and start mashing their " nitro " buttons , which merely leads to them slamming into the wall and griping about off - roading being a redneck sport .
No no , thank you , Mr. Stewart .
# 41 : Battlezone
Here 's an old school classic for you .
The wire frame tanks were cool , as were the nifty stickers for fake buttons carefully placed next to the real buttons that controlled your own tank ( which was actually designed in 128 - bit color with amazing texture detail and bump mapping , all of which went to waste when it was revealed that the game was entirely in the first person perspective ) .
However , some of the cabinets were designed to further sell the whole " tank of the future " motif .
Instead of having an ordinary , blasé screen , they had a sort of periscope view .
Normally , completely shutting out all outside light and subjecting your eyes to nothing but bright wire frames for long periods of time could be detrimental to your eyesight , but thankfully , the developers had the foresight to include open areas to the sides of the scope frame to let in some sunlight , and to let a few people look in on you to see if you were doing well or sucking out loud .
If Nintendo had remembered this little feature when they were designing their damned Virtual Boy , I might still be able to see the color red .
# 40 : Exterminator
Having a game where you use a digitized hand to smash digitized bugs in a digitized house was n't good enough for the designers of Exterminator .
They wanted the entire cabinet to be shaped like one of the houses in the game , right down to the roof and chimney .
It gave the game a very unique feeling , which was good because the cabinet could n't be made to play any other games besides Exterminator ( something that 's commonly done in arcades ) .
It was a very bold move .
It was n't a very popular move , especially since the cabinets themselves were pretty unreliable , but it was a bold move nonetheless .
# 39 : Title Fight
You kids today .
In my day , we did n't have a " Nintendo Wii " with motion - sensitive control sticks for our boxing games .
Oh no , we had our own kind of control " sticks " for our boxing games .
Take Title Fight , for example .
You had two joysticks , and each one was like a set of plastic brass knuckles that you would slam forward and backward in order to lay your opponent out on the canvas .
There probably were sound effects in this game , but I could never make them out over the loud banging of the joysticks as I mimicked the motions ( and enthusiasm ) of real professional boxers .
In a totally unrelated note , the local arcade was always sending their Title Fight machine away for repairs because somehow , the joysticks kept getting broken .
Probably some punk kids spilling their sodas all over the damn console .
I hate kids .
# 38 : Smash TV
Who does n't remember Smash TV ?
Altered Beast had " Wise fwom your gwabe " , and Smash TV had " Big money , big prizes , I love it ! "
Ok , I 'll admit it does n't have quite the same punch , but it was fitting , considering how many toasters and VCRs you could walk away with .
The thing that really took me by surprise back when I first saw this thing was that instead of having a joystick and a couple buttons for shooting , it had an unbelievable two joysticks : one for moving , and one for shooting in one of eight directions .
It was positively revolutionary .
So much so that I did n't even mind the fact that I was getting totally reamed in that game , and shelling out more than my fair share of quarters trying to find the " Pleasure Domes " , if you know what I mean .
# 37 : Laser Ghost
Lasers and ghosts were at long last brought together in this late 80's shooter .
The cabinet featured plastic guns affixed to the console just like all the other shooters from that era .
However , whereas other shooters could only fit two guns for two players onto the machine , Laser Ghost managed to squeeze a third gun in between the other two .
This meant your other friend did n't have to wait for either you or your friend to die before jumping in .
Unfortunately , the middle gun was much higher than the other two .
Some versions of the cabinet included seats for players 1 and 3 , and others included a seat for just player 2 , but either way , someone was going to be left standing when you played the game .
It was just a matter of figuring out which friend you liked least .
# 36 : Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles ( TMNT )
If you were at an arcade with both this game and The Simpsons , you had a tough choice ahead of you , but either way you were in for a lot of fun .
Now , the obvious thing to do would be to go with the TMNT game that four people could play , but they still made a number of cabinets designed for only two players .
That 's how you knew if you were in a cheap - ass arcade or not .
Anyway , the cabinet itself was decked out with images of the turtles , along with a couple actors portraying April and Shredder .
Were the artists unable to draw convincing human characters or did they think these photo actors would make the appearance of the game all the more impressive ?
Perhaps it was simply too hard to find the real ninja turtles for a photo shoot ?
Only Master Splinter knows such ancient secrets .
I 'm sure that this machine was the start of a highly lucrative modeling career for the girl who posed as April too .
Either way , it was a big , bright arcade machine that drew in gamers like pizza draws in turtles .
Ninja turtles .

Have health insurers been systematically cheating patients and doctors of fair reimbursement for medical services ?
That is the disturbing possibility raised by an investigation of the industry ’s arcane procedures for calculating “ reasonable and customary ” rates .
The investigation , by the New York State attorney general , Andrew Cuomo , and his staff , suggests that these procedures  used by major insurance companies to determine what they will pay when patients visit a doctor who is not in the company ’s network  may be rigged to shortchange the beneficiaries .
When patients visit an out - of - network doctor , insurers typically agree to pay 80 percent of the reasonable and customary rate charged by doctors in the same geographic area .
The patient is stuck with the rest , and as any patient knows , that rate always seems to fall short of what their own doctor is charging .
If the attorney general ’s investigators are right , we can understand why .
The numbers are mainly compiled by an obscure company known as Ingenix , which  as it turns out  is owned by UnitedHealth Group , one of the nation ’s largest health insurers .
Ingenix collects billing information from UnitedHealth and other health care payers to compile a database that is then used by the insurers to determine out - of - network reimbursement rates .

Following an announcement this week that the Japanese fast breeder nuclear reactor Monju would be reopened , activists have leaked suppressed video footage of the disaster that led to its closure in 1995 .
The infamous sodium spill , an accident that long ago earned itself a place in the history of nuclear power in Japan , has returned one more time to haunt government and industry officials with images they hoped would never return .
Named after the Buddhist divinity of wisdom , Monju , located in Japan 's Fukui prefecture , is Japan 's only fast - breeder reactor .
Unlike conventional reactors , fast - breeder reactors , which “ breed ” plutonium , use sodium rather than water as a coolant .
This type of coolant creates a potentially hazardous situation as sodium is highly corrosive and reacts violently with both water and air .
On December 8th , 1995 , 700 kg of molten sodium leaked from the secondary cooling circuit of the Monju reactor , resulting in a fire that made headlines across the country .
Although the accident itself did not result in a radiation leak , many argue that the sodium spill itself came very close to breaching Monju , a catastrophe which would have spilled plutonium into the environment .
Following the fire , officials at the government - owned Power Reactor and Nuclear Fuel Development Corporation ( PNC ) , operators of Monju , first played down the extent of damage at the reactor and denied the existence of a videotape showing the sodium spill .
Later , they released still shots only , showing things like intact pipes and clean floors and claiming that there had only been “ a minor leakage in the secondary sodium loop [ that had ] caused some fumes ” .
While short videos were released , these were edited to hide the full extent of the damage .
Further complicating the story , the deputy general manager of the general affairs department at the PNC , Shigeo Nishimura , 49 , jumped to his death the day after a news conference where he and other officials revealed the extent of the cover -up .
Starting from September of last year , Nishimura 's family brought the story back to light in a trial against the PNC at Japan 's High Court .
It is in this context that a never - before - seen video ( the so - called “ 2 o' clock video ” ) , which shows men in silver " space suits " exploring the reactor in which sodium compounds hang from the air ducts like icicles , has finally come out , first described a group called News for the People in Japan ( NPJ ) and also by Japanese lawyer Tokyodo at his blog .
The opening lines in the video provide some background :
“ 「 動燃が隠したもんじゅナトリウム漏れ事故直後の映像 いわゆる2時ビデオ 」 もんじゅナトリウム漏れ事故の直後動燃は職員を現場に入れナトリウム漏れの映像を撮影していた。
しかし、そのあまりの生々しさに動燃はこれを隠した。
動燃は隠した理由は「価値がないから」と説明した。 „
Video taken just after the sodium leak accident at Monju , hidden by the PNC - the so - called 2 o'clock video Just after the accident , the PNC sent employees to the site to film the leak .
However , due to the graphic nature of the footage , the PNC hid it .
The PNC explained that they hid it because “ it has no value ” .
“ あなたの目でなぜ動燃がこのビデオを隠したのか、判断して欲しい。 このビデオがもんじゅ（福井県）に隠されただけでなく、本社にもコピーが持ち込まれて隠されていたことが後に発覚した。 その釈明会見で嘘を発表することになった職員は会見直後自殺した。 彼を自殺に追いやったのは何だったのか…。そのことも考えてほしい。 „
With your own eyes , we want you to judge why the PNC hid the video .
This video was not only hidden at Monju ( Fukui Prefecture ) , it was also discovered later that there was another copy hidden at the head office .
An employee who had to lie at the press conference committed suicide right afterwards .
What was it that drove him to commit suicide …
Think about this .
In his blog entry , Japanese lawyer tokyodo - 2005 goes into more detail about the video :
“ 先日、この訴訟の口頭弁論が行われたが、西村さん側から大きな事実二つが主張された。 „
A trial hearing for the case was held the other day , and two major facts were claimed by Nishimura 's side .
[…]
“ 一つは、旧動燃が嘘をつき続けなければならなくなった２時ビデオの実態だ。 „
One is the truth of the “ 2 - o' clock video ” , about which the PNC had to keep lying .
[…]
“ ナトリウムが漏れて小さな山のようにたまっている様子もはっきり撮影されており、これでは、旧動燃が隠したいと思うのも仕方ないと思えた。これが隠されたことによって、次から次へと嘘をつかざるを得なくなり、その嘘が外側から剥がれることによって、もんじゅ廃炉の声が高まった。先日の法廷での上映はその嘘の核となったビデオ、動燃が隠さざるを得なかったビデオの実態を伝えた。 „
A small mountain of leaked sodium is clearly captured [ in the video ] , and it seems obvious why the PNC wanted to hide it .
Because this was hidden , they had no choice but to keep telling lies one after another , and as these lies were revealed , voices demanding the closure of the reactor grew louder .
At the court hearing , the truth of the video — the video which became the core of the lies , and which the PNC had no choice but to hide — was revealed .
“ 事故が起きたのは、平成７年１２月８日、ビデオが撮影されたのはそれから６時間後の９日午前２時、ダビングされたビデオが本
社に持ち込まれたのがその日の午後９時半。居合わせた社員はこれを視聴している。 „
The accident happened on December 8 , 1995 , and the video was filmed 6 hours later at 2 a.m. on December 9 .
A copy of the video was brought to the head office on the same day at 9:30 p.m .
All the employees present watched this video .
[…]
“ ここで、西村さんは２時ビデオが本社に持ち込まれていたことが分かったのは、１２月２５日だと答える予定だったが、なぜか、１月１０日だと答えてしまった。 „
Here , Nishimura was supposed to say that they found out about the 2 - o' clock video having been brought to the head office on December 25 , but instead for some reason he said it happened on January 10 . [… ]
[…]
“ そこで、西村さんは、自分で自分の口をふさぐしかなくなったのだろう。冒頭の遺書のようにすべてを自分のミスという形にして自殺した。 „
Nishimura must have no choice but to silence his own tongue .
As in the will mentioned at the beginning of this entry , he made it out so that everything was his mistake when he committed suicide .
“ もんじゅはまもなく再開されようとしている。果たして西村さんを死に追いやった隠蔽体質は改善されているのか。少なくとも西村さんの裁判ですべてを明らかにして反省しようとする姿勢はまったく感じられない…。西村さんは命をかけて、ある意味、もんじゅを救ったが、西村さんは自分のような犠牲者が続くことは望んでいないはずだ。 „
Monju is soon going to be reopened .
Has their habit of covering up — which pushed Nishimura to suicide — been improved ?
There does n't seem to be an attitude of attempting to reveal everything in court and reflecting on what happened ….
Nishimura might have saved Monju with his death , but it is doubtful he would have wanted others victims to follow .
More information about the re-opening of Monju can be found at at World Nuclear News .
Wikileaks will release a second video on Monday .
I really have mixed feelings about the outcome of yesterday ’s Super Bowl .
It was a fantastic game , no matter who you were rooting for , and that ’s always nice .
Historically a lot of Super Bowls have been yawners .
I was n’t really pulling for the Giants so much as I was against the Patriots , and that was tough for me , too .
See , when you look at how New England does things , they really get a lot right .
No prima donnas .
We , not me .
Brains and teamwork trump individual athleticism .
Etc .
In essence , they have won by repudiating everything that ’s wrong about sports in this day and age .
They ’re the San Antonio Spurs of the NFL .
As an old - school guy who was raised by an even older - school grandfather , this matters to me .
He was one of those guys who grew up through the Depression and who actually did walk six miles to school each day .
People who knew him way back when thought that in a different day and age he might have been good enough to make it to the bigs in baseball , but the hard realities of life intervened .
At my house , sportsmanship mattered .
Losing right was preferred to winning wrong .
Education was more important that sports .
And you did it right or you did n’t play .
Period .
There was no compromise on any of this .
So despite my appreciation for The Patriot Way , I was more than a little distressed by revelations earlier this year that Bill Belichick , the architect of the program , had intentionally , willfully and with malice aforethought broken the rules of the game .
I do n’t care whether or not a significant advantage was gained .
I do n’t care whether or not you think other teams do it to ( around here , proof carries more weight than paranoid conspiracy theory ) .
I do n’t care if others do n’t see it this way .
All I care about is that the man established a clever process for cheating .
Bill Belicheat .
Given how people tend to operate , I ’m skeptical that the instance he got busted for this year was the only time he ’s cheated , especially in light of reports bubbling up that he did it to St. Louis before the 2002 Super Bowl .
Am I being unfair here and violating my own rule about proof ?
Put it this way .
When you do what we now know he did , you forfeit any presumption of innocence .
Even if this is the only time in your life you broke a rule , you have given away your right and ability to call on your reputation .
I understand the rage in Bob Lefsetz ’s rant in today ’s e-mail newsletter :
But we live in a country of pussy penalties , everyone must be given multiple chances , because otherwise the ECONOMY might suffer !
It ’s all about the money …
And I do n’t want to say today ’s game had nothing to do with bread , but I felt a righting of the solar system , a giant correction factor .
Reverse the curse ?
After Bill Clinton lied , the truth was for losers .
Mr. Smith got kicked out of not only Washington , but the courtroom , everywhere in America .
We live in a nation of lying , cheating scumbags .
Especially those with power .
There ’s no honor , just spacious houses and expensive automobiles …
But , FINALLY , that old axiom held true …
CHEATERS NEVER PROSPER !
The Patriots lost .
Could n’t happen to a more smug crew .
I ca n’t say that I love the Giants , not since Y.A. Tittle and Ally Sherman , but I think you play the game with all you ’ve got , you do n’t fight for an illegal edge , and if you happen to lose , well NOBODY ALWAYS WINS !
Enron .
Bernie Ebbers .
Joe Nacchio .
Dennis Koslowski .
The Rigas .
Is Bellicheat in their league ?
Well , his taping of the Jets , his alleged taping of the Rams and whatever else he may have done did n’t destroy anyone ’s pension , so maybe not .
But we ’re a nation of sport and the NFL is one of our most prominent morality plays .
It ’s symbolic , and what happens in our major sports teaches us , and especially our kids , lessons that will endure for as long as they live .
Think your kids are n’t learning from Barry Bonds , Roger Clemens and the Mitchell Report ?
NFL Commish Roger Goodell went too light on the Pats and his behavior of late makes me wonder if he ’s trying to make a looming scandal go away for the good of the league ’s image bottom line .
Do n’t know , but time will tell .
In any case , it ’s good when we see cheaters failing to prosper .
I hate it for a class act like Junior Seau , who may have seen his last shot at a ring die with David Tyree ’s epic catch , but this is a small price to pay for an important lesson .
If you ’re a parent , I hope you ’ll make the most of this teachable moment in sports history .
According to the latest NPD group report , during the month of December Blu-ray players held 60 percent of the HD media player market -- despite the fact that HD DVD players were considerably cheaper .
While that might 've helped Warner in its decision to go Blu , the move has definitely had a dramatic effect on player sales since .
According to the same study the week after the announcement , Blu-ray players were able to grab 93 percent of the market , which puts the year to date ( short , we know ) share for Blu-ray players at 70 percent .
Granted , it 's hard to put too much stock in just a week or two of data , but if this and the recent media sales numbers ( 85 percent ) becomes a trend , maybe this wo n't be such a slow death for HD DVD after all [ Via Blu-ray.com
It beggars belief .
Polls show the president ’s support at less than 30 percent nationally — in not one single state does even 50 percent approve of him .
Yet he retains enough of his beloved “ political capital ” to plan an attack on another country for reasons other than defensive .
Bush was expected to be a lame duck president by this point .
But the Democratic congress has seen to it that he ’s been fitted with a prosthetic wing .
In part , that ’s because the prospect of thousands , tens of thousands or even hundreds of thousands Iranians killed is n’t enough to inspire the American public to voice its opposition to attacking Iran .
But maybe the prospect of a like number of Americans losing their jobs because of an attack on Iran will .
Here ’s how to explain it to family and friends who either do n’t believe Bush & Co. would be crazy enough to launch another capricious war or do n’t care .
Oil is already approaching $ 100 a barrel .
Now imagine that price doubled — not in a decade , but overnight .
That scenario is considered likely if Iran attacks or blockades oil shipping in the Persian Gulf .
Also bear in mind it contains the world ’s largest offshore oil field , which would be equally vulnerable to disruption .
Now imagine your home - heating bill and the price you pay at the gas pump reflecting the post - attack price of a barrel of oil .
Then envision your employer experiencing the same alarm , but amplified by the size of his facilities , as well as transportation costs .
Now imagine him facing up to his inability to pay his fuel bills .
Next , see bossman downsize or shut his doors .
Never mind trying to appeal to a dormant altruistic streak in Americans .
Heck , we ca n’t even get worked up about the likelihood that our own soldiers in Iraq would suffer blowback for an attack on Iran .
Americans need to be made to understand that , before we know what hit us , one out of say , seven of us may wind up unemployed and unable to support our families .
Once aware , Americans might be more willing to call their congress members and inform them of their opposition to an attack on Iran .
For those who do n’t know their representatives or senators ’ numbers ( okay , or even their names ) send them to Visi.com .
Of course , some believe Iran is on the verge of developing nuclear weapons or that it ’s supplying Iraq with the latest in IEDs .
To them , disabling a supposed foe may be worth the risk of losing their livelihoods .
More power to them .

As you probably could already tell by reading this blog , I tend to focus on doing things the smart way .
In life , there are always two ways to do things : the smart way and the dumb way .
The dumb way , unfortunately ,
Yesterday , we looked into how gamers are dealing with the lack of extra Rock Band instruments .
Today , it has been announced that the going may get easier for people looking to put together a full band : Mad Catz is now officially licensed to produce Rock Band peripherals .
" This agreement with MTV Games represents a natural opportunity for Mad Catz to combine our core competencies of producing and distributing high - quality accessories with the entertaining experience of Rock Band ’s interactive controllers , " said Darren Richardson , president and chief executive officer of Mad Catz , in a statement .
" Mad Catz will produce premium instruments , allowing gamers and music fans to experience music in an entirely new light while taking on the personality of their favorite music idols . "
Expect the first products to hit in the first half of 2008 , around the same time first - party guitars and drums will be released .
I 've had very uneven luck with Mad Catz peripherals ; most people I speak to do n't bother with the risk and buy first - party when possible .
Unless the instruments are demonstrably cheaper or come with new features , Mad Catz may have a rough time convincing the market to buy its products for Rock Band .
Around 30 people were in attendance at an “ Impeach for Peace ” party , at the home of Jan Willms in Saint Paul .
The party was co-hosted by Tina Buggs .
Attendees included long - time Impeach for Peace members , as well as several new faces .
Sen . Ellen Anderson , DFL , and Michael Cavlan , a senatorial candidate from the Green Party , both spoke .
Dan Fearn , a member of Veterans for Peace , also talked about the impeachment plan .
Mikael Rudolph , founder of the Minneapolis chapter of World Ca n’t Wait , Impeach for Peace.org , explained to guests the mission of the group .
A table of literature was also available .
A late arrival viewed the movie “ How to Impeach a President . ”
The event brought together veteran activists , Greens , DFLs and independents .
The purpose of our group was well defined and passed along to others .
People seemed to want to talk and exchange ideas , but I think a recommendation for the next event would be to stage a screening of “ How to Impeach a President . ”

It is a peaceful resting place for 350,000 souls - an historic graveyard which now serves as a nature reserve .
But plans are afoot to dig up the ancient graves at Tower Hamlets Cemetery - and reopen it as a 21st century burial site .
Officially it would be known as a " multi- faith " cemetery but it is likely that it would principally answer calls for a Muslim graveyard in the largely - Asian East London borough .
Scroll down for more ...
The local newspaper has been bombarded with letters from historians and nature lovers declaring : " There is no way we 'll allow them to dig up our ancestors . "
But the Labour - controlled council 's environment spokesman Abdal Ullah appeared to be in no doubt about the feasibility of the plan when he said : " To preserve the respect and dignity for everyone , I think most of the graves would have to be cleared out and we 'd start afresh . "
He said a corner of the cemetery would be reserved for Muslims who are buried in shrouds at a depth of 6ft and on their side facing Mecca .
By law , any graves more than 75 years old can be removed .
At the cemetery yesterday , liaison officer Ken Greenway - the only paid member of staff tending the 33 - acre site - said he was astonished that anyone would even contemplate such a move .
" I 'm against it and I have to stand up for that because of the huge value of this site today , " he added .
" It 's a beautiful haven for wildlife and people . "
The City of London and Tower Hamlets Cemetery was opened in 1841 by an Act of Parliament .
During the Second World War it was bombed five times and some headstones still bear the marks of shrapnel hits .
Scroll down for more ...
Other markers have gone altogether , torn down when the graveyard was deconsecrated as a Church of England cemetery by another Act of Parliament in 1966 when it was deemed to be full .
The intention was to create an open space for the public , which led to two bomb - damaged chapels being demolished and a swathe of graves cleared .
In 1986 ownership passed from the Greater London Council to Tower Hamlets and in 1990 the Friends of the Tower Hamlets Cemetery Park was set up .
Seven years ago the park became the borough 's first nature reserve and it is now tended by 1,600 volunteers .
It is home to 27 species of butterfly , a rare bumble bee , woodpeckers , sparrowhawks and the elusive firecrest .
Some 8,000 schoolchildren visit every year for outdoor nature lessons .
Professor David Bellamy , who is patron of the Friends of Tower Hamlets Cemetery Park , said : " Tower Hamlets Cemetery is still a place of peace and reflection as it has been since it was saved from becoming just another part of East London 's urban sprawl .
" Now in its new guise as a local nature reserve and green lung , people of every colour , creed and kind share their humanity with that of other living things .
" I can only pray that the wisdom of all faiths can together discover the right way ahead for this very special part of East London 's heritage . "
Last night the council was insisting there were no plans to re-open the park as a cemetery .
" It is a popular and historic nature park and if there were any proposalsto alter the look or the functionality , there would be a full consultation with interested parties , " said a spokesman .
However the council admitted it had been looking at " options " for burial sites .
And Lib Dem group leader Stephanie Eaton said she had received a letter from the council chief executive admitting the park was one of the options being considered .
WASHINGTON --
Fifty years ago this week , America was shaken out of technological complacency by a beeping 180 - pound aluminum ball orbiting overhead .
Sputnik was a shock because we had always assumed that Russia was nothing but a big , lumbering and all - brawn bear .
He could wear down the Nazis and produce mountains of steel but had none of our savvy or sophistication .
Then one day we wake up and he beats us into space , placing overhead the first satellite to orbit the Earth since God placed the moon where it could give us lovely sailing tides .
At the time , all thoughts were about the Soviets overwhelming us technologically .
But the panic turned out to be unwarranted .
Sputnik was not subtle science .
The Soviets were making up for their inability to miniaturize nuclear warheads -- something that does require sophistication -- by developing massive rockets .
And they had managed to develop one just massive enough to hurl a ball into Earth orbit .
We had no idea how lucky we were with Sputnik .
The subsequent panic turned out to be an enormous boon .
The fear of falling behind the Communists induced the federal government to pour a river of money into science and math education .
The result was a generation of scientists who gave us not only Apollo and the moon , but the sinews of the information age -- for example , ARPA that created ARPANET that became the Internet -- that have assured American technological dominance to this day .
There was another lucky outcome of Sputnik .
Two years earlier , President Eisenhower had proposed " Open Skies " under which the U.S. and Russia would permit spy - plane overflights so each would know the other 's military capabilities .
The idea was to reduce mutual uncertainty and strengthen deterrence .
Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev rejected the idea out of hand .
The advent of the orbiting satellite circumvented the objection .
By 1960 , we had launched our first working spy satellite .
But our greatest luck was the fact that the Soviets got to space first .
Sputnik orbiting over the United States -- and Eisenhower never protesting a violation of U.S. sovereignty -- established forever the principle that orbital space is not national territory but is as free and open as the high seas .
Had we beaten the Russians into orbit -- and we were only a few months behind -- Khrushchev might very well have protested our presence over sovereign Soviet territory and reserved the right to one day ( the technology was still years away ) shoot us down .
Sputnik and the space age it launched had one other curious , wholly unexpected effect .
Before Sputnik , while still dreaming about outer space in science fiction , we always assumed that one step would create the hunger for the next -- ever outward from Earth orbit to the moon to Mars and beyond .
Not so .
It took only 12 years to go from Sputnik to the moon , on which we jumped about for a brief interlude and then , amazingly , abandoned .
There are technological , budgetary and political reasons to explain this .
But the most profound is psychological .
It 's cold out there .
" In the Shadow of the Moon " is a magnificent new documentary of the remembrances of some of those very few human beings who have actually gone to the moon .
They talk , as you 'd expect , about the wonder and beauty and grandeur of the place .
But some also recall the coldness of that desolation .
One astronaut tells how on the moon 's surface he was seized with the realization that he and his crewmate were utterly alone ( BEG ITAL ) on an entire world ( END ITAL ) .
On Earth , you can be wandering a forbidding desert but always with the hope that there might be something human over the horizon .
On the moon there is nothing but dust and rock , forever .
And then -- just about all the astronauts talk about this -- you look up and see this beautiful blue marble , warm and fragile , hanging in the black lunar sky .
And you long for home .
The astronauts brought back that image in the famous photo , " Earthrise " -- and , with it , that feeling of longing .
That iconic image did not just help spur the environmental movement .
With surpassing irony , it created at the very dawn of the space age a longing not for space , but for home .
This is perhaps to be expected for a 200,000 - year - old race of beings leaving its crib for the first time .
We will , however , outgrow that fear .
It was 115 years from Columbus to the Jamestown colony .
It will take about that same span of time for a new generation -- ours is too bound to Earth -- to go out and not look back .

Bush admits telecoms spied John Byrne and Nick Juliano

Print This Email This In Oval Office address , president pledges veto of any temporary FISA expansions
Well , he finally dropped the " allegedly . "
President Bush at long last admitted what everyone has suspected for years -- the nation 's telecommunications companies closely cooperated with the National Security Agency and his administration to implement large - scale spying on Americans .
Bush was praising the Senate for approving his long - sought update to a foreign surveillance law .
Critics say the bill legalizes his warrantless wiretapping program , which was implemented outside the boundaries of the law , and frees phone and internet companies from any responsibility for violating customers ' privacy .
" The senate bill also provides fair and just liability protections for companies that did the right thing and assisted in defending America , after the attacks of Sept. 11 , " Bush said .
As recently as his State of the Union address , Bush would only call for legal immunity for companies " believed to have assisted " in his so - called Terrorist Surveillance Program .
Bush 's admission came a day after his press secretary similarly acknowledged phone company cooperation .
Also Tuesday , the Director of National Intelligence sought to suppress as " Top Secret " evidence of a phone conversation between a telecom company representative and a DNI lawyer .
Speaking from the Oval Office Wednesday morning , Bush threw down the gauntlet and issued a stern warning to the House .
He admonished the chamber for failing to rubber - stamp the White House approved bill , which 18 Democrats joined every Republican and Joe Lieberman to do Tuesday .
Democrats in the House , on the other hand , approved a bill updating the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance without granting legal immunity .
Bush has pleged to veto any bill without immunity , and he said Tuesday that he would not accept any more temporary FISA extensions .
By midnight Saturday , when a stop - gap extension expires , Bush said he will get what he wants or do nothing to stop what he says are vital gaps in intelligence collection re-open .
On the eve of a vote to give telephone companies immunity for their alleged participation in the National Security Agency 's warrantless wiretap program , White House spokesperson Dana Perino admitted that the companies actually spied .
Because they were patriotic .
" The telephone companies that were alleged to have helped their country after 9/11 did so because they are patriotic and they certainly helped us and they helped us save lives , " Perino told reporters at Tuesday 's press briefing .
The admission , while possibly a verbal slip - up , was first noticed by Ryan Singer , of Wired .
The Senate gave the phone companies immunity by a 69 - 29 vote .
It passed wiretapping bill in its entirety just before 6 pm ET , 68 - 29 .
Earlier this afternoon , the immunity measure 's staunchest opponent , Sen. Chris Dodd ( D - CT ) , announced he would abandon his effort to block the bill with a filibuster , arguing that the House , which has passed an immunity - free bill , would be a better place to try to strip immunity from Congress 's final piece of legislation .
" We lost every single battle we had on this bill , " Dodd said on a conference call Tuesday with reporters and bloggers .
" And the question is now , Can we do better with the House carrying the ball on this bill ? "
The bill to update the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act , including a provision granting retroactive immunity to telecommunications companies that facilitated government spying , passed the Senate on a 68 - 29 vote Tuesday evening .
The 40 - year - old DJ has been with Radio 1 since 1998
The DJ - real name Raymond Bingham - was arrested in November 2007 for flying in for a nightclub gig with 2.16g of cannabis in his luggage .
Bingham denied smuggling drugs , claiming he had left the cannabis in a trouser pocket and forgotten about it .
" Grooverider has paid a very high price for a serious mistake , " a spokesman for Radio 1 said .
The 40 - year - old has been with the station since 1998 and hosted the weekend drum ' n ' bass show with fellow DJ Fabio .
' Ridiculous ' arrest
The programme , which has broadcast without him since his arrest , will continue under the title Radio 1's Drum ' n ' Bass Show With Fabio .
Grooverider had been employed on a freelance basis and has not been paid by the station since November .
Four years is the minimum sentence for drug trafficking in the UAE .
In the last 12 months , 64 British nationals have been arrested in the UAE for drugs offences
The DJ , who called his arrest " ridiculous " in an interview last month , has two weeks to appeal .
" I must have forgotten the spliff , " he said in the interview .
" It was a small amount .
Back home I would not even get prosecuted . "
It seems like they were only yesterday , but do you realize how bad the 90s were ?
There were the 80s hair bands hanging around way past their use by dates , some terrible one hit wonders , and oh yes , David Hasselhoff .
So settle yourself in for a look at some of the most awful , and most hilarious , music videos from the 1990s .
“ Hooked on a Feeling ” by David Hasselhoff
You ’ve got to hand it to David Hasselhoff .
This song may be terrible , and the video may contain some of the worst special effects I ’ve ever seen , but it ’s so entertaining !
See The Hoff fly like a superhero , become an Eskimo , and dance with Masai warriors , all in the one video .
“ Burger Man ” by ZZ Top
This is one of ZZ Top ’s lesser known hits , and with good reason .
I ’m not sure what they were smoking when they penned a song called Burger Man , and then decided the clip needed a Burger Monster , but here it is .
Make sure you watch right to the end for the Burger Monster ’s spectacular demise .
“ Cherry Pie ” by Warrant
At the time I thought this was a great song with a great clip .
Now as I watch it back it makes me skin crawl .
It features those hair band has - beens Warrant and as many blatant sexual references as they could cram into one music video .
Creepy stuff .
“ I ’m Too Sexy ” by Right Said Fred
Now I know I ’m Too Sexy was written as a parody of the fashion industry .
But watching lead singer Richard Fairbrass strut around makes me believe he really does think he ’s too sexy for his shirt , his cat , and your party .
He ’s not .
“ Ice Ice Baby ” by Vanilla Ice
Long before the world embraced white rap with Eminem , we had Vanilla Ice .
Why was n’t he shown the same respect ?
Was it that neatly coiffed hair ?
The choreographed dance moves ?
Or perhaps those terrible lyrics ?
Watching this film clip , it all comes flooding back to me .
The two party system in America is responsible for all the war , loss of civil liberties , the capture of our mass media by corporate ownership and the outsourcing of American industries to foreign lands .
The two party system has failed America by catering to the mega - wealthy that finance their political campaigns and allows them to bank offshore in tax - havens that hide taxable income from our government with no fear of repercussion .
The Democrats and Republicans for all of their blustering talk in Congress have continued to vote in lockstep and bring this nation to the brink of bankruptcy .
During the period after 9/11 we have seen our civil liberties abrogated .
The Patriot Act , which allows a search of your residence without you being there or your knowledge if you are declared a “ suspected terrorist , The Military Commission Act of 2006 , which allows “ interrogation up to the point of organ failure and psychological interrogation as long as a mental breakdown lasts no longer than a few months , The Insurrection Act that eliminates posse commitatus , the amendment that says the Federal Government cannot use Federal troops for Law Enforcement , that only the Governors of the States can do that under state control , The Presidential directives especially PD 51 that gives the President control of all three branches in the event of a National Emergency , the bill now in the Senate S 1959 the so - called “ Thought Control Bill ” that can hold people responsible for getting others to incite violence through what they read on the internet .
The end run around the FISA
Act that would have allowed the President to authorize eavesdropping on suspected terrorists as long as they gave the court a warrant three days after the fact , and Congress has allowed this law - breaking by the President .
We have also seen a War in Iraq and a War in Afghanistan that has cost this nation over 5,000 lives in what the government will admit to , while the real death toll is at least 15.000 but once the casualty is medivac’d he or she is not counted as a casualty of the war .
Both parties threaten each other and offer great debates on C - SPAN for our benefit , while colluding with each other to maximize profits for themselves and their corporate sponsor’s .
We sit silently watching C - Span and root for “ our ” side , but when the roll call is made we see a lopsided vote , and the most virulent speakers cave - in and vote for bills authorizing the use of force , declaring another nation ’s military a “ terrorist ” organization , authorizing more war funds , and creating a new bureaucracy like The Department of Homeland Security that does nothing but gobble up taxpayer ’s money .
The Democratic candidates save Mike Gravel , Dennis Kucinich and John Edwards are married to the corporate structure of this country .
It is ridiculous to believe that any save Ron Paul and the three I mentioned above doing anything different than what is being done now .
This is the truth , the whole truth and nothing but the truth , the long and short of it , so to speak .
Anyone that believes we can change this nation and push back what has transpired by working within the two party system is deluded .
I myself would love to run for Congress from my district in South Carolina .
How do you think that would work out for me ?
I could have the most remarkable platform , appeal to both Democrats and Republicans , and I would be laughed out of the room .
I know no one and I do n’t have ten years to “ cultivate ” backers .
Either do the rest of the people in this country save those that are already entrenched in corporate party politics .
My opinion is that John Edwards will ramp up his rhetoric .
I believe Ron Paul will run as an Independent , he has the money and the momentum .
I am waiting to hear Edwards get in the ring and truly speak “ Truth to Power ” .
If he ca n’t do it under the Democratic banner then he should also run as an independent .
If Edwards and Paul both run as Independents , we will have effectively destroyed the two - party system and let the best man win .
If this happens , I will run as an Independent for Congress from South Carolina .
The two - party system has to go .
If Edwards stays his course and does n’t make a huge issue of civil liberties and an end to foreign involvement , we should all back Ron Paul .
Whatever happens , we all have a vested interest in breaking the two - party system .
That ’s the way I see it .
,
On Thursday , Rep. Dennis Kucinich might actually swing the results of the caucus , which is why I 'm passing this along .
Kucinich 's supporters could help Obama in non-liberal precincts where the two or three Kucinich supporters could wind up enlarging Obama 's preference groups just enough to get that extra delegate ...
Note : Last cycle , the Edwards and Kucinich campaigns agreed to tell their supporters to join each other 's preference groups if one or the other did n't make " threshold . "
Edwards advisers now believe that the deal hurt them more than it helped them .
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
Tuesday , January 01 , 2008
DES MOINES , IAâ € “ Democratic Presidential candidate and Ohio Congressman Dennis Kucinich opened the New Year by publicly asking his Iowa supporters to vote for him in the caucuses this Thursday , and suggesting that if he did not make the 15 % threshold , their second ballot should be for Senator Barack Obama .
" This is obviously an ' Iowa - only ' recommendation , as Sen. Obama and I are competing in the New Hampshire primary next Tuesday where I want to be the first choice of New Hampshire voters .
" I hope Iowans will caucus for me as their first choice this Thursday , because of my singular positions on the war , on health care , and trade .
This is an opportunity for people to stand up for themselves .
But in those caucus locations where my support does n't reach the necessary threshold , I strongly encourage all of my supporters to make Barack Obama their second choice .
Sen . Obama and I have one thing in common : Change . "

Summary
Classified SECRET consolidated US Forces Rules of Engagement ( ROE ) for Iraq .
On first reading , the document contains a number of items of interest to the press , including rules about mosque attacks , detention of immams , cross border incursions ( including Iran and Syria ) , the use of mines and riot control agents , terrorist targeting , the destruction of Iraqi government property used by insurgents and even kafkaesque rules for attacks on WMD mobile production labs .
Deeper reading by those more familiar with the US - Iraq war is likely to reveal other items of interest , for instance variations in the declaration that Al Quds , the Mahdi Army and armed supporters of Muqtada Al - Sadr are enemies who may be engaged at will .
The document forms a talking point to most US operations in Iraq and the degree of official sanction for them .
For example the Jan 10 2008 New York Times article on Blackwater CS gas [ tear gas ] use :
may be compared with this earlier Wikileaks investigtaion :
and Chemical Weapons Convention related rules ( Riot Control Agents - RTAs ) specified in the Rules of Engagement .
The ROE classification date is 2005 - 10 - 03 .
However ROEs change slowly over time and the current ROE is likely quite similar to the document described here .
The document comes from the same courageous national security whistleblower " Peryton " who disclosed Guantanamo bay 's main manuals and a classified report on Fallujah , all of which were independently verified and released by Wikileaks in December 2007 ( U.S lost Fallujah 's info war ) and associated links )
A few words on classification and distribution :
" ( U ) " means unclassified " ( C ) " means classified CONFIDENTIAL " ( S ) " means classified SECRET " REL " means " release " " IRQ " means " IRAQ " " MCFI " means Multi Coalition Force Iraq
" DISPLAY ONLY TO IRQ " likely means that cleared ( to a level of SECRET ) Iraqi personnel can only view the document and not retain it .
FRAGO means " Fragmentary Order " , " OPORD " means " operating order " .
On legitimacy :
The ROE comes from ' Peryton ' a national security whistleblower who has supplied a number of other classified or For Official Use Only documents , two of which have been publicly verified by the US military :
and one of which attracted a " no comment " , but was subsequently privately verified by UPI 's national security correspondent Shaun Waterman :
Wikileaks has privately verified the ROE and several other documents from this source with our contacts and no document Wikileaks has released from this source has ever been questioned .
The material is also in harmony with the public record .
We stand by the document .
On motivation , Peryton has shown that they are primarily motivated by ethical concerns and the press has always found something important in their material , e.g :
Declassification dates are almost always on 10 or 25 year boundaries .
SECRET//.../20151003 " ( year - month - day ) is a standard marking which specifies the declassification date .
Simply subtract 10 years to obtain the classification date ( 2005 - 10-03 ) .

Green city planned for the desert
Enlarge Image
The Gulf state describes the five - year initiative as " the most ambitious sustainability project ever launched by a government " .
Components will include the world 's largest hydrogen power plant .
The government has also announced plans for a " sustainable city " , housing about 50,000 people , that will produce no greenhouse gases and contain no cars .
The $ 15 bn fund , which the state hopes will lead to international joint ventures involving much more money , is being channelled through the Masdar Initiative , a company established to develop and commercialise clean energy technologies .
It shows that you can generate hydrogen without carbon release from fossil fuels
Professor Keith Guy
Powering up for hydrogen
" Our ability to adapt and respond to these realities will ensure that Abu Dhabi 's global energy leadership as well as our own growth and development continues . "
Technology bridge
The portfolio of technologies eligible for funding under the Masdar Initiative is extensive , but solar energy is likely to be a major beneficiary .
The hydrogen plant , meanwhile , will link the world 's currently dominant technology , fossil fuel burning , with two technologies likely to be important in a low - carbon future - carbon sequestration and hydrogen manufacture .
Hydrogen will be manufactured from natural gas by reactions involving steam , producing a mixture of hydrogen and carbon dioxide .
President Bush 's administration is also pumping money into hydrogen
When hydrogen is burned , it produces no CO2 .
Eventually hydrogen made this way could be used in vehicles , though in Abu Dhabi it will generate electricity .
" It 's important because it shows that you can generate hydrogen without carbon release from fossil fuels , " commented Keith Guy , an engineering consultant and professor at the UK's Bath University .
" When you look at how hydrogen could be made economically , the route that many people have been looking at , through electrolysis of water , is incredibly expensive . "
The Masdar Sustainable City , another component of the Abu Dhabi government 's plans which is being designed with input from the environmental group WWF , is envisaged as a self - contained car - free zone where all energy will come from renewable resources , principally solar panels to generate electricity .
Buildings will be constructed to allow air in but keep the Sun 's heat out .
Wind towers will ventilate homes and offices using natural convection .
The fund and the Masdar City plans were formally unveiled at the World Future Energy Summit in Abu Dhabi .

Low - energy bulbs contain a small amount of mercury
Disposing of bulbs safely
It says because the bulbs contain small amounts of mercury , more information about safe recycling is needed .
It also wants health warnings printed on packaging and information on how to clear up smashed bulbs in the home .
But a toxicologist has played down the risks , saying several bulbs would have to be smashed at once to pose a danger .
Toxic substance
Environmental scientist Dr David Spurgeon said : " Because these light bulbs contain small amounts of mercury they could cause a problem if they are disposed of in a normal waste - bin .
" It is possible that the mercury they contain could be released either into the air or from land - fill when they are released into the wider environment .
" That 's a concern , because mercury is a well known toxic substance . "
If you broke five bulbs in a small unventilated room then you might be in short term danger
Dr David Ray , toxicologist
Official advice from the Department of the Environment states that if a low - energy bulb is smashed , the room needs to be vacated for at least 15 minutes .
A vacuum cleaner should not be used to clear up the debris , and care should be taken not to inhale the dust .
Instead , rubber gloves should be used , and the broken bulb put into a sealed plastic bag - which should be taken to the local council for disposal .
Unbroken used bulbs can be taken back to the retailer if the owner is a member of the Distributor Takeback Scheme .
Otherwise , many local waste disposal sites now have the facilities to safely collect and dispose of old bulbs .
However , this advice is not printed on the packaging that low - energy bulbs are sold in .
Toxicologist Dr David Ray , from the University of Nottingham , said about 6 - 8 mg of mercury was present in a typical low - energy bulb , which he described as a " pretty small amount " .
" Mercury accumulates in the body - especially the brain , " he said .
" The biggest danger is repeated exposure - a one off exposure is not as potentially dangerous compared to working in a light bulb factory .
" If you smash one bulb then that is not too much of a hazard .
However , if you broke five bulbs in a small unventilated room then you might be in short term danger . "
Information campaign
Adrian Harding of the Environment Agency said : " More information does need to be made available by retailers , local authorities and the government to alert people to the best way of dealing with these products when they become waste . "
Louise Molloy from the environmental group Greenpeace said that a public information campaign was needed in order to advise people how to dispose of low - energy bulbs safely .
But she added : " Rather than being worried about the mercury these light bulbs contain , the general public should be reassured that using them will actually reduce the amount of mercury overall in our atmosphere . "
The lighting industry and the government say the risk of mercury pollution posed by low - energy bulbs is minimal .
Kevin Verdun of the Lighting Association said : " Fluorescent strips , like the ones used in garages and kitchens , also contain mercury and have been used for many years without poisoning anyone . "
But he said that warnings on how to safely dispose of smashed bulbs " might " be put on packaging in future , if the government and the public demanded it .
This month shops in the UK will begin the process of phasing out traditional tungsten bulbs as part of a government plan to completely replace them by 2011 .
Ministers hope that using the more environmentally - friendly bulbs will save at least save 5 m tonnes - worth of carbon dioxide emissions every year .
It 's neck and neck between Clinton and Obama in New Hampshire and Iowa .
And here 's a fascinating glimpse of the choice :
The poll finds a divide in support for Clinton and Obama among age groups , with about two out of five voters age 18 to 44 in both states saying they favor Obama and about the same margin of Democratic voters age 65 and above backing Clinton , though Edwards gets a similar margin of support from that group in Iowa .
Furthermore , Clinton continues to hold onto support from older women .
In Iowa , she gets 43 percent of the vote from women age 45 and over , twice as much as Edwards and Obama .
The numbers are similar in New Hampshire .
It 's between the older generation versus the younger ; those afraid of the Republican machine and those who want to transcend that bitter struggle .
I liked this rationale for Clinton :
" You ca n't sit across the table from somebody all those years and not talk business , " says Klenske , 81 .
" If you 're a farmer 's wife you pretty much know as much about operating a farm as your husband does . "
This is what Clinton does for feminism .
She makes it indistinguishable from nepotism .

Can We Treat Other Religions With Such Disrespect ?
In March 2007 , the 9th World Russian National Council was held in Moscow .
One of its resolutions caught our attention : “ On the development of a national system of religious education and science . ”
It is a peculiar title .
If religious education is an internal affair of the Russian Orthodox Church , then why should the Church concern itself with science ?
And would science be well served by such concern ?
The text of the resolution is unequivocal .
The resolution calls for an appeal to the Russian federal government to “ include theology in the list of scholarly disciplines recognized by the State Commission for Academic Degrees and Titles and to preserve theology as an independent scholarly field .
” The Church 's attempts to introduce theology to the list of government - recognized scholarly disciplines have a long history .
Previously , however , the pressure exerted on the Academic Degrees and Titles Commission remained hidden from the public eye .
Since the Council in March 2007 , the pressure is out in the open .
But why is it that theology — an assemblage of religious dogmas — should occupy a place among scientific disciplines ?
Scientific disciplines deal with facts , logic , and proofs , but not faith .
The Catholic Church , it should be noted , has almost completely renounced interfering with science ( in 1992 the Church even recognized its fault in the Galileo affair and cleared his name ) .
In conversation with V. I. Arnold ( March 1998 ) , Pope John Paul II recognized that science alone is able to determine the truth , whereas religion , in the words of the pontificate , sees itself as better suited to evaluate the possible uses of new discoveries .
The Russian Orthodox Church holds a different view :
“ We need a dialogue between the government and society at large in order to end the monopoly of the materialist worldview that was created in the Soviet era . ”
( From the resolution of the Council . )
All the achievements of science worldwide are based on a materialist view of the world .
Modern science is simply not concerned with any other views .
Steven Weinberg , the American physicist and Nobel Prize winner , put it aptly :
“ “ The experience of being a scientist makes religion seem fairly irrelevant .
Most scientists I know simply do n't think about it very much .
They do n't think about religion enough to qualify as practicing atheists . ”
( New York Times , August 23 , 2005 ) So what are we being offered to replace the “ monopoly of a materialist worldview ” ?
But let us come back to the Academic Degrees and Titles Commission .
The incorporation of the Church into a government body is an obvious breach of the Constitution .
The Church has already infiltrated the army and now the media broadcast the blessings of new military equipment ( battleships and submarines are now required to be blessed — which , alas ! does not always help ) .
Religious ceremonies attended by high government officials are also widely covered .
These are all examples of the clericalization of this country .
The Council ’s abovementioned resolution contains another urgent call “ for the recognition of the cultural significance of Orthodox culture and ethics education in all schools and for the inclusion of this subject in the standard federal curriculum .
” Church officials are calling on the government to make Introduction to Orthodox Culture a mandatory subject in all Russia ’s schools .
The idea has been in the works for some time .
In Circular # 5925 , dated December 9th , 1999 , addressed to “ all eparchial officials , ” Alexis II states that “ the task of spiritual and moral education will not be fulfilled if we fail to pay attention to the system of public education . ”
The conclusion of the same document reads :
“ In case difficulties should arise teaching ‘ Introduction to Orthodox Beliefs , ’ the subject should be called ‘ Introduction to Orthodox Culture , ’ which the teachers and school principals raised in atheism will find more acceptable .
” It follows from the quoted text that under the guise of “ Introduction to Orthodox Culture , ” we are going to have ( in breach of the Constitution , once again ) religious education .
Even if we assume that the course is truly about “ Orthodox culture , ” such a subject would still — as has been said so many times — be unacceptable in an ethnically and religiously diverse country .
Nevertheless , the Council considers this subject necessary in our country , where Orthodox Christians , so they say , constitute an absolute majority .
If you count all ethnically Russian atheists as Orthodox Christians , then they would indeed make up a majority .
Without the atheists , alas , Orthodox Christians are in the minority .
But that is not the point .
Can we treat other religions with such disrespect ?
Is this not a form of Orthodox chauvinism ?
Church functionaries ought to take the time to consider whether such a policy will ultimately unite the country or lead to division .
Courts Must Now Decide
Whether the Theory of Evolution is True
In the European Union , where religious intolerance has already shown its colors , it has been recognized after much discussion that schools should teach a course in the history of the main monotheist religions .
The main argument for such a course would be that teaching history and cultural heritage of other religions would promote understanding between members of different ethnic and religious groups .
No one even thought of demanding the teaching of an “ Introduction to Catholic Culture . ”
At last year ’s Christmas Readings , Education Minister Andrey A. Fursenko announced the publication of the history of world religions textbook .
The Orthodox lobby gave the announcement a hostile reception .
Meanwhile the textbook , written by scholars of the History Institute of the Russian Academy of Sciences ( the title is Religions of the World , to be used in grades 10 and 11 ) , is a well - balanced account packed with information that any educated person should know .
And what do we have instead ?
In 2006 , a St. Petersburg high - school student Masha and her dad went to court to demand that the high - school biology curriculum of “ outdated and erroneous ” Darwinism be replaced by the theory that man was created by a Divine force ( creationism ) .
It ’s an absurd situation : for some reason the courts must now decide whether the theory of evolution , which states that life emerged on Earth three billion years ago , is true , or whether the truth lies rather in the theory of creation , which , unlike the theory of evolution , does not present a single fact but states that life on Earth has existed for a few thousand years .
It seems to be a question exclusively within the competence of science .
Yet Masha and her dad received support from the Patriarch Alexis II who declared at the Christmas Educational Readings :
“ There is no harm in knowing the Bible ’s account of the origin of the world .
If someone wants to think that they descend from apes , let them keep their view , but without imposing it on others .
” But what will happen if school education gets deprived of elementary proofs , of basic logic , if the last remnants of critical thinking are eviscerated , and instead dogmas are learnt by rote — would that do no harm either ?
By the way , to be precise , neither Darwin nor his successors have ever stated that man descended from the ape .
They only stated that apes and humans have common ancestors .
But it is not only Darwinism that the Church has problems with .
For instance , how does the Bible ’s account of the origin of the world relate to the facts demonstrated by modern cosmology and astrophysics ?
What should be taught in school : these facts or the Bible ’s account of the world created in seven days ?
To believe in God or not is a matter of each individual ’s conscience and convictions .
We respect the feelings of religious people and our goal is not to fight religion .
But we can not stand by when attempts are made to cast doubt on scientific knowledge , to extirpate the “ materialist worldview , ” to substitute the knowledge accumulated by science with faith .
We should n’t forget that the government ’s policy of innovative development can only be realized if schools and universities equip young people with the knowledge acquired by modern science .
To this knowledge there is no alternative .

He just talked about the White House “ holiday celebration . ”
Why not call it a Christmas party ?
Because Bush is doing what everyone does – they use the word holiday so that it includes Hannukah and eother seasonal holidays , not just Christmas .
I ca n’t wait for FOX News to hold Bush accountable for his war on Christmas .
Oh that ’s right , FOX is a Republican front organization and not a real news network .
Never mind .
To the detractors of the documentary , Who Killed the Electric Car? , one of the problems with trying to get the entire picture of what happened to the EV1 program at GM from one 90 minute film is that you quickly discover that it is impossible .
Also , for as many times that I hear you say environmentally friendly cars simply have no appeal , there are millions of people like me who say that if there was just an environmentally friendly car made by an American car company I would buy one .
Most of the people I know think that way .
Most of them would have happily bought an electric car made by GM if it was offered where they lived .
The EV1 was only offered in California and Arizona .
Unfortunately , GM did n’t expand the market for the EV1 and now those people who would have bought an EV1 are in essence being forced to purchase the Prius made by Toyota and powered by gasoline .
I have been told by many detractors that GM claims that they spent around a billion dollars on the EV1 , what you do n’t hear is that GM puts every expenditure , from the beginning of the program to the very end , in that number .
From the first cents paid to Aeroenvironment for the EV1 prototype somewhere in the mid to late 1980s to the last dollar spend on crushing the EV1 last year , a time period that covers more than 16 years .
Simple math tells you that this averages out to only 62.5 million a year .
Given that GM lost 4.5 billion in 1991 , that is 4.5 billion in a single year , and 12.5 billion last year , 62.5 million a year clearly shows how little money GM spent on the EV1 .
The total expenditures per year averages out to about 6 dollars and 82 cents per vehicle that GM sold last year .
Or you can think of it this way , the cost of running the EV1 project was one three hundredths of a percent of GMs total revenue for a year .
( .03 % ) If GM ’s total revenue were 100 dollars the cost of running the EV1 program would have cost it 3 cents .
I do n’t know about you but I do n’t spend pennies , I just put them in a jar and forget about them .
Needless to say , GM did n’t spend a lot on the EV1 .
The tell tale signs that GM never was going to produce the EV1 as a viable product were that it limited distribution to California and Arizona , that it only leased the cars , would n’t want that technology reverse engineered by anyone else , and that it produced the cars in hand assembled batches rather than in a full functioning assembly line .
Assembly line production is far less costly per unit and typically used for a product that really was to reach the entire marketplace .
I have n’t seen the movie yet , but I do n’t believe that it talks about the other prototypes that GM made off of the EV1 platform .
GM made a series hybrid of the EV1 , which in essence gave the EV1 unlimited range using a turbine generator to power the car for long distances .
It also made two parallel hybrids , one like the Toyota Prius and one with a unique structure where a small diesel engine powered the back wheels while the front wheels were essentially powered by a standard EV1 drive train .
GM also had a 4 seat model of the EV1 , a CNG model and a fuel cell model .
All of these vehicles would have had much greater acceptance in the market place than the pure electric vehicle , with the exception of the fuel cell .
All the versions would have provided GM with a real world test platform for future fuel cell vehicles , since fuel cell vehicles are electric vehicles that use hydrogen fuel cells rather than a battery to produce electricity .
That they did n’t pursue incorporating this line of improvements to the future fuel cell car makes me think that GM is n’t really interested in fuel cells either .
Oddly , GM keeps introducing prototypes that look to provide us with everything we need in a car and fuel economy to boot .
One example is the Precept pictured below , but GM simply never goes into full production with these innovations .
Why ?
GM made the Precept in hydrogen and hybrid versions
With these innovations in the marketplace , GM would have been a decade a head of Toyota and Honda in hybrids and fuel cells .
It also would have given Americans a choice away from gasoline , which would be plug - in electricity .
Electricity , even in post Enron California , is far cheaper than gasoline today .
Automobile users switching to use more electricity rather than gasoline would have had a moderating effect on the price of oil .
There are also greater geopolitical implications as well , since electricity is produced virtually oil free .
It is GMs legendary shortsightedness that keeps the organization in the hall of fame of miss management .
What I do n’t understand is why the board does n’t find people of vision to lead the company , at least managers with some idea that gasoline prices might rise , or that environmental or mid-east politics may force them into doing something different , or even that there just might be breakthrough technology that would put them at a disadvantage .
The prudent management thing to do is to have a product mix that would protect the company from any sudden or unexpected shocks in oil prices , political change , unforeseen innovations , or Al Gore talking a lot about global warming .
Another thing that GM ’s management could do is to constantly improve that product line keeping competitors from being able to effectively compete .
Am I wrong or maybe the oil crisis of the 1970s never happened ?
Am I wrong or are n’t most scientist in agreement that global warming is not only real but we are causing it ?
Am I wrong or is Toyota capturing more and more market share away from Gm ?
So I leave with some advice for GM ’s management , go see , Who Killed the Electric Car ?
It might give you a clue about what not to do in the future .

The chances of giving birth to triplets once are more than 8,000 -
1
The girl , named only as Pamela , had her first set of female triplets aged 15 , having first given birth to a son when she was just 14 .
All seven children were born prematurely but without any kind of fertility treatment .
While doctors say the three newborns and their mother are well , the case has sparked debate across Argentina .
In bars and cafes , as well as the letters pages of newspapers , there has been widespread criticism of Pamela 's alleged promiscuity .
Seeking more
Pamela 's family already receives help from the provincial authorities , which donated land and built them a house when the first set of triplets was born .
Pamela 's mother , who cleans houses to support her daughter and rapidly increasing number of grandchildren , says they will now seek more assistance from the government for the new additions to the family .
Some Argentines are arguing that perhaps what Pamela needs is more advice on contraception .
The teenager , who will be 17 on Monday , comes from the remote town of Leones in the central Argentine province of Cordoba .

A grandfather was mauled to death by his Rottweiler after he collapsed in the street .
The man , believed to be James Rehill , 78 , fell to the ground while he was taking the dog for a walk .
Scroll down for more ...
At first , the animal tried to revive its master by licking and pawing him , witnesses said .
But it became more and more agitated and started biting and mauling him .
Passers - by tried to scare the dog off by sounding car horns and banging sticks .
But it took no notice and continued to maul the retired labourer 's face and hands .
The ten - minute attack , in Newham , East London , on Sunday , ended when a policeman fired a fire extinguisher at the dog .
It was later destroyed by police marksmen .
The father - of - two was taken to the Royal London Hospital in Whitechapel but died on Sunday evening .
It is thought the dog was wearing a muzzle but that it somehow came off or broke .
Aziz Rahman , 32 , saw the attack , which took place outside his house .
He said the dog threw Mr Rehill around like a " rag doll " .
" At first , the dog was trying to wake him up , licking him , but it became distressed when he did n't get up and started to bite him . "
YOUR TESTIMONIALS !!
Direct from you , in your words ....
Thanks , guys !!
Johnny is n't afraid to show he has a black friend because whenever he sees me in the hall he asks me Waaaazzzuup .
Johnny always compliments me by saying things like , " Damn bitch you stupid fly , " or by telling me you a big fine woman back that thing up .
Just things that make a black girl feel good .
I love how Johnny and Sally refer to me as " The Black Ryan " so no one gets confused when they are talking about me , this makes me feel special .
Sally is always complimenting me on my skin tone .
When she comes back from her tropical vacations she says to me , " Look !
Look !
I 'm as dark as you are ! "
Then she holds out her arm against mine to compare .
I just love how she wants to be like me !
I love it when Johnny & Sally ask me to sing at parties .
All of us can sing , you know .
- After saying a multisyllabic word such as " understand , " Johnny will often follow it with a translation for my benefit like " Dig ? " I am glad that he makes his big words accessible to me .
- Johnny always alters his given name and refers to himself in the third person -- for example , " J - Dog do n't play that " or " J - Dog wants to know wusssaappp . "
It comforts me to know that my parlance has such broad appeal .
- Sally has a habit of showing me her running tally of the number of black people she greets everyday .
I feel unique and special to be part of her statistical list .
Sally and Johnny are always giving me my props on how good it is that I graduated from college and that I do not have any illegitimate children .
The fact that I have never been to jail makes me a " credit to my race " in their eyes .
They know my race needs all the credit it can get .
Thanks for looking out you guys !
I love being around Johnny and Sally because they kiss their dogs on the mouth , and that is really funny !
Sally is so great .... everytime I ride in the car with her she makes sure the radio is tuned to " my " station .
Me and Sally use to be close partners back in the day .
I used to fuck her real good till Johnny came in the picture riding on his new 20 " rims with the system pumping .
Johnny is a cool guy .
He is always hooking me up with skinny white girls with no azz .... I really miss hitting Sally from the back .....
I work with Johnny , and sometimes he stops in the middle of our corporate hallways , but instead of shaking my hands he gives me a fist pound and says " what up . "
He 's so in touch with the street , its astonishing .
I like Johnny and Sally because they NEVER flaunt their wealth in front of me .
In fact , they go to great lengths to keep their valuables as well as their wallets and purses as far away from me as possible .
How cool is THAT ???
Sally is always there for me .
She was even brave enough to tell me how she feels sorry for me because my hair can never really look " professional . "
Dear homepeeps Sally and Johnny ,
I love Sally and Johnny because : - They think my name , Baratunde , is so interesting and unique .
- Sally and Johnny recognize that as a black man , I 'm an expert on self - defense and the ways of organized crime .
Whenever they are about to go to a " bad " neighborhood , they ask me for my advice .
That 's phat . - I met Sally and Johnny in high school history class .
Whenever something about black people came up -- like slavery or Jim Crow or riots -- they would look at me , cause as the only black person in the class they were
confident I could explain the history of black America when I was only 15 .
No one else believed in me like you guys .
Thanks ! -
I love Johnny cause whenever he 's looking for some weed , he knows that I 'm the go - to guy .
Even though I live in the burbs and spend all my time at the office , Johnny knows I keep my finger on the pulse of the drug - trafficking
community .
Sally and I go out to the clubs a lot and she always says she wishes she had my natural rhythm .
Sally and Johnny always ask me how the entire black community feels about certain topics .
I really respect this about them because I am black and therfore obviously know how all blacks feel about everything !
Sally and Johnny listen to more gangster rap then I do !
Let us pause to consider the Pentagon ’s effort to shoot down USA - 193 , an intelligence - gathering satellite the size of a bus that went out of commission shortly after its launch in 2006 and then began hurtling toward Earth .
A window of opportunity opened Wednesday night and soon the world will know whether it has been saved from peril .
This was a plan that I was originally behind 1,000 percent .
Who among us wants to be hit by a falling bus ?
And the shooting - it - before - it - impacts strategy has worked well many times before , usually in movies starring Bruce Willis .
However , as details emerged , the plan began to seem somewhat less attractive .
We ’ve been sending stuff into orbit for half a century .
An estimated 17,000 items , weighing up to 100 tons , have already fallen back into the atmosphere .
The odds against one of them hitting a human being 
I am thinking in particular of me  are , at worst , several million to one .
The critical thing about USA - 193 , according to the Pentagon , is that it was carrying an unusual amount of fuel , which could release toxic fumes on impact .
According to Gen. James Cartwright of the Marines , vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , it was the deadly gas threat that made President Bush decide to go for satellite assassination .
ANCHORAGE ( Reuters ) - Alaska ’s Sarah Palin has made a habit of taking on big opponents and winning , but the Republican governor is facing her toughest fight yet after locking horns with the state ’s powerful oil industry .
Palin , 44 has taken direct aim at the traditional comfortable partnership between the big three oil companies in the state - BP BP.L , ConocoPhillips COP.N and Exxon Mobil XOM.N -- and the state Republican party .
“ The oil companies have been hugely influential in Alaska , certainly over the last decade and a half with the prior two administrations , ” Palin told Reuters in a recent interview .
“ ( For ) Alaskans , as owners of the resource ... it is time to embrace our sovereignty . ”
Palin ’s clashes with the three giants that control the state ’s vital oil industry have endeared her to some Alaskans wary of the companies ’ power .
But they have made her few friends in the oil industry , which accuses her of hurting investment in Alaska ’s shrinking oil sector and delaying the construction of a long - sought natural gas pipeline .
REPUBLICAN REBEL
A former small town mayor and mother of four , Palin was appointed chairwoman of the Alaska Oil and Gas Conservation Commission ( AOGCC ) , the board that sets technical standards for oil and gas produced on state lands , by Republican governor Frank Murkowski in 2003 .
Palin ’s stint with the normally staid AOGCC was tumultuous .
Soon after joining she began complaining about the conduct of Randy Ruedrich , the chairman of the Alaska Republican Party , who Murkowski appointed as the AOGCC ’s top petroleum engineer .
Palin accused Ruedrich of ethical violations and resigned in disgust after less than a year in office .
Before stepping down , she turned over incriminating evidence against Ruedrich
to investigators .
Faced with this evidence , Ruedrich pleaded guilty to violating the state ethics act and was fined $ 12,000 .
But he remains chairman of the Alaska Republican Party .
A social conservative , Palin found herself a rising political star ahead of the 2006 elections as Alaskans grew disenchanted with Murkowski ’s scandal - plagued administration .
Palin ’s squeaky - clean image and outrage over Murkowski ’s attempt to negotiate a natural gas pipeline contract behind closed doors propelled her to the top of the polls .
She humiliated Murkowski in the Republican primary and cruised to victory in the general election just as news of another scandal , this one implicating Republican members of the legislature , began to break .
A federal investigation had turned up evidence that executives at VECO Corp , Alaska ’s biggest oil services company , had been bribing some Republican lawmakers to ensure support for legislation favorable to the oil companies .
Although no evidence has been brought to light linking the oil companies with VECO ’s activities , recordings of senior oil company executives discussing political lobbying efforts with VECO officials led many Alaskans to conclude the majors were behind the bribery .
Palin used the uproar over the VECO scandal to partner with Democrats in the legislature to push through an increase in taxes on oil production and to set up a new state - backed effort to design a natural gas pipeline project free of the influence of the majors .
The companies are not backing down without a fight .
They have already announced investment cuts due to the tax hike and have warned the Palin ’s gas pipeline plan is doomed to failure without their support .
The guy on the left in the Santa suit is responsbile for up to fifty murdered sex slaves , including his own daughter
Browse column A version of this article first appeared in the February 2008 issue of Penthouse magazine .
NIZHNY TAGIL — Last March ,
The eXile reported a story so shocking and so gruesome that it made every other item in the Russian crime catalog seem like a parking violation .
If you read the story , you remember it .
A mass grave containing the mutilated remains of more than a dozen teenage sex slaves was unearthed in a forest outside Nizhny Tagil , an industrial city of 400,000 just east of the southern Urals .
The young victims were linked to a local prostitution ring that had been kidnapping , enslaving and killing local girls for five years .
Even by Russian crime standards , the story jumped out , blacker than pitch and colder than a snow - frosted corpse .
There were remarkably few follow - ups to the discovery , first reported in the Yekaterinburg edition of Komsomolskaya Pravda .
While the Bittsevsky Maniac was working on his Chikatilo rerun , earning top billing in the Russian press and beyond when caught , the Sex Slaves of Nizhny Tagil were killed a second time by an uninterested and jaded media .
Most Russian papers merely allotted an in - brief blurb to the mass murder .
Aside from our short report , the Guardian was the only other English language outlet to mention the crime .
Komsomolskaya Pravda was the only Russian daily that delved into the nitty - gritty and asked why it went unsolved for so long .
The remains of Olya and Vika , both 13 years old , were identified and their deaths linked to the sex slave ring
In July , we traveled east to find out exactly what happened in Nizhny Tagil .
What we found was a story of mind - bending cruelty and epic police negligence , wrapped up in a searing multi-dimensional indictment of Russian society .
Nizhny Tagil is a natural backdrop for the crime , a city that lives up to and beyond its tough reputation .
Tagil is known best for two things : the smoke belching ironworks that crowd its southern and eastern skylines , and the maximum - security prisons that surround it like institutional scarecrows .
( Jailed former Yukos chairman Mikhail Khodorkovsky was originally sentenced to one of Tagil ’s brutal zonas , but the authorities changed their minds and sent him to Siberia instead . )
Mining , the city ’s main industry for centuries , all but collapsed with the USSR .
Like many provincial Russian cities , it has bounced back a bit in recent years , but not by much .
Homeless and scabby babushkas sit crowd curbs clutching plastic bottles of bathtub vodka .
Vicious street fights are common .
The roads look like a war zone — potholed , cracked , decrepit and completely empty by 10 p.m .
At night , an air raid siren soundtrack is the only thing that seems to be missing .
On our first night in town , we searched in vain for an hour to find a place to get a drink along the empty downtown streets .
Eventually we stumbled on a small and smoky basement joint called the Caspi .
We did n’t know it at the time , but the bar played a major role in the very crime we were researching .
We should have guessed .
The clientele was grizzled to the point of being a caricature of the provincial low - rent Russian underworld : the men were dressed in track suits and covered with blurry prison tattoos .
The women were blank - eyed and poorly made - up in cheap designer knock - offs .
There was one fellow with a full - body burn scar sitting alone in the corner .
It was a criminal bar , the only late - night option in Russia 's most notorious prison town .
Most Tagil residents have only one - degree of separation from the jails ; they are either ex-cons or the children or spouses of ex-cons .
Prisoners are often released with nothing — not even train fare — and so stick around the city simply because they have nowhere else to go .

Patent Infringement Win Has Implications for Check 21 Implementation or payment processor DataTreasury Corp. of Melville , N.Y. , a company involved in several patent infringement disputes , the first week of July 2005 was full of events that have potential implications for the Check Clearing for the 21st Century Act , or Check 21 .
On July 1 , a federal judge in Texas granted two consent judgments in favor of DataTreasury in its lawsuits against JPMorgan Chase & Co. and former defendant BankOne , which JPMorgan Chase now owns .
Following that news , DataTreasury announced on July 6 that it will pursue patent infringement litigation against four major U.S. banks , including Bank of America Corp . ( BofA ) , Citigroup , Wachovia Corp. and Wells Fargo Bank & Co. DataTreasury filed suit in U.S. District Court , Eastern District of Texas .
At issue is enforcement of two patents owned by DataTreasury for technology developed by the company 's Chief Executive Officer and founder , Claudio Ballard .
The technology enables the implementation of Check 21 , enacted in October 2004 .
Check 21 makes it possible for banks to truncate checks , turning them from paper - based documents into electronic images for processing ( see " Check 21 and Another Patent Infringement Lawsuit , " The Green Sheet , Dec. 27 , 2004 , issue 04:12:02 ) .
Ballard founded his company in 1998 , based on patent applications he had filed for DataTreasury 's Global Repository Platform , a system that manages image capture , centralized processing and electronic storage of document and check information .
The company received U.S. Patent Nos. 5,910,988 and 6,032,137 in 1999 and 2000 , respectively .
In 2002 , well before Check 21 became law , DataTreasury filed suit against several payments companies including JPMorgan Chase , First Data Corp. , Ingenico Corp. , Affiliated Computer Services Inc. ( ACS ) and RDM Corp. , for patent infringement .
DataTreasury filed its initial lawsuits for protection of what it claimed , and the federal court recently agreed , is its property .
The ability to license the technology is a key factor in the company 's business model and success , and is especially critical now that Check 21 is on the books .
According to DataTreasury , each year BofA processes 9.4 billion checks ; Citigroup processes 2.4 billion ; Wachovia processes 4.5 billion ; and Wells Fargo processes 3.7 billion checks .
JPMorgan Chase processed 1.5 billion checks in 2003 .
The consent judgments announced in early July explicitly state that DataTreasury 's patents are valid and enforceable .
JPMorgan Chase , which opted to settle with DataTreasury in the infringement suit , is now a DataTreasury licensee .
Current defendants , take heed .
" We hope that these new defendants realize that long and expensive litigation is definitely not in the best interest of their shareholders , " said DataTreasury lead attorney Ed Holm .
" It is now clear that DataTreasury 's patents are not only valid and enforceable , but have also gained commercial acceptance in the banking industry . "
So far , DataTreasury has been successful in its attempts to go after patent infringers .
It has entered into licensing agreements with some companies , and at least one company , ACS , is permanently barred from ever using its technology .
In June 2003 , DataTreasury granted RDM a nonexclusive worldwide license for use on a per-click royalty basis .
Two years later , in June 2005 , DataTreasury entered into a settlement and license agreement with NetDeposit Inc. , a company that provides Check 21 and franchise - building software for the financial services industry .
DataTreasury is currently preparing to take First Data and Ingenico to trial to resolve its claims against them ; it has refiled its claims against Viewpointe Archive , a check - image archiving provider founded by JPMorgan Chase .
Will DataTreasury eventually " own " Check 21 ?
The JPMorgan Chase settlement indicates that the company does control check imaging technology , but long - term implications for banks and existing services such as ATMs are unclear .
Some analysts believe that many financial institutions could be compelled to pay licensing fees to DataTreasury , depending on how the scope of its patents is interpreted and enforced in the future .

Security mavens have uncovered a design flaw in most home routers that allows attackers to remotely control the devices by luring an attached computer to a booby - trapped website .
The weakness could allow attackers to redirect victims to fraudulent destinations that masquerade as trusted sites belonging to banks , ecommerce companies or health care organizations .
The exploit works even if a user has changed the default password of the router .
And it works regardless the operating system or browser the computer connected to the device is running , as long as it has a recent version of Adobe Flash installed .
" This is a huge problem , " Adrian Pastor , of the prolific hacking organization GNUCitizen , said in an instant message .
The problem resides in Universal Plug and Play , a feature built in to most routers used for home networks so machines running games , instant messaging programs and other applications will work seamlessly with the devices .
By exposing an end user to a malicious Flash file lurking on a website , attackers can use UPnP , as the technology is usually called , to make significant modifications to the router .
The most serious change that 's possible is changing the the server PCs connected to the router use to access websites .
That might cause a victim trying to access eBay or Bank of America to see spoofed pages that steal their login credentials .
The hack could also allow attackers to open ports on a victim 's router .
That would be useful in turning a router into what would amount to a zombie machine by forwarding ports to an external server .
The weakness , which works using the navigatetoURL function and URLRequest object specified in Flash , is n't a security flaw within Flash , the researches say .
Rather they are design flaws in UPnP , which does n't use authentication .
PCs using virtually any platform and browser will change router settings , as long as they run version 8 or higher of Flash .
Routers made by Linksys , Dlink and SpeedTouch have been confirmed to be vulnerable , and other manufacturers ' products are also likely susceptible to attack , the researchers said .
Most routers have UPnP turned on by default .
The only way to prevent the attack is to turn the feature off , something that is possible with some , but not all , devices .
The vulnerability , which was also discovered by Petko D. Petkov , is explained further here .

Could IP addresses soon be considered " personal information " in Europe ?
The question was discussed yesterday at a hearing before the European Parliament 's Civil Liberties Committee , where European data protection authorities and privacy advocates backed the idea .
Google , not surprisingly , was n't as thrilled .
Giving legal protection to IP addresses poses a host of problems for companies like Google that log massive amounts of data and want to know which machines it comes from .
IP address tracking can help the company crackdown on click fraud , for instance , and it can help Google identify the general geographical location of many of its visitors .
But IP addresses do n't match up with people , only machines , making them at best quasi-personal .
As Google 's Global Privacy Counsel Peter Fleischer told the Committee ( PDF ) , " There is no black or white answer : sometimes an IP address can be considered as personal data and sometimes not ; it depends on the context , and which personal information it reveals . "
Marc Rotenberg , who heads the Electronic Privacy Information Center , argued that IP addresses are still quite personal and are likely to become even more so soon .
" We are moving towards the IP6 model , for which it will be even more the case that IP addresses will be personally identifiable , " he said .
The debate over IP addresses quickly morphed into a debate over the Google / DoubleClick merger , which the European Commission is currently examining .
In his prepared remarks , Fleischer said that Google 's success " depends on trust .
If our users do n't trust us , they wo n't use our services .
And they wo n't trust us , if we do n't protect their privacy . "
But Carlos Coelho , a member of the EPP - ED , Parliament 's largest bloc , argued that " trust between the user and the online service supplier cannot exist in a monopoly situation , yet Google 's buyout of DoubleClick could create such a case . "
If enough others subscribe to that view , it 's not hard to imagine that stricter privacy laws ( including regulations for some kinds of IP address collection ) could follow .
Such a plan has the backing of one of Europe 's most influential data protection advocates , Germany 's data protection commissioner Peter Scharr .
Scharr heads the EU's " Article 29 Data Protection Working Group , " which advises the European Commission on data protection issues .
According to the AP , Scharr told the Civil Liberties Committee that an IP address " has to be regarded as personal data " in situations where it can be used to identify someone .
Given Scharr 's backing , this is an idea that could garner real traction in Europe .
If it does , it 's unlikely to prevent the collection of IP addresses ( which are used for everything from busting child pornography suspects to finding file - swappers to blacklisting spam domains ) , but it would no doubt require databases of such addresses to meet certain security and retention standards .
Google has tried to get out in front of such issues by voluntarily making changes to its own retention policy and anonymizing IP addresses within 18 - 24 months .

Court records show that the amount claimed by Countrywide was from the period during which Ms. Hill was making regular payments under the auspices of the bankruptcy court .
They included “ monthly charges ” totaling $ 3,840 from November 2006 to April 2007 , late charges of $ 128 and other charges of almost $ 200 .
A lawyer representing Ms. Hill in her bankruptcy case , Kenneth Steidl , of Steidl and Steinberg in Pittsburgh , wrote Countrywide a few weeks later stating that Ms. Hill had been deemed current on her mortgage during the period in question .
But in May , Countrywide sent Ms. Hill another notice stating that her loan was delinquent and demanding that she pay $ 4,715.58 .
Neither Mr. Steidl nor Julia Steidl , who has also represented Ms. Hill , returned phone calls seeking comment .
Justifying Ms. Hill ’s arrears , Countrywide sent her lawyer copies of three letters on company letterhead addressed to the homeowner , as well as to Mr. Steidl and Ronda J. Winnecour , the Chapter 13 trustee for the western district of Pennsylvania .
The Countrywide letters were dated September 2003 , October 2004 and March 2007 and showed changes in escrow requirements on Ms. Hill ’s loan .
“ This letter is to advise you that the escrow requirement has changed per the escrow analysis completed today , ” each letter began .
But Mr. Steidl told the court he had never received the letters .
Furthermore , he noticed that his address on the first Countrywide letter was not the location of his office at the time , but an address he moved to later .
Neither did the Chapter 13 trustee ’s office have any record of receiving the letters , court records show .
When Mr. Steidl discussed this with Leslie E. Puida , Countrywide ’s outside counsel on the case , he said Ms. Puida told him that the letters had been “ recreated ” by Countrywide to reflect the escrow discrepancies , the court transcript shows .
During these discussions , Ms. Puida reduced the amount that Countrywide claimed Ms. Hill owed to $ 1,500 from $ 4,700 .
Under questioning by the judge , Ms. Puida said that “ a processor ” at Countrywide had generated the letters to show how the escrow discrepancies arose .
“ They were not offered to prove that they had been sent , ” Ms. Puida said .
But she also said , under questioning from the court , that the letters did not carry a disclaimer indicating that they were not actual correspondence or that they had never been sent .
Gov't acknowledges discussing lawsuits with telecom company Nick Juliano

This A US government attorney working for the Director of National Intelligence secretly discussed pending litigation with a telecommunications carrier , a top Intelligence official acknowledged this month .
But much remains unknown about when the conversation took place or what advice the government attorney may have offered , as the Intelligence Director works to keep notes of the conversation classified .
In a filing released as part its ongoing lawsuit with a privacy watchdog , the government for the first time revealed the contents of a telephone message slip it previously withheld from a Freedom of Information Act response .
A DNI administrative assistant took a message from a telecommunications company representative and gave the telco rep 's name and number to a govenrment lawyer , who returned the phone call and took notes on the message slip , according to the filing .
The disclosure comes at the Senate is preparing for a final vote on a bill that would grant legal immunity to the telecommunications companies .
Senate Democrats find themselves in precisely the situation they hoped to avoid in working to update a foreign surveillance law , and the push for immunity has created some deep divisions between the Senate and the House , as Roll Call reports .
The Electronic Frontier Foundation has filed a FOIA request for all documents concerning discussions or exchanges between Director of National Intelligence Michael McConnell or others in his office and telecommunications carriers regarding efforts to update the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act .
Hundreds of pages of documents were released in November and December detailing McConnell 's discussions with Congress .
The lawyer called to discuss " the various options that may be available to address the litigation facing the telecommunications carriers " and the two disussed " options such as court orders and legislation , " such as the telecom - immunizing FISA update to be voted on Tuesday .
The government argued that releasing the identity of the telecommunications company it talked to would be an unwarranted invasion of privacy and could aid terrorists seeking to subvert US surveillance methods .
" Confirmation by the ODNI that the US Government does or does not have a relationship with a particular telecommunications carrier for an intelligence activity would provide our adversaries with a road map , instructing them about which communications modes and personnel remain safe or are successfully defeating the US government 's capabilities , " wrote Ronald L. Burgess , Director of Intelligence Staff .
Wired 's Ryan Singel notes the government has declared the document Top Secret .
" To highlight the fact it was not an official document , the government reveals that the attorney who wrote on the slip left it on his desk for several weeks and then just filed it in an ' unofficial ' FISA folder , " he writes .
" It 's unclear if that 's official policy for handling Top Secret documents or not . "
The government does not say when the phone call took place , although it is most likely sometime after February 2006 , when USA Today reported that Sprint , MCI and AT&T cooperated with the National Security Agency 's post - 9/11 warrantless wiretapping program .
EFF filed a class - action lawsuit against AT&T the next month ; there are about 40 lawsuits pending against those companies alleging they violated laws protecting customers ' privacy in cooperating with the government 's program .
" A majority of international calls are handled by long - distance carriers AT&T , MCI and Sprint .
All three own ' gateway ' switches capable of routing calls to points around the globe , " the paper reported .
" AT&T was recently acquired by SBC Communications , which has since adopted the AT&T name as its corporate moniker .
MCI , formerly known as WorldCom , was recently acquired by Verizon .
Sprint recently merged with Nextel . "
Details of the warrantless wiretapping program remain secret , and as the Wall Street Journal reported after the companies ' cooperation was disclosed , even company CEO 's may not have known the full details of how the government was accessing their customers ' telephone calls , e-mails and faxes .
" Internally ... Verizon Communications Inc. , which recently acquired MCI , and the former SBC , which recently acquired and took the name AT&T , have encountered a confusing situation , " the paper reported .
" Workers who hold security clearance at the acquired firms can't always legally talk about details of their work to workers who do n't have such clearance at the new parent company , people familiar with the situation say . "
The EFF is continuing to fight for the full message slip to be released , and it will argue its case against the government in federal court March 7 , Singel reports .
Jesus as Trickster Rebel
By Walter Wink
From The Impossible Will Take a While : A Citizen�s Guide to Hope in a Time of Fear , edited by Paul Rogat Loeb . ]
You have heard that it was said , � An eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth . �
But I say to you , Do not resist one who is evil .
But if anyone strikes you on the right cheek , turn to him the other also ; and if anyone would sue you and take your coat , let him have your cloak as well ; and if any one forces you to go one mile , go with him two miles .
( attributed to Jesus in Matthew 5:38 �41 , Revised Standard Version )
Many who have committed their lives to working for change and justice in the world simply dismiss Jesus� teachings about nonviolence as impractical idealism .
And with good reason .
� Turn the other cheek� suggests the passive , Christian doormat quality that has made so many Christians cowardly and complicit in the face of injustice .
� Resist not evil� seems to break the back of all opposition to evil and counsel submission .
� Going the second mile� has become a platitude meaning nothing more than �extend yourself . �
Rather than fostering structural change , such attitudes encourage collaboration with the oppressor .
Jesus never behaved in such ways .
Whatever the source of the misunderstanding , it is neither Jesus nor his teaching , which , when given a fair hearing in its original social context , is arguably one of the most revolutionary political statements ever uttered .
When the court translators working in the hire of King James chose to translate antistenai as � Resist not evil , � they were doing something more than rendering Greek into English .
They were translating nonviolent resistance into docility .
The Greek word means more than simply to " stand against " or " resist . "
It means to resist violently , to revolt or rebel , to engage in an insurrection .
Jesus did not tell his oppressed hearers not to resist evil .
His entire ministry is at odds with such a preposterous idea .
He is , rather , warning against responding to evil in kind by letting the oppressor set the terms of our opposition .
A proper translation of Jesus� teaching would then be , � Do not retaliate against violence with violence . �
Jesus was no less committed to opposing evil than the anti-Roman resistance fighters like Barabbas .
The only difference was over the means to be used .
Up against evil
There are three general responses to evil : ( 1 ) violent opposition , ( 2 ) passivity , and ( 3 ) the third way of militant nonviolence articulated by Jesus .
Human evolution has conditioned us for only the first two of these responses : fight or flight .
Fight had been the cry of Galileans who had abortively rebelled against Rome only two decades before Jesus spoke .
Jesus and many of his hearers would have seen some of the two thousand of their countrymen crucified by the Romans along the roadsides .
They would have known some of the inhabitants of Sepphoris ( a mere three miles north of Nazareth ) who had been sold into slavery for aiding the insurrectionists � assault on the arsenal there .
Some also would live to experience the horrors of the war against Rome in 66�70 C.E. , one of the ghastliest in history .
If the option of fighting had no appeal to them , their only alternative was flight : passivity , submission , or , at best , a passive - aggressive recalcitrance in obeying commands .
For them no third way existed .
Now we are in a better position to see why King James� servants translated antistenai as �resist not . �
The king would not want people concluding they had any recourse against his or any other sovereign�s unjust policies .
Jesus commands us , according to these king�s men , to resist not .
Jesus appears to say say that submission to monarchial absolutism is the will of God .
Most modern translations have meekly followed the King James path .
Neither of the invidious alternatives of flight or fight is what Jesus is proposing .
Jesus abhors both passivity and violence as responses to evil .
His is a third alternative not even touched by these options .
The Scholars Version translates Antistenai brilliantly : � Don�t react violently against someone who is evil . �
Turn the other cheek ?
Jesus clarifies his meaning by three brief examples .
� If anyone strikes you on the right cheek , turn to him the other also . �
Why the right cheek ?
How does one strike another on the right cheek anyway ?
Try it .
A blow by the right fist in that right - handed world would land on the left cheek of the opponent .
To strike the right cheek with the fist would require using the left hand , but in that society the left hand was used only for unclean tasks .
As the Dead Sea Scrolls specify , even to gesture with the left hand at Qumran carried the penalty of ten days penance .
The only way one could strike the right cheek with the right hand would be with the back of the hand .
What we are dealing with here is unmistakably an insult , not a fistfight .
The intention is not to injure but to humiliate , to put someone in his or her place .
One normally did not strike a peer in this way , and if one did the fine was exorbitant ( four zuz was the fine for a blow to a peer with a fist , 400 zuz for backhanding him ; but to an underling , no penalty whatever ) .
A backhand slap was the normal way of admonishing inferiors .
Masters backhanded slaves ; husbands , wives ; parents , children ; men , women ; Romans , Jews .
We have here a set of unequal relations , in each of which retaliation would be suicidal .
The only normal response would be cowering submission .
It is important to ask who Jesus� audience is .
In every case , Jesus� listeners are not those who strike , initiate lawsuits , or impose forced labor .
Rather , Jesus is speaking to their victims , people who have been subjected to these very indignities .
They have been forced to stifle their inner outrage at the dehumanizing treatment meted out to them by the hierarchical system of caste and class , race and gender , age and status , and by the guardians of imperial occupation .
Why then does Jesus counsel these already humiliated people to turn the other cheek ?
Because this action robs the oppressor of power to humiliate them .
The person who turns the other cheek is saying , in effect , � Try again .
Your first blow failed to achieve its intended effect .
I deny you the power to humiliate me .
I am a human being just like you .
Your status ( gender , race , age , wealth ) does not alter that .
You can not demean me .�
Such a response would create enormous difficulties for the striker .
Purely logistically , how can he now hit the other cheek ?
He can not backhand it with his right hand .
If he hits with a fist , he makes himself an equal , acknowledging the other as a peer .
But the whole point of the back of the hand is to reinforce the caste system and its institutionalized inequality .
No limits to giving ?
The second example Jesus gives is set in a court of law .
Someone is being sued for his outer garment .
Who would do that and under what circumstances ?
Only the poorest of the poor would have nothing but an outer garment to give as collateral for a loan .
Jewish law strictly required its return every evening at sunset , for that was all the poor had in which to sleep .
The situation to which Jesus alludes is one with which his hearers would have been too familiar : the poor debtor has sunk ever deeper into poverty , the debt cannot be repaid , and his creditor has hauled him into court to wring out repayment .
Indebtedness was the most serious social problem in first - century Palestine .
Jesus� parables are full of debtors struggling to salvage their lives .
It is in this context that Jesus speaks .
His hearers are the poor ( �if anyone would sue you� ) .
They share a rankling hatred for a system that subjects them to humiliation by stripping them of their lands , their goods , finally even their outer garments .
Why then does Jesus counsel them to give over their inner garment as well ?
This would mean stripping off all their clothing and marching out of court stark naked !
Put yourself in the debtor�s place ; imagine the chuckles this saying must have evoked .
There stands the creditor , beet - red with embarrassment , your outer garment in one hand , your underwear in the other .
You have suddenly turned the tables on him .
You had no hope of winning the trial ; the law was entirely in his favor .
But you have refused to be humiliated .
At the same time you have registered a stunning protest against a system that spawns such debt .
You have said , in effect , � You want my robe ?
Here , take everything !
Now you�ve got all I have except my body .
Is that what you�ll take next ? �
Serious clowning
Nakedness was taboo in Judaism .
Shame fell not on the naked party but the person viewing or causing one�s nakedness ( Genesis 9:20 � 27 ) .
By stripping you have brought the creditor under the same prohibition that led to the curse of Canaan .
As you parade into the street , your friends and neighbors , startled , aghast , inquire what happened .
You explain .
They join your growing procession , which now resembles a victory parade .
The entire system by which debtors are oppressed has been publicly unmasked .
The creditor is revealed to be not a �respectable � moneylender but a party in the reduction of an entire social class to landlessness and destitution .
This unmasking is not simply punitive , however ; it offers the creditor a chance to see , perhaps for the first time in his life , what his practices cause �and to repent .
Jesus in effect is sponsoring clowning .
In so doing he shows himself to be thoroughly Jewish .
A later saying of the Talmud runs , � If your neighbor calls you an ass , put a saddle on your back . �
The Powers That Be literally stand on their dignity .
Nothing takes away their potency faster than deft lampooning .
By refusing to be awed by their power , the powerless are emboldened to seize the initiative , even where structural change is not possible .
This message , far from being a counsel of perfection unattainable in this life , is a practical , strategic measure for empowering the oppressed .
It provides a hint of how to take on the entire system in a way that unmasks its essential cruelty and to burlesque its pretensions to justice , law , and order .
Go the second mile ?
Jesus� third example , the one about going the second mile , is drawn from the enlightened practice of limiting the amount of forced labor that Roman soldiers could levy on subject peoples .
A soldier could impress a civilian to carry his pack one mile only ; to force the civilian to go further carried with it severe penalties under military law .
In this way Rome tried to limit the anger of the occupied people and still keep its armies on the move .
Nevertheless , this levy was a bitter reminder to the Jews that they were a subject people even in the Promised Land .
To this proud but subjugated people Jesus does not counsel revolt .
One does not �befriend � the soldier , draw him aside , and drive a knife into his ribs .
Jesus was keenly aware of the futility of armed revolt against Roman imperial might .
He minced no words about it , though it must have cost him support from the revolutionary factions .
But why walk the second mile ?
Is this not to rebound to the opposite extreme : aiding and abetting the enemy ?
Not at all .
The question here , as in the two previous instances , is how the oppressed can recover the initiative , how they can assert their human dignity in a situation that cannot for the time being be changed .
The rules are Caesar�s but not how one responds to the rules .
The response is God�s , and Caesar has no power over that .
Imagine then the soldier�s surprise when , at the next mile marker , he reluctantly reaches to assume his pack ( sixty - five to eighty - five pounds in full gear ) .
You say , � Oh no , let me carry it another mile . �
Normally he has to coerce your kinsmen to carry his pack ; now you do it cheerfully and will not stop !
Is this a provocation ?
Are you insulting his strength ?
Being kind ?
Trying to get him disciplined for seeming to make you go farther then you should ?
Are you planning to file a complaint ?
To create trouble ?
Throwing power off balance
From a situation of servile impressment , you have once more seized the initiative .
You have taken back the power of choice .
The soldier is thrown off - balance by being deprived of the predictability of your response .
Imagine the hilarious situation of a Roman infantryman pleading with a Jew , � Aw , come on , please give me back my pack !�
The humor of this scene may escape those who picture it through sanctimonious eyes .
It could scarcely , however , have been lost on Jesus� hearers , who must have delighted in the prospect of thus discomfiting their oppressors .
Some readers may object to the idea of discomfiting the soldier or embarrassing the creditor .
But can people engaged in oppressive acts repent unless made uncomfortable with their actions ?
There is , admittedly , the danger of using nonviolence as a tactic of revenge and humiliation .
There is also , at the opposite extreme , an equal danger of sentimentality and softness that confuses the uncompromising love of Jesus with being nice .
Loving confrontation can free both the oppressed from docility and the oppressor from sin .
Even if nonviolent action does not immediately change the heart of the oppressor , it does affect those committed to it .
As Martin Luther King , Jr. attested , it gives them new self - respect and calls on strength and courage they did not know they had .
To those with power , Jesus� advice to the powerless may seem paltry .
But to those whose lifelong pattern has been to cringe , bow , and scrape before their masters , to those who have internalized their role as inferiors , this small step is momentous .
Jesus� Third Way :
� Seize the moral initiative .
� Find a creative alternative to violence .
� Assert your own humanity and dignity as a person .
� Meet force with ridicule or humor .
� Break the cycle of humiliation .
� Refuse to submit or to accept the inferior position .
� Expose the injustice of the system .
� Take control of the power dynamic .
� Shame the oppressor into repentance .
� Stand your ground .
� Force the Powers into decisions for which they are not prepared .
� Recognize your own power .
� Be willing to suffer rather than retaliate .
� Force the oppressor to see you in a new light .
� Deprive the oppressor of a situation where force is effective .
� Be willing to undergo the penalty of breaking unjust laws .
What Jesus would have done
It is too bad Jesus did not provide fifteen or twenty more examples since we do not tend toward this new response naturally .
Some examples from political history might help engrave it more deeply in our minds :
In Alagamar , Brazil , a group of peasants organized a long - term struggle to preserve their lands against attempts at illegal expropriation by national and international firms ( with the connivance of local politicians and the military ) .
Some of the peasants were arrested and jailed in town .
Their companions decided they were all equally responsible .
Hundreds marched to town .
They filled the house of the judge , demanding to be jailed with those who had been arrested .
The judge was finally obliged to send them all home , including the prisoners .
During the Vietnam War , one woman claimed 79 dependents on her United States income tax , all Vietnamese orphans , so she owed no tax .
They were not legal dependents , of course , so were disallowed .
No , she insisted , these children have been orphaned by indiscriminate United States bombing ; we are responsible for their lives .
She forced the Internal Revenue Service to take her to court .
That gave her a larger forum for making her case .
She used the system against itself to unmask the moral indefensibility of what the system was doing .
Of course she �lost � the case , but she made her point .
During World War II , when Nazi authorities in occupied Denmark promulgated an order that all Jews had to wear yellow armbands with the Star of David , the king made it a point to attend a celebration in the Copenhagen synagogue .
He and most of the population of Copenhagen donned yellow armbands as well .
His stand was affirmed by the Bishop of Sjaelland and other Lutheran clergy .
The Nazis eventually had to rescind the order .
It is important to repeat such stories to extend our imaginations for creative nonviolence .
Since it is not a natural response , we need to be schooled in it .
We need models , and we need to rehearse nonviolence in our daily lives if we ever hope to resort to it in crises .
Today we can draw on the cumulative historical experience of nonviolent social struggle .
But the spirit , the thrust , the surge for creative transformation that is the ultimate principle of the universe �this is the same one we see incarnated in Jesus .
His teaching reads like a practical manual for empowering the powerless to seize the initiative even in situations impervious to change .
To risk confronting the Powers with such clown - like vulnerability , to affirm at the same time our own humanity and that of those we oppose , to dare to draw the sting of evil by absorbing it �such behavior is unlikely to attract the faint of heart .
But to people dispirited by the enormity of the injustices that crush us and the intractability of those in positions of power , Jesus� words beam hope across the centuries .
We need not be afraid .
We can assert our human dignity .
We can lay claim to the creative possibilities that are still ours , burlesque the injustice of unfair laws , and force evil out of hiding from behind the facade of legitimacy .

Cars are to have aircraft - style black boxes installed to help cut the death toll on our roads .
From 2010 , all new cars will be fitted with the £ 400 devices , which automatically call the emergency services after a crash .
But motoring groups fear the technology could be developed to spy on drivers ' movements .
The palm - sized electrical devices activate an SOS distress signal following a crash serious enough to trigger the air bag or flip the car .
It will dial 112 - the pan-European emergency number - and send a digital text message with details of where and when the accident happened .
A voice link to the driver will allow paramedics to find out details about injuries and a " panic button " linking the driver to a central control room will also be installed .
Investigators hope to use the information to work out the causes behind crashes and to ensure the emergency services reach victims sooner .
EU Commissioner Viviane Reding claimed the eCall scheme could save about 2,500 lives every year across Europe .
Mobile phone maker Telit Communications has signed up to the eCall scheme along with Germany 's Siemens and Wavecom of France .
But some motoring groups said they feared the technology could be developed to track vehicles or pave the way for " pay - as - you - drive " congestion charging .
The Government is already considering proposals to make drivers pay up to £ 1.50 a mile .
Edmund King , of RAC Foundation , said : " If this black box is used purely as an SOS safety alert system , I do n't think motorists would have any objections .
" If however , it is developed later into a spy in the car , there would be problems .
" We do not want to see motorists checked electronically every second of the day to see if they are parked on a double yellow line or driving somewhere at four in the morning . "
The technology is already available in some cars .
Vauxhall 's parent company General Motors has a system called OnStar , which includes an automatic SOS option .
Duke Nukem Forever Teaser Debuts on Shacknews
Hail to the king , baby .
" The release is still ' when it 's done , ' but you can expect more frequent media releases and we 're not changing engines again and we have considerable work behind us , " Broussard told Shacknews today when asked about a release date .
Get the Flash Player to see this player .
The trailer features the work of longtime Duke voice actor Jon St. John as well as prolific game composers Jeremy and Julian Soule .
Several captures from the video are available below .
Platforms for the game were not confirmed , but when asked today whether Xbox 360 in addition to PC is likely , Broussard 's response sounded positive though not definitive .
" I do n't think we 've stated that yet for the record but your observations are probably correct , " he conceded .
First announced for PC in 1997 as a followup to the studio's classic Duke Nukem 3D , Duke Nukem Forever is known to have gone through several significant development iterations .
Its last major showing was at E3 2001 with its impressive gameplay trailer ; the current Duke Nukem Forever is said to share little in common with that game .
For more on the history of Duke Nukem Forever , check out Nick Breckon 's feature , published today .
" It 's basically a restart as the tech changed and we 've been on this version of the game since 2004 or so , " Broussard said today .
" The released media up to this point are not longer relevant other than for curiosity purposes . "

McCain says his lobbyists are ' honorable , ' but they do n't work for ' legitimate ' causes he picks Michael Roston
Published : Friday February 22 , 2008

Print This Email This Sen. John McCain is defending the private work performed by his campaign staff , many of whom earn healthy livings off the campaign trail as registered federal lobbyists .
Although the so - called " maverick " Arizona lawmaker has long fought to minimize the role of special interests in electoral politics , McCain called his senior campaign staff " honorable " for their lobbying work .
" These people have honorable records , and they 're honorable people , and I 'm proud to have them as part of my team , " he declared in Indianapolis , blaming the system and not the individuals who work within it for unduly influencing policy - making .
McCain later went on to say , " The right to represent interests or groups of Americans is a constitutional right .
There are people that represent firemen , civil servants , retirees , and those people are legitimate representatives of a variety of interests in America . "
Unfortunately for McCain , a review of federal records maintained by the Senate Office of Public Records show that the lobbyists at the top of the senator 's campaign and senatorial staffs do not represent fire fighters , civil servants , or retirees , the legitimate causes he identified in his address on Friday .
According to the SOPR database , the International Association of Fire Fighters ( IAFF ) does its own lobbying , and has also employed Dutko Worldwide , McAllister and Quinn , and Valis and Keelen , LLC .
The American Association of Retired People ( AARP ) also does much of its own lobbying , and has at times retained Bracewell & Giuliani , CJ Strategies , Davis , Wright Tremaine , LLP , Duberstein Group , Ernst & Young , Fleishman - Hillard Goverment Relations , Innovative Federal Strategies , Mark J. Iwry , Johnson , Madigan , Peck , Boland , and Stewart , and Reinecke Strategic Solutions .
Finally , the American Federation of State , County and Municipal Employees ( AFSCME ) does much of its own lobby work , too , and has also paid Jefferson Government Relations and Lussier , Gregor , Vienna and Associates .
At the federal level , the American Federation of Government Employees is a member of the AFL - CIO , and has been represented by mCapitol Management , and Murphy , Frazer , and Selfridge .
A report in Friday 's Washington Post noted some of the lobbying firms that McCain 's lieutenants are members of : Rick Davis of Davis Manafort ; Charles Black at BKSH and Associates ; Steve Schmidt of Mercury Public Affairs ; Marc McKinnon of Public Strategic , Inc. ; Mark Buse of ML Strategies ; and , Tom Loeffler of the Loeffler Group .
None of these firms are in the employ of the main representatives of the causes McCain identified as having a legitimate need to lobby government : fire fighters , civil servants , and retirees .
Which begs the question : if these causes are honorable , why are n't McCain 's top advisers lobbying on their behalf ?
And why are they instead representing large corporations , including AT&T , Verizon , JP Morgan , Land O'Lakes , Novartis Pharmaceuticals , and Toyota ?
Does McCain think these interests are on the same plane as fire fighers , civil servants , and retirees ?
Ultimately , though , McCain seems unfazed by the revolving door nature of the lobbyists who run his campaign .
" I 'm proud of the record of many of my advisers .
One small example , Charlie Black .
Charlie Black was involved in the first Reagan campaign , and he 's been involved in every national presidential campaign since , " the senator said at the rally .
With wire services
NAIROBI , Kenya ( CNN ) --
Gangs of young men armed with machetes are roaming the streets in Kenya as post-election violence threatens to engulf the country .
Horrific attacks are being reported , including the torching of a church where people who had sought refuge were burned alive .
At least 148 people have been killed and about 75,000 have fled their homes since President Mwai Kibaki won a narrow victory , according to Kenyan government officials .
The Associated Press reported a higher number -- about 275 -- have died since Saturday .
Much of the violence is between supporters of Kibaki from the majority Kikuyu tribe and backers of opposition leader Raila Odinga , who is from the Luo tribe .
The ethnic violence , previously rare in Kenya , is reminiscent of the strife that led to the Rwanda genocide .
In a particularly disturbing incident , a mob appears to have burned a church filled with Kenyans seeking refuge from the violence .
The Red Cross told The Associated Press that at least 50 were burned to death at the church , some of them children .
As many as 200 people were at the church , about 185 miles northwest of Nairobi , KTN reporter Tony Biwott told CNN .
Watch as machete - wielding looters haul away goods »
Biwott said he counted at least 15 charred bodies , including children , in the burned church and an adjacent field .
" I 'm sure there were more than 15 but I could n't count the ones who were ashes , " he said in a phone interview .
The wounded sustained gunshot wounds , burns and cuts from a panga , a machete - like weapon , the Red Cross said .
Watch smoke darken skies near a burned church
The national police commissioner has said in Kenyan society , churches are considered sacred and no one would expect such violence there .
He said an investigation into the incident is under way .
About 120 people are reported dead and over 1,000 injured countrywide , according to The Red Cross .
Police and political backers of opposition leader Raila Odinga began clashing about four days ago as Odinga , of the Luo tribe , narrowly lost Kenya 's presidential election to Mwai Kibaki .
Kibaki is a member of Kikuyu , Kenya 's largest tribe .
Violence broke out in several cities as frustration mounted during the slow hand - count of the ballots .
Kibaki was re-elected with 51.3 percent of the vote , to 48.7 percent for Odinga .
" What we now witness is a cold and calculated plan to organize and engage in massacres , " government spokesman Alfred Mutua said .
Bringing in the New Year , Kibaki -- who rarely speaks to the press -- urged calm to the nation .
" It now is a time for healing and reconciliation amongst all Kenyans , " he said .
Foreign Minister Raphael Tuju said the government is committed to taking control .
" If the tear gas does n't work then unfortunately they have to use live bullets , " he told CNN .
" The president has been sworn in , the elections are over , the Kenyans have to accept the results , the opposition has to accept the results . "
Tuesday , international observers said the balloting fell short of international standards for democratic elections .
Alexander Lambsdorff , the head of the EU Election Observation Mission in Kenya , cited discrepancies in vote counts , election observers being turned away from polling places and observers being refused entrance to the electoral commission vote - counting room .
The violence also has displaced some 75,000 Kenyans inside the country , Mutua said .
The government said Tuesday it will not allow any political rallies in the aftermath of the controversial election outcome .
Odinga 's opposition Orange Democratic Movement had scheduled rallies for Tuesday , raising fears of more violence .
Mutua said there was no intention to impose a state of emergency or curfew at this point , and said police are handling the violence well and with " extreme restraint . "
However , he warned that police restraint would not last forever .
The violence is rare for Kenya , which has enjoyed relative calm even as war and chronic political violence wracked neighboring countries , such as Ethiopia , Sudan and Uganda .
The United States has withheld congratulations for Kibaki , citing concerns of voting problems , even though Kibaki has claimed victory .

All About Mwai Kibaki • Kenya
On his Random Thoughts blog , security researcher Nicholas Weaver speculates about how ISPs , particularly AT&T , could aid the fight against copyright infringement .
His proposal to map torrent participants to IP addresses and verify that those addresses are uploading copyrighted material will be controversial , even if it is workable .
Weaver 's first observation is that " AT&T probably has a huge incentive to block pirated traffic " because , apparently , 5 percent of its users use 50 percent of the bandwidth .
Weaver continues to observe that it 's extremely easy to get a hold of pirated content on the Internet .
Legal campaigns against BitTorrent search sites have resulted in some small successes , but sites like The Pirate Bay continue to taunt the copyright industry with the likes of a Valentine - inspired sharing is caring slogan .
Weaver 's solution ?
All that is necessary is that the MPAA or their contractor automatically spiders for torrents .
When it finds torrents , it connects to each torrent with manipulated clients .
The client would first transfer enough content to verify copyright , and then attempt to map the participants in the Torrent .
The MPAA can then use an automated mechanism to inform the ISPs in question , which can then block the IP address of the BitTorrent user for a short time .
This would work much better than wide - scale deep packet inspection .
As noted before , routers have a hard enough time just routing the packets .
So what about this torrent mapping approach ?
Can it work , and would it be an attractive move for the MPAA to make ?
Basic operation should n't be a problem .
The idea behind BitTorrent is that a large file , such as a Divx - encoded movie , is partitioned in 256KB to 2 MB parts .
People download the parts they do n't have yet , and at the same time upload the parts that they do have to others .
Because everyone is both downloading and uploading at the same time , the total bandwidth of a BitTorrent " swarm " is huge , and the software is fairly good at making sure the uploading and downloading is tit for tat .
Traditionally , BitTorrent uses a " tracker , " a central server that keeps track of everyone downloading a certain file .
However , newer BitTorrent clients also use Dynamic Hash Tables , a mechanism that makes it possible to publish and find information ( such as torrent participants ) without a central server .
In both cases a client application needs to find other machines to connect to , so it would be trivially easy for an organization like the MPAA to hook into that and siphon off the list of IP addresses of people participating in a torrent .
It 's unclear whether having your IP address listed in a BitTorrent swarm would be sufficient evidence of copyright violation .
To show a clear - cut case of copyright infringement , it would likely be necessary for the MPAA to connect to those IP addresses to see if they actually upload pirated content .
That would make the process much more difficult , because large swarms can have thousands of participants and getting any specific one to upload to a given client does n't always work or can take a while .
Also , it 's uncertain whether a handful of 256KB chunks of a 1.2GB movie uploaded by a single member of a swarm would be sufficient to prove in court that copyright infringement occurred .
The MPAA would itself also have to upload in this scenario in order to avoid being flagged as a " leecher " and therefore ignored .
However , once the MPAA is satisfied that a certain address is distributing certain content , the RIAA 's legal campaign demonstrates that it 's possible ( at least in the US ) determine which ISP that address belongs to by filing a Doe lawsuit and subpoenaing the ISP .
Filtering these addresses in that ISP 's network , or even in the ISP 's network can be done by injecting routing information into the network that directs packets to ( from is a bit harder ) the address in question toward a black hole or a filter .
It 's not even necessary to go into routers to configure access lists to block packets .
So all of this could certainly work , although it may not work fast enough to make much of a dent in BitTorrent traffic : if it takes the MPAA and ISPs fifty minutes to find a pirate and they then block her for ten minutes , that 's still fifty minutes of prime downloading time per hour .
So it 's feasible , but is it a good idea ?
If the MPAA decides that it 's game for a legal campaign that will cost it tens of millions of dollars and turn into a PR nightmare , it could certainly happen in the US .
A EU commissioner recently called IP addresses " private information , " and a European Court of Justice ruling that ISP subscriber data can only be divulged in criminal cases make a legal campaign a much more dicey proposition in the EU .
So far , the motion picture industry has contented itself with moving against the P2P sites as opposed to individual users , and there 's no sign that will change anytime soon .
But if the MPAA decides to open the Pandora 's box of litigation , this could be a useful tool
ISLAMABAD , Pakistan ( CNN ) --
A missile strike in a remote part of Pakistan killed at least eight suspected militants and wounded three others Thursday , Pakistan 's state media reported .
The U.S. military denied any involvement in the incident , a source told CNN .
The strike happened in South Waziristan , a rugged mountainous region of Pakistan near its border with Afghanistan .
Intelligence officials believe that the area is a haven for al Qaeda and Taliban militants .
Local tribesmen said the missile was fired from an unknown location and struck a house where the militants had gathered , the Associated Press of Pakistan said .
The country 's Office of Inter - Services Public Relations told CNN that it was looking into the incident but could not provide details .
The office coordinates release of military news and access to military sources .
An official with the agency said the Pakistani army did not have a big military presence in the village of Azam Warsak , where the attack occurred .

The NHS has a target that all patients should be treated within four hours of arriving at the emergency room .
This is a laudable goal , but it has lead to some unexpected consequences : patient stacking .
According to the Daily Mail , ( ‘ A&E patients left in ambulances … ‘ ) , “ Thousands of people a year are having to wait outside accident and emergency departments because trusts will not let them in until they can treat them within four hours , in line with a Labour pledge . ”
According to the Daily Mail figures , 43,576 patients waited longer than one hour before being let into emergency units .
A department of health spokesperson noted that there are 4.3 million patient emergency journeys per year so according to the Daily Mail figures , just over 1 % of individuals waited more than one hour due to patient stacking .
While 1 - 2 % of emergency journeys does not seem like a lot , it does mean that about 120 people every day wait more than one hour to enter the emergency room .

It is rare that a bad pharma story is left untouched by the British media , but this one unfolded while everyone was drunk in December , and perhaps it was just too geeky .
Luckily , you share my taste for details .
Ezetimibe is a best - selling cholesterol drug with sales of more than £ 2bn last year .
It can modify cholesterol levels but no one knows whether it cuts the incidence of real outcomes such as heart attacks , or , you know , death .
Is that the bad thing ?
No .
There was a trial , called ENHANCE , which looked at this more closely , running for years and ending two years ago .
Doctors still give out the drug and they could do with this medical evidence to help with prescribing : but it ’s nowhere to be found .
Is that the bad thing ?
Kind of .
Let ’s imagine we ’re playing snakes and ladders .
I roll the die three times in a row then pick the best score as my actual roll , as if the other two were just practice .
I invite you , winningly , to ignore those other rolls .
You would rightly kick the board over , declaring I was a cheat .
I waited until after I knew the results and then I chose the score that suited me best .
Similarly , in a trial , you might measure many things but you have to say which is the “ primary outcome ” before you start : you ca n’t change your mind about what you ’re counting as your main outcome after you ’ve finished and the results are in .
It ’s not just dodgy , it also messes with the statistics .
You cannot find your starting hypothesis in your final results , unless you are a time lord .
What if the results were completely random , like our die , and you just selected the one six , making it look as if you were a winner ?
But the people running the ENHANCE trial altered their chosen endpoint when the trial was over .
They say they did so before they knew the results .
That may be so , but it does n’t look good , and they ’ve now had a very serious letter from a US congressional committee demanding to know why it was done .
( I seriously recommend you read it , the letter is a hoot , and it pulls no punches ) .
Then they announced they were changing the endpoints back , in a press release FAQ dated the same day this committee ’s letter was sent .
You cannot change the rules after the game has started .
You can not even be seen to do that .
To stop firms doing this kind of thing we have registers of clinical trials .
Before your trial starts you put it on the register and publish detailed information about what you ’re going to do – so you ca n’t change your mind once the game has begun or bury unfavourable data .
That ’s the point of a clinical trials register .
Was the Enhance trial registered ?
Yes .
Oh no , hang on , yes , but registered on October 31 2007 , more than 18 months after it finished .
And looking at some original papers , this register entry in fact had the cheeky altered outcomes .
So is that the really bad thing ?
No .
Here is the very bad thing .
It also transpires there are more unpublished studies on Ezetimibe , from five years ago , and some regard safety .
A Schering executive , Robert J Spiegel , says the firms had not considered those studies scientifically important enough to publish .
Some , he suggests , could be eventually placed in the public domain .
And that is the final straw : because all of this breaks the most fundamental and sacred contract in clinical research , the moral contract between patient and researcher .
Patients are in the hands of researchers on the understanding they are taking modest risks to benefit mankind as a whole , to improve prescribing .
Ezetimibe may well be safe .
But nonetheless the data belongs to patients – and to the people whose bodies are used .

POPL 2008 の 面白かった発表めも最終日。たぶん論文名でググればPDFが見つかるものが多いと思います。
" Clowns to the Left of Me , Jokers to the Right " 。昔から勝手に大ファン の Conor McBright 氏の発表なのです 。Zipper はコンテナの中を行ったり来たりしなが ら
１個１個順番に操作を加えるデータ構造だけど、コンテナの要素の型は変えない。この論文では、
コンテナの要素を別の型に置き換えていく操作に一般化したZipperみたいなものを与えています。 …ってわかりにくいな。map をステップバイステップでできるようにしたのが
Zipper だとすれば、 今度のは fold をステップバイステップでできるようにしたもの、というか。 そしてあるコンテナ のZipperは、そのコンテナの型を微分！すれば 自動的に得られるのに対し、今度のは型に対す るDissectionという操作で自動的に得られる。
" Extensible Encoding of Type Hierarchies " 。 多重継承対応かつインクリメンタルな、クラスの継承関係を効率的に判定する方法 " ESE " 。 既存手法も色々おもしろい（→前まとめた記事）けどこれも面白い。 方法としては、クラスの集合をできるだけ少ない個数の
" Straight Slice " の集合に適当に分割する、 というもの 。Straight Slice とはクラスのリストで 「 リスト内で ... , classA , ... , classB , ... , classC , ...
の順にクラスが並んでたらclassAの派生クラスかつclassCの派生クラスなクラスは全てclassBの派生クラスでもある 」 ようなもの。こうすると、任意のクラス c について、「 cの先祖」は必ず 各Straight Slice内で連続して並ぶ ようになる。なるので、その範囲を覚えておけば先祖判定が少ない手間でできるようになる。
新しいクラスを追加するときには、可能な限り親と同じスライスの親の隣に置くようにする、という感じで
PQ Encodingとかより局所的な手間で追加もできる。 （※追記：比較対象の DSTの論文 ( リンク 先PDF ) 読んでみたら、もうこっから Straight Slice に基づく手法なのか。なるほど。 このスライスの格納の仕方が違うと言うことかな）
" The Design and the Implementation of Typed Scheme " 。PLT Scheme に #lang typed - scheme を実装。 元々PLT Scheme にcontractのシステムがあるので、untyped scheme からは typed scheme で書かれた モジュールの型は contract として見えるようにしてあるというのが、へーと思った。 " 型 " は例えば ( define - type-alias Complex (∪ Number ( cons Number Number ) ) ) こんなん で 、Number か NumberとNumberのペア、だけが入ることを期待することを表現したりできる。 データを表現するS式の構造を型とする感じだろうか。
あと厄介なのが同じ変数に、場所によって違う型をつけなきゃいけないパターン
( lambda ( x : ( ∪ Number Boolean ) ) ( if ( number ? x ) (+ x 1 ) ( not x ) ) )
で、これをやる既存の型システムはなかなかないと。number?
のような述語の判定がどうなるかtrue/falseまで
型判定に含めておいてif式で分岐するところで別の環境を使えるようにするシステムになってるみたい？

A home improvement loan helps the owner to give more value to the property and offer low interest rates and comfortable fees .
After conducting many investigations experts discovered that getting a home improvement loan will help to increase the value of the property or the house .
People should think carefully before applying for a home improvement loan and consider which improvements or renovations are the ones that could cause an increase in the price of the house ; for instance , to build one or more bedrooms or a loft transformation can hike up the value of your home .
Originally released in 70's as a trainer designed for basketball freaks , Adidas Campus is featured sporting a Vintage style as apart of the latest collection .
This Adidas Campus Vintage have a multi-colored woven upper with insertions of suede and leather .
This model looks like it is straight out of the 1970 with bright colors for summer and a retro woven material .
Despite the clasic design it is a great fashion model and will be available later this month at Adidasi in Romania .
So , my wife is finishing up a graduate degree , and is thus currently in a course called " Mathematical Methods for Physicists " .
They 're covering a heck of a lot of ground , but one of her recent homework questions caused me great offense :
∫ ( 0 , ∞ ) sin ( bx ) dx
" A- ha , " I thought , " the partial sums do not converge , therefore this integral is divergent . "
But the actual answer was different :
How the heck did that work ?
Why has n't someone outlawed this ?
How can we find an integral for something that diverges like that ?
( The use of Euler I understand , it 's " how can you suddenly add this new variable in there " )
NEW YORK ( Hollywood Reporter ) - A former “ Dateline NBC ” correspondent claims that in the aftermath of September 11 , the network diverted him from reporting on al Qaeda and instead wanted him to ride along with the country ’s “ forgotten heroes , ” firefighters .
John Hockenberry , who was laid off from “ Dateline ” in early 2005 , wrote in this month ’s Technology Review that on the Sunday after the September 2001 attacks he was pitching stories on the origins of al Qaeda and Islamic fundamentalism .
He claimed that then - NBC programming chief Jeff Zucker , who came into a meeting Hockenberry was having with “ Dateline ” executive producer David Corvo , said “ Dateline ” should instead focus on the firefighters and perhaps ride along with them a la “ Cops , ” the Fox reality series .
According to Hockenberry , Zucker said “ that he had no time for any subtitled interviews with jihadists raging about Palestine . ”
NBC News was n’t impressed by this or any of Hockenberry ’s other claims .
“ It ’s unfortunate that John Hockenberry seems to be so far out of touch with reality , ” an NBC spokesperson said .
“ The comments are so utterly absurd , we will have no further comment . ”
Another NBC executive said it did n’t sound like Zucker , who was promoted out of the news division and was at one time “ Today ” executive producer .
Hockenberry is a distinguished fellow at the MIT Media Lab in Cambridge , Mass .
But for more than 20 years , he was a broadcast journalist working at National Public Radio , ABC News and from 1996 - 2005 , a correspondent at “ Dateline . ”
Hockenberry ’s blistering article trained much of its fire on the controversial NBC newsmagazine , which has been criticized for its “ To Catch a Predator ” series -- a “ highly rated pile of programming debris , ” in Hockenberry ’s words .
Another bombshell is Hockenberry ’s claims that General Electric , NBC ’s parent company , discouraged him from talking to the Bin Laden family about their estranged family member .
Hockenberry asked GE , which does business with the Bin Laden family company , to help him get in contact with them .
Instead , a PR executive called Hockenberry ’s hotel room in Saudi Arabia and read a statement about how GE did n’t see its “ valuable business relationship ” with the Bin Laden Group as having anything to do with “ Dateline . ”
In another instance , Hockenberry claimed a story he did about a Weather Underground member would n’t appear on the Sunday edition of “ Dateline ” unless its lead - out , the 1960s family drama “ American Dreams , ” did a show about “ protesters or something . ”
And for another story on the abuse of mentally ill inmates , Hockenberry was told by a producer that video of a fatal attack on a prisoner by guards was n’t enough .

WASHINGTON  Bush administration officials said Tuesday that they were confident that charges against six suspected members of Al Qaeda would survive expected defense contentions that the cases are based on unreliable statements obtained using harsh interrogation methods .
The officials confirmed that the Justice Department and the Pentagon , aware of probable legal challenges involving possible mistreatment of prisoners , began an extensive effort in late 2006 to rebuild the cases against the six men using what officials called “ clean teams ” of agents and military investigators .
By interviewing the prisoners again , and reassembling other evidence against them , the prosecutors could present evidence in court that would be harder for defense lawyers to challenge .
But some legal experts said that approach might not defuse defense arguments that the initial investigations were tainted .
The chief military prosecutor for detainees held at Guantánamo Bay in Cuba , Col. Lawrence J. Morris of the Army , declined to discuss the details of how prosecutors would deal with questions about the treatment of captured terrorism suspects .
But , Colonel Morris added , “ we will take very seriously our burden to present trustworthy evidence on which a panel can rely ” in reaching a verdict .
Imagine a country hosting the Olympic Games where internet content is routinely monitored for material that irks the powerful ; material that must be stopped , and whose recipients must suffer the force of the law .
China , this year ?
Yes ; but also , perhaps , Britain in 2012 .
That is , if some parts of a strategy paper - emphatically not a Green Paper , as those map out the path to legislation - to be published jointly tomorrow by the Department of Culture , Media and Sport and the Department for Business , Enterprise and Regulatory Reform ( DBERR ) are implemented .
The part that has drawn the most attention is the government 's threat - which is understood to be repeated in the document - that if internet service providers ( ISPs ) and " content producers " cannot agree how to regulate and control illicit downloading of copyrighted content by Britons , then ministers create new legislation that will force ISPs to police what passes through their systems .
The announcement marks a victory for the record industry in Britain , which has struggled for years to find a response to the explosion in illegal downloading since the first peer - to - peer filesharing program , Napster , appeared in 1999 .
It has tried lawsuits against filesharers ; though it won every one of the dozens of cases brought , piracy has continued to grow .
The 2007 Digital Music Survey by Olswang , which interviewed 1,700 people , found that in 2007 , 43 % of respondents had carried out " unauthorised downloading " - compared to 36 % in 2006 , but 40 % in 2005 .
Possibly the new broadband users in 2006 had n't figured out file - sharing systems ; but they have now .
The survey also found in 2007 that 18 % of those asked said they'd do it more often in the future : only one - third cited fears of prosecution as a reason for downloading less .
Three strikes , you 're off
Now , the music industry has used its lobbying muscle with the government - which is always happy with an industry that employs thousands and generates millions of pounds in taxable revenue - to force ISPs to sit down and create a new framework to choke downloading .
Under the scheme , the British Phonographic Industry ( BPI ) , representing the record industry , will gather evidence about people suspected of downloading material illicitly and pass it on to the relevant ISP , which will then send a warning letter to the customer .
The third warning will mean termination of the account .
There are even proposals that ISPs should create a central database naming people who have been warned or cut off .
" The three - strike process is far better then landing someone with a great big lawsuit , " says Matt Phillips of the BPI .
" Surveys we 've done suggest that 70 % of consumers would stop sharing on their connection if they knew it was being done illicitly .
And it 's got to be better than taking them to court , where they 'll face a legal bill of at least £ 3,000 . "
For the BPI , too , such a system is far preferable because it transfers the apparent responsibility for taking action from them to the ISPs - who until now have taken a hands - off role , insisting they are merely conduits for whatever data passes over their connections .
Indeed , that " conduit " status gives them exemption from all sorts of legal comeback by content creators under the Electronic Commerce Regulations of 2002 .
But ISPs are uneasy about the move , whose gaps have already been demonstrated by Tiscali , one of the major ISPs with about 2 million UK customers .
Last year it began implementing precisely the scheme that the BPI wants .
The BPI identified 21 IP addresses of Tiscali customers suspected of file - sharing and passed them to Tiscali , which warned the users ; four were subsequently cut off .
Who pays the pipe owner ?
But then the two sides began disagreeing : Tiscali became uneasy about the legal implications if it were challenged ; would the BPI be prepared to take joint liability ?
And would the BPI share the costs of identifying and contacting the accused users , since most ISPs operate on very low margins : every support call loses money ( Making a play for customers , August 30 2007 ) .
The two sides could n't agree , and the BPI has sent Tiscali no more IP addresses since October .
The BPI says that such details are not immediately important : " If somebody is being banjacked [ having their connection hijacked ] , then the three - stage process is far more reasonable than having a lawsuit arrive one morning , " says Phillips .
ISPA , the organisation which represents ISPs , sounds frustrated by the corner it is being forced into .
It has little lobbying power , being a relatively new industry - it barely existed 15 years ago - that employs relatively few people and does n't generate exports .
Those qualities do n't endear it to the government , even if ISPs have enabled the explosion in internet use that has led to roughly 90 % of home connections being broadband .
" Using bittorrent [ a file - sharing protocol used to distribute both legal and illicit materials ] is n't illegal , " points out ISPA .
" We prefer to go with self - regulation because it 's generally seen to be more nimble than legislation .
And it has proved effective - look at what we 've managed to do with the Internet Watch Foundation to get abusive images of children off the internet in Britain . "
By contrast , ISPA says , legislation such as the Computer Misuse Act takes a long time to implement and leaves loopholes , while also criminalising activities that some need to do ( such as scanning systems for weaknesses ) .
The complications are increased by the fact that legitimate organisations now use filesharing .
The BBC , Channel 4 and Sky all use the Kontiki peer - to - peer software for their " watch anytime " services ; some users have been surprised to find that they are uploading material from their computers while watching it .
Equally , BitTorrent - the commercial company built around the bittorrent protocol - distributes music and film from its site via filesharing .
Can the BPI and ISPs be certain that they are challenging someone who is really breaking the law ?
And where is the burden of proof ?
Will accused filesharers be able to see the evidence against them , and where will they be able to challenge it ?
ISPA says that such discussions are " ongoing " , but the government has started the clock ticking .
In an interview last month Lord Triesman , the ( first ever ) minister for intellectual property at DBERR , hinted that if there was no agreement between the two sides , he might aim to add proposals for legislation to the Queen 's Speech , due in November .
That would probably mean legislation would come into force in 2009 or 2010 - a prospect that ISPs do not find edifying .
There are many " what ifs ? " outstanding : what if someone uses someone else 's unsecured Wi -Fi connection ?
What if someone uses a shared space such as an internet cafe or university ?
Or , what if filesharers begin using encryption and " tunnelling " to hide from view ?
But imagine , finally , that a rigorous self - regulation procedure is in place , and that the internet populace knows about it .
Does the BPI think its members ' sales will grow ?
For once , Phillips hesitates .
" That 's really hard to answer .
But it would send out the message that copyright is to be respected , that creative industries are to be respected and paid for , " he says .
" It would mean that the people who are paying for content would n't be subsidising those who do n't .
But I can't say to you now that it would make sales grow , or by how much . "
A young hacker accused of helping to corral more than 400,000 computers into a money - making botnet has pleaded guilty to criminal charges in connection with the scheme , which he admits damaged US military computers .
The defendant was identified only by the the initials B.D.H. because he was a juvenile when the crimes were committed .
He is better known by the handle " SoBe " in internet relay channels frequented by hackers .
He appeared in US District Court in Los Angeles on Monday , where he pleaded guilty to two counts of juvenile delinquency .
His plea agreement contemplates a sentence of one year to 18 months in prison .
SoBe entered the public spotlight in November 2005 as an " unindicted co-conspirator " to Jeanson James Ancheta , who eventually pleaded guilty to four felony charges in connection with the same botnet .
With SoBe located in Boca Raton , Florida , and Ancheta working in Downey , California , the two built a lucrative business by surreptitiously installing adware on computers and then pocketing affiliate fees .
According to court documents , the pair collected at least $ 58,000 in 13 months , but it 's possible they made much more .
" It 's immoral , but the money makes it right , " Ancheta told SoBe during one online chat , according to the indictment charging Ancheta .
" I just hope this stuff lasts a while so I do n't have to get a job right away , " SoBe told Ancheta during a different conversation .
Among the computers infected by SoBe and Ancheta were those belonging to the Defense Information Security Agency .
SoBe also claimed to have pwned machines maintained by Sandia National Laboratories .
While the two hackers were n't able to write their own malware - they made modifications to a well - known program called rxbot - they showed some skill in varying the download times and rates of the adware installations .
That allowed them to evade detection by network administrators and security analysts .
After collecting fees , the men used the infected computers to seek and infect new machines .
They also discussed temporarily shutting down their operations in response to enforcement actions by the FBI .
In May 2006 , Ancheta , who was an adult at the time of the offense , was sentenced to 57 months in federal prison .
Under federal guidelines
SoBe faces a maximum sentence of 15 years in custody , although juveniles can't be incarcerated beyond the age of 21 .
His sentencing hearing is scheduled for May 8 . ®
Karma whoring typically involves
Reposting material from the articles linked to .
This works famously because Slashdot readers often do n't actually read the article before responding to it or moderating .
Thus , karma whores look like they are providing useful information when they are just regurgitating common material .
Reposting common links , especially those that get around the " free registration required " to read articles on the NewYorkTimes ?
web site .
Regurgitating the party line with that little lemon twist of inflammatory rhetoric .
GroupThink is one of the most controversial aspects of karma whoring , as some think it 's legitimate to summarize the common viewpoint for future readers .
And probably more than that .
RobMalda ( Cmdr Taco ) , Editor in Chief of Slashdot , has generally been known to disparage the karma whores in public ( well , swear and rant at them ) , which has only made the game more entertaining .
Maybe he should have ignored it - c.f. DissuadeReputation .
Consequently , he installed the infamous KarmaCap of 50 karma to keep the whores in check ( who really needs more than 50 ? ) .
Further , it has backfired .
Because the game is to accumulate karma , the only way to accumulate more after you 've reached your cap is to " burn karma " off .
Spam , flames , hot grits , and odes to NataliePortman ?
quickly burn karma so the game begins again .
Of course , burning karma is fun too .
So much so that no self - respecting troll will keep their karma that high for too long .
Also , Malda instituted the equally infamous " bitch- slap " which reduces a particular individual 's karma below absolute zero .
This caused quite the famous [ flame war ] , leading to the departure of Signal 11 .
Apparently this has n't been used very often , though .
By the way , Signal 11 is the most famous KarmaWhore ever , despite having only whored consciously for a couple of weeks just to see what it was like .
Unfortunately , the reputation has stuck to him since .
( He 's more well received on KuroShin , though . )
See also MetaModeration , MojoAnalysis .
I 'm actually going to defend the first two practices listed here -- posting a digest of linked material ( though I 'd argue against the whole banana ) , or posting unencumbered links , not to mention mirrors to slashdotted content , is helpful .
The web as a medium is fairly low - friction , but it 's not friction free .
In particular , checking out multiple links from a page or article can be time consuming or confusing ( multiple pages open on a browser ) .
The magic key is linking to external content for additional information , but not for essential understanding of the current page or content .
ScoopEngine moderation handles this situation more cleanly than Slash .
To be highly - placed , a comment need only be moderated to a high value once , or a small number of times .
This accomplishes the goal of high placement on the page .
It 's only repeated moderation which starts having a sustained impact on a user 's mojo .
And , if a large number of users feel that the link is whorish behavior , it can be moderated down to an appropriate level .
I do agree with the general message that Slash moderation is pathologically broken .
-- KarstenSelf
KarmaWhores are the perfect phenomenon to show how scored moderation creates people who would like to screw with the system .

My job can be so exciting .
I get to work with some of the brightest minds and most accomplished luminaries in technology , politics , and business .
I am consistently humbled and feel lucky for the opportunities I get .
That said , of all the folks with whom I have interacted in the last couple of years , almost no one has impressed me more than MC Hammer .
Yeah , that 's right , MC Hammer .
I recently invited Hammer to Google to check the place out and meet some folks .
The guy has opinions on everything , but particularly likes to think about how broken the music industry is today from the perspective of the artist .
It did n't surprise me that he had he head around that space , considering he has been in the business for years .
Yet , I will admit to initially underestimating Hammer as a technologist .
As we spoke it became clear that from WiFi , to video compression , to secure payment systems , Hammer is a geek , and a well - informed one at that .
As we walked across the Google campus , Hammer told me he had been there years ago when it belonged to SGI .
Back then , he visited to better understand how his videos could be viewed by fans on the Internet .
Rather than rely on just reading about streaming video , he wanted to go to the source and get the scoop firsthand .
Anyway , the visit was a blast .
While moving through our building and cafeteria , Hammer attracted more handshakes and autograph requests than most world leaders who visit .
We had lunch with 15 or so Googlers and Hammer held court .
They were rapt with attention for over an hour .
Bottom line , five things worth noting about Hammer :
1 ) Hammer is a man of action - During lunch , we were talking about Blogger .
Hammer told us he wanted to learn more about this and understand how to set one up .
I told him I could put together a meeting next week , blah blah .
Without hesitation he said " Why not now ? " I was caught off guard .
Have I become the slow bureaucrat that pushes off meetings until next week ?
Yikes .
I cancelled my next appointment and took Hammer immediately to Blogger HQ where Case and Goldman put together a sweet blog for him and linked it to his T - Mobile Sidekick .
( blog url coming soon )
2 ) The world loves Hammer - As we walked around the Googleplex , it was amazing how many international Googlers recognized him and came up to say hi and give him props .
Asians , Africans , Europeans .
They were all excited to see Hammer .
3 ) Young people dig Hammer - I was suprised to see how young a lot of his fans were .
I mean , many of the adoring masses were 22 or 23 years old .
That means those kids were 7 or 8 years old when " U Can't Touch This " was hot .
I asked a few of them what the deal was .
Did they remember Hammer from back in the day ?
A few claimed to .
However , most told me that Hammer was all about the 80s , and the 80s are back .
4 ) Hammer is a master marketer - He has a new album in hand .
( We heard some tracks .
It 's hot .
Very well produced . )
Following his trademark style , the hooks to his tunes are very catchy and easily repeatable even by the most soulfully challenged .
On top of that , Hammer has a few new dances up his sleeves .
Hopefully , he will unleash them soon so we can all clue in before holiday party season is upon us .
Either way , I predict good things for this album .
5 ) Hammer is a nice guy -
No matter how many times people interrupted for a photo or to ask him to sign something , Hammer was beyond cordial and went out of his way to make them happy .
It was amazing how polite and cheery he was with everyone .
So cool .
The man is too legit .

UPDATE : Hammer is easily the coolest blogger I know .
Check his stuff out here : http://mchammer.blogspot.com/.
His voice is so sincere , he posts regularly , he interacts with his commenters , he even leaves audioposts .
So awesome .
Way to be , Hammer !
