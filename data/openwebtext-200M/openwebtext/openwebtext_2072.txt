Opponents say the bill will lead to ' Frankenstein ' - style experiments
Fertility expert Lord Winston said statements made by Cardinal Keith O'Brien were discrediting the Church .
Some 200 medical charities have urged MPs to support legislation allowing the creation of animal - human embryos .
Scientists say hybrid embryos will bring medical benefits but detractors in the Church say it is immoral .
Shortage of eggs
The controversy first began when the government announced plans to update the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act , which would expand the scope of embryo research .
The legislation would allow scientists to combine animal eggs with human nuclei , which can then be grown into stem cells .
It was introduced because of a shortage of donated human eggs .
Over the Easter weekend , a number of Catholic Church leaders weighed into the dispute , saying the plans undermined the sanctity of life .
I have huge respect for the Catholic Church ... but it will be destroying its probity with overblown statements of this kind
Lord Winston
In his Easter sermon , Cardinal O'Brien described the legislation as a " monstrous attack on human rights , human dignity and human life " , adding that it would allow experiments of " Frankenstein proportion " .
But Lord Winston told the Daily Telegraph he thought the cardinal 's statements were inaccurate .
He said : " They are misleading and I 'm afraid that when the Church , for good motives , tells untruths , it brings discredit upon itself . "
" I have huge respect for the Catholic Church , which does great good , but it will be destroying its probity with overblown statements of this kind . "
The row has intensified with a number of Catholic Labour cabinet members warning that they may vote against the government .
Claims defended
Catholic leaders have denied misleading the public over the issue .
The Archbishop of Cardiff , Peter Smith , called for a " calm , reasoned debate based on the facts " .
He said : " I refute any suggestion that the Catholic bishops have been lying about this Bill or misleading people as to its contents and import , " he said .
" Contrary to what a number of scientists have claimed , this Bill does in fact allow the creation of animal - human hybrid embryos for research . "
The Bishop of Lichfield , the Rt Revd Jonathan Gledhill , said : " It 's a very important part of our society and a very important part of the Christian faith that you should have respect for human embryos .
" If you stop obeying God you start to limit the rights of human beings and this is a case in point . "
Research ' hampered '
Cancer Research and the British Heart Foundation are among more than 200 charities in favour of the creation of human - animal hybrids for research .
In a letter to every MP , the charities argue that current research is being " significantly hampered " by a shortage of donated human eggs .
The charities said : " The bill will allow new avenues of scientific inquiry to be pursued which could greatly increase our understanding of serious medical conditions affecting millions of people throughout the UK . "
They are hopeful of finding cures for diseases and genetic disorders such as cancer , heart disease , Parkinson 's and muscular dystrophy .
Free vote
The government appears to be seeking a compromise over the bill after warnings that substantial number of Labour MPs are ready to defy the government .
Health Secretary Alan Johnson said the government would seek an " accommodation " with Labour MPs allowing them to vote according to their conscience rather than on party lines .
Tory leader David Cameron has urged Gordon Brown to allow all MPs a free vote on the issue .
He told BBC London radio : " What he should say is ' this is an important bill ... it does raise issues of conscience , so there should be free votes throughout the bill 's passage ' . "
The bill received its first reading in the House of Commons in February , and while no date has been set for its second reading - or approval in principle - it is viewed as a key piece of legislation on the government 's agenda .
In the case of the accused New York City detective , the authorities acted promptly and effectively .
The girl managed to escape and notified the police , who investigated immediately .
Detective Taylor and Ms. Brown were arrested and the case has been turned over to the office of Queens District Attorney Richard Brown .
Both are in custody .
But law enforcement does not always respond in a positive or constructive way .
It is common across the country for under - age girls engaged in prostitution to be arrested , which is bizarre when you consider that it is a serious crime  statutory rape  for an adult to have sex with a minor .
If no money is involved , the youngster is considered a victim .
But if the man pays for the sex  even if the money is going to the pimp , which is so often the case  the child is considered a prostitute and thus subject in many venues to arrest and incarceration .
“ We often see the girls arrested and the pimps and the johns go free , ” said Carol Smolenski , the head of Ecpat - USA , a group that fights the sexual exploitation of children .
“ One of the big problems is that there is this whole set of child sex exploiters who are not targeted as exceptionally bad guys . ”
What ’s needed is a paradigm shift .
Society ( and thus law enforcement ) needs to view any adult who sexually exploits a child as a villain , and the exploited child as a victim of that villainy .
If a 35 - year - old pimp puts a 16 - year - old girl on the street and a 30 - year - old john pays to have sex with her , how is it reasonable that the girl is most often the point in that triangle that is targeted by law enforcement ?
A measure of how far we still have to go is the fact that some enlightened officials in the state of New York tried to shift that paradigm last year and failed .
The proposed Safe Harbor
Act would have ended the practice of criminalizing kids too young to legally consent to sex .
Under the law , authorities would have no longer been able to charge children with prostitution , but would have had to offer such youngsters emotional counseling , medical care and shelter , if necessary .
Osama Bin Laden evaded a US - led offensive in Afghanistan in 2001
The man , named as Muhammad Rahim , helped arrange Bin Laden 's escape from his Tora Bora hideout in Afghanistan in 2001 , US officials say .
He was transferred to the Pentagon from CIA custody earlier this week , a Pentagon spokesman said .
The CIA captured Rahim , said to be an Afghan national , in the summer of 2007 .
A statement from CIA director Michael Hayden to intelligence staff said Rahim was " a tough , seasoned jihadist " , whose arrest was a blow to more than one terror network .
" His combat experience , which dates back to the 1980s , includes plots against US and Afghan targets , " Mr Hayden said .
" Rahim is perhaps best known in counter - terror circles as a personal facilitator and translator for Osama Bin Laden and other al - Qaeda leaders . "
' Most trusted '
Pentagon spokesman Bryan Whitman said Rahim was a close associate of Bin Laden and had ties to al - Qaeda groups throughout the Middle East .
Osama Bin Laden remains top of Washington 's ' Most Wanted ' list
" He is one of [ Osama Bin Laden 's ] most trusted facilitators and procurement specialists , " Mr Whitman said .
" He helped prepare Tora Bora as a hideout for Osama Bin Laden .
He assisted al - Qaeda 's exodus from the area in late 2001 . "
Rahim will be given access to the International Committee of the Red Cross at the Guantanamo Bay camp in Cuba , and will be treated in accordance with US and international law , Mr Whitman added .
CIA officials say the transfer to the Pentagon is the first such to take place for about a year .
US forces are believed to have come closest to trapping Bin Laden in a complex of caves in the mountainous Tora Bora region near the Pakistani border .
The hunt for him began following the 11 September 2001 terror attacks on the US by al - Qaeda operatives .
The Cost The United States of America spends 56 % of total government military spending on Planet Earth , with a published FY2008 military budget of $ 623 billion * ( in 2008 dollars ) .
China is a distant second at 6 % with an estimated 2004 military budget of $ 65 billion .
The entire " Axis of Evil " ( with Pakistan thrown in for good measure ) spends barely 1 % at less than $ 15 billion .
* This is the official defense budget , and does not include " supplementary " funding for the war(s ) .
In 2006 , supplementary funding for the Iraq and Afghan conflicts was just over $ 100 billion .
Total supplementary funding over the Iraq and Afghan conflicts has been roughly $ 450 billion .
What does the US get for that $ 623 billion ?
1,285,400 * Army
642,766 Navy
217,600 Marines
705,200 Air Force
* Numbers include active service , mobilized guard and reserve , national guard , selected reserve , and civilian contractors

Analysis
we
To maintain this position of strength , the Bush administration seeks to exploit US prowess in science and technology to ensure that American weapons , offensive and defensive , are always a generation or two ahead of those of any potential adversaries .
This follows the thinking of US strategists who favour a " revolution in military affairs " ( RMA ) which aims to redefine war through the procurement of advanced weapons - self - guiding munitions , advanced satellites , airborne sensors , unmanned aerial vehicles ( UAVs ) , robot - controlled gun systems , " low - yield " nuclear munitions and the famous NMD anti-ballistic system .
That 's a total of just under 3 million men and women under arms , 5 % ( about 140,000 ) of whom are immigrants .
We spend about $ 210,000 annually per soldier or about $ 2000 annually per US resident .
In the " early days of the Cold War " , the US military was required to be capable of responding to 2 1/2 wars ( e.g. : direct theatre - level conflict between NATO and the Warsaw Pact in Europe plus a similar war with China in Asia and a " half - war " with a regional state such as Vietnam ) .
During the first Bush administration ( GHW Bush , 1988 - 1992 ) , General Colin Powell developed the idea of the Base Force , emphasizing regional conflict over global conflict , and reducing the size of the standing forces .
Between 1993 and 2001 , the US military had an overall strategic objective of being able to fight two major strategic conflicts ( theatre level wars ) simultaneously .
Since 2001 , when Don Rumsfeld approved new " terms of reference " , the US military has been tasked with four missions :
If you compare the current scope of required military action with that of the Cold War , the US military has much less " on it 's plate " now .
The " one major conflict " ( say , with Iraq ) really matches up with the " half war " of the Cold War era , so we 've taken two global sized wars off the table .
Obviously the US military has been growing smaller since Vietnam , with a significant blip upward in 2008 ( unfortunately , I can't find good data right this moment for the last couple of years ) .
Post 2000 , it 's logical to assume that some of the draw down is being taken up by private contractors ( Blackwater , etc . ) .
Since the end of WWII , we see a variable trend upward in US military budget .
It appears that there is a " normal " military budget of a bit over $ 300 billion with bumps for Korea , Vietnam , and GWII .
GWI is a more diffuse bump -- possibly because we 're seeing a substantial change in the military 's mission and posture during the changeover to the Base Force .
No doubt , though , there 's a huge jump in the last few years ( once again , I do n't have continuous data for the last couple of years ) .
We are now at a post - WWII high and at nearly double the " normal " baseline .
Equally obviously , the historical trend in the US is to increase spending on a per-soldier basis .
This does n't argue that each soldier gets paid this much or uses this much equipment , but demonstrates that spending is increasing faster than the size of the US military ( which we see above is n't actually increasing over time except very recently ) .
In a business we'd look at these three graphs and immediately see something obvious : this company has a slight downturn in headcount , a large increase in budget and an overall increase in spending per employee .
The hope is that we 're seeing capital spending increases designed to improve productivity .
An alternative might be that we 're seeing a company retooling for a completely new function -- building planes instead of cars , for instance .
GWI was a fast war of maneuver , with tanks and helos and fixed - wing aircraft slicing decisively into enemy formations and destroying them .
Rather like we imagined what we would do ifwent rolling through the Fulda Gap instead of the Warsaw Pact trying to .
GWII started out the same way , and that phase of it ended the same way too -- with our mobile forces crushing everything they could find .
This was what the US military was designed to do against the Soviets or the Chinese in one of those " theatre - level " conflicts of the Cold War .
In a sense , GWI was the last hurrah of the Cold War US military machine .
GWII is the first hurrah of a new US military designed by Don Rumsfeld , which uses technology to increase " productivity " -- effectively providing the same effect using fewer soldiers Unfortunately , the " revolution in military affairs " people forgot something : technological improvement both ways .
That 's the background and some basic analysis -- sort of a primer of information you need at your fingertips if you want to talk about the US military .
Of course , there is no question she was terrifically interested in returning to Pakistan , and resuming power .
What has somehow escaped attention as a central factor in her death , however , is the pressure applied by Condi Rice for Bhutto to return to Pakistan , and , particularly , the representation Rice made to Bhutto -- against Bhutto's own intuition -- that President Musharraf was in support .
At this point , Benazir Bhutto 's death has been consigned as a fateful tragedy or a kind of cruel inevitability for " that part of the world . "
It 's as if Bhutto survived to the age of fifty - four simply out of sheer luck .
The reality , however , is that Bhutto was nothing if not shrewdly tactical in her decisions and highly circumspect when it involved her safety .
If you read through a series of investigatory articles published in late December by Newsweek and its sister publication , The Washington Post , the context surrounding Bhutto 's assassination takes on a disturbing political light -- one which the media has failed to draw conclusions from .
The photo was taken just before Condi Rice testified before the House Foreign Relations Committee last October .
As she prepares to sit down , she is confronted -- in a stark act of protest theatre -- by a member of the group Code Pink .
I thought Iraq , too , at least up till December 27th , when Benazir Bhutto was assassinated .
Looking at this photo , which was included in TIME 's 2007 Images Of The Year , you immediately think of Iraq , do n't you ?
Writes Robin Wright and Glenn Kessler in WAPO on December 27th :
For Benazir Bhutto , the decision to return to Pakistan was sealed during a telephone call from Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice just a week before Bhutto flew home in October .
The call culminated more than a year of secret diplomacy — and came only when it became clear that the heir to Pakistan 's most powerful political dynasty was the only one who could bail out Washington 's key ally in the battle against terrorism .
It was a stunning turnaround for Bhutto , a former prime minister who was forced from power in 1996 amid corruption charges .
She was suddenly visiting with top State Department officials , dining with U.N. Ambassador Zalmay Khalilzad and conferring with members of the National Security Council .
As President Pervez Musharraf 's political future began to unravel this year , Bhutto became the only politician who might help keep him in power .
" The U.S. came to understand that Bhutto was not a threat to stability but was instead the only possible way that we could guarantee stability and keep the presidency of Musharraf intact , " said Mark Siegel , who lobbied for Bhutto in Washington and witnessed much of the behind - the - scenes diplomacy .
If you read the Newsweek account , you 'll see how Condi imagined a Bhutto - Musharraf dream team .
It was Rice who convinced Bhutto to return to Pakistan and team up with Musharraf , even though Musharraf 's actions , Bhutto 's instincts , and the facts on the ground once Bhutto returned demonstrated -- as consistent with the " fantasy mind " of the Bush Administration -- that Rice 's actions were mostly guided by wishful thinking .
Wright and Kessler continue :
The turning point to get Musharraf on board was a September trip by Deputy Secretary of State John D. Negroponte to Islamabad .
" He basically delivered a message to Musharraf that we would stand by him , but he needed a democratic facade on the government , and we thought Benazir was the right choice for that face , " said Bruce Riedel , former CIA and national security council staffer now at the Brookings Institution 's Saban Center for Middle East Policy .
" Musharraf still detested her and he came around reluctantly as he began to recognize this fall that his position was untenable , " Riedel said .
The Pakistani leader had two choices : Bhutto or former prime minister Nawaz Sharif , who Musharraf had overthrown in a 1999 military coup .
" Musharraf took what he thought was the lesser of two evils , " Riedel said .
Many career foreign policy officials were skeptical of the U.S. plan .
" There were many inside the administration , at the State and Defense Departments and in intelligence , who thought this was a bad idea from the beginning because the prospects that the two could work together to run the country effectively were nil , " said Riedel .
As part of the deal , Bhutto 's party agreed not to protest against Musharraf 's reelection in September to his third term .
In return , Musharraf agreed to lift the corruption charges against Bhutto .
But Bhutto sought one particular guarantee — that Washington would ensure Musharraf followed through on free and fair elections producing a civilian government .
Rice , who became engaged in the final stages of brokering a deal , called Bhutto in Dubai and pledged that Washington would see the process through , according to Siegel .
A week later , on Oct. 18 , Bhutto returned .
Ten weeks later , she was dead .
Like a one trick pony , Rice 's idea was that the symbolism of an election would demonstrate to the world that democracy had taken hold in Pakistan .
( Not like we have n't seen the scenario backfire in Iraq several times already . )
The problem , however , is that Condi sold herself on the idea that Musharraf would play ball , and then proceeded to ignore all signals that did n't conform to that belief .
Reality was , however , that Musharraf -- as evidenced by his long - standing propensity toward lip service -- was never fully committed to partnering with Bhutto , even though his telling Condi what she wanted to hear is what ultimately led Bhutto to return , and play things out .
As Michael Hersh wrote in Newsweek on December 28th :
At Rice 's urging , Bhutto earlier this year agreed to take part in the parliamentary elections , with the understanding that the Pakistani president would keep his part of the bargain by permitting her , a twice - elected prime minister , to serve for a third term ( which was banned by a technical rule ) .
Instead , Musharraf did nothing to change the law and instead declared emergency rule — a decision that President Bush did not immediately denounce .
Nor did the Americans push Musharraf on the other aspects of the deal that would have allowed her to be a three - time prime minister .
" The Americans left her high and dry , " says a close Bhutto ally who requested anonymity when discussing diplomatic issues .
" They did not keep their word . "
According to this report , Condi was , again , personally involved in providing assurances regarding Bhutto 's security , taking Musharraf at his word that he had Bhutto 's safety in mind .
For Bhutto's part , after she arrived home , she did everything she could to telegraph that she was not just at risk , but being hung out to dry .
You 'll recall how Bhutto was nearly killed by a suicide bomber in October , the very day she returned to Pakistan .
That instance , too , involved a bomber trying to push through the crowd to her car .
As John Barry writes in Newsweek on December 27th :
After the Karachi carnage in October , Bhutto accused Musharraf 's government of failing to provide proper security .
Administration sources in Washington say that Rice personally urged Musharraf to provide Bhutto with at least the same security as that given to his own prime minister .
Although there was no turning back once she re-entered Pakistan and launched her campaign to regain power , it was pretty obvious to Bhutto from mid-October that she was in a death trap .
The signs and signals were everywhere .
Carlotta Gall , writing in the NYT on December 29th cited an October 26 email Bhutto sent to friend and associate Mark Siegel complaining about Musharraf , and the inadequate security associated with her public appearances .
She could n't have been more specific .
She wrote :
“ I have been made to feel insecure by his minions and there is no way what is happening in terms of stopping me from taking private cars or using tinted windows or giving jammers or four police mobiles to cover all sides could happen without him . ”
On October 26th , Wolf Blitzer also received a now highly publicized message from Bhutto , via Siegel , to be disclose only upon her death .
It detailed the basic security requirements above , and asked that the reporter make it known that the four police vehicles she had requested to surround her vehicle while traveling were never supplied .
... If you have n't seen the video footage of the assassination , by the way , you might notice that not only was there no escort , but three nearby policemen supposedly tasked to protect Bhutto's car at the moment of the attack where simply idling around .
Giving the impotency of the State Department in the face of Bhutto's protection , no wonder the agency was so keen to be part of the murder investigation following Bhutto 's murder .
Surely , Condi and her team had a special interest in throwing as much suspicion on al Qaeda or other " evil doers " to direct attention away from the Administration for committing Bhutto to the wolves den .
According to the piece by Eric Schmitt in the January 2nd NYT , the sniping between the State Department and Bhutto's husband and widower , Asif Ali Zardari , publicly drew a circle of responsibility that pulled in Washington .
According to Schmitt 's piece , titled U.S. Is n’t Ready to Accept Pakistan ’s Initial Findings , unnamed U.S. officials revealed on New Years Day that Bush Administration officials " had differed " with Ms. Bhutto ’s people over her security arrangements .
Schmitt fills in the story as follows :
The elder Mr. Zardari ... complained that the Bush administration failed to press Mr. Musharraf ’s government hard enough to provide adequate security for his wife during her campaign .
On Tuesday , however , American officials fired back , saying they had provided a constant flow of threat reports to Ms. Bhutto and her political advisers , even before she returned to Pakistan on Oct. 18 after a self - imposed exile .
American intelligence officials said they never received a credible threat of an attack with a specific date , time or place .
Short of that , they said , Ms. Bhutto , a strongly opinionated , two - time prime minister , decided she would mount an aggressive political campaign .
“ U.S. officials repeatedly met with and spoke with former Prime Minister Bhutto and members of her party — including Zardari — to discuss her security concerns , ” the State Department official said .
“ It was general advice , not what route to take or which rally to attend . ”
The official said that each time Ms. Bhutto or her advisers requested the administration ’s help in getting increased security for her from the Musharraf government , administration or embassy officials pressed her case with Pakistani authorities .
On the day she was killed , Ms. Bhutto was riding in an armored car after a political rally in Rawalpindi .
The State Department official said diplomats at the United States Embassy in Islamabad , including Ambassador Anne W. Patterson , were in daily contact with officials from Ms. Bhutto ’s party .
The Americans passed along information and specific advice on private security contractors to hire ...
...
But Ms. Bhutto and her husband rejected that suggestion , the official said , apparently fearing that even the reputable Pakistani firms might be infiltrated by extremists .
This is quite a telling passage , illuminating -- among other things -- how much the State Department went into full CYA mode after the assassination , implementing a strategy of blaming the victim .
More specifically , the fact that Team Condi was left to push for private security confirms , in a rather definitive way , how the U.S. lacked the leverage or hope of forcing its supposed client , Musharraf , to provide Benazir Bhutto , his supposed election partner , with any protection at all .
Going back to the photograph , one week after 136 loyalists died in the first suicide attack on Bhutto , and the same day the NYT reported that Bhutto has been barred by the Pakistan Foreign Ministry from leaving the country , Condi -- appearing before Congress to hype an attack on Iran based on allegations that would be thoroughly discredited five weeks later -- turns her back on a dark haired woman confronting her with blood on her hands .
I wonder , because TIME 's year - end feature came out just before Bhutto's assassination , what the Western - minded leader might have made of this image of the year .

Final Thoughts
The next time you drive into a gas station , thank Bush for the war that helped make all this possible .
Thank Bush for all those sorties and combat ships that use all that fuel .
Thank Bush for the fact that there is less oil coming out of Iraq today than there was seven years ago .
Thank Bush for the policies of fear , intimidation , and strike first ask questions later that keeps the Mideast in a constant state of stress and adds to the price of oil .
The Public Has Finally Caught On
The fake fiscal conservatives who supported Bush and this stupid war , the fake fiscal conservatives who supported Bush 's insane military spending , and the fake Republican conservatives that supported numerous other Bush insanities in clear violation of the constitution brought this all about .
And as amazing as it seems , the public has finally figured out that Bush 's policies in the Mideast are a significant part of the reason why the dollar is collapsing and oil prices are soaring .
That realization is why Obama Will Be The Next President Of The United States .

The Ron Paul Revolution Marches On
For the record , I still support the Ron Paul cause .
Ron Paul 's efforts to redirect and save the Republican Party and nation , should be applauded and supported .
In his video , Ron Paul is asking for a March on Washington .
He 's hoping for a miracle at the convention , and barring that , he 's laying important groundwork for the future .
Ron Paul is the only true fiscal conservative that I can find in either party .
Play the video .
Become involved .
Be a part of the solution .
Hat tip to " Wade " for the link .
The final analysis shows however , that this election is coming down between Obama and McCain .
The final analysis also shows this country cannot possibly take four more years of the same policies we have suffered with for the last eight .
And while everyone is pondering that , it 's time for a sing along .
I 'm sure most of you will know the tune .
Where have all the dollars gone ?
The next time you fill up with gas remember those pictures and sing this song ....
Where have all the dollars gone ?
Long time passing
Where have all the dollars gone ?
Long long time ago
Where have all the dollars gone ?
Gone to Dubai every one
When will they ever learn ?
When will they ever learn ?

By Congressman Dennis Kucinich , special to www.ImpeachCheney.org
As a member of Congress , I have sworn an oath to defend the Constitution and the laws of our nation , and I have pledged to represent the views of my constituents and of all Americans .
That ’s why I feel both duty and sorrow in pursuing the path of impeachment against Vice President Richard B. Cheney .
While the impeachment movement has generated intensely strong sentiment and activism , there have been only two polls published on the question of impeaching Vice President Cheney .
In a national poll , 54 percent of Americans favored impeachment .
In one state poll , 64 percent of Vermonters favored impeaching the Vice President .
Twenty - one of my colleagues have heeded the public demand and signed on as cosponsors of my resolution , H Res 333 .
Others in the Congress have claimed they have more important priorities , but have told their constituents they will keep their views in mind if the matter ever comes up for a vote .
Well , the issue is coming up for a vote this week on the floor of the U.S. House of Representatives , and the “ distraction ”  will require members to balance their priorities between Constitutionally proscribed justice and recourse and the alternative : Constitutional abuse and dictatorial power .
Only by taking up impeachment can we reinstitute a balance of powers and slow down the rush to launch a new war of aggression against Iran .
I am urging my colleagues to recognize that impeachment will not create a crisis by briefly disrupting their schedules on Capitol Hill .
The crisis , as Americans outside the Beltway know , is upon us .
Congress , the first branch of our government , to which the first half of the Constitution is devoted , has been reduced to almost a bystander as the policies of the wealthiest nation and the largest military ever known are set in secret by the Vice President ’s office .
Under Bush / Cheney , we have become a nation that illegally threatens and launches aggressive wars for political “ “ not national security — reasons .
For this crisis of confidence , this denial of our Constitutional beliefs and rights , impeachment is the only cure available .
I urge you , my fellow citizens , to share your sentiments with your Members of Congress and with your family , friends , and the news media in support regarding the rule of law and the imperative of impeaching a vice president who has misled both the public and the Congress about the gravest matters possible : war and peace .
Please join with organizations like www.ImpeachCheney.org in making your voices heard as soon as possible !
Every individual Member of Congress will have to decide within days where they stand .
On Tuesday , when I introduce my privileged resolution to force this issue to a vote , some other member of Congress will almost certainly move to table ( kill ) it .
A
Yes vote to table is a vote to delay the enforcement of the rule of law aside .
A
No vote to table is a vote to give impeachment a chance for a full and fair hearing .
Please help me get this message out .

PHOENIX ( Reuters ) - Arizona steel fabricator Sheridan Bailey has been laying off employees in recent weeks even though he has plenty of orders on the books .
Fresh prints are found along a foot path north of the U.S. and Mexican border in Arizona 's Avra Valley , March 31 .
2007 .
A state law going into effect in Arizona on Tuesday targets employers who hire illegal immigrants .
REUTERS / Jeff Topping
His firm , Ironco Enterprises , shed around 10 percent of its 100 - strong workforce to get in line with a state law going into effect on Tuesday that targets employers who hire illegal immigrants .
“ We have let some people go who we came to know were not properly documented .
So in that respect the law is already doing what the framers expected , ” he said .
The maker of steel frames for buildings is among an estimated 150,000 businesses across the desert state preparing for the measure that places Arizona at the vanguard of more than 100 U.S. states and municipalities taking on immigration enforcement .
The law , passed days after a federal immigration overhaul died in the U.S. Senate in June , punishes first - time violators who knowingly hire undocumented workers with a 10 - day suspension of their business licenses .
A second offense means they lose it .
The measure also requires employers to use an online federal database , dubbed “ E - Verify , ” to check the employment eligibility of new hires in the border state , which is home to an estimated 500,000 illegal immigrants .
Many employers like Bailey say they are pruning their workforce of illegal immigrants to avoid prosecution , or have outsourced some operations to neighboring states and even over the border to Mexico .
Other businesses have put a freeze on expansion in Arizona out of fear they will face prosecution should they inadvertently hire an illegal immigrant .
“ It is too much of a risk for us , ” said Jason LeVecke , a franchise owner who operates a chain of 57 Carl ’s Jr. hamburger restaurants in the state .
He plans to expand in Texas .
BUSINESS ‘DEATH PENALTY ’
Immigration is the subject of a rancorous debate in the United States , where an estimated 12 million illegal immigrants live and work in the shadows .
The topic comes up frequently among Republican and Democratic hopefuls fighting to be their party ’s candidate in the November 2008 presidential election .
The politicians must tread a fine line between appeasing anti-immigration sentiment and trying not to anger Hispanics , who make up the fastest - growing voter bloc in the nation .
Many Arizonans support the new law .
They say it takes away the lure of jobs for illegal immigrants and clamps down on employers unfairly profiting from cheap migrant labor .
“ The only people who should be nervous are employers who hire illegals at cheap rates to gain unfair advantage over their competitors .
They should be worrying a lot , ” said John Kavanagh , a Republican state lawmaker who co-sponsored the bill .
Gov. Janet Napolitano , a Democrat , signed the measure into law despite voicing concern that it was a business “ death penalty . ”
A coalition of business groups filed suit to block the measure , arguing that it will be harmful to local businesses .
A U.S. District Court threw out the challenge earlier this month , but a new suit has since been filed .
Lawyers opposed to the employer sanctions law say that it is unconstitutional and is open to abuse by people making malicious anonymous complaints .
They warn that it will also make Arizona less competitive nationally .
“ ( Already ) we have had businesses shut down , businesses that will not go ahead with acquisitions .
It is going to get worse before it gets better , ” said Julie Pace , one of the lawyers bringing the employers ’ suit .
“ Arizona will get bypassed economically .
We will be known as tough but stupid from an economic perspective , ” she said .
Do you know how much energy you use ?
Most of us do n’t .
Sure we have meters outside some where but those gauges only mean something to the trained city technicians that come by once a month .
For the rest of us , we need something else that translates energy usage into laymen ’s terms .
Perhaps something like the Power Conscience .
It ’s a simple device that gives you up to the minute stats on your energy usage and calculates your current electric bill .
Designer Delroy Dennisur could have stopped right there but he decided to take it a step further and give you a purdy visual cue .
The front panel is laden with LEDs forming a floral pattern .
The more energy you use , the more light is emitted as if the florals are growing .
Personally I think the opposite should happen .
The florals begin to recede the more energy you use .

LONDON ( Reuters ) - Work on Heath Ledger ’s last film , suspended due to his death by accidental overdose in January , has resumed after three Hollywood stars agreed to play his character , director Terry Gilliam said on Monday .
Johnny Depp , Colin Farrell and Jude Law will step in to complete Ledger ’s unfinished role in the movie “ The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus , ” portraying various incarnations of his character , but Ledger ’s presence in the movie will also be maintained .
“ Since the format of the story allows for the preservation of his entire performance , at no point will Heath ’s work be modified or altered through the use of digital technology , ” the film ’s producers said in a statement .
“ Each of the parts played by Johnny , Colin and Jude is representative of the many aspects of the character that Heath was playing , ” they added .
Gilliam said filming on the British - Canadian production , due for release next summer , had resumed in Vancouver “ with the blessing and support of Heath Ledger ’s family . ”
Ledger had just finished shooting scenes for the movie in London before his death .
Newspapers have reported that the story involves a magical mirror that takes people into different dimensions , allowing Gilliam to switch between actors .
“ I am delighted that Heath ’s brilliant performance can be shared with the world , ” Gilliam said .
“ We are looking forward to finishing the movie and , through the film , with a modicum of humility , being able to touch people ’s hearts and souls as Heath was able to do . ”
“ The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus ” is described as a modern - day fantasy adventure and has a budget estimated at $ 30 million .

Foods with a traditionally healthy appeal have up to twice the amount of sugar in them compared to 30 years ago .
Breakfast cereals , wholemeal bread and soups are chief among those foods which are significantly sweeter than they were only three decades ago .
European Union trade reforms leading to a reduction in the price of sugar and an increasing demand for sweeter products are being blamed for what health experts say is a worrying trend .

They say the increased sugar in our diets will lead to higher levels of tooth decay and result in more people than ever before becoming diabetic .
Scientists have also said increased sugar levels are a major reason for soaring obesity rates in the UK , particularly when it comes to sugar - thirsty children .
While the Government and health watchdogs have focused on encouraging people and food companies to cut down on the amount of salt the nation consumes , sugar levels have gone up almost unchecked by comparison .
McCance and Widdowson 's The Composition of Foods , an industry handbook on the nutritional value of foods , has blown the debate about sugar in our food wide open .
A cursory glance at its 1978 and 2002 editions suggests many foods previously thought of as being healthy and largely sugar - free are now anything but .
In 1978 Kellogg 's Special K had 9.6g of sugar per 100g .
That figure has since doubled to 17g per 100g .
In crude terms it means the breakfast cereal now has almost as much sugar in it as vanilla ice - cream .
Wholemeal bread getting sweeter
Wholemeal bread is also surprisingly high in sugar - and getting sweeter .
In 1978 a typical wholemeal loaf contained on average 2.1g of sugar per 100g .
By 2002 that figure had risen to 2.8g , effectively ending the myth that wholemeal bread is a healthy choice .
The Food Standards Agency ( FSA ) wants food companies to reduce the amount of sugar in their products and is so worried about the trend that it is considering imposing legal limits .
The FSA two years ago launched a campaign to cut down salt , but one apparent spin - off of that has been companies putting in more sugar to make up for the lower salt levels .
Ian Tokelove , spokesman for the Food Commission , which campaigns for healthier food , warned : ' Most of us are eating too much sugar , but we are being swamped with it in our food .
' We naturally have a sweet tooth and manufacturers have been quick to use that to try to increase sales in a crowded marketplace .
' It 's cheap to use and it 's been one of the first things to be added when companies want to make a product a bit different . '
Processed foods , which generally have higher sugar levels , are routinely blamed for much of the extra sugar in our diets .
But even fruit and vegetables on sale in the UK are sweeter now than they used to be , with supermarkets selecting sweeter products because they are more attractive to reluctant fruit and vegetable eaters .
An article in the British Medical Journal in 2005 claimed : ' Sugar is as dangerous as tobacco and , in terms of world health , far more important . '
Supermarket giant Sainsbury 's is among the companies looking at the products it sells to see if it can reduce sugar and salt levels .
Formatting may be lacking as a result .

Posted on March 24 , 2008 , Jonathan Internet Community Strikes Down Xbox 360 Thief With Great Vengeance and Furious Anger
Sit down , kids ; it ’s story time .
On March 12 , Jesse McPherson returned from his trip to SXSW only to find that his home in Philadelphia had been burglarized .
The thief made off with his TV , an old Powerbook , and his Xbox 360 .
Naturally , he was upset , so he took it upon himself to call up some local pawn shops in the area to see if anyone had come in trying to hock his stuff .
As luck would have it , the first place he called remembered a young man who tried to sell a Powerbook that had a few quirks similar to McPherson’s .
So he went down there and snapped a couple shots from their security feed of the guy trying to sell the laptop .
He contacted the police and told them he had pictures of the thief , but he never heard back from them .
Meanwhile , this past Friday , his co-workers surprise him with a brand new Xbox 360 console .
Now here ’s where things get really interesting .
That night , McPherson goes home , hooks up his new gift , and recovers his Xbox Live account .
The first thing he notices is he ’s received a voice message from some random person .
As it turns out , it ’s the thief , who explicitly says he ’s got the Xbox and offers to sell it back to him .
McPherson calls the police , and the person on the other end tells him to call back during normal operating hours and then hangs up on him ( note to self : never ever move to Philadelphia ) .
Left with nowhere else to turn , McPherson did the only thing he could think of and posted the thief ’s Xbox Live account on the internet .
His story got picked up by Digg and within a few hours the internet community managed to uncover the thief ’s name , address , high school , e-mail , phone number , etc. and even put together a wiki page to compile all of it .
Then he pretty much started getting harassed through AIM , a YouTube video , and probably every social site he ’s ever subscribed to almost constantly .
By Sunday , the kid actually shows up at McPherson ’s house and gives him the laptop back .
No word yet on the Xbox , but McPherson has said he will be in contact with the kid ’s parents soon .
I also have a feeling the kid will be giving up the Xbox soon , since his account ’s bio now reads : “ mY eFFinG xBoX brOkE sO i WoNt bE oN fOr aWhILe iF u NeEd Me SEnD mE a MeSsAgE aS lOnG aS iT aiNt vOiCe I wiLl GeT iT . ”
There ’s really no justice quite like internet justice .
Some people have pointed out that a threat left on Xbox Live is flimsy evidence that this kid is the actual thief and not just the guy who bought it off the thief .
That may be true , but it ’s still a little hard to explain how an internet search that started with an Xbox Live account brought back a picture of a kid who looks a lot like the guy trying to pawn a Powerbook that sounds remarkably like the stolen one .
Besides , even if he were n’t the one who broke into McPherson ’s house , he still knowingly bought some stolen goods and then bragged about it to the rightful owner .
That ’s worthy enough of some internet backlash , I say .

Family recalls fallen soldier was against Bush , Iraq war
Army corporal Victor Garcia did n't support the Iraq invasion and he did n't vote for the president , but he gave his life serving his country .
The AP's John Mone speaks to his family about his death and about the 5th anniversary of the war .
Garcia 's sister notes that her brother had more to say than just " Bush sucks , " and could always back his convictions with facts .
Despite his stance against the war Garcia enlisted looking for some help with college tuition and perhaps some discipline .
The specialist was assigned to the 1st Battalion , 38th Infantry Regiment , 4th Brigade , 2nd Infantry Division ( Stryker Brigade Combat Team ) , at Ft. Lewis , Wash .
On July 1 , 2007 he was killed in Baghdad when his unit was attacked with small - arms fire .
Garcia , 22 , was the son of Mexican immigrants .
His brothers , Abel and Daniel , married their high school sweethearts at a young age .
Victor knew many girls , but had no girlfriend .
 Victor just wanted to get out and see the world ,  Daniel Garcia said .
 Victor was the one destined to do a lot more . 
He was an avid sports fan and loved the Atlanta Braves , the San Francisco 49ers and Manchester United soccer club in England .
He read books by leftist critic Noam Chomsky .
One of his blog entries on his MySpace.com page wonders ,  What more evidence do we need ?  that the war was a mistake .
Besides his mother and brothers , Garcia is survived by his father and a sister .
This video is from The Associated Press , broadcast March 18 , 2008 .

A novel class of hybrid materials made from metals and organic compounds is changing the face of solid state chemistry and materials science just 10 years after its discovery , with applications already in safe storage of highly inflammable gases such as hydrogen and methane .
Europe is aiming to capitalise on core strengths in the field and build critical mass by combining the diverse range of skills required within a coherent research network , following a major workshop organised by the European Science Foundation ( ESF ) .
The materials called MOFs ( Metal Organic Frameworks ) represent one of the biggest breakthroughs in solid state science whose potential is only just being realised , according to the ESF workshop convenor Gérard Férey .
“ The domain is currently exploding , and there are so many potential applications that it is difficult to decide how to prioritise them .
The only limit is our imagination , ” said Férey .
There is no doubt though that the first big application of MOFs - storage of gases - will be highly important , given the urgency of developing alternatives to fossil fuels for automobiles .
“ For hydrogen storage , MOFs are already used , and many carmakers have these products in prototypes , ” said Férey .
MOFs are porous materials with microscopic sized holes , resembling honeycombs at molecular dimensions .
This property of having astronomical numbers of tiny holes within a relatively small volume can be exploited in various ways , one of which is as a repository for gases .
Gas molecules diffuse into the MOF solid and are contained within its pores .
In the case of gas storage , MOFs offer the crucial advantage of soaking up some of the gas pressure exerted by the molecules .
This makes hydrogen derived from non-fossil energy sources such as fuel cells , or even genetically engineered plants , potentially viable as a fuel for cars while the alternative of pressurised canisters is not .
The key difference is that the amount of gas stored in a conventional cylinder at say 200 atmospheres pressure could be accommodated in an MOF vessel of the same size at just 30 atmospheres , which is much safer .
The porous nature of MOFs enables them to be exploited in quite another way as catalysts to accelerate chemical reactions for a wide variety of materials production and pharmaceutical applications , although this field , as Férey noted , is still in its infancy .
Yet already the field is gaining interest beyond academia from serious companies , with a significant development at the ESF workshop being the presence and support of German chemicals giant BASF .
This in turn has provided high endorsement of the field ’s potential and has stimulated interest from other companies , according to Férey .
But several challenges remain before this potential can be realised , the first one being to assemble research and development teams with the right body of skills .
As Férey noted , many of the skills already exist but the researchers need to expand their horizons and focus more broadly on the big picture beyond their specialised domains .
There is also the technical challenge of learning first how these materials are formed , and then applying the knowledge to design MOFs matched to specific requirements .
MOFs are crystalline solids that form in highly regular patterns from solutions , just as salts and sugars do .
Researchers need to learn how to manipulate the starting conditions to obtain just the crystalline composition and arrangement they want .

So here ’s the situation : you want to syndicate some content using JavaScript to pull in the data ( like AdWords or similar programs ) .
The syndication script ca n’t know anything about the page it ’s being used on — so it ca n’t have a dependency on the existence of particular elements .
Yet the host page needs to be able to control where the content is inserted — the syndication script needs to insert the content wherever the < script > tag is .
How do you do it ?
Well you probably do what Google does and use document .
write .
But document . write is not a nice technique , it has some notable issues :
document .
write does not work in XHTML mode ( on XHTML pages served as XML )
does not work in XHTML mode ( on XHTML pages served as XML ) content written in with document .
write may not subsequently appear in the page ’s DOM , which means no further access to manipulate it programmatically , and no access to accessibility APIs
may not subsequently appear in the page ’s DOM , which means no further access to manipulate it programmatically , and no access to accessibility APIs document .
write is conceptually wrong because it treats nodes as serialized text — which they ’re not — they ’re nodes
But what ’s the alternative ?
DOM creation techniques need an existing element reference to work with ; even innerHTML needs to know where to write the HTML .
And in both cases , simply appending to < body > is not an option if you want the new content to appear inline with the existing content .
I was faced with this dilemma a few days ago , until an obvious solution dawned on me — we do in fact have a predictable refence : the < script > element itself !
All we need is a way of identifying the including < script > in the DOM , and then we can use the insertBefore method to append new HTML directly before it .
So , given a syndication script with a fixed ID :
< script type =" text / javascript " id =" syndication " src=" syndication.js " ></ script >
We can go from oldskool nastiness like this :
document.write ( '< p id =" syndicated - content " >
Here is some syndicated content . </p >' ) ;
To modern loveliness like this :
var newcontent = document.createElement ('p ' ) ; newcontent.id = ' syndicated - content ' ; newcontent.appendChild(document.createTextNode (' Here is some syndicated content . ' ) ) ; var scr = document.getElementById(' syndication ' ) ; scr.parentNode.insertBefore(newcontent , scr ) ;
We could even go a step further and remove the < script >
ID , but in that case we would need a concrete method for identifying the specific element .
We could do that by knowing its SRC :
var scripts = document.getElementsByTagName( ' script ' ) ; for ( var i=0 ; i<scripts.length ; i++) { if ( scripts[i].src == ' http://www.mydomain.com/syndication.js') { //scripts[i ] is the one break ; } }
These Guys
The government tortured a guy who was already crazy , and then used his " confession " as the basis for much of the official version of 9/11
The " official " version of events was crafted to protect the Bush administration
Bush , Cheney and other top administration officials claimed and continue to claim that Saddam was behind 9/11 ( and used that as one of the main justifications for the Iraq war ) , even though they were informed that there was no link ( they also lied 935 times about the " national security threat posed by Saddam Hussein 's Iraq " )
The U.S. is using a ' Kangaroo court ' to prosecute the men accused of a role in September 11 attacks , and will switch off their microphones if they say anything which questions the government 's version of events
The following clarification was printed in the Guardian 's Corrections and clarifications column , Saturday February 2 2008
Dubai is one of the seven emirates that make up the United Arab Emirates ; Dubai is also the name of its capital city .
It is not a country , as we suggested in the article below .
A flotilla of ships may have been dispatched to reinstate the broken submarine cable that has left the Middle East and India struggling to communicate with the rest of the world , but it took just one vessel to inflict the damage that brought down the internet for millions .
According to reports , the internet blackout , which has left 75 million people with only limited access , was caused by a ship that tried to moor off the coast of Egypt in bad weather on Wednesday .
Since then phone and internet traffic has been severely reduced across a huge swath of the region , slashed by as much as 70 % in countries including India , Egypt and Dubai .
While tens of millions have been directly affected , the impact of the blackout has spread far wider , with economies across Asia and the Middle East struggling to cope .
Governments have also become directly involved , with the Egyptian communications ministry imploring surfers to stay offline so business traffic can take priority .
" People who download music and films are going to affect businesses who have more important things to do , " said ministry spokesman Mohammed Taymur .
But as backroom staff at businesses across the globe scrambled to reroute their traffic or switch on backup satellite systems , experts said the incident highlighted the fragility of a global communications network we take for granted .
" People just do n't realise that all these things go through undersea cables - that this is the main way these economies are all linked , " said Alan Mauldin , the research director of TeleGeography .
" Even when you 're using wireless internet , it 's only really wireless back to your base station : the rest is done over real , physical connections . "
Despite the clean , hi-tech image of the online world , much of the planet remains totally reliant on real - world connections put in place through massive physical effort .
The expensive fibre optic cables are laid at great cost in huge lines around the globe , directing traffic backwards and forwards across continents and streaming millions of conversations simultaneously from one country to another .
One expert suggested that this week 's accident should be a " wake - up call " to convince governments that keeping such connections secure should be a higher priority .
Officials must spend more time and energy making sure that critical communications such as mobile phones and the net are adequately protected - whether from disaster or a terrorist strike , said Mustafa Alani , head of security and terrorism at the Gulf Research Centre in Dubai .
" This shows how easy it would be to attack , " he said .
" When it comes to great technology , it 's not about building it , it 's how to protect it . "
Although the direct effect of the Mediterranean accident is being felt as far west as Bangladesh , the greatest impact has been in India , which has the world 's fifth largest internet population and an economy that is increasingly reliant on hi-tech communications .
The Indian stock markets had already closed when reports of the collapse first surfaced on Wednesday , but the impact of a 50 % drop in bandwidth was being felt keenly yesterday - particularly by the country 's expansive outsourcing industry .
American corporations were reporting a number of problems with their Indian - based support services and call centres as the domino effect kicked in , although a spokesman for BT - one of Britain 's biggest outsourcers - said the company had so far seen little direct evidence of problems .
Countries in east Asia and the Pacific remained unaffected as they pipe most of their internet traffic to Europe through the US , but it could be several weeks before things are back to normal in the affected countries .
" It will depend on how bad the damage is , but they 'll find the sections in question and bring them up onto a ship for repair before sinking them again , " said Mauldin .
" It could take a week or possibly two weeks . "
The fibre optic wires in question - called Flag Europe - Asia and Sea - Me - We 4 - are some of the most vital information pipelines between Europe and the east .
The latter , which runs in an uninterrupted line from western Europe to Singapore , had only recently been opened after a mammoth £ 500 m , three - year installation project .
Between them , the two lines are responsible for around 75 % of all connectivity in the Middle East and south Asia .
" The problems are really at pinch points where increasingly huge amounts of information are coming through , " said Jim Kinsella , chairman of Interoute , Europe 's largest fibre optic network provider .
He said that improvements are scheduled for submarine cabling , but that plans to send more internet traffic over land connections rather than under the sea had been set back by political wrangling .
" The whole subsea franchise operation is due to change dramatically in the next 18 months , but the question is how we cope in the meantime .
You always have to assume that this kind of thing is going to happen . "
In what I can only view as troubling and a move surely to invite more backlash against photographers , London ’s Metropolitan police has launched a new counter - terrorism PR campaign complete with anti-photography propaganda .
The campaign is meant to encourage people to turn in “ odd ” seeming people that they see taking photographs .
“ Thousands of people take photos every day , ” reads their advertisement being run in London ’s major newspapers .
“ What if one of them seems odd ? ”
Having personally been harassed in the past by the U.S. police while out shooting , I worry that this kind of a campaign will result in even more harassment for photographers going forward .
In addition to police harassment , I think that this campaign also sends the wrong message to people about photographers and photography .
I think it encourages people to think suspiciously of photographers and to add to the climate of fear associated with photography .
Photography is not a crime .
Taking photographs is part of a rich tradition of art , social commentary and historical documentation .
I ’m very disappointed seeing London ’s Metropolitan Police decide to take this course of action and worry that this sort of backward thinking will continue to spread the boogeyman myth that photographers and photography are the enemy when they very much are not .
Having people report “ odd seeming ” photographers will only take important police time away from ways that it could better be spent in really fighting crime and terrorism .
Thanks Nick for this important heads up .

I ’m a big proponent of investing passively by maintaining a diversified portfolio of index funds .
It definitely takes the fun out of investing , but as far as I ’m concerned , taking risks with money that is earmarked for my daughter ’s education and our retirement is not meant to be fun anyway .
Its serious business .
So what do I mean by passive investing .
For me , it means that I do n’t stay awake at night thinking ( and worrying ) of ways I can beat the stock market and make millions of dollars or on the flip side , make sure that I do n’t gamble away all my hard earned money .
If you want to hear stories of why trying to beat the market is a waste of time , I would definitely recommend reading the book “ Wise Investing made Simple ” by Larry Swedroe .
The best definition for Passive Investing I have seen so far is :
An investment strategy involving limited ongoing buying and selling actions .
Passive investors will purchase investments with the intention of long - term appreciation and limited maintenance .
Investopedia adds to this by saying , Passive Investing is also known as a buy - and - hold or couch potato strategy , passive investing requires good initial research , patience and a well diversified portfolio .
Unlike active investors , passive investors buy a security and typically do n’t actively attempt to profit from short - term price fluctuations .
Passive investors instead rely on their belief that in the long term the investment will be profitable .
Passive investment management makes no attempt to distinguish attractive from unattractive securities , or forecast securities prices , or time markets and market sectors .
Passive managers invest in broad sectors of the market , called asset classes or indexes , and , like active investors , want to make a profit , but accept the average returns various asset classes produce .
Passive investors make little or no use of the information active investors seek out .
Instead , they allocate assets such as 1 oz silver bars based upon empirical research delineating probable asset class risks and returns , diversify widely within and across asset classes , and maintain allocations long - term through periodic re-balancing of asset classes .
Where as , Active management might best be described as an attempt to apply human intelligence to find “ good deals ” in the financial markets .
Active management is the predominant model for investment strategy today .
Active managers try to pick attractive stocks , bonds , mutual funds , time when to move into or out of markets or market sectors , and place leveraged bets on the future direction of securities and markets with options , futures , and other derivatives .
Their objective is to make a profit , and , often without intention , to do better than they would have done if they simply accepted average market returns .
In pursuing their objectives , active managers search out information they believe to be valuable , and often develop complex or proprietary selection and trading systems .
Active management encompasses hundreds of methods , and includes fundamental analysis , technical analysis , and macroeconomic analysis , all having in common an attempt to determine profitable future investment trends .
So , in order to reach your financial goals , slow and steady wins the race !
Hopefully , my review of the book “ The Quiet Millionaire ” written by Brett Wilder , can shed more light on the various aspects of saving and investing wisely .

Chinese officials have admitted that the Three Gorges Dam across the Yangtze River will , in the absence of urgent preventative action , provoke an ecological and environmental " catastrophe " , the Times reports .
The shock confession confirms what opponents of the £ 13 bn project have always maintained , and officials have now conceded that the massive structure is responsible for a " litany of threats to the environment " , including " conflicts over land shortages , ecological deterioration as a result of irrational development and , especially , erosion and landslides on steep hills around the dam " .
The erosion menace poses the most serious threat to those living close to the lake behind the dam .
While 1.3 m people were relocated to enable its creation , hundreds of thousands more may have to join the exodus or face possible " geological disasters " along the shore .
One official explained that " the shore of the reservoir had collapsed in 91 places and a total of 36 km had already caved in " .
Such landslides have produced waves up to 50 m tall which then slam into the shore wreaking further havoc .
In July , the Times notes , " a mountain along a tributary collapsed , dragging 13 farmers to their deaths and drowning 11 fishermen in a two - storey - high wave " .
Geological instability is n't the only unforeseen negative effect of the Three Gorges .
Downstream of the dam , locals have been battling two billion rats forced into farmland by rising water levels after the dam authority released a large amount of Yangtze River water " to control flooding in the face of the annual rainy season " .
Given the clear and mounting evidence that the project is on the verge of going seriously titsup , an official statement on Xinhua news agency admitted : “ There exist many ecological and environmental problems concerning the Three Gorges Dam .
If no preventive measures are taken , the project could lead to catastrophe . ”
Wang Xiaofeng , the director of the administrative office in charge of building the dam , confessed : “ We absolutely cannot relax our guard against ecological and environmental security problems sparked by the Three Gorges project .
We cannot win passing economic prosperity at the cost of the environment . ”
Environmental activist Dai Qing told the Times : “ We have never stopped talking about the problems but our voice was too weak .
The system does not listen to the voices of civic activists or dissidents .
But now , at last , they are starting to hear .
" The Government knows it has made a mistake .
Now they are afraid that the environmental catastrophe that they cannot prevent will spark civil unrest .
So they want to go public before the troubles start . ” ®
Nicola Horlick - or " supermum " to the tabloids , owing to the fact that she has high - flying jobs and five kids - has spent her career amassing a reported £ 25 m ; she now seems determined to divest herself of large parts of it .
She already gives away about 25 % of her income each year ; she has just revealed , in a thinktank report on the state of philanthropy in the City , that she will not be leaving most of the remainder to her children .
" I think it is wrong to give too much inherited wealth to children , " Horlick told the report 's authors .
" I will not be leaving all my wealth to my children because that would just ruin their lives . "
She is by no means the first to go public with this conviction .
Bill Gates has ploughed an estimated $ 30bn into the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation .
This was supplemented , in 2006 , by another £ 24bn or so from his friend Warren Buffett .
( Buffett has always been colourfully , quotably clear on where he stands .
His daughter often tells a story of finding herself without change for a car parking ticket - her father lent her $ 20 , then promptly made her write him a cheque .
" To suggest that the children of the wealthy should be just as wealthy , " he has said , " is like saying the members of America 's 2004 Olympics team should be made up only of the children of the 1980 Olympics team . " )
Anita Roddick , the late founder of the Body Shop , " told [ her ] kids that they would not inherit one penny .
The money that we make from the company goes into the Body Shop Foundation , which is n't one of those awful tax shelters , like some in America .
It just functions to take the money and give it away . "
Sir Tom Hunter , the first Scottish billionaire , announced last July that he will be giving his billion to charity ; two weeks ago Barron Hilton said he would be doing the same with 97 % of his $ 2.3 bn fortune - his granddaughter Paris 's embarrassing antics having convinced him that bequeathing unearned wealth is not something he wants to do .
He is fighting something of a rearguard action : what all these parents are keen to duck is the possibility of producing a Paris in the first place .
" Advisers to the rich structure entire symposia for their clients around the idea of avoiding her fate , " noted a recent piece in New York magazine .
Horlick says she wants her children to understand " that there is more to life than shopping on the King 's Road and mobile telephones " ;
Roddick is on record as boasting that her kids have " got one huge dose of what real thinking is , what real life is .
They 're not rich bitches snorting cocaine every time they go into a bloody club , they 're not in bloody Hello ! magazine .
They work .
They 're real . "
Britain may not have quite caught up with America , which has so many super - rich that there is a market for such symposia , and for outfits such as Tiger21 , " a peer - to - peer investment group on the Upper East Side whose barrier to entry is investable assets of at least $ 10 m " - but Britain is swimming in more wealth than ever before .
Last year alone , the number of Britons with investable assets of $ 1 m or more grew by 8 % , according to a study by Capgemini and Merrill Lynch .
According to Barclays Wealth , which provides its clients with advice on estate planning , the number of households with financial assets ( excluding property ) in excess of $ 1 m is expected to triple by 2016 .
" There are so many more people than there have ever been who have more money than will ever be required to live on , " says Merryn Somerset Webb , editor of Moneyweek and author of Love Is Not Enough : The Smart Woman 's Guide to Money .
" That 's what throws up the problem . "
And the evidence ( again , American ) is that the richer you are , the more you worry about it - and the lower the proportion of your assets your children receive .
According to a research paper published in the journal Philanthropy by the director and two staff members of the Boston College Centre on Wealth and Philanthropy , " As net estates become very large , wealth - holders make a conscious decision to move their resources away from heirs and towards charity . "
In 2003 heirs received 86 % of the smallest estates ( $ 1 - $ 2.5 m ) , and only 31 % of the largest ( over $ 20 m ) .
This is partly , and obviously , a function of the sheer amounts involved - 86 % of $ 2 m is $ 1.72 m , while 31 % of $ 20 m is nearly four times as much - but it is instructive nonetheless .
Many of these rich do not come from riches .
They are self - made , and generally the self - made have a different attitude to money - or specifically , the acquisition of money - compared with those who have always had it .
They generally do not , for example , have the " legacy assets " of the old rich - the 4,000 - acre pile in Scotland that has been in the family for generations and must be passed on in good nick ; or the idea of noblesse oblige that used to go with such assets : the responsibility to the tenants of the land , to the local community .
" With inherited wealth , the current generation may simply consider themselves custodians for the time being of the family wealth and will follow the path laid down over many generations , " says Stuart Chappell , director of Barclays Wealth .
" With self - generated wealth , it is the responsibility of those who made the wealth to decide what is to happen after they are gone .
It is more likely that the creators of new money will feel that those who follow them should not be ' feather - bedded ' . "
While these new rich may see no harm in showering children with all the things and freedoms that they themselves could not have , they are more likely to feel that if they could , through skill and application , make a fortune , there is no reason why their children cannot do the same .
But what if they do n't want to ?
What if they do not have the same luck ?
" The self - made tend to believe , I think probably rightly , " says Somerset Webb , " that work is a value in itself , and therefore their children not just should work , but need to work . "
In this rather Protestant world - view , money is simply a facilitator .
According to Buffett , " A very rich man might leave his children enough money to make it possible for them to do almost anything they want , but he would be a fool to leave them so much money that they ended up doing nothing at all . "
Increasingly , even those who make no grand stands about how " little " they are leaving their children are trying to control how much these children will receive .
According to another report from Barclays Wealth , in association with the Economist Intelligence Unit , almost 60 % of those with more than $ 10 m in assets stipulate that a child must get a college education , or hold down a job for a prescribed length of time .
The traditional age of accession to fortune might in the past have been 21 , as we know from no end of Victorian novels ; now it 's more likely to be 25 , or 30 , or 35 .
For all the obvious advantages of wealth , what 's at stake is something more nebulous , less biddable : happiness .
Somerset Webb ends Love Is Not Enough with a salutary cruise through the research on money and happiness .
In the past 30 years , for example , our incomes have risen by 80 % , in real terms - but according to research by the editor of the Journal of Happiness Studies , Ruut Veenhoven , we are only 1.36 % happier .
The major route to happiness , discovered a team from Gothenburg University in Sweden , was goal - oriented work ; the successive positing and achieving of specific challenges .
As Paul Sykes , a former tyre - fitter from Barnsley who is now worth £ 250 m , has put it , " I have never found a link between money and happiness , but I have found a link between success and happiness . "
He claims that his son and three daughters will get nothing from him at all .
" Nothing " , in this context , is , of course , relative .
Even those who inherit nothing in financial terms will - unless their parents are particularly obtuse - have already received a priceless start in terms of education , lifestyle and opportunity .
" I would argue that when your kids have all the advantages in terms of how they grow up and the opportunities they have for education , it 's neither right nor rational to be flooding them with money , " Steve Forbes has said .
Hamish Ogston , a Yorkshire - based entrepreneur worth about £ 400 m , has been just as clear : " I 'm a firm believer in them having a leg - up in the form of reasonable parenting , education and possibly a few thousand pounds , but nothing much more than that . "
But how much of a leg - up is enough ?
Ogston may think a few thousand pounds ; it was reported last year that to live the way a millionaire 's child might be accustomed - maids , yachts , jewellery , second and third homes - now requires not a million but £ 5.8 m .
" If you happen to be a multibillionaire , you might think you 're being cruel to your children by leaving them less than , say , £ 5 m , " says Somerset Webb .
" Whereas if you only have a couple of million , you might think that leaving them enough to put a deposit down on a flat is plenty .
So it 's still an area of huge extremes , and when Nicola Horlick says , ' I 'm not leaving all my money to my children , ' it 's impossible to know exactly what she means - buy them all a central London flat and be done with it ?
Or does she mean that they 'll get £ 5,000 and a secondhand car ?
Who knows ? "
Get it wrong , however , and you could be dealing with anything from damage control of Hiltonesque proportions or the self - destructive excesses of the Marquess of Blandford ( whose behaviour led in 1994 to him being stripped of his right to the Marlborough estate , which includes Blenheim ) to , more usually , a low - key , chronic sense of disappointment and failure .
A psychologist quoted in New York magazine found that in a sample of 314 tenth - graders in a wealthy suburban community , the rate of " clinically significant anxiety " was 5 % to 9 % higher than the norm while , among girls , the rate of " clinically significant depression " was three times the national norm .
" The pros of inheriting great wealth , I believe , are largely illusory and can become pathological , " Sigrid Rausing , whose family is worth an estimated £ 5.4bn , recently told the Economist 's Intelligent Life magazine .
" An illusory sense of being special and different , the assumption that one is interesting to other people only , or mainly , because of the money , and subsequent feelings of isolation . "
The children of the rich know that this will not elicit much sympathy from the hordes who would dearly like a tad more cash to ease their passage through life , but the feeling that there is nothing to aim for , nothing to achieve ( or , conversely , when parents have achieved so much that their children cannot imagine matching them ) , is corrosive of self - worth .
People with average means who aspire to write the perfect novel , for example , or to be a great actor , might give it their all for a couple of years and then give up ( or at least get a complementary job ) , admitting they had n't made it and moving on to something more fulfilling - whereas having so much cash that you never have to do this creates " a position of constant failure " , as Somerset Webb puts it .
Unhappiness and lostness in turn result in guilt : how is it possible to be unhappy when you have so much ?
And that , too , is corrosive .
Get it right , and enough can be not just good , but fantastically enabling .
Somewhat inevitably , the piece in Intelligent Life ends by reminding its readers of Virginia Woolf , her discovery of the absolute importance , for a woman , of a " room of one 's own " , and the comparatively modest £ 500 a year ( £ 20,500 today ) needed to achieve it .
" My aunt 's legacy revealed the sky to me . "
Entrepreneurs can take risks they otherwise might n't ; investors can subsidise imaginative startups ; the altruistic can help others without the overwhelming need to help themselves first .
And the enabling applies however modest their aspirations .
" When I think about the people I know who have inherited money , " says Somerset Webb , " the ones who have used it right are the ones who live perfectly ordinary lives , just slightly better . "
Now that 's something probably worth envying .

My fortnightly column for Salon.com is now up , commemorating the 5th anniversary of Bush ’s invasion of Iraq :
“ Five years of Iraq lies : ” How President Bush and his advisors have spent each year of the war peddling mendacious tales about a mission accomplished .
I posit that each year of the war has been characterized by a central lie by the Bush propaganda machine .
Year 1 : “ There is no guerrilla war . ”
Year 2 : “ Iraq is a model democracy . ”
Year 3 : “ Zarqawi is causing all the trouble . ”
Year 4 : “ There is no Civil War . ”
Year 5 : “ Everything is calm now . ”
I also suggest that John McCain is pushing for :
Year 6 : “ Total victory is around the corner . ”
Also , at Tomdispatch.com Greg Mitchell , editor of Editor and Publisher magazine and author of So Wrong for So Long : How the Press , The Pundits — and the President — Failed on Iraq , writes on the brave journalists like Chris Hedges who got it right .
As for John McCain ’s bizarre assertion on Tuesday that Iran was actively training “ al - Qaeda , ” the senator was just parroting the Pentagon line of a few years ago , which gradually was muted because even the gullible US press would n’t swallow it .
Bottom line , if you are so ignorant or confused that you think Shiite ayatollahs in Tehran are training and arming radical Salafi Sunnis to blow up Shiites in Iraq , you really should not be president .
P.S. Glenn Greenwald demonstrates that McCain has repeatedly made this looney assertion and that it was n’t just a momentary slip .
You wonder whether , if he had been corrected by anyone but Lieberman , he would even have backed off momentarily .
Top 10 Weird Ways We Deal With the Dead
( Image credit : Çatalhöyük Research Project )
Dying is a fact of life , as is the disposal of a body after the fact .
You know all about burial and cremation , but here are the other ways people , past and present - have dealt with the departed .
Mummification
( Image credit : Dr. Michael Miyamoto . )
The mummies of ancient Egypt are probably the world 's most famous dead bodies .
Reserved for members of the upper classes , mummification involved the removal of all organs including the brain , which was pulled through the nose by a hook .
The body was then stuffed with dry materials like sawdust and wrapped in linens .
The Egyptians believed that mummification preserved the soul for its journey into the afterlife .
Cryonics

Who 's never heard of Walt Disney 's quest for immortality by having his body frozen ?
While that was an urban legend , cryonic science is a reality , currently only legal to perform on those who 've been pronounced dead .
Soon after dying , participants are stored in a liquid nitrogen solution to prevent decay until that time when death becomes a reversible phenomenon .
Until then , the bodies remain on ice .
Shown here is a four - body liquid nitrogen cooler .
Balinese Cremation

Contrary to the more somber western funerals , cremation ceremonies among the Hindus of Bali have an almost carnival - like atmosphere .
Festive floats parade down local streets accompanying the body to a burning ground , where it is transferred into a ceremonial bull receptacle and set alight .
Plastination

Send your corpse on a tour of museums ' round the world with plastination , developed by German scientist Gunther von Hagens .
His popular " Body Worlds " exhibits showcase the controversial preservation technique , which involves dissecting the body into bits , embalming it with a hardening fluid and reposing the body into various ' educational ' positions .
Neanderthal Cave Burials
( Image credit : Naftali Hilger )
Before they began interring their dead in the ground proper around 100,000 years ago , Neanderthals routinely left the deceased deep inside the caves of Europe and the Middle East .
To Neanderthals , the dark , mysterious recesses of a cave may have seemed like a good place to transfer over to the otherworld , some archaeologists have argued .
Bog Bodies
( Image credit : Drents Museum , Carnegie Museum of Natural History )
Plenty of travelers perished accidentally crossing the murky bogs of northern Europe , but at least some individuals , especially in the Middle Ages , were buried there carefully and on purpose .
Lucky for archaeologists , the chemical make - up of a bog preserves human flesh very well , allowing them to study the unlucky bog bodies closely .
Tibetan Sky Burial
( Image credit : Tom Soetaert )
Ever wanted to fly ?
In Tibet , you get to do just that , only after you 're already dead .
Instead of trying to bury bodies in the hard , rocky ground , some Tibetans send their loved ones to the top of a mountain and leave them to be eaten by the vultures .
The disassembled corpses are even mixed with flour and milk for a tastier treat , to make sure every bit leaves the Earth for good .
Viking Ship Burials
( Image credit : Paul Moore , Dreamstime.com )
Middle Age Vikings lived and literally died by the sea .
After death , wealthier Vikings were placed in ships filled with food , jewels , weapons , food and even sometimes servants or animals for their comfort in the afterlife .
The boats were interred in the ground , set alight or sent out to sea .
The ultimate postmortem destination for Viking warriors was Valhalla , or " Odin 's Hall " , made famous in the Old Norse sagas .
Tree Burials
( Image credit : stock.xchng )
Indigenous tribes in many parts of the world discovered that the best way of disposing the dead was to put them up high , rather than down below .
Groups in Australia , British Columbia , the American southwest and Siberia were known to practice tree burial , which involved wrapping the body in a shroud or cloth and placing it in a crook to decompose .
Towers of Silence
( Image credit : Wikimedia commons user Yosemite )
Zoroastrians believe the body is impure and should n't pollute the earth after death through burial or cremation .
Instead , the deceased are brought to a ceremonial " tower of silence " , usually located on an elevated mountain plateau , and left exposed to the animals and elements .
When the bones have been dried and bleached by the sun , they are gathered and dissolved in lime .

Pesatnya pertumbuhan bisnis judi ini membuat para produsen game judi online panen .
Tidak bisa dipungkiri , semakin hari perkembangan dunia perjudian semakin tidak terkendali .
Ini juga menyebabkan beberapa bandar judi yang tidak siap dengan modal yang cukup harus gulung tikar .
Hal ini dikarenakan pangsa pasar judi di Indonesia bisa dibilang mengecil .
Karena semakin banyaknya bandar - bandar judi baru yang menawarkan promo-promo menarik .
Selain promo yang menarik , bandar judi online sekarang juga harus pintar membaca tren game online yang disukai oleh penjudi di Indonesia .
Karena jika tidak , maka bandar judi online tersebut bisa dipastikan akan susah mencari pelanggan / member yang akan bermain di situsnya .
Hal - hal seperti inilah yang membuat persaingan bandar judi online semakin ketat dan semakin sengit .
Semua bandar saling berlomba untuk mendapatkan member baru , sedangkan masyarakat yang gemar bermain judi belum tentu bertambah dan bisa jadi semakin sedikit .
Beda dengan bandar judi online , produsen game online seperti game slot atau game - game online lainnya yang menggunakan uang asli semakin mendulang profit dengan kondisi seperti ini .
Dimana persentase pertumbuhan bandar judi online lebih pesat daripada pertumbuhan penjudi itu sendiri .
Karena produsen game judi online ini tidak mengandalkan member / penjudi untuk mendapatkan uang .
Mereka akan mendapatkan uang apabila ada bandar yang ingin menggunakan platform game online mereka di situs bandar judi mereka .
Walaupun sebagian besar produsen game online tersebut menawarkan sistem kerjasama .
Dimana bandar judi online akan membagi profit yang didapat dengan produsen game online tersebut .
Dan jika profit yang disepakati tidak tercapai , maka akan ada biaya ‘ maintenance ’ sebagai kompensasi kepada produsen game online tersebut .

The 2nd one is obstruction of the analysis by a grand jury straight into both the stock fraud attorneys and the money laundering as well as the third is interfering with all the workings of the IRS simply by not disclosing a just offshore debit card account which he had control off plus contained thousands of dollars , on his tax .
The first check out was handled pretty well from the associate but after that is how the problems started .
There were withdrawals from an ATM with one branch so video clip was available , great you should think .
But unfortunately , the one who handled the case decided to create her own crack decision plus think that a person who was in the meeting to see the pictures has been one of the people who took cash from the ATM .
I ca n’t say for sure about you , but final I checked an associate in a bank does n’t have a felony justice degree or a logo to decide who is guilty delete word .
If you made a decision to do it on the personal , then you are probably very intelligent , have a minimum of decent understanding of stock business or just a risky person who acquired some cash in order to throw away .
Anyway , in this circumstance I see you joining the particular army of losers plus screaming a thing like only retards think about playing with penny stocks .
there ’s no much better way to waste your time plus money .
Stop making an attempt to obtain wealthy rapid . ” and so forth .
Check the broker ’s reputation before with them to invest .
When you spend time doing it necessary background checks , you slow up the risk of becoming a sufferer of investment fraud lawyer .
Chief Judge Rich Young of the Southern Region of Indiana addressed the particular court saying , “ That ’s a genuine concern of the court .
You will find a proper procedure for approving management of assets that were not followed here .
” Fresh told the Indiana Attorney it is likely the judge inside Warsaw would not have authorized of the divorce and arrangement of assets had this individual been made aware of Conour ’s continuing wire investment fraud cases .
So be sure you do a little more research whenever getting a hot tip on the stock .
Sure , you can make a good quality change , but know what you are n’t doing and do n’t get scammed into one of these penny share frauds without consulting a 3rd party for research on the share in question .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - The Pentagon said on Thursday it was very confident that a spectacular and unprecedented missile strike from a U.S. Navy warship had destroyed the toxic fuel tank of a defunct U.S. spy satellite .
The 1,000 pound ( 450 kg ) fuel tank could have released its load of hydrazine fuel as a toxic gas if it had fallen to Earth , causing health risks for anyone nearby , officials said .
The strike took place 153 miles above the Pacific Ocean on Wednesday as the satellite sped through space at more than 17,000 mph ( 27,000 kph ) , the Pentagon reported .
“ This was uncharted territory .
The technical degree of difficulty was significant here , ” said Marine Gen. James Cartwright , vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff .
“ You can imagine , at the point of intercept , there were a few cheers that went up in operations centers and on that ship , ” Cartwright told reporters at the Pentagon .
Both Russia and China had expressed concern ahead of the mission .
Moscow said it could be used as cover to test a new space weapon .
China , criticized by Washington after it shot down one of its own satellites last year , said the operation may influence security in space and harm other countries .
U.S. Defense Secretary Robert Gates said Washington could share some information to reassure China about the operation .
“ Our whole approach to this was one of complete transparency , prior notifications and letting everybody know what was going on and the purpose of the activity , ” Gates told reporters during a visit to Hawaii .
Washington said the only reason for the mission was to prevent harm to humans from fuel on the bus-sized satellite , which was expected to re-enter the Earth ’s atmosphere within the next couple of weeks .
“ We ’re very confident that we hit the satellite .
We also have a high degree of confidence that we got the tank , ” Cartwright said , putting the chances that the tank had been breached at around 90 percent .
FIREBALL SUGGESTS SUCCESS
Cartwright said a fireball in video images of the strike , a vapor cloud that formed and indications of hydrazine in the air all suggested the tank had been shattered .
But he said it could take another 24 to 48 hours to know for sure .

Debris from the satellite had already started to re-enter the atmosphere over the Atlantic and Pacific oceans but nothing larger than a football had been detected so far , he said .
The 5,000 - pound ( 2,300 kg ) satellite was struck by an SM - 3 missile fired from the USS Lake Erie northwest of Hawaii at 10:26 p.m. EST , the Pentagon said .
The operation was the first time a sea - based missile has been used to hit a satellite , according to experts .
The United States and the Soviet Union conducted anti-satellite tests in the Cold War but used other techniques .
The operation used modified elements of the U.S. missile defense system and supporters of that project were quick to praise the operation .
But Gates said it should not be seen as a test of the missile defense system ’s viability .
“ We ’ve had a number of successful tests , ” he said .
“ I think the issue of whether it will work is behind us .
We just need to keep improving its capabilities . ”
Some space experts have questioned the Pentagon ’s justification for the mission , saying the chances of any part of the satellite causing harm were extremely remote .
But Pentagon officials have denied suggestions they wanted to destroy the satellite to prevent part of the classified spacecraft from falling into the hands of rival powers .
U.S. officials also have rejected accusations from some security and space experts that the Pentagon was using the operation to test and demonstrate its ability to hit targets in space following China ’s anti-satellite test .
Washington says its case is different from the Chinese test because it was announced in advance and undertaken to protect people .
It also says the Chinese craft was struck at a higher altitude , more crowded with other satellites .
The Pentagon has said the stray spacecraft was a test satellite for the National Reconnaissance Office , a U.S. intelligence agency , that was launched in December 2006 and stopped communicating within a few hours of reaching orbit .

Working Journalists Attacked By Federal Agents
SAN JUAN , PUERTO RICO - The American Civil Liberties Union today will ask a federal appeals court to allow a case brought by journalists who were kicked , punched and pepper sprayed by FBI agents to move forward .
The ACLU will ask the U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit to reverse an earlier decision by the district court that sided with the FBI agents and ignored important constitutional issues raised by the journalists .
“ This case raises the question of how far government agents can go to impede the ability of journalists to gather the news , ” said Catherine Crump , staff attorney with the ACLU First Amendment Working Group .
“ It ’s time for the courts to exercise some much needed judicial oversight .
These journalists deserve their day in court . ”
In February 2006 , several journalists attempting to report on the search of a San Juan apartment by FBI agents approached agents leaving the apartment to ask for their comments .
The FBI agents responded by using physical force to intimidate the journalists to stop them from reporting on the apartment search .
On November 5 , 2007 , the ACLU filed a lawsuit on behalf of the journalists , asserting that the FBI agents had violated their First Amendment right to gather news and their Fourth Amendment right to be free from excessive force .
The ACLU ’s lawsuit asserts that the FBI agents prevented the journalists from gathering the news by , among other things , punching , shoving , and kicking them , spraying pepper spray in their faces , covering the lens of their camera , and pointing an automatic rifle at a one of the journalists .
“ In keeping several journalists from doing their jobs , the FBI agents violated the First Amendment right to freedom of the press , ” said William Ramirez , Executive Director and attorney with the ACLU of Puerto Rico .
“ The FBI should not be able to exert excessive physical force every time it wants to escape public scrutiny . ”
At the time of the apartment search , the FBI was the subject of intense criticism as a result of an earlier raid in which a leader of the Puerto Rican independence movement was killed .
In addition to Crump and Ramirez , attorneys in the lawsuit are Aden Fine of the ACLU First Amendment Working Group , Josué González of the ACLU of Puerto Rico and Nora Vargas - Agosta .
The Reporters ’ Committee for Freedom of the Press has filed an amicus brief in the case .
The ACLU ’s brief and other related documents are available online here : www.aclu.org/freespeech/censorship/34007res20071105.html
NEW YORK ( AP ) 
The number of sex abuse claims against Roman Catholic clergy dropped for the third consecutive year , but total payouts to victims nearly doubled to reach their highest level ever , according to a new report for the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops .
Dioceses and religious orders received 691 new allegations last year , compared with 714 in 2006 .
The overwhelming majority of claims date back decades .
Settlements with victims increased by 90 % over the same period , to more than $ 526 million — the largest amount for one year .
The findings , released Friday , are part of an annual review the American bishops commissioned in 2002 as the abuse crisis consumed the church .
A companion audit of bishops ' child safety policies found that nearly every diocese was following the plan .
Still , the bishops ' child protection officer cautioned against " issue fatigue . "
Teresa Kettelkamp , executive director of the Office of Child and Youth Protection , said the sense of urgency surrounding the issue is easing as dioceses finish enacting the reforms and cope with the many other demands on their resources .
Auditors found that some lay - clergy review boards — created in every diocese to help bishops respond to abuse — had n't met in more than a year because no new allegations had been made .
Two archdioceses — Denver and Anchorage — had n't reported abuse claims to civil authorities until after the lapse was discovered in the audit .
" I think this is too important an issue to tire of it , " Kettelkamp said .
" Just because the number of victims has decreased , do n't feel that there are n't more victims out there needing encouragement to come forward . "
The abuse crisis erupted in 2002 , with the case of one predator priest in the Archdiocese of Boston , then spread to dioceses nationwide and beyond .
The bishops responded by enacting the Charter for the Protection of Children and Young People , which requires dioceses to conduct background checks on workers , provide safety training to children and reach out to victims .
Nearly 14,000 molestation claims have been filed against Catholic clergy since 1950 , according to tallies released by the bishops ' conference .
Abuse - related costs have reached at least $ 2.3 billion in the same period .
Last year , total abuse - related costs , including settlements , legal fees , therapy for victims and support for offenders , surpassed $ 615 million for dioceses and religious orders .
Several dioceses reached massive agreements with victims in the past 12 months .
The Archdiocese of Los Angeles had the biggest by far , pledging $ 660 million to about 500 people .
But many of those settlements have yet to be fully paid .
Insurance covers some of the cost .
Of the 691 new abuse claims , five cases involved alleged victims who were under age 18 last year .
Some of the accused clergy in these cases were overseas priests working in the United States .
The National Review Board , the lay panel the bishops established to monitor their policies , said dioceses should improve background checks on priests from other countries and review standards of conduct with them .
American dioceses are relying increasingly on overseas priests as the number of U.S. clergy sharply decline .
Most of the new allegations were made by adults who said they had been abused about three decades ago .
A large majority of the 491 clergy accused last year were dead or missing , or had either been barred from public church work or defrocked because of other molestation cases .
About 40 % of the clergy was newly accused .
The survey of nearly all 195 U.S. dioceses and non-geographic districts called eparchies was conducted by the Center for Applied Research in the Apostolate at Georgetown University .
The accompanying audit was conducted by The Gavin Group , Inc. , a consulting firm led by a former FBI official , which completed onsite reviews at 190 dioceses and eparchies nationwide .
Four eparchies and the Diocese of Lincoln , Neb. , did not participate .
The biggest compliance problem the auditors discovered was training children to protect themselves from abuse .
Eleven dioceses had not fully completed the training .
Kettelkamp said it has been especially difficult to train children in after - school religious education classes , who often only attend for a short period .
The Archdiocese of Boston was among those that failed to provide training in those courses .
Advocates for victims have criticized the annual reports because the auditors and researchers must rely on information provided by the dioceses and religious orders .

OTTAWA ( Reuters ) - Canada has imposed sweeping restrictions on who can donate organs for transplant -- including a ban on gay men who have been sexually active in the past five years -- and a leading doctor said on Tuesday he feared the move could deter potential donors .
The restrictions , which also cover drug addicts , prisoners , prostitutes and people who have had tattoos or body piercings in the last 12 months using shared needles , came into effect last month .
“ The safety of the cells , tissues and organs intended for transplantation is paramount .
These regulations are based on risk for safety purposes and not lifestyle choices , ” said a Health Canada spokeswoman .
The rules include a loophole that allows doctors to use healthy organs from a person in a high - risk group as long as they first inform the patient receiving the transplant .
The head of Canada ’s largest organ transplant program -- operated by the University Health Network in Toronto -- said doctors had already been following many of the same rules , which are similar to regulations that govern blood donations .
But Dr Gary
Levy said he feared some people might wrongly decide they were in a high - risk group and decide not to make their organs available for donation .
“ I ’m worried about ( whether ) this will have a negative impact on organ donation ... I was on a radio show today and someone called in and said ‘ I ca n’t donate ’ , ” he said .
“ I said ‘ That ’s not true ... leave it to the professionals to determine whether these organs can be used safely and if they ’re good ’ , ” he told Reuters , saying the regulations should have focused more on risky behavior .
“ If you have a same gender partner and you ’ve had that same gender partner for 30 years , you ’re not a high - risk group .
But if you ’re a heterosexual and you went out and had sex with 14 people last night , you ’re a high - risk person , ” he said .
Helen Kennedy , executive director of the gay rights group Egale Canada , described the regulations as outrageous and crazy .
“ It ’s perpetuating stereotypes .
It bans every gay or bisexual man who potentially is in a monogamous relationship -- or other gay men who are vigilant about safe sex practices -- from donating organs , ” she told Reuters .
“ The question should be based on behavior : Have you had unprotected sex with anyone ... or , have you had unprotected anal sex ? ”
Health Canada insisted gay men were not being singled out .
“ A gay man who had practiced abstinence for the five years prior ( to making an organ donation ) would be acceptable , ” said the spokeswoman .
“ Likewise a heterosexual man who had had a single sexual encounter with a male within the last five years would not be considered acceptable even though he is not gay . ”
Mob -busting investigator to question CIA over al - Qaeda interrogations
America ’s top lawman has announced the launch of a criminal investigation into the CIA ’s destruction of videotapes allegedly showing the violent interrogations of al - Qaeda suspects being held at a secret prison .
Attorney General Michael Mukasey has appointed a modern day ‘ Untouchable ’ to head up the investigation .
But will mob-buster John Durham be tough enough to take on the Central Intelligence Agency and possibly even the White House ?
“ He ’s a very solid guy , ” New York journalist Lucy Komisar told PressTV in a satellite interview , “ In fact one of his big successes was putting away a Republican governor for corruption .
He ’s also gone up against the FBI in Boston that was using mob informants in a way that ended up having some people killed that the FBI should have been protecting .
So he does n’t have a problem going after the agencies of government , powerful agencies at that . ”
Durham will be investigating whether the CIA broke any laws when it destroyed the tapes that reportedly showed two high profile al - Qaeda prisoners , including Abu Zubaydah , being subjected to waterboarding , a technique simulates drowning .
According to a former CIA agent who spoke to ABC News late last year , Zubaydah broke after just 35 - seconds .
Mukasey ordered the investigation based on a court order issued in 2005 that demanded the preservation of all evidence related to interrogations at the U.S. detention center at Guantanamo Bay , and criticism from the U.S. September 11th Commission which claims the CIA deliberately obstructed their investigation regarding the interrogation of suspects .
The commission told The New York Times that the CIA ignored their requests for information and did not notify them regarding the existence of the tapes .
“ The commission went to the CIA and asked for anything that would shed light on al - Qaeda and its leaders , ” Komisar told PressTV , “ they were not told about these tapes and they asked in many different ways if there was any other information that they should have received . ”
The case will likely bring the subject of torture back into sharp focus , and also highlight the question of America ’s secret prison network , sometimes referred to as the American Gulag .
“ We know there are at least eight of them , ” Komisar said , “ they are or were in Afghanistan , in Thailand and in a number of former East European countries , but we ’re not getting any official information and it really depends on whether or not the people who have the information stonewall when Durham conducts his grand jury . ”
Komisar explained that in the U.S. a grand jury is necessary to bring an indictment in a very serious criminal case .
“ A grand jury ’s proceedings are conducted in secret and the testimony that is taken is secret .
So it really depends now on whether or not the administration people , the CIA people , are willing to talk , ” she said .
But , Komisar pointed out that refusing to give information to a grand jury can result in a charge of contempt and even a jail sentence .
“ So this will be a difficult problem for a number of people , ” Komisar said .
One of the first to face questioning will be former CIA official Jose Rodriquez who has been called to appear on Jan. 16 .
“ He ’s been a CIA guy for some 30 years , ” Komisar said , “ He was at various times the station chief in Argentina , Colombia and Mexico .
He was the one who gave the order for the tapes to be destroyed , so if anyone is going to take the fall it is going to be him . ”
Komisar said the main question now , however , is what he is being told by the people in government , and when or if he gets indicted .
“ President Bush is in office for another year and he has a very interesting habit of issuing pardons to people who are clearly guilty of serious crimes , ” Komisar said .
The clear intimation is that Rodriquez might be encouraged to fall on his sword for the sake of the agency , and then receive a pardon from the White House .
But according to earlier reports , it ’s not only the reputation of the Langley - based spy agency that is at stake .
President Bush has been accused of lying in regard to his knowledge of the tapes and their destruction .
If Durham ’s investigation reveals proof of Bush ’s dishonesty , that could open up the way for impeachment .
“ Technically yes , ” agreed Komisar , “ but the problem is this is an election year and the Democrats and Republicans are busy fighting over who is going to be the successor .
So I am not sure that members of Congress , even Democratic members would want to get involved in a fight over impeachment .
It would be a big distraction and it might bring down a lot of criticism on the Democrats , and they do n’t want that . ”
Pretext
This article will pretty much be my opinion , thinly disgused as a subjective comparison between watching films and TV shows , either on DVD , or by downloading them via Bittorrent and the likes .
I am totally ignoring the legality of this comparison .
I am only going to cover what should be the most important factor : Convenience for the viewer .
Getting
DVD
Depending on various factors , the DVD release of a film can be months or even years after it has shown in cinemas .
If you happen to live somewhere that is n't America , it can be even longer till a DVD appears .
Of course if you live in America then films from other countries are going to appear much latter , but as a large percentage of films / TV shows are American , it is generally " the world outside America " is the one waiting for DVDs to appear .
Geographically staggered released are common .
In fact , they are the primary reason for the DVD region encoding system -
To prevent importing / exporting DVD 's to areas you have n't released them in yet .
As for cinemas ( which I will combine with the DVD section where need - be ) , it costs a lot of money transporting film reels to various countries , there 's no point sending thousands of reels to a country where the film 's advertising has n't been noticed at all .
This is all well and good for the film makers , but from a consumer point of view it sucks -
The internet has made the world very small :
As soon as a film is released , there 's reviews all over the internet .
It 's a little annoying knowing all these people can and have seen the film already , but you cannot .
The film has been finished , you just can't see it yet because the film reel was n't seen to your local cinema , or country ...
Piracy
As soon as it's released , someone , somewhere will have somehow managed to get a video camera into the cinema , recorded the film , and make it available online .
That 's the normal - within a few hours of a film 's release , you can download it .
Anywhere in the world .
That is ( Remember , I 'm ignoring the legality factor in all of this ) an extremely efficient distribution .
It costs ... nothing - Peer to peer distribution uses the downloader 's bandwidth to also upload the film .
A self propagating , free , distribution method .
Sometimes films are made available online even before it 's in cinemas .
Sometimes months before ( although these often have some scenes missing , or incomplete sound - effects / visuals )
Now , the important point - it 's incredibly convenient .
Without leaving their homes , by clicking a few buttons on a computer , a few hours later the film is ready to watch .
Sure , setting up a Bittorrent client takes a little bit of technical knowledge - at least , it used to .
Grab uTorrent if you use Windows , Transmission if you use OS X , put the application somewhere sensible ( Program Files , or Applications folder ) , and double click the icon .
UPnP takes care of the port - forwarding , and that 's it - The client is setup .
The biggest problem now is companies similar to " Media Defender " flooding Torrent sites with fake torrents , but simply reading the comments on the torrent - download page , or reading sites like " RlsLog " both give good indications of a torrent 's quality - both in terms of download and visual quality .
As for visual quality - The rule of thumb is if it has " CAM " in the title , it 's bad quality , " TS " means bad quality with better audio , " SCREENER " can mean good quality , maybe with a watermark ( " For your Consideration " , for example ) , DVDRip is generally perfect quality .
As for download - speed , the higher number of seeds , the better .
The less peers ( downloaders only ) , the better .
But , if something has thousands of seeds and very few peers , be suspicious .
That 's it , it takes about 5 minutes to teach someone the basics , and there are plenty of written guides around .
Where piracy beats the alternative hands down : TV shows .
Using a torrent auto - downloader ( something like TVTad , TED , the uTorrent / Azereus RSS auto - downloader features ) along with a service like TVrss. net .
You put in the names of the TV shows you watch , put in the RSS feed from TVRSS .
That 's it , when a new episode is aired , someone captures / uploads it , the torrent appears in your client and starts downloading .
All unattended .
Then you 're free to watch it when you want , as many times as you want , on what ever device or screen you want .
Personal Video Recorders ( PVRs . TiVo , Windows Media Center , MythTV etc ) can achieve a similar things , but , if you do n't live in America you 'll have to wait months ( if not years ... if not forever ..) before the show is aired in your country .
If your PVR is n't setup correctly , or is turned off , or you forget to set it up for that episode , or it's moved due to scheduling - You miss that episode .
With the TVRSS setup , it 's pretty much impossible to miss an episode - it automatically downloads all episodes with no intervention .
If your computer is off , you can download it later .
In fact , you can download it weeks , months , even years later .
If your patient , and wait till the end of the season , someone will put together a " [ Showname ] Season 123.torrent " , containing all the episodes in a consistent file type / quality .
There are lots of " Entire show " torrents , where you can grab all episodes of a particular show .
Be even more patient and a " [ Showname ] Complete Series.torrent " torrent will be created .
Winner
Piracy -
It 's more convenient , no waiting for months for staggered releases , no waiting for physical media to arrive , no hoping they will show the film in your countries cinemas .
There 's a slight learning curve to using Bittorrent , but with a technically minded friend , or a half - decent guide it can setup up in minutes .
Watching
DVD
Most computers now can play DVDs , most TV 's come with DVD players ( if not , you can buy them for not a lot of money ) .
The hardware to watch DVD 's is widely available .
Now , you put your legitimately bought DVD in your legitimately bought DVD player and what 's the first thing you see ?
An unskippable anti-piracy warning !
Then a bunch of unskippable studio logos , maybe some trailer you need to skip though .
Then you need to find the play - movie button ..
And .. more studio logos .
The ironic thing ?
On illegally downloaded films , these annoying copyright / anti-piracy warnings are n't there -
They only inconvenience the legitimate users - it does n't solve the problem at all .
The way around this is ..
Non-existent really .
The only way around I know of is " AnyDVD " or VLC , which lets you skip copyright notices on DVD 's that you watch on your computer .
A slight improvement , but still annoying and limited .
On your regular DVD player , there 's no easy way to bypass the UOP 's..
Piracy
You double click the .avi file , it starts playing the movie , no skippable warnings , no trailers , just the movie .
There 's the small issue of codecs , which is simply solved by installing something like the " Combined Community Codec Pack " ( CCCP ) , or using mplayer / VLC , and you never have to worry about it again .
Things like Xbox Media Center , Windows Media Center , those hardware media - extender boxes allow you to watch films / TV shows etc on your TV .
Again , like Bittorrent , this is n't very simple to setup - but really , it 's no different to setting up a DVD player : if you do n't know how to do it yourself , you get a friend to do it .
If you can setup a DVD player easily , chances are you can setup a media - extender box , or even XBMC .
There are similar " legal " options .
For example , the iTunes Store .
These have some huge drawbacks : * If you buy the content form Apple , it wont play back on your little generic - brand media - extender box , or your Xbox Media Center modified - Xbox .
*
You have to use iTunes to play it back , you have to authorized iTunes online to play it .
If your computer dies , and you did n't have a premonition telling you to de-authorize your computer , things get complicated .
*
If you want a Windows Media - Center / XBMC - type interface , it wo n't work ..
You need to buy ..
An " Apple TV " !
It can only play media bought from iTunes ..
It 's the only hardware box that can play iTunes content .. * The iTunes store outside America are awful .
The UK store is extremely limited , the Australian one does not exist .
Alternatives like Amazon Unbox or Hulu are n't available outside the US at all .
The Apple TV box is very limited .
Compare it to say the XBMC system : * It can play DVDs , most formats of digital media ( aside from DRM 'd media such as the iTunes content .. ) , it can play streaming TV , it can stream the content from any device than can run an FTP or SMB ( Windows File Sharing server ) *
You can " acquire " pretty much any film or TV show online - from big HOllywood films , to obscure foreign films .
*
There are various scripts and modification to do many things , from streaming online content ( Youtube , DailiyMotion and loads of others ) , display news , weather , games .
All free , and fairly easy to create .
Again , it can be a bit of a pain to setup , but once it 's up and running , it 's done and very easy to use .
Winner
Piracy .
No useless " anti-piracy " warnings , you just click play and the film starts .
And that play button can be on anything from a DivX - compatible DVD player , to laptop , to a modified Xbox .
Storing
DVD
Storing a lot of DVD boxes can be a bit annoying .
They get dusty , they are hard to move around , they can be hard to find specific discs unless you organize them nicely , which takes a lot of effort .
Discs get dirty and scratched easily , if that happens , your screwed - Good luck getting a replacement , you pretty much have to buy it again .
If you want to get rid of a DVD , you can give them to a friend , sell them on eBay , or similar .
Wait , technically you can't , it 's illegal to do any of that , according to those " No unauthorized lending , copying or [ ... ] " .
But it 's impossible to enforce , so no one does .
Giving a friend a DVD , or even a copy of a CD is accepted , but transferring it over the internet is still a hanging - offense in most peoples eyes ..
Piracy
A 500GB hard drive costs less than £ 70 now .
That drive , which is less than the size of two DVD boxes , and hides inside your computer .
This little cheap drive could hold over 600 movies .
Or over 100 full TV seasons .
Want rid of something ?
Hit the delete button and it's gone .
This is n't a big issue , you can easily shove another harddrive or 3 in a PC - disc space quickly becomes a non-issue .
The biggest problem with digital media is , if your harddrive dies , your media goes with it .
But since you can easily download the files again , it 's not a big problem .
Besides , harddrives are generally more reliable that optical drives , if only because you do n't constantly touch the surface of a harddrive platter , like you do every time you put a DVD in the player .
If you do want to backup your files up .
Plug in an external harddrive , copy the files over - in a few minutes the film is copied on two reliable drives .
The same can't be said for DVD - backup ( Which you 'd have to violate the DMCA to backup ! ) .
Winner
Piracy .
Digital media is far more convenient in pretty much every way .
Legality
DVD
Legal .
But it 's against the law to decrypt the DVD so you can back it up .
You ( legally ) can't lend the DVD to a friend ( Although as I said above , this is never enforced ) .
The Region Encoding System prevents discs working in other countries - may not seem like a huge problem , but for example , my sister recently emigrated from the UK to Australia .
Some of her DVD 's work in the Australian DVD player on the main TV .
A lot of Australian DVD 's do n't work on the UK DVD player she brought .
It 's annoying .
It does n't prevent piracy .
It 's been said ( not sure how officially ) but when you buy a DVD , or a game , your effectively " renting " it , or purchasing a license to watch the content .
The data you just bought is n't yours , it 's the studios ..
Sort of makes sense , they made the content , but that should n't prevent me from doing what I want with it .
No , that does n't mean I should be able to edit out the credits and claim I made it - but I should mean I can copy it onto my laptop without violating the DMCA .
Okay , for most people , DVD 's are fine .
I do n't mind watching or buying / renting DVDs ...
Until I put the disc in and have to sit though a message warning me it 's illegal to copy this disc and such .
EVERY .
SINGLE .
TIME .
I was watching a Simpsons DVD ( Season 3 , I think it was ) :
When I put the disc in , you get the 20th Century Fox logo , which I fast - forward .
Then , a " WARNING " screen with some legal text .
Then the same text in Spanish .
Then in Italian .
Then French .
Then ....
This goes on for at least 30 seconds , then a few other pages of text I can't skip .
Finally , I get to the main menu , and choose an episode ...
After a slightly drawn - out menu exit-animation , another copyright notice !
After that next 5 second screen the episode plays .
At the end of the episode , if I do n't hit the Menu button during the credits , it goes back though the opening " WARNING " pages ...
Finally , it 's back to the menu , ready to go though the copyright notice intro again ..
Do these messages help at all ?
If the person has bought your DVD , you might as well be nice to them !
If they have bought the DVD to rip it to a computer and redistribute it , those warnings are n't going to deter them .
There 's nothing you can do to stop them when they have the disc in their hands .
NOTHING .
DRM does n't work , encryption does n't work .
But , if you make legitimate viewers experience suck thanks to all these limitations , the piracy option is going to look more and more tempting to them .
If you could buy reasonably priced content , without lots ( or any kind of ) limitations , you 'll do more for anti-piracy than any super - strong DRM system will .
iTunes is fairly flexible in terms of DRM - you can transfer media between a few computers with iTunes on it , and it 's fairly easy , cheap and convenient to buy content .
It 's extremely successful .
Although , as I have said before , the iTunes Store has several huge flaws , the biggest of those being it's ( effectively ) America - only .
Hulu , Amazon Unbox , Netflix Online and others all suffer the same problem .
As a second example , AllOfMP3 - Cheap , easy to buy , non-DRM 'd music .
Extremely successful also .
Not because of the all - in - one service like iTunes , which supplies everything ( The software , the content , the hardware players etc ) - it just gives good , unrestrictive content .
Unfortunatly , AllOfMp3 seems to have been shutdown !
Piracy
It 's not legal .
I do n't know if it should be , but the current copyright system is just not applicable anymore , with the rise in broadband and digital media .
Fines of many - thousand pounds / dollars / yen for downloading a single movie is just insane .
People have gotten longer jail time for piracy than murderers have .
Claims of loss - of - profits are unprovable and disputable ( Arguments such as " I would never have never bought the DVD anyway " are valid , if not more so than " By downloading the film you deprived the filmmaker of payment , and fund terrorism " ) .
The " You would n't steal a handbag .. " anti-piracy video which is on a lot of DVD 's is a good example of piracy being handled wrongly .
Downloading a copy of a film is not the same as stealing a handbag , or even a DVD .
Duplicating media , and physically stealing something just is n't the same thing .
If you take a DVD from a shop 's shelve , and do n't pay for it - that 's an item someone now can't pick up and give the store money for .
If you take someone 's handbag , they have to go out , buy a replacement for it , and everything in it .
Downloading a film is more comparable to lending a DVD to a friend .
You both get to watch the film , but only one of you has actually given money to the distribution company !
I fail to see how a DVD , viewed by 100 people , is any different to 100 people downloading that same film of the Internet .
To summarize that sub-rant , theft and copyright infringement are not the same , and should not be handled as such .
Ever .
Winner and summary
I 'm not sure .
Well .
Obviously DVD's are more legal , but the restrictions imposed by the DMCA ( Digital Millennium Copyright Act - which criminalize the circumnavigation of DRM , which incidentally make watching DVD 's in Linux illegal , at least inside the US ) kind of make things more legally - fiddly .
You can't technically backup DVD 's without violating it .
Downloading films while illegal , is again kind of " legally - fiddly " .
It 's easily justified .
DVD 's are more legal , but in a few years new content delivery methods will become popular .
People stick to the methods they know , for music it was LP's , then 20 years or so later it was cassette tapes , 20 years later , MP3's .
Same with VHS , to DVD 's , something will eventually replace it , and since all these kids are growing up having gotten used to downloading content online , it 's a good bet that online delivery will be the next big thing .
It 's really a case of history repeating itself :
LP records will destroy the live music industry !
No one will see live music anymore !
Cassette were heralded as the death of the music industry , and will destroy our LP sales !
MP3's were heralded as the death of the music industry , and will destroy our cassette sales !
VHS will destroy the movie industry , no one will go to see films anymore !
DVD 's will destroy the movie industry , no one will go to see films anymore !
Bittorrent will destroy the movie industry , no one will go to see films anymore !
Do you see the pattern ?
These new mediums were going to " destroy the [ film / music ] industry " , but when said industries stopped fighting against them , and actually tried embracing them , they realized they could make lots of money by selling cassettes , VHS tapes , and DVDs .
And they pretty much became the corner - stones of the industry .
It 's a shame it 's taken so long for online delivery to be accepted .
Online MP3 sales are starting to pick up , but online movie sales are still in the " death of the industry " stage .
Columnist Robert Novak is hardly a neoconservative .
He has often been harshly critical of Israel , which would automatically disqualify him from joining that elite group , but he apparently shares the neocon view of the U.S. intelligence community .
In a Christmas Eve column called " Subverting Bush at Langley , " Novak , sometimes referred to by his critics as " Robert No-facts , " has hit his journalistic lowest point since he deliberately outed CIA officer Valerie Plame in July 2003 .
Novak argues that the CIA has been systematically seeking to destroy the Bush presidency , a neocon theme favored by the likes of John Bolton and Norman Podhoretz , among others .
Basic neocon doctrine posits that the U.S. policy in the Middle East that seeks to replace corrupt Arab states with democracies that will be friendly to Israel must be right , so therefore the failure of those policies must be the result of a stab in the back by traitors within the system .
To complete the circle , neocons note that the intelligence community has long been lukewarm on the Iraq war and other ventures , so it must be sheltering the traitors in question .
The neocon syllogism deliberately ignores the fact that the CIA was created in 1947 to provide objective information to policymakers , not to support a particular position or agenda , meaning that if the CIA is doing its job properly it will often find itself at odds with politicians .
It also ignores the possibility that the Iraq war and the tight circle of neocons who promoted it might have been wrong both in their basic assumptions about the nature of the Middle East and also in terms of their prescriptions for making it a more congenial place .
Neocons have never admitted to being wrong , even with Iraq and Afghanistan tumbling down around their ears .
The lesser mortals who get their hands dirty attempting to carry out neocon policies must also take the blame for the mistakes .
Novak gathers many of the neocon critiques of the intelligence community into one broad indictment , claiming that he can discern a " defiant undermining of President Bush . "
His article claims that the CIA deliberately destroyed the tapes of the " enhanced " interrogations of several key terrorism suspects " in the face of the administration ’s resistance , " that the CIA produced a National Intelligence Estimate ( NIE ) on Iran that does not examine contradictions with an earlier NIE written in 2005 , and that the CIA has refused to share information on the Israeli attack on Syria that took place in early September .
Novak ’s claims are themselves agenda - driven , and he seems not to know how the intelligence community is currently structured .
He also tends to forget that both the CIA and the director of national intelligence work for the president and are completely responsive to his orders  they do not and cannot issue " rogue " intelligence assessments to embarrass the White House .
Nor does the U.S. intelligence community decide " on its own what information the public shall learn , " as Novak avers .
The release of classified information is up to the president .
No experienced intelligence officer or anyone who even knows how the system works would claim that the interrogation tapes were destroyed without White House consent .
The director of operations who ordered the destruction of the tapes , Jose Rodriguez , is an extremely cautious man who is himself a lawyer .
When he acted , he acted under orders .
Regarding the NIE , which Novak describes as " flying solo " by the CIA , even the president and vice president have reluctantly agreed that it is the best possible analysis based on all the information available to the United States government at the present time .
That does not make the document infallible , and it does not mean that parts of it might well be rewritten as new information is acquired .
The White House has avoided criticizing the report per se , and it has not allowed the conclusions to shift the administration ’s preferred policy options , which continue to consist of asserting a hard line against Iran .
In addition , Novak seems unaware that the NIE is a consensus document that was issued by Director of National Intelligence Mike McConnell , not by the CIA , nor that it was reviewed and tested both by 16 separate intelligence agencies and the White House before it was issued .
It was only released in an unclassified summary form because it was feared that either Congress or the Israelis , both of whom received full classified copies , would selectively leak it to suit their own ends .
Novak ’s claim that intelligence on the Israeli attack on Syria is being deliberately withheld by the CIA is also nonsensical , particularly as the CIA does not control either the National Security Agency or the National Geospatial Intelligence Agency , where electronic intercepts and satellite photo surveillance are now located .
Presumably , those are the two government components that would have information on the Israeli attack , if such intelligence even exists .
The really pathetic part of the Novak story is that his apparent source for the allegations about the CIA is Congressman Peter Hoekstra of Michigan , who is the ranking Republican on the House Select Intelligence Committee .
If one were to assume that Hoekstra ’s years of experience on the committee , which he once headed , means that he is a reliable source with a firm grasp of the difference between politically contrived fiction and reality , one would be wrong .
Army intelligence once had a source description referred to as an F - 6 .
An F - 6 reported unverifiable information and was himself of uncertain reliability .
Hoekstra is an F - 6 .
Hoekstra is , in fact , one of the propagators of the school of thought that relies on the intelligence " stab in the back " as the principal reason for the Republican Party ’s complete failure in Iraq and the so - called global war on terrorism .
When a politician finds himself in an untenable position of his own making , he instinctively tries to find a scapegoat .
In July 2006 , Hoekstra stated , " In fact , I have long been convinced that a strong and well - positioned group within the Agency intentionally undermined the Administration and its policies . "
He has called for a major shakeup at the CIA not because it has been wrong about issues , but because it is not , in his opinion , loyal enough to the president .
And it is so much easier to blame faceless intelligence analysts than to admit that the White House has been catastrophically wrong about Iraq , at a cost of 4,000 American lives and trillions of dollars .
In Novak ’s column , Hoekstra describes the CIA as " incompetent , arrogant , and political , " which is a trenchant description of the congressman himself .
Hoekstra has had his share of foot - in - mouth moments .
On June 22 , 2006 , he and Pennsylvania Sen .
Rick Santorum announced at a press conference in the Capitol that weapons of mass destruction consisting of 500 chemical devices had been located in Iraq , vindicating the presidential decision to go to war .
The weapons turned out to be discarded artillery shells , and the Hoekstra - Santorum claims were quickly disputed by both the Pentagon and the intelligence community .
The Iraq Study Group also reexamined the report and determined that Saddam ’s chemical weapons had been destroyed in 1991 .
Hoekstra is also eager to come to grips with axis - of - evil Iran .
In September 2006 , the BBC , CBS News , and the Associated Press all reported how Hoekstra ’s House Intelligence Committee received an unusual rebuke in the form of a letter from the International Atomic Energy Association for what it described as " serious distortions of the agency ’s own findings on Iran ’s nuclear activity . "
The letter raised objections over the committee ’s report of Aug. 23 , which stated incorrectly that Iran had enriched uranium to weapons - grade level .
The IAEA had in fact only found small quantities of enrichment at far lower levels , 3.5 percent versus the 90 percent that Hoekstra ’s committee was claiming .
The letter also took “ strong exception to the incorrect and misleading assertion ” that the IAEA removed senior safeguards inspector Chris Charlier for “ allegedly raising concerns about Iranian deception ” over its program .
Charlier had been removed at the request of Tehran , which has the right to make such an objection under agreed rules between the agency and all states , but he remained head of a section investigating Iran .
The IAEA added that it was “ outrageous and dishonest ” to suggest in the report that Charlier was removed for not adhering to a completely fictitious " unstated IAEA policy barring IAEA officials from telling the whole truth ” about Iran .
Robert Novak ’s rearranging of facts that have already been contorted by Congressman Hoekstra makes for an interesting read , but the defamation of thousands of professional intelligence officers to shield a wholly incompetent Bush administration from its manifold failures is little more than a cheap shot .
It does not deserve to be on the editorial page of one of America ’s leading newspapers .

The chief executive of McDonald ’s UK has hit out at video games for being a major cause of the childhood obesity crisis .
Steve Easterbrook told The Times that the food and drinks industry shared responsibility for the issue with individuals and Government .
But he made special mention of the popularity of games – and said they have reduced the amount of time young people spend outdoors burning off energy ” .
The issue of obesity is complex and is absolutely one our society is facing , there ’s no denial about that , ” said Easterbrook .
But if you break it down I think there ’s an education piece : how can we better communicate to individuals the importance of a balanced diet and taking care of themselves ?
Then there ’s a lifestyle element : there ’s fewer green spaces and kids are sat home playing computer games on the TV when in the past they ’d have been burning off energy outside . ”
According to The Times , McDonalds UK is ‘ on the brink of its best year for two decades ’ .
The firm has enjoyed six per cent like - for - like sales growth in the last year .
More than 88 million visits were made to McDonald ’s restaurants last month , up 10 million on the previous year .

In 1981 , Obama arrived at Columbia University , where he majored in international relations .
He wrote his senior thesis on the North - South debate on trade then raging as part of the demand for a “ new international economic order . ”
But he says that he was never much of a lefty .
Obama offers himself as the representative of a new generation , free of the dogmas that still burden the Democratic Party .
“ The Democrats have been stuck in the arguments of Vietnam , ” he said to me on the campaign plane , “ which means that either you ’re a Scoop Jackson Democrat or you ’re a Tom Hayden Democrat and you ’re suspicious of any military action .
And that ’s just not my framework . ”
Image Credit ... Christian Witkin
Indeed , for all his soaring idealism , Obama seems to have absorbed Lolo ’s teachings about the world ’s refractoriness .
The foreign - policy figures whom he finds “ most compelling , ” he says , are the archrealists who shaped policy during the cold war , including the secretaries of state George C. Marshall and Dean Acheson and the diplomat - scholar George F. Kennan .
“ What impresses me is not just the specifics of what they did , ” he said , “ but the approach they took to solve the problem , which is , if we have assets or tools to deal with foreign policy , we know that the most costly is the military tool , particularly in a nuclear era , so we want to apply all the other tools that are less costly . ”
Obama said that he also admired the worldly pragmatists who served the first George Bush , including Brent Scowcroft , the national - security adviser : “ The whole Bush team , I think , was not entirely aware of the opportunities of this new world , but they had a very clear - eyed assessment . ”
He has sought out the former secretary of state Colin Powell for counsel , and spoken with Scowcroft as well .
Obama was sitting across from me in one of the leather bucket seats of the walnut - trimmed corporate jet the campaign had just leased .
He has a look as cool and unruffled as his velvety tenor .
He was tieless , as always , and his white shirt billowed around his trim frame ; not even the tiniest crease marred his pale khaki linen pants .
Because Obama has a loose and jokey manner — fist - bumps , male hugs — you do not immediately notice the inner gyroscope that keeps everything at a level .
Even in public , he rarely changes the volume , speed or pitch of his voice .
He does not hurry ; he lopes .
He seems to have a gift for husbanding his energy .
He had woken early that morning in Manchester to play a game of pickup basketball against kids from Southern New Hampshire University .
( The Obamas lost , 11 - 10 . )
The plane was heading to Des Moines ; Obama had four campaign events scheduled for later that day .
He was yawning , and he had pushed his salmon aside , half - eaten ; but he spoke for about an hour before taking a nap .
You feel , with Obama , that life experience , temperament and opinion are all of a piece .
He is , on the one hand , an idealist and optimist who recoils from the zero-sum formula .
If a single sentiment stands at the heart of his worldview , it ’s that , as he said in a speech earlier this year , “ the security of the American people is inextricably linked to the security of all people . ”
What ’s good for others is good for us ; there ’s no contradiction between idealism and realism .
This may strike some as naïve ; and yet Obama shies away from the exclamatory rhetoric and grandiose formulations that have become George Bush ’s stock in trade .
Bush ’s post -9/11 recognition that our own security depends on the well - being of people on the other side of the globe led him to propound the so - called Freedom Agenda and to promote democracy in the Middle East .
Obama , though a more eager democracy promoter than his realist heroes were , is also far more tempered than Bush .
He accuses the Bush administration of an ethnocentric fixation on elections and classic political rights .
Instead , he argues : “ We have to be focused on what are the aspirations of the people in those countries .
Once those aspirations are met , it opens up space for the kind of democratic regimes that we want . ”
Obama speaks with special passion about the need to change America ’s image in the world — and not only by proving that it can elect a 46 - year - old black man with roots in the Muslim world .
He returns again and again to the question of what America means to the rest of the world .
In one of his speeches , he observed that United States senators typically see “ the desperate faces ” of Darfur or Baghdad from the height of a helicopter .
“ And it makes you stop and wonder , ” he added , “ when those faces look up at an American helicopter , do they feel hope , or do they feel hate ? ”
Obama would like to restore the era when people in capitals all over the world could go to the local American cultural center to read books and magazines , the way he could in Jakarta — though now he would add English lessons and vocational training , and “ stories of America ’s Muslims and the strength they add to our country . ”
He argues that we must give emerging powers like India , Brazil , Nigeria and South Africa “ a stake in upholding the international order . ”
Obama is an unabashed fan of multilateral institutions .
At an event in New Hampshire this summer , I heard him say , “ I want to go before the United Nations and say , ‘ America ’s back ! ’ ” This is a bit too multilateral even for some of his advisers , who take a more skeptical view of the U.N. than he does .
But for Obama , our willingness to be constrained by rules that govern others may take precedence over the rules themselves .
By the time he announced his candidacy earlier this year , Obama was already a media phenomenon thanks to his star turn at the 2004 Democratic convention and the publication of his second book , “ The Audacity of Hope . ”
He moved in a bright nimbus of expectation ; but he had arrived so recently on the national stage that the idea of a President Obama seemed almost impertinent .
And Americans were all too familiar with the dangers of callow presidents .
This spring , Obama tried to prove his readiness for office by laying out his foreign - policy views in a series of speeches and the obligatory essay in Foreign Affairs .
He was obviously far more knowledgeable about the world , and far more nuanced in his understanding , than George Bush was in 2000 .
But was this junior senator with the boyish mien seasoned enough for the Oval Office ?
This was the threshold he had to cross .
And Hillary Clinton wasted no time in planting the seeds of doubt .
I. The Law
18 USC 2331 states , inter alia , that :
( 1 ) the term " international terrorism " means activities that — ( A ) involve violent acts or acts dangerous to human life that are a violation of the criminal laws of the United States or of any State , or that would be a criminal violation if committed within the jurisdiction of the United States or of any State ; ( B ) appear to be intended — ( i ) to intimidate or coerce a civilian population ;
( ii ) to influence the policy of a government by intimidation or coercion ; or
( iii ) to affect the conduct of a government by mass destruction , assassination , or kidnapping ; and ( C ) occur primarily outside the territorial jurisdiction of the United States , or transcend national boundaries in terms of the means by which they are accomplished , the persons they appear intended to intimidate or coerce , or the locale in which their perpetrators operate or seek asylum [ . ]
II .
The Alleged Facts
I incorporate by reference the excellent , must - read , highly - recommended diary by Naomi Wolf , entitled Blackwater :
Are you scared yet ?
Next , for your consideration , a series of articles from The Washington Post , The Independent , and The New York Times that show the terroristic activities of Blackwater in Iraq .
In high - level meetings over the past several days , U.S. military officials have pressed State Department officials to assert more control over Blackwater , which operates under the department 's authority , said a U.S. government official with knowledge of the discussions .
" The military is very sensitive to its relationship that they 've built with the Iraqis being altered or even severely degraded by actions such as this event , " the official said .
" This is a nightmare , " said a senior U.S. military official .
" We had guys who saw the aftermath , and it was very bad .
This is going to hurt us badly .
It may be worse than Abu Ghraib , and it comes at a time when we 're trying to have an impact for the long term . "
The official was referring to the prison scandal that emerged in 2004 in which U.S. soldiers tortured and abused Iraqis .
In last week 's incident , Blackwater guards shot into a crush of cars , killing at least 11 Iraqis and wounding 12 .
Blackwater officials insist their guards were ambushed , but witnesses have described the shooting as unprovoked .
Iraq 's Interior Ministry has concluded that Blackwater was at fault .
The Washington Post
Blackwater , one of the largest American security firms in Iraq , has come under criticism in the US for its role in a 2004 ambush in Fallujah that left four of its staff killed and the region in deadly chaos .
A House of Representatives report outlined the " unprepared and disorderly " build - up to the incident on 31 March , 2004 , resulting in the employees – who were escorting a convoy – being executed and having their charred bodies hung from a bridge .
The disturbing attack was seen as a turning point for US public opinion after images of the charred bodies were shown around the world by the media .
A few days later , the US military launched a major offensive in Fallujah , leading to one of the bloodiest periods since the 2003 invasion .
The Independent
The American official said that by Wednesday morning , American investigators still had not responded to multiple requests for information by Iraqi officials investigating the episode .
The official also said that Blackwater had been conducting its own investigation but had been ordered by the United States to stop that work .
Ms. Tyrrell confirmed that the company had done an investigation of its own , but said , " No government entity has discouraged us from doing so . "
An Iraqi investigation had concluded that the guards shot without provocation .
But the official said that the guards told American investigators that they believed that they fired in response to enemy gunfire .
The Blackwater compound , rimmed by concrete blast walls and concertina wire in the Green Zone in central Baghdad , has been under tight control .
Participants in the Sept. 16 security operation have been ordered not to speak about the episode .
But word of the disagreement on the street has slowly made its way through the community of private security contractors New York Times
And , there are allegations that Blackwater is selling arms to insurgents that are being used against American troops :
The first public hint that an investigation was under way came earlier this week in a statement from State Department Inspector General Howard Krongard after he was accused of blocking fraud investigations in Afghanistan and Iraq .
Do n't Miss Krongard said the State Department has been cooperating with the prosecutors in the Blackwater probe .
" In particular , I made one of my best investigators available to help assistant U.S. attorneys in North Carolina in their investigation into alleged smuggling of weapons into Iraq by a contractor , " Krongard 's statement said .
Blackwater resumed normal security operations in Iraq on Friday , the State Department said , after a brief hiatus following the lethal incident last Sunday .
CNN
There is a diary today ( h/t Terre ) regarding Krongard now threatening his staff if they participate with the Waxman investigation :
I am writing to you about an exceptionally serious matter : reports that your senior staff has threatened officials that you could fire them if they cooperate with the Committee 's investigation into your conduct .
On September 18 , 2007 , I wrote to you requesting your assistance with an Oversight Committee investigation into your actions as State Department Inspector General .
In that letter , I described allegations from seven officials in your office that you interfered with on - going investigations in order to protect the State Department and the White House from political embarrassment .
I requested various documents related to the investigation , and I informed you that Committee staff would be conducting interviews of several officials in your ofÍice .
Two of the individuals who came forward were John A. DeDona , the former Assistant Inspector General for Investigations , and Ralph McNamara , the former Deputy Assistant Inspector General for Investigations .
They told my staff that they had resigned after you repeatedly halted or impeded investigations undertaken by their office .
The other individuals who contacted my staff asked that their identities not be revealed because they feared that you would retaliate against them .
III .
Applying the Law to the Alleged Facts
It is clear that if the facts alleged are true , then Blackwater has been involved in violent acts or acts dangerous to human life that are a violation of the criminal laws of the United States or of any State , or that would be a criminal violation if committed within the jurisdiction of the United States or of any State
Further , it appears that such acts are minimally intended to to intimidate or coerce a civilian population
And , these alleged activities occur primarily outside the territorial jurisdiction of the United States , or transcend national boundaries in terms of the means by which they are accomplished , the persons they appear intended to intimidate or coerce , or the locale in which their perpetrators operate or seek asylum [ . ]
IV .
Conclusion
Therefore , it is incumbent on the Senate to Resolve that ,
BLACKWATER USA IS AN " INTERNATIONAL TERRORIST " ORGANIZATION , AS DEFINED IN 18 USC 2331 , ET SEQ .
If no Resolution is forthcoming , then we know that the Democratic Leadership is condoning these activities of the Republican Party and their mercenaries in Iraq .
The choice is yours , Mr Reid and Madam Speaker Pelosi .
We await your action on this matter .
Feb. 15 , 2008  -- Michael Guggenheim suffers from a rare disorder that makes the simple act of writing his name excruciatingly painful .
But now that he has found the tools to overcome this pain , he wants to share them with others .
When Michael , now 12 , was learning to read and write , his mother noticed something was wrong .
He could not write — it actually caused him pain to do so — yet he kept trying .
" You could ask him to draw a picture of something and he could describe it beautifully with words , and then you ask him to draw a stick figure and it would just be a dot on the paper , " his mother , Lori Guggenheim , said .
Michael was diagnosed with dysgraphia , a rare learning disability similar to dyslexia that does n't affect his IQ or any of his other abilities .
Nita Ferjo , an educational psychologist who treated Michael , said when she first started seeing him , he could not even hold a pencil .
" He was the kind of little kid rather than screaming and fighting , he would put his head down and just — be a sad little boy , " Ferjo said .
Michael said dealing with the disorder was frustrating .
" I used to get angry and I 'd rip up all the papers .
It was really stressful , " he said .
While it will always be painful for him to write , Michael persevered .
His family got him a laptop computer , and in a few years he has learned to write with ease on a keyboard , and now excels at school .
" It 's like the story of the tree in the front of the grove that gets blown in the wind constantly and is stronger having gone through that , " said his dad , Paul Guggenheim .
' It 's Not All About Me in This World '
Last summer , Michael thought of a way to spread the joy he gets from his laptop to children in need .
He gathered donated laptops and volunteers his time to teach kids at a Los Angeles homeless shelter to write , work and play on the computer .
" There is a characteristic drive in this youngster that is just remarkable , " Ferjo said .
When Michael applied at the shelter for a volunteer teaching position , Cecilia Ribakoff , the shelter 's volunteer coordinator , was stunned .
" He 's not even a teenager and when he interviewed with me it was a serious interview , " Ribakoff said .
" For an hour I asked him , ' Well what are you gonna do ?
What 's your course curriculum ? '
His mom was n't part of this .
His mom was in the car and I was alone with Michael . "
On top of his own homework and after - school hockey and basketball , Michael teaches his class once a week .
The children at the shelter have gained new skills , and to them , Michael is more than a teacher .
" He 's a friend .
He 's a confidante .
He is the guy who brings cool technology , and he's a kid like them , " Ribakoff said .
" It 's one boy helping other kids and with something that has changed his life . "
For his part , Michael is very down - to - earth about why he volunteers .
" It 's not all about me in this world , it 's really about all these other kids , " he said .
" It 's 'cause they are just as smart and nice as me and everyone else , it 's just they do n't get all the breaks .
Some of them before this class never knew what a computer was . "
Michael has also formed a non-profit organization called SPLAT , Showing People Learning and Technology , and launched a Web site splatcharity.wordpress.com .
As Michael looks toward the future , he thinks more about the kids he teaches than himself .
" The hope for me is that these kids will be able to excel and hopefully never have to come back to a place like this and to be able to be successful in whatever they can , " he said .
You can e-mail Michael Guggenheim directly to find out more about SPLAT at Mguggz@yahoo.com .

The Guardian reports on a building scandal in Israel over the extreme brutality of its occupation of the Palestinians in the West Bank .
Excerpt :
‘ According to Yishai Karin :
‘ At one point or another of their service , the majority of the interviewees enjoyed violence .
They enjoyed the violence because it broke the routine and they liked the destruction and the chaos .
They also enjoyed the feeling of power in the violence and the sense of danger . ’
In the words of one soldier : ‘ The truth ?
When there is chaos , I like it .
That ’s when I enjoy it .
It ’s like a drug .
If I do n’t go into Rafah , and if there is n’t some kind of riot once in some weeks , I go nuts .’ . . .
One described beating women .
‘ With women I have no problem .
With women , one threw a clog at me and I kicked her here [ pointing to the crotch ] , I broke everything there .
She ca n’t have children .
Next time she wo n’t throw clogs at me .
When one of them [ a woman ] spat at me , I gave her the rifle butt in the face .
She does n’t have what to spit with any more . ’ ‘
The idea that these sorts of actions derive from ‘ lack of training ’ is absurd .
They derive from hatred and from being able to act with impunity .
They are a burden of the strong who have the opportunity to abuse the weak .
The US political elite and media that conceals the brutality of the Israeli occupation for sectional political gains are accomplices to this sadism , and their silence endangers the security of the United States .
When we cannot understand why Arab audiences , who are perfectly aware of what the Israeli army has been doing to Palestinians for decades , are outraged , it leads us into policy mistakes in dealing with the Middle East .
No one in the US media ever talks about Zionofascism , and the campus groups who yoke the word ‘ fascism ’ to other religions and peoples are most often trying to divert attention from their own authoritarianism and approval of brutality .
HAMMERFEST , Norway —
For a quarter - century , energy executives were tantalized by vast quantities of natural gas in one of the world ’s least hospitable places — 90 miles off Norway ’s northern coast , beneath the Arctic Ocean .
Bitter winds and frequent snowstorms lash the region .
The sun disappears for two months a year .
No oil company knew how to operate in such a harsh environment .
But Norway has finally solved the problem .
The other day , on an island just offshore , a giant yellow flame illuminated the sky here .
It was just a temporary flare for excess gas , but it signaled a new era in energy production .
Across the bay from this small fishing town , where reindeer wander the streets , one of the world ’s most advanced natural gas plants is coming to life .

The cartograms below show the world through the eyes of editors - in - chief , in 2007 .
Countries swell as they receive more media attention ; others shrink as we forget them .

These maps allow you to grasp several media trends at a glance .
First , traditional newspapers are highly selective in their coverage of world news .
Looking at the three British dailies , editors favour countries that are bigger and more populous , but also closer to home and better developed .
They also give more room to the countries of origin of British immigrants , especially if they are white ( look at the size of Australia and New - Zealand ) .
Hardly surprising , but still disheartening , especially when you consider that the only brand that does not advocate objectivity , The Economist , covers the world more equally .
Second , we see that web - only outlets do not offer such a different view of the world .
That makes sense , considering the narrowing of the news agenda on the web that was described in the Project for Excellence in Journalism ’s latest report .
Their lack of resources forces them to contract their scope .
Smaller issues are better covered by the blogosphere , which seems unbeatable at providing niche news .
The world according to newspapers is a project that came up while writing a dissertation for school .
I first published some maps on L’Observatoire des Médias , a French blog .
Seeing the response , Gilles Bruno and I decided to go further and keep track of newspaper coverage .
We want the maps above to be updated daily ( or weekly ) in order to pressure editors into covering more diverse issues .
We will build a scraper that will automatically retrieve the data for the 164 countries on several newspapers and a Java or Flash interface that will morph the maps .
If you have any skill in cartograms , or data scraping , or if you have funds to buy these skills , you are more than welcome in the team !

We have a blueprint for a state machine that writes a blueprint for another state machine .
So we are looking at a blueprint of a state machine that makes blueprints and we are trying to predict the behaviour of the state machines it builds .
This is roughly like looking at Bach ’s DNA and hearing the Little Fugue in your head .

The Art of the Metaobject Protocol is one of the most important books ever written on the subject of building abstractions with objects .
The Metaobject Protocol is a system for defining your own object semantics , and you can implement the parts you choose in Ruby or any other reasonably expressive language .
And while you ’re learning how to make your programs better in your language , you just might pick up a little Common Lisp .
Highly recommended .

This post was conceived during the Q&A after Andrew Hessel ’s talk at SciBarCamp .
1. ( A few people missed this post script , so I have made it an end note ) :
Yes , I realize that “ metaprogramming ” is a vague term with may possible interpretations right down to the weak assertion that writing named procedures is metaprogramming .
And I also realize that there is much , much more to programming than imperative programming .
But please do n’t allow the presence of this disclaimer to discourage you from comments about other forms of metaprogramming that do not fit into the neat box of state machines building blueprints for state machines .
I am especially interested in hearing from functional programmers : what is the functional equivalent of the metaprogramming described here and how does it differ in character ?
[ back ]
In case you did n’t recognise it at a glance , this is a metaprogramming gene : it repairs DNA in Methanoculleus Marisnigri , an anaerobic organism found in decaying sediment at the bottom of the Black Sea .
Metaprogramming genes ‽
Yes indeed , the Genetic code embraces metaprogramming with enthusiasm : DNA splices itself , moves code around , and rewrites code .
Sections of code are turned on and off .
Genes manufacture proteins that express or suppress other genes .
And I am grossly oversimplifying things !
The frustrating thing about genetic code is that it is really , really easy to understand what it does in the small .
Nucleic acids come in triplets called codons .
In the gene above , the first codon and last codon are beginning and end markers , like curly braces in Algol - derived programming languages .
The other codons code for amino acids .
The entire template manufactures a small piece of RNA .
This mechanism is very well understood at this scale of behaviour .
However , when you build from the DNA up to the whole organism , the overall behaviour is a mystery , just asSoftware programs exhibit the same frustrating property : although we can easily determine what individual expressions do , the behaviour of programs in the aggregate resists simple analysis .
Consider : What does this do ?
Well , in C++ anything is possible , but a simple interpretation — incrementing an integer and then using the result to assign zero to an element of an indexed collection — is well understood and the probable meaning of this program in many languages .
The program that includes such a line has state , and this line of code makes a very small alteration to that state .
What effect does this line of code have on a program ’s behaviour ?
Well , now we have a conundrum .
You often find this code inside of a loop .
But if we make some error in our loop boundary checking , we can start overwriting some other thing — like our program ’s code — with zeroes .
This is the basic problem with state machines : a small change of state can have unpredictable consequences on the behaviour of our machine .
There is a much more familiar expression we use to describe programming machines with mutable state :
We call it “ Imperative Programming . ”
And we have discovered that it matches the way our brains think about many algorithms really well , that ’s why we ( statistically speaking ) resist purely functional approaches .
However , we have known for a very long time that imperative programs have this awful property : a small change of code can result in unpredictable changes to the behaviour of the running program .
So here is my analogy : an imperative program is a blueprint for a state machine .
We put the blueprint inside of another machine we understand really well , and it manufactures the state machine for us , then starts the state machine .
Our problem is that we are supposed to understand the behaviour of the constructed machine as it changes state just by looking at the blueprint .
Wait !
Let ’s make the problem harder .
What if we have a blueprint for a state machine .
What does our state machine do ?
It writes a blueprint for a state machine and feeds that to a machine - making machine , which then gives us back another state machine .
So we are looking at a blueprint of a state machine that makes blueprints and we are trying to predict not only its behaviour but the behaviour of the state machines it builds .
This is roughly like looking at Bach ’s DNA and hearing the Little Fugue in your head .
Does that sound easy ?
No ?
Well what do you think we are doing when we write code what writes code ?
Here is a standard Ruby template for writing modules :
You are looking at a program that write programs , a blueprint for a machine that makes blueprints .
Metaprogramming is imperatively programming an imperative program .
Now , a program is a kind of amplifier : a short program produces a big result .
So when we write a program that writes programs , we are amplifying the amplification .
Consequently , metaprogramming amplifies the good , the bad , and the ugly of imperative programming .
In and of itself , metaprogramming is ‘ just ’ an amplifier .
If you have issues with imperative programming , you are going to have issues with metaprogramming , only magnified .
I do n’t know about you , but I certainly have issues with imperative programming .
And I am not alone : the history of programming languages has been dominated by attempts to tame the basic complexity of mutable state in programs .
Structured programming attempted to tame the arbitrarily complicated program flows — known to this day as “ spaghetti code ” — resulting from the indiscriminate use of if and goto statements .
Object - oriented programming attempted to tame the arbitrarily complicated data states resulting from the indiscriminate combination of procedures and data structures .
Procedure calls , continuations , methods , … the idioms and language mechanisms we ’ve devised are all attempts to make simpler machines that are easier to understand .
Of course , there is no simple answer .
Banning metaprogramming makes exactly as much sense as banning abstractions in imperative programming , and for exactly the same reasons .
If you ban abstractions from imperative programs , you assert that longer programs made out of simpler pieces are more tractable than short programs made out of abstractions .
Sometimes they are , sometimes the abstractions are gratuitous , and sometimes the mechanisms used to make a program short are incidental to its purpose , almost as if you compressed the source code and insisted that it must be easier to read because it has fewer redundant bits .
I ’m personally optimistic that we will find reasonable idioms and mechanisms for managing the complexity of metaprogramming .
Some of the idioms we ’ve already found are promising , and as long as we do n’t succumb to Blub and decide that there is no further improvement possible , we can only get better .
We seem to be doing a decent job with the style where we place our metaprogramming in a separate place from our program ’s core “ business logic . ”
Rails accomplishes this with plug-ins : not only can you use lots of other people ’s plug-ins , you can deliberately place your own metaprogramming code in a plug - in to keep it separate from the application code that calls it .
You call acts_as_versioned in your class , and the plug - in does the rest .
Although you are using metaprogramming , your program fakes a declarative style quite effectively .
When I said that IS - A IS - A HAS - A , a few people pointed out that IS - A is n’t HAS-A : In actuality , ISA - AHAS -A .
Is n’t that the point of true abstractions ?
To provide the illusion of a new set of semantics implemented using existing semantics ?
Syntactically this is Ruby code , but semantically it is something else altogether ( If it matters to you , it is a small snippet of a system for defining a decision tree used to determine loan eligibility ) .
This is possible with metaprogramming by its very nature :
You are working with a machine that takes a blueprint as its input and produces a blueprint as its output .
In effect , you are working with a blueprint transformer .
Mediating between different semantics is an obvious application for this technique .
This is great , and I am a big booster of the power of metaprogramming .
But just as we are loathe to “ throw out the baby with the bath water ” by banning techniques just because they can be misused , we should likewise be loathe to embrace techniques as golden hammers just because they have some extremely beneficial applications .
For all of its wonderful utility , metaprogramming is , at its heart , the act of writing programs that write programs .
Which means that understanding our programs requires predicting what a program will do given a blueprint for a machine that will write a blueprint for our program .
This is not a trivial exercise .
And yes , you can shoot yourself in the foot if you are n’t careful .
But in the end , there ’s two kinds of programmers in the world : those with dangerous techniques and those who dig .
Historically , Ranger devotion to off - color ritual only grows stronger when management tries to stop it .
Rangers fans still shout a derisive chant about Denis Potvin at home games , a reference that dates to 1979 , when the Islanders ’ Potvin hit the Rangers ’ Ulf Nilsson and broke Nilsson ’s ankle .
The chant was always shouted after the organist played the song “ Let ’s Go Band . ”
But in the 1980s , in an attempt to crack down on the chant , the Rangers stopped playing the song .
More than 20 years later , fans still whistle the song as a lead - in to the chant .
“ It ’s a hockey game , ” said Ricardo Pereira , 25 , a season - ticket holder from Huntington on Long Island .
“ Hockey players are tough .
Deal with it . ”
Hockey has a loyal fan base within New York ’s gay community , including the members of the New York Gay Hockey Association , which oversees 5 teams and claims 150 members .
Many gay Rangers fans grew up attending games with their families and say they make a distinction between raucous tradition and comments that single out a specific group .
Stankes said he turned down an invitation by the gay hockey group to attend a Rangers game en masse a few years ago .
As he feared , the crowd booed when the name of the group flashed on the monitors .
But Kagan said the fans ’ reaction surprised and hurt him .
“ I never expected that at all , ” he said .
One of the most visible examples of the fans ’ antigay behavior is the chant directed at Goodman , which according to him began in 1998 or 1999 , when the Rangers were doing poorly and some fans claimed Goodman ’s dancing was jinxing the team .
“ The fans were looking to vent their frustration on somebody and unfortunately it was me , ” said Goodman , 38 , who lives in northern New Jersey and said he was not gay .
Goodman is a celebrity at Rangers games and appears frequently on television and in local newspapers , but was reluctant to comment on the chants and told a reporter he prefers to be called Dancin ’ Larry .
Last we checked we actually were n't in the Twilight Zone , but quite frankly , the bigwigs at Gibson just might be .
Seemingly out of nowhere , the famed guitar manufacturer sparked up a lawsuit against Activision claiming that Guitar Hero titles violate one of its patents .
Now the company appears to be on the warpath , suing Wal - Mart , Target , GameStop , Amazon , Toys ' R ' Us and Kmart in an attempt to get the game off of store shelves .
Reportedly , Gibson took " this action reluctantly , but is required to protect its intellectual property . "
For the retailers that did comment , they chimed in only to say " we are n't commenting , " and judging by the looks of things , the games are still widely available -- for now .
Faced with what his advisers acknowledged was a major test to his candidacy , Senator Barack Obama sought on Monday to contain the damage from incendiary comments made by his pastor and prepared to address the issue of race more directly than at any other moment of his presidential campaign .
Though he has faced questions about controversial statements by the pastor , the Rev. Jeremiah A. Wright Jr. , for more than a year , Mr. Obama is enduring intense new scrutiny now over Mr. Wright ’s characterizations of the United States as fundamentally racist and the government as corrupt and murderous .
Mr. Obama , in a speech Tuesday in Philadelphia , will repeat his earlier denunciations of the minister ’s words , aides said .
But they said he would also use the opportunity to open a broader discussion of race , which his campaign has said throughout the contest that it wants to transcend .
He will bluntly address racial divisions , one aide said , talking about the way they play out in church , in the campaign , and beyond .
Mr. Obama continued to write the speech on Monday evening , which he believes could be one of the most important of his presidential candidacy , aides said .
His wife , Michelle , had not been scheduled to travel with him this week , but hastily made plans to be in Philadelphia .
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - The Supreme Court on Tuesday turned down a legal challenge to the warrantless domestic spying program President George W. Bush created after the Sept. 11 attacks .

The American Civil Liberties Union had asked the justices to hear the case after a lower court ruled the ACLU and other groups and individuals that sued the government had no legal right to do so because they could not prove they had been affected by the program .
The civil liberties group also asked the nation ’s highest court to make clear that Bush does not have the power under the U.S. Constitution to engage in intelligence surveillance within the United States that Congress has expressly prohibited .
“ It ’s very disturbing that the president ’s actions will not be reviewed by the Supreme Court , ” said Jameel Jaffer , director of the ACLU ’s National Security Project .
“ Allowing the executive branch to police itself flies in the face of the constitutional system of checks and balances . ”
Bush authorized the program to monitor international phone calls and e-mails of U.S. citizens without first obtaining a court warrant .
The program ’s disclosure in December 2005 caused a political uproar among Democrats , some Republicans and civil liberties activists .
The administration abandoned the program about a year ago , putting it under the surveillance court that Congress created more than 30 years ago .
Steven Shapiro , the ACLU ’s legal director , expressed disappointment that the high court refused to review the case .
“ Today ’s action says nothing about the case ’s merits and does not suggest in any way an endorsement of the lower court ’s decision .
The court ’s unwillingness to act makes it even more important that Congress insist on legislative safeguards that will protect civil liberties without jeopardizing national security , ” he said .
The journalists , scholars , attorneys and national advocacy groups that filed the lawsuit said the illegal surveillance had disrupted their ability to communicate with sources and clients .
A U.S. appeals court based in Cincinnati dismissed the case because the plaintiffs could not state with certainty they had been wiretapped by the government ’s National Security Agency .
Administration lawyers opposed the appeal and said further review by the Supreme Court was unwarranted .
The Supreme Court sided with the administration and rejected the appeal without any comment .
The Palestinian activist Dr. Sami Amin Al - Arian , imprisoned for five years despite a jury ’s failure to return a single guilty verdict against him , has gone on a hunger strike in Northern Neck Regional Jail in Warsaw , Va. Al - Arian , who has abstained from food and water since March 3 , began his hunger strike after being informed he would be called before a third grand jury .
He has lost 15 pounds and has been moved to the jail ’s medical unit .
“ A great nation is ultimately defined and judged by its system of justice , ” Al - Arian said in a statement released through his family .
“ When the system is manipulated by the powerful and tolerates abuses against the minorities or the weak members of society , the government not only loses its moral authority and betrays future generations , but will also be condemned by history . ”
The hunger strike is the third by the Palestinian activist , who was to have been released in April and deported .
During his first hunger strike , which lasted 140 days , he took liquid nutrients and lost 45 pounds .
During his hunger strike last year , which lasted 60 days , he drank only water and lost 55 pounds .
Al - Arian is a diabetic .
“ We are very worried about his health , but we understand why he ’s doing this , ” said his daughter , Laila Al - Arian .
“ The U.S. government , through its vindictive and politically motivated behavior , has given our family no other option . ”
The recent documentary “ USA vs Al - Arian ” detailed the absurdity of the show trial held in Florida and the hollowness of the government ’s case against Al - Arian .
When the film was awarded Best Nordic Documentary at the Nordic Panorama in Finland the jury wrote : “ The film shows precisely how a common man becomes a victim of the situation in the contemporary world , where the Big Brother is watching you even when you ´re ordering pizza . ”
The decision to call Al - Arian before the grand jury was made although Al - Arian had signed a “ no - cooperation ” agreement .
The agreement stipulated that he would not be required to cooperate with the government in other cases .
The government ’s attempt to force him to testify , despite the agreement , came a month before his scheduled release .
It is seen by his lawyers and his family as an effort by the government to keep the activist in jail indefinitely .
Al - Arian endured a six - month show trial in Florida that saw the government ’s case collapse .
The Justice Department spent an estimated $ 50 million and several years investigating and prosecuting Al - Arian .
The government called 80 witnesses and subjected the jury to hundreds of hours of often absurd phone transcriptions and recordings made over a 10 - year period , which the jury dismissed as “ gossip . ”
Out of the 94 charges made against the four defendants , there were no convictions .
Of the 17 charges against Al - Arian — including “ conspiracy to murder and maim persons abroad ” — the jury acquitted him of eight and was hung on the rest .
The jurors disagreed on the remaining charges , with 10 of the 12 jurors favoring his full acquittal .
Two others in the case , Ghassan Ballut and Sameeh Hammoudeh , were acquitted of all charges , dealing another body blow to the government ’s case .
Following the acquittal , a disaster for the government , especially because then - Attorney General John Ashcroft had announced the indictment , prosecutors threatened to retry Al - Arian .
The Palestinian professor , under duress , accepted a plea bargain agreement that would spare him a second trial , saying in his agreement that he had helped people associated with Palestinian Islamic Jihad with immigration matters .
It was a tepid charge given the high profile of the case .
The U.S. Attorney ’s Office for the Middle District of Florida and the counter - terrorism section of the Justice Department agreed to recommend to the judge the minimum sentence of 46 months .
But U.S. District Judge James S. Moody Jr. sentenced Dr. Al - Arian to the maximum 57 months .
In referring to Al - Arian ’s contention that he had only raised money for Palestinian Islamic Jihad ’s charity for widows and orphans , the judge said acidly to the professor that “ your only connection to orphans and widows is that you create them . ”
British scientists have uncovered the truth behind one of modern culture 's greatest mysteries : why little girls play with pink toys .
Is it because toy companies flood whole store aisles with the color ?
Or because well - meaning relatives shower girl babies with pink blankets and clothing ?
Nope .
According to the men in lab coats , it 's purely biological .
Apparently , women are hardwired to like pink because our cavewoman foremothers spent their days gathering red leaves and berries amongst the trees while their husbands were out hunting .
Later , women needed to notice red-faced babies and blushing boyfriends .
And why do men like blue ?
Because it 's the color of the sky .
This evolutionary just - so story takes up three pages of a 2007 issue of Current Biology .
To back up the assertion that pink is a universal girly preference worth examining , the authors refer to a 1985 study finding that little girls use more pink and red crayons in their drawings than little boys do .
Dig further , however , and the story completely falls apart .
British women do prefer pink , but the author 's claim of a “ robust , cross- cultural sex difference ” turns out to be neither .
The scientists compared British natives with Chinese immigrants to Britain , and glossed over the differences .
For example :
The girliest color in the British results , a purplish - pink , was in fact the Chinese men 's favorite .
Nowhere do scientific findings get more mangled than when they 're about the differences between men and women .
According to the science pages , women are n't just biologically hardwired to prefer pink to blue .
We 're also predisposed to backstab one another in the workplace , cry in the boardroom , and have both lower iqs and less of a sense of humor than men .
Some misleading stories come from bad science , where the study authors ' conclusions are n't supported by their own data .
Others are well - conducted studies whose conclusions mutate upon contact with the mainstream media .
Newspapers and websites are prone to playing fast and loose with their reports on studies , often neglecting to reveal salient facts about a study 's sample group or methodology .
The fact is that science articles are n't designed to be read by non-scientists .
College and grad students in the sciences are trained in how to do it :
They review papers and discuss them in journal clubs ; learn how to question methodologies ( Is that sample really big enough ?
Was that the right test to use ? ) ; and learn how to be critical of authors ' interpretations ( Do the results really mean what they say they mean ? ) .
Students also know to look at context for each study , looking up previous papers on the subject , reviewing the authors ' previous work , and searching out any evidence of bias that might color a study 's findings .
Journalists looking for a quick story , however , do little such research .
And in an age where news sites , wire services , and blogs pick up stories with lightning - fast speed , bad research gets around .
When London 's Sunday Times reported on a 2007 study claiming that men get dumber in the presence of blond women , the paper got the name of the journal wrong , citing the Journal of Experimental Psychology rather than the Journal of Experimental Social Psychology .
Nearly every subsequent news article repeated the error because they were content to simply reword the Times ' version of the story rather than finding and discussing the study itself .
The Times reported that blond - exposed subjects “ mimic the unconscious stereotype of the dumb blonde . ”
But that 's not exactly what the study tested .
Rather , subjects — most of them female — fared slightly worse on online trivia quizzes after rating hair color ( is she a blond , brunet , or redhead ? ) on pictures of beauty queens .
You could just as easily say that beauty queens make people dumb , or photos of dazzling smiles make people dumb .
It seems this study made the news mostly because it could be illustrated with photos of Marilyn Monroe and filled out with dopey quotes from blond models and actresses , as well as blond jokes from the Times itself .
Ben Goldacre , who writes the “ Bad Science ” column for the UK's Guardian , speculates that science stories come in three varieties : the wacky story , the breakthrough story , and the scare story .
Most widely reported studies on gender seem to fall into the wacky category — the supposed innate preference for pink is one of them — and their media strength is that they tend to support existing stereotypes of women , reassuring readers that social stereotypes do , in fact , reflect reality .
We can't put all the blame on mainstream media , of course .
Scientists are part of the same culture as the rest of us , and they too have biases that shape their hypotheses and interpretations .
The scientific community can also be as fad - driven as popular culture , creating a climate in which many researchers simultaneously geek out over one specific theory while competing ideas get lost or abandoned .
So let 's learn how to read between the lines of these dubious articles .
Next time you see an article reporting that women are happiest when they 're picking up their man 's dirty socks , try asking these questions :
1 Do the Conclusions Fit a Little Too Well With Cultural Stereotypes ?
Science has the capacity to surprise and amaze us , but sometimes it 's more satisfying when you can jump up and say , “ Yes !
I knew it all along ! ”
Which is why articles touting the awesomeness of traditional gender roles are an evergreen subject in the science pages .
A 2007 study from the American Society for Cancer Research journal Cancer Epidemiology Biomarkers and Prevention titled “ Physical activity and breast - cancer risk ” found fame in such headlines as the BBC 's “ Housework cuts breast - cancer risk . ”
That 's not to mention the 2006 study on housework and cancer in Canadian women , the 2005 study on housework and cancer in Chinese women , or the 2004 study … you get the idea .
[ See “ Home Is Where the Cardio Is , ” Bitch no . 27 ]
The reality ?
Being physically active seems to help prevent cancer , and the researchers behind the recent studies have been counting housework as physical activity .
Housework , sports , and active jobs all had significant effects in reducing cancer risk , and the authors think the key may be frequent , low - impact exercise .
An author on several of these studies , Christine Friedenreich , told the Calgary Herald that in past studies , researchers counted jobs like construction work as physical activity , but not housework — and it turns out that domestic tasks are , duh , hard work .
This means that many women are getting more exercise than they ( or their doctors ) had realized .
That should be good news for them — but instead , the message imparted by the news reports is , “ Get back into the kitchen !
That 's all the exercise you need ! ”
It 's worth noting that one of the study 's sponsors , Cancer Research UK , answered questions about the 2006 study on its website , pointing out that for many of the older women in the study group , housework was their primary form of exercise .
The organization went on to address charges of sexism directly , making sure to mention a related 2006 study that found housework cuts the risk of bowel cancer for both men and women , concluding , “ There 's absolutely no excuse for men to dodge the dusting ! ”
2 Does the Study Agree With the Headline ?
Behind every junk - science headline is a scientific journal article .
Sometimes the university or organization that was home to the study sends out a press release to mainstream outlets , hoping for attention ; other times , journalists simply scan the abstracts of academic journals for newsworthy fodder .
Chances are a story will make the papers if it 's got some kind of hook — weird ( like the idea that housework has curative properties ) , controversial ( like claims that men are smarter than women ) , can be illustrated with bikini babes ( like the dumb - blond study ) , etc .
Especially for online news outlets , these hooks are valuable because they make good linkbait : the kind of thing they hope you 'll forward to friends or post on your blog .
The London Times probably had n't read the full study titled “ Prejudice against women in male - congenial environments : Perceptions of gender - role congruity in leadership ” when they summarized it under the headline “ Office Queen Bees Hold Back Women 's Careers ” in a 2006 article .
The paper 's charge — that “ women bosses are significantly more likely than men to discriminate against female employees ” — may indeed have surprised the study 's authors .
The actual study went something like this : Participants were n't put in a boss 's role , but an observer's .
They read a purposely vague description of a manager who was being considered for promotion and were asked to imagine how qualified the candidate was , and whether he or she was likely to succeed .
The study made a number of interesting points that the Times could easily have reported on — for instance , that female managers were judged to have both very masculine and very feminine traits , possibly in an attempt to reconcile their gender with the traditionally masculine - associated role of leadership .
Both the male and female participants were optimistic about the male manager 's success , but not about the woman 's ( except when she worked in a female - dominated industry ) .
Sounds pretty realistic , right ?
The researchers thought so too .
They write , “ Participants ' predictions about the [ female ] candidate 's future salary … mirrored the fact that women earn less money in the same position [ than ] men do in real life . ”
So where are those “ queen bees ” that the Times so gleefully name - checked ?
Exactly .
It 's not difficult to track down the science behind the story .
Look for the names of the researchers , the journal their work appeared in , and ( if you 're lucky ) the title of the article .
Type whatever info you 've got into Google Scholar ( www.scholar.google.com), and soon you 'll be looking at an abstract for the paper .
Scientific journals are usually locked behind paywalls , unfortunately , so you may need to call upon a pal at a university for access to the entire study .
3 Can You Spot the Double Standard ?
Whether it 's lions fathering all the cubs in their pride , or human males getting a pass for cheating on their girlfriends , males sleeping around rarely make the news — it 's the natural order , after all — unless the article is happily touting the genetic advantages a male gets from spreading his dna around .
But when female cheetahs were found to do the same by a Zoological Society of London study , the study 's words about “ promiscuous ” felines were quickly outnumbered in Google 's index by the phrase , “ cheetahs are sluts ! ”
Study author Dada Gottelli was quoted thus : “ Mating with more than one male poses a serious threat to females , increasing the risk of exposure to parasites and diseases .
Females also have to travel over large distances to find new mates , making them more vulnerable to predation . ”
Sounds like a cheetah - specific version of certain sex -ed curricula :
Do n't sleep around , girls , or you 'll catch lots of diseases and the male cheetahs wo n't respect you in the morning .
Male cheetahs , however , are n't “ promiscuous ” — they 're creating a healthier gene pool .
Not too surprising , then , that most of the coverage glossed over the evolutionary benefit of promiscuity for both male and female cheetahs :
Multiple cubs by multiple cub daddies increases the likelihood of genetic diversity — a definite positive for a threatened species .
Furthermore , the study noted that the rates of infanticide in cheetahs are much lower than in other big - cat populations , likely because male competitors do n't know which offspring might be theirs .
But why let the facts slow down a good headline ?
In a human example of a double - standard story , women were found to be “ worse oglers ” than men , according to the Sydney Morning Herald summary of a study published in the journal Hormones and Behavior .
( The Herald inexplicably illustrated its story with headshots of Sharon Stone and Mr. Bean ) .
What does that even mean , you ask ?
When researchers showed “ sexual stimuli ” ( read : Internet porn ) to heterosexual men and women , they expected women to look more at faces and men to look more at genitals .
The newspaper reported that , in fact , “ almost the reverse was true . ”
Actually , the study says that men looked at women 's faces more than women did , and men and women looked with equal frequency at the pictured genitals ; women who were n't on oral contraceptives looked slightly more .
So where did that headline come from ?
The study authors did n't originate the “ worse oglers ” language ; they even warn in the study that they can't say why subjects ' gazes lingered where they did , or whether they were turned on as they looked .
So it 's not fair to say that the study was about “ ogling , ” a word that suggests that looking is lustful and perhaps inappropriate .
To say that women are “ worse ” at ogling , we have to believe , first , that ogling is bad , and second , that men do it at some normal , baseline level that women are exceeding .
The judgmental language makes it sound like women in the study were indulging a bad habit .
Right there in the headline is the double standard :
If men ogle , it 's normal , but when women do it , they 're “ worse . ”
4 Is There Another Conclusion That Would be Just as Valid ?
Sometimes a news story is an accurate representation of the scientists ' conclusions , but the scientists ' conclusions do n't follow their results .
Take this 2005 BBC headline : “ Men Cleverer Than Women . ”
The study , at the time of the headline yet to be published in the British Journal of Psychology , claims that as iq scores rise , the gender gap widens , with 5.5 men for every woman scoring at the “ genius ” level of 155 or higher on iq tests .
That 's all the evidence the authors ( one of whom , Richard Lynn , has published similar studies on racial differences in iq ) give to support their claim .
But there is another , equally powerful explanation that 's been considered for years before this study came along : iq tests — which do n't measure intelligence directly , but try to approximate it — have a wealth of gender , racial , and cultural biases .
In a 2000 survey of sex differences in intelligence called “ The Smarter Sex : A Critical Review of Sex Differences in Intelligence , ” in the Educational Psychology Review , Diane Halpern and Mary LaMay write that Lynn 's approach “ rests on the belief that the test of intelligence is really measuring what psychologists mean by intelligence , and that it is doing so in a way that will yield a fair assessment for males and females — two assumptions that may not be justified . ”
Statistically , men do outperform women on certain types of questions , but the reverse is also true ; test designers use this fact to calibrate iq tests , balancing male - biased with female - biased questions so that men and women average the same scores on the same test .
Addressing Lynn 's research directly , Halpern and LaMay say , “ Using data from tests that are designed to yield no sex differences to argue for a difference is psychometric nonsense . ”
Either the tests were miscalibrated ( and thus biased ) or Lynn 's results are a fluke : Probably the latter , since other studies ( like a 1995 study on a population similar to Lynn 's , done by scientists at the Flinders University of South Australia and published in the British Journal of Clinical Psychology ) found no difference between males and females .
So why even report the latest study from this obviously biased researcher ?
Perhaps it 's reassuring to believe that sexism is n't sexism , it 's science ; that the status quo reflects some kind of natural order ; and that anyone who claims otherwise is a whiner .
Or perhaps Lynn 's studies make the news because he 's sort of a one - man show of bunk science — after all , this is the same guy who claims that African - Americans have higher iqs than Africans because they have Caucasian genes that make them smarter .
Then there are the stories that point the finger at feminism for a variety of historical incidents and ills .
The 2007 Boston Globe story titled “ Stone Age Feminism ?
Females joining hunt may explain Neanderthals ' end ” is one of these .
The supporting study , authored by archaeologists Steven Kuhn and Mary Stiner , turned on the hypothesis that Neanderthal women participated in hunting alongside Neanderthal men .
The dangers of hunting — among them , getting stomped and gored by various beasts — along with the fact that many cavegals ' lives were cut short before they could produce baby Neanderthals , meant that the breeding population dwindled and the species died out .
But the evidence for this “ stone age feminism ” was n't evidence at all .
The hypothesis that the women hunted alongside the men was developed because the study 's authors found no clues suggesting that Neanderthal women were , well , homemakers — no grinding stones and bone needles that would signal a traditional division of labor in the species .
So is it possible that male and female Neanderthals hunted together successfully , and the species dwindled for some other , totally unrelated reason ?
And , for that matter , why not hypothesize that coed hunting parties actually contributed to the Neanderthals ' longevity ?
More than 100,000 years of existence is nothing to sneeze at , after all .
Why jump to the conclusion that feminism ruins everything ?
Ah , yes : because it's a story that will sell papers .
5 Is the Study Even Science ?
In his “ Bad Science ” column , Goldacre reminds us that so - called studies may not have studied anything at all .
A hair - removal cream company once asked Goldacre to come up with a formula calculating which celebrity had the sexiest walk .
“ We know what results we want to achieve , ” they told him , naming celebrities with shapely legs whose high - ranking walks could move units of their product .
When Goldacre refused , another scientist supplied the company with a formula , thinking it would be used as a joke .
The company 's press release became an article in the Telegraph , crediting a nonexistent “ team of Cambridge mathematicians ” and with no mention of the so - called study 's actual source .
Lesson learned :
If you can't find the source article , it may not actually exist .
In another example of non-science , BBC News studiously reported in late 2007 that humor “ comes from testosterone . ”
The article ?
Based on a British Medical Journal study recording the casual responses of passers - by to a unicyclist .
The article notes that little boys had more “ aggressive ” responses to the unicyclist ( trying to knock him over ) and young men made the most jokes — typically an unimaginative variant of “ Lost your wheel ? ” — with elderly men's jokes being less hostile ( “ Does it crush your bollocks , mate ? ” ) .
The article also featured a graphic showing the ebb of testosterone in men over time ; since young men have the most testosterone and made the greatest number of jokes , the author concludes , testosterone must be the source of humor .
If all you read was the BBC piece , you might think that there 's a clutch of professors somewhere in England taking this theory seriously .
In fact , the deliberately hilarious study was published in the BMJ's Christmas issue , famous for its joke articles .
( A study from the previous year was titled “ Surgeons are taller and more handsome than physicians ” and used a photo of George Clooney as a control . )
The fact that the BBC did n't pick up on the joke speaks volumes about the mainstream media 's unceasing appetite for gendered potshots .
How many of us would really be surprised to see a “ legitimate ” report linking testosterone and humor ?
Would it look anything like the 2005 report from Stirling and St. Andrews universities in the UK that claims testosterone causes women to be “ career - driven ” like men ?
The humbling take - home message from these studies is that traditionally masculine traits still belong to men— even when women share them .
Although there is an element of humor in how wrong the news media can get science , the trend is n't a harmless one .
While plenty of smart people question biased headlines of all stripes , casual readers — particularly young ones — are likely to skim the stories and tuck them away in the pocket of their brains where stereotypes are kept .
It 's bad enough when we see images of women as passive , petty , dumb , or slutty in fiction or advertisements , but stereotypes that come with the lofty stamp of science have the air of being , well , factual .
After all , if women are biologically wired to be weak or catty or dumb or humorless , then there 's nothing wrong with writing consistently airheaded female movie and tv characters , dismissing women in positions of power as “ bitches ” or “ too emotional , ” or claiming that institutional sexism does n't exist , women just are n't smart enough to be ceos , grand masters , or surgeons .
These studies reassure people that media images reflect reality , that society reflects biology , and that nothing can or should be changed .
Perhaps we should just take solace in one final study , released by the American Psychological Association in 2005 but picked up by very few mainstream sources .
The title ?
“ Men and women found more similar than portrayed in popular media . ”
Counterattack : Obama camp calls out Clinton over tax returns Nick Juliano
Published : Wednesday March 5 , 2008
|
Print This Email This Emerging from its bruising at the hands of Hillary Clinton 's " kitchen sink " strategy , the Barack Obama campaign came out swinging Wednesday with sharp questions about what could be hiding in Hillary Clinton 's unreleased tax returns .
After being stung with losses in Ohio , Texas and Rhode Island the night before , Obama held onto his lead in the delegate count , and the Illinois senator stressed that the math was still on his side .
Meanwhile , his campaign pushed its newest line of attack : Clinton 's claim that she is the more vetted candidate is hogwash because of the unanswered questions in her tax returns .
" Senator Clinton has also claimed that she is too busy to release her tax returns .
Given the fact she is able to loan her campaign $ 5 million , you would think the Clintons would be able to hire an accountant , " read an Obama campaign " memo " sent to reporters Wednesday .
" The reality is that she wants to keep this information hidden from voters .
The people of Wyoming , Mississippi , Pennsylvania and the rest of the country should wonder why . "
Obama advisers continued to raise questions on a press conference call Wednesday afternoon .
Their strategy seemed to echo the Clinton team 's gambit in the days before the most recent elections to chide reporters into going after her opponent .
" What 's good for the goose is good for the gander , " Obama strategist David Axelrod said kicking off Wednesday 's campaign call .
Axelrod contended that Clinton had faced less skepticism during the 2008 campaign than Obama had , which he noted was at odds with her reputation for secrecy .
" This has been a pattern , she 's been a habitual non-discloser on this and other issues , " such as records from the White House during her time as First Lady , which have not been released by the Clinton presidential library .
" We 're going to ask you guys to do your jobs , " Axelrod chided the reporters listening in .
As Axelrod was talking to reporters , Clinton communications director Howard Wolfson fired back in his own e-mail to reporters .
" Faced with many legitimate questions about Senator Obama 's long - time relationship with indicted political fixer Tony Rezko , the Obama campaign has chosen to lash out at Senator Clinton , " Wolfson said , returning to questions the Clinton campaign harped on leading up to Tuesday 's vote about Obama 's relationship with the indicted real estate developer .
DEVELOPING ...
What a thing to wake up to .
Alright , RIAA , think about it for five seconds :
FACT : Like Napster before it , OiNK 's database was the most comprehensive , convenient , high - quality source of digital music on the Internet .
And if you build it , they will come - the site has thousands upon thousands of users , every one a music lover looking for a great way to find albums new and old .
Also like Napster before it , the industry has chosen to completely blow a tremendous opportunity by destroying an obviously successful system rather than simply figuring out a way to monetize it and rake in profits .
FACT : There is no one - stop location on the Internet where you can pay $ 10 and download a 192 + kbps DRM - free MP3 of any album you want - which you can do on OiNK for free .
Essentially , the music industry is asking consumers to ignore the gentleman in the street handing out fresh Hebrew National hot dogs ( delicious , amirite ) and pretending that the gross chunks of meat that 've been simmering in 7 - Eleven all week are just as good !
Why should anyone pay for an inferior product when what they actually want is just sitting there ?
FACT : DRM - laden music does n't work .
Subscription services do n't work .
Why ?
The same people who buy the most music are also its biggest promoters , making tapes or burning CDs for their friends and now , passing around MP3s .
If you can't do this , it 's no fun - how can you convince your friend to go to a show with you ?
Music is communal .
Sites like OiNK are the ultimate example of this .
Which leads to ... FACT : Career sales trump one - hit - wonders .
Touring and merch trumps album sales .
How does this happen ?
AWARENESS .
How do people become aware of bands in a way that inclines them to make a connection and develop loyalty in the iPod era ?
I 'll let you guys figure that one out , but it 's not happening on MTV or ClearChannel - owned radio stations .
FACT : A download is not a lost sale .
The kids with the most MP3s are hoarding them because they can , not because they 're trying to save money on paying for CDs .
No one is ever going to go out and buy 5 - 10 albums a week , but that 's about how many a good chunk of us download .
FACT : Promotion costs money .
Record companies routinely lose tons of cash on bands that sell 100 k and call it a career .
During the late '90s heyday , they could offset this with the Backstreet Boys , but that was never going to last .
FACT : Promoting your album by letting people listen to it online so they can go out and buy it or see you on tour , and letting buzz build organically through word of mouth ?
FREE .FACT : The audience that pirates albums is often a totally different market than the one that still buys CDs .
Downloading is never going to cannibalize CD sales - they 're two seperate entities , and the industry should be supplying quality products to both markets , not constraining one while the other dies a miserable death .
In short , fellas , the industry is moving in a direction where bands are going to pull a Radiohead and just sell the shit themselves because the industry seems unwilling or incapable of doing the absolute bare minimum of offering their entire catalogs in a quality file format at a reasonable place in a one - stop shop .
Because there 's been some confusion about my intentions with this post , I 'll make them perfectly clear : I 'm not condoning piracy or even promoting OiNK , really .
What I 'm saying is , the lack of a legitimate , legal service with the same quality , ease and variety of OiNK is a huge , gaping hole in the music business right now and if anyone wants to make money on a recording ever again , you guys had better fill it the hell up .

NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - U.S. mortgage applications dipped last week , reflecting lower demand for home loan refinancing as interest rates surged to their highest since October , an industry group said on Wednesday .

U.S. mortgage applications dipped last week , reflecting lower demand for home loan refinancing as interest rates surged to their highest since October , an industry group said on Wednesday .
REUTERS / Richard Clement
The Mortgage Bankers Association said its seasonally adjusted index of mortgage applications , which includes both purchase and refinance loans , for the week ended March 7 fell 1.9 percent to 671.7 .
The U.S. housing market is suffering one of the worst downturns in history .
Last week ’s drop in demand may indicate what is in store for the hard - hit sector this spring , which is the peak home - buying season .
Borrowing costs on 30 - year fixed - rate mortgages , excluding fees , averaged 6.37 percent , up 0.39 percentage point from the previous week , the highest since the week ended October 12 , 2007 when it hit 6.40 percent .
Fixed 15 - year mortgage rates averaged 5.72 percent , up from 5.26 percent the previous week .
Rates on one - year adjustable - rate mortgages ( ARMs ) increased to 6.72 percent from 5.83 percent .
Overall mortgage applications last week were 2.7 percent below their year - ago level .
The four - week moving average of mortgage applications , which smooths the volatile weekly figures , was down 12.1 percent to 711.1 .
The MBA ’s seasonally adjusted purchase index rose 1.6 percent to 368.8 .
The index came in below its year - earlier level of 414.3 , a drop of 11.0 percent .
The group ’s seasonally adjusted index of refinancing applications decreased 4.7 percent to 2,448.2 .
The index was up 5.9 percent from its year - ago level of 2,312.2 .
Consumers seeking to refinance their existing home loans tend to be highly sensitive to shifts in interest rates .
The refinance share of applications decreased to 50.6 percent from 52.4 percent the previous week .
The ARM share of activity decreased to 15.5 percent , down from 17.3 percent the previous week .
In my sourer moments I find myself persuaded that Bertie Wooster 's verdict on aunts also applies to politicians : " It is no use telling me that there are bad aunts and good aunts .
At the core , they are all alike .
Sooner or later , out pops the cloven hoof . "
Never is this more the case than during a Presidential campaign .
The sheer ghastliness of the front - runners is something to behold .
Or not , as the case may be .
Try as I might , for instance , I find it hard to warm to Hillary Clinton even as I acknowledge that some of the hysteria surrounding her is absurdly overblown .
And yet , there 's something to it too .
This story in today 's Washington Post about Hillary 's struggle to appeal to male voters wo n't have pleased the campaign much , ( it 's pretty anecdotal for one , and , for another , she is doing slightly better with white men than might be imagined ) .
Still , it 's undeniable that there 's something about Hillary 's demeanour that puts people off .
It 's not as simple as her being a woman , though that doubtless disqualifies her in some folks ' eyes , but that she 's a particular type of woman .
As always Wodehouse is an invaluable guide to matters of the heart .
Dipping into The Inimitable Jeeves last night , it struck me that , for a certain kind of chap , Hillary is the Honoria Glossop of the presidential campaign .
It 's not just that Hillary 's now infamous " cackle " is dangerously reminiscent of Miss Glossop 's laugh " that sounded like a squadron of cavalry charging across a tin bridge . "
No , it 's more that Hillary too often gives the impression of sharing Honoria 's horrifying determination to mould a fellow .
To wit , one can easily imagine Hillary addressing a chap , thus :
" I think " she said " I shall be able to make something of you , Bertie .
It is true yours has been a wasted life up to the present , but you are still young , and there is a lot of good in you ... It simply wants bringing out . "
But what if you do n't want bringing out ?
Opting out ai n't an option with this sort of girl .
And it gets worse .
When Hillary is n't being Honoria Glossop she 's reminding one of Florence Craye .
Now it 's true that Bertie was briefly infatuated with Miss Craye .
But that was until he engaged Jeeves and was persuaded that Miss Craye was a thoroughly unsuitable match ( See Carry On , Jeeves for the details ) .
As Bertie realised :
" The root of the trouble was that she was one of those intellectual girls , steeped to the gills in serious purpose , who are unable to see a male soul without wanting to get behind it and shove . "
Some of us might prefer to remain un - shoved .
Worse still , whenever a girl of Florence 's type engages one to stick one 's neck out for her - by , for instance , stealing a manuscript - she tries to persuade you that it 's really for your own advantage .
She risks nothing , of course , whereas your allowance is endangered .
But no , she will say :
" I wonder you can't appreciate the compliment I am paying you - trusting you like this "
Alas , I can just hear Hillary putting it like that .
Ca n't you ?
So , as you can see , fiancees can be as cloven - hoofed as aunts and politicians .
I admit that the Wodehouse vote may be too much of a microtrend or niche for even Mark Penn to have analysed but I 'm as confident as one can be that Mrs Clinton does poorly amongst Wodehouse fans .
Still , looking on the brighter side of things , since no - one could imagine Hillary suggesting that " the stars are God 's daisy chain " she is unlikely to be considered the Madeline Bassett of the primary season .
That would be Mike Huckabee .
The simmering conflict between the feds and states over new federal identification rules took an odd turn this week , with the feds seemingly now willing to accept all but outright rebels as part of their secure driver 's license alliance .
Montana governor Brian Schweitzer won a Real ID waiver without ever saying Montana would comply .
Photo : Montana Governor 's OfficeFirst , California wrote the Department of Homeland Security on Tuesday to say it has n't yet decided if they will comply with new federal identification rules , despite the fact they applied for and got an extension on complying until 2010 .
DHS has said for months that states had to agree to comply in the future to get that extension .
If they do n't get the extension , that state 's citizens could not get into federal buildings or escape pat - downs at the airport , unless they had a passport .
But within minutes of THREAT LEVEL showing a copy of the California letter to DHS , the government said California 's ambivalence was just fine .
Then Friday , DHS handed out a waiver to Montana , which did n't ask for one .
In January , Montana 's outspoken Democratic governor Brian Schweitzer called such extensions a " Faustian bargain " in a letter to other governors that urged collective rebellion .
Montana , along with civil liberties and small government groups , consider Real ID to be a de facto national identity card .
Other states are balking at the price tag , which originally started at some $ 20 billion , but after some changes to the rules , the government expects the change to only cost some $ 4 billion .
But Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff says he wants Real ID to be on track by the time he leaves his post , saying better identification cards will help prevent terrorism .
At issue are long - delayed rules that require states to collect , verify and store birth and marriage certificates for nearly all citizens who have state - issued licenses or identification cards .
That means almost every driver 's license holder will have to get certified documents and go into the DMV to get a new license – and many will likely have to go in more than once .
The rules also require the nation 's DMVs to interconnect their systems to prevent duplicate licenses , which privacy groups consider to be the equivalent of a national ID card .
In the years after 2010 , the federal government will begin rejecting non-Real ID driver 's licenses as valid for federal purposes , which could include buying over - counter cold medicine and getting into Social Security Administration buildings .
DHS granted the extension Friday after Montana 's Attorney General Mike McGrath sent a letter ( .pdf ) by fax outlining the security measures Montana has taken in regards to identification and asking not to be penalized come May 11 .
But McGrath noted that Montana 's legislature voted unanimously to reject Real ID and would not be convening again until next January .
DHS Assistant Secretary Stewart Baker wrote back that those measures sounded close enough to Real ID , but that the only way not to get punished is to ask for a waiver .
So Montana gets a waiver ( .pdf ) , Baker decided .
That 's an odd bit of generosity towards a state whose governor has been trying to foment a wide rebellion against Real ID , which he considers an infringement on states and citizens ' rights .
In a letter to other governors , Montana Governor Brian Schweitzer called the extension a " Faustian bargain . "
He 's also said sometimes it is best to tell the federal government to " go to hell . "
That leaves South Carolina and Maine as the only states that have n't asked for an extension .
The other states may actually be preparing to comply or just playing along in the hopes that Congress reverses the mandate .
New Hampshire asked for an extension in February , but DHS seemed to not like the tone of the letter , which , like Montana 's letter , noted that the state legislature prohibited joining in the Real ID program .
Friday 's letter suggests that New Hampshire could simply write a more polite letter talking about plans to increase driver 's license integrity by including , say , three - dimensional holograms , and DHS would accept it .
That leaves South Carolina and Maine , neither of which have decided whether to ask for an extension .
They have until March 31 to do so , but today 's news suggests that they might be able to save the stamp – DHS might have already put one in the mail .

The choice boils down to preference and how much effort you want to invest .
Below we 'll give you a general idea of what your options are .
PS2 Mod Chips PS2 Mod Chips are electronic chips that can be installed to your console .
Once installed , the PS2 mod chip will allow you to play your copied games .
There are two types of mod chips , solder and non-solder .
Both chip types require you to open your PS2 and make modifications .
Installing a mod chip is not difficult but your experience and skill with a soldering iron will determine just how easy or difficult it becomes .
We do n't provide a mod chip instructional guide , but you may want to visit this PS2 Mod Chip site for tips and more info .
We personally suggest the Modchipstore and PS2 Cover for getting PS2 mod chips .
Be aware that any modifications to your PS2 console voids your warranty .
PS2 Boot Discs Boot Discs are the perfect solution for those gamers who do not want to make modifications on their consoles .
Unlike using mod chips where you are required to open your console and install them , boot discs are much simpler to use and do not require you to modify your console at all .
Using boot discs you place them into your PS2 game console before inserting and using your game copies .
On top of being a much simpler method as opposed to installing a mod chip , using boot discs will not void your PS2 warranty like installing a mod chip will .
Again we suggest the Modchipstore or PS2 Cover .
PS2 Cover also has the Flip Top Cover which makes changing discs quick and easy !

Imagine a world where there are no buttons , no links and all you need is to just roll over your mouse to navigate .
You must be saying , c'mon have you gone crazy ?
Well , I 'd have said the same until I found this page ( its flash based so I do expect you have the plugin installed ) .
The URL is http://dontclick.it .
It claims to be an institute of interactive research .
The catch here is that the navigation is done in a different way than the traditional clicking on links or buttons .
The home page reads :
And it is actually fun inside .
The navigation is as smooth as I donno - core animation ( ala Leopard ) .
Its a new experience .
So , can we do away with the mouse buttons already ???
I ask too many questions .
Tom Cruise , John Travolta , Kirstie Alley , Jenna Elfman " ... let 's face it , we 're not surprised when obviously unstable , closeted , or just plain untalented actors and actresses start blathering on about Xenu and cleansing their Engrams .
Hollywood types can be pretty flaky .
But while some of the famous faces of Scientology make sense , there are a surprising amount of celebs that honestly , we expected better from .

Why You Would n't Expect Him To Be a Scientologist :
It breaks our hearts , honestly .
Lee 's a hilarious actor , and can deliver the driest one - liners around .
He seems like a genuinely intelligent and funny guy .
Hell , dude was a pro skateboarder .
How cool is that ?
Knowing he thinks alien ghosts infected the planet with negative energy can't help but be a little disappointing coming from a guy who can execute a flawless nosegrind .
Connections : Lee ' My Name is Earl and Mallrats co-star Ethan Suplee is n't just a Scientologist ; he ' also married to the sister of second generation Scientologist / certified whack job Juliette Lewis , who starred in that awful " retarded people in love " movie The Other Sister with close friend and fellow Scientologist Giovani Ribisi .
Lewis and her father guest - starred on My Name is Earl in 2006 , which must have made for a really fun day on the set for anyone who needed an E - meter reading .
Presumed Operating Thetan Level : One ( is able to " audit " self , has knowledge of matter , energy , space and time above that of regular humans )
#9 : LEAH REMINI : SCIENTOLOGIST
Best Known For :
The shrill , but perplexingly attractive wife of human - sized sandwich receptacle Kevin James on King of Queens .
Why You Would n't Expect Her To Be a Scientologist : Having watched King of Queens , we 're more than a little surprised that they actually wanted her .
You can almost picture her at some Scientologist retreat , nagging away at John Travolta for fucking up his tone scale .
That said , she ' earned her Hubbard stripes , having been a vocal supporter of Scientology in the past .
Remini gave the Church of Scientology a loving , 40 - minute tongue - bath when she appeared on Janeane Garafolo ' short - lived Air America show Majority Report to plug some manner of Scientology - endorsed " detoxification cure " nonsense .
More surprising : that airwaves could handle that much brittle , sarcastic estrogen occupying the same space and not implode like a black hole .
Connections : According to Remini , she was the first person to have seen Suri Cruise in person , even though she ' never been known to be on even " nodding acquaintance " terms with Tom or Katie .
She did not comment about whether Tom Cruise has since eaten the baby .
Presumed Operatng Thetan Level : Three or Four ( is able to regulate her " meat body " for thetans , and can rid self of the " effects of drugs on the spirit " )
#8 : BECK : SCIENTOLOGIST
Best Known For : being in possession of two turntables and a microphone ; being able to identify a good drum break ; being the hippest white boy in the room .
Why You Would n't Expect Him To Be a Scientologist : The Reverend of Electric Soul , genre - hopping creator of esoteric and complex albums : does n't Beck seem a bit too ironically hip to believe in something as goddamn ridiculous as Scientology without putting quote gestures around it and talking about it through a voice synthesizer first ?
While he never came out about his beliefs until 2005 , Beck is actually a second generation Scientologist ; there are a multitude of conspiracy theories online that both he and his record label tried to conceal his Scientologist leanings for most of his career .
Clearly the label did n't want anybody to think that Beck , a 100 - pound Fraggle who writes acoustic guitar raps about plastic eyeballs spraypainting vegetables , was weird or anything .
Connections : Beck ' mother was the midwife for the birth of pasty - faced actor / second generation Scientologist Giovanni Ribisi ( The Mod Squad , Saving Private Ryan ) and his twin sister Marissa .
Beck is now married to Marissa , the mother of his son " Cosimo Henri . "
As of this writing they 're expecting another one , who'll probably get an even more retarded name , if that 's possible .
( See also : Jason Lee ' son " Pilot Inspektor Riesgraf Lee " ; " Suri " ) Presumed Operating Thetan Level : 7 or higher ( able to audit self and " address the primary cause of amnesia " ; according to Wikipedia , graduation from this level requires a $ 100,000 payment )
#7 : GRETA VAN SUSTEREN : SCIENTOLOGIST
Best Known For : being a legal expert for CNN and FOX ; covered the O.J. Simpson trial ; host of Burden of Proof and On the Record with Greta Van Susteren .
Why You Would n't Expect Her To Be a Scientologist :
Well , she has an education , for one , and by all accounts was a pretty good lawyer .
Second , she ' on the FOX network , which tends to put tree - huggin ' Democrats ahead of Scientology 's foe , the cursed space pirate Xenu , on their Most Wanted Lists .
Connections : Her husband John " Bhopal " Coale represented Lisa Marie Presley ( Scientologist ) in her divorce .
Lisa Marie is of course the daughter of Elvis Presley , who enjoyed eating ham a lot ( below ; ham 's religious affiliations unknown ) .
The law firm owned by Van Susteren and her husband has also brought a lawsuit against Wellspring , a cult recovery facility , for reasons unclear , since Scientology is so obviously not a cult at all .
( Note to Scientologists : please do n't sue . )
Presumed Operating Thetan Level :
We 're not sure about Van Susteren , but her husband is a level 8 , the highest level currently available ( can only be achieved while on a boat at sea ; seriously , we are not making this shit up ) .
#6 : DANNY MASTERSON : SCIENTOLOGIST
Best Known For : his Jewfro'd stoner Hyde character from That ' 70s Show .
Why You Would n't Expect Him To Be a Scientologist : Masterson played the only bearable character in a show consisting of smirking human skeleton Topher Grace , face - punchable douchebag Ashton Kutcher and functionally retarded ethnic stereotype ( and Lindsey Lohan despoiler ) Wilmer Valderrama .
Masterson ' the only guy in that cast that we do n't actually want to strangle to death , and that 's taking into account that he probably spends at least two embarrassing hours a day " sideburn - grooming . "
But , alas , it 's true .
In his own words : " I have always been in Scientology my entire life .
Each service in Scientology is something I have added to my toolbox of data for living . "
In December 2005 , Masterson helped promote the gala opening of Scientology 's controversial " Psychiatry : An Industry of Death " Museum .
You know , for the kids .
Connections : Laura Prepon , the red - headed masturbatory aid from That '70s Show , was brought into the Scientology fold by Danny and his brother Christopher ( troublemaker Francis on Malcolm in the Middle ) after Laura and Christopher started dating .
Frankie Muniz has so far not been asked to participate , putting his Thetans at considerable risk .
On the plus side , Frankie Muniz has not been asked to participate in something .
Presumed Operating Thetan Level : unknown ; can perhaps be found in his high - tech data toolbox

#5 : ISAAC HAYES : SCIENTOLOGIST
Best Known For :
The theme song to Shaft ; playing Chef on South Park .
Why You Would n't Expect Him To Be a Scientologist : Who ' a sex machine to all the chicks ?
Not Isaac
Hayes , unless they 're at least level 4 .
Okay , this entry 's sort of cheating , since after Hayes ' public dismissal from South Park last year over the show 's offensive portrayal of Scientology , pretty much everyone 's aware of Isaac 's Xenu - battling ways at this point .
Still , though : motherfucker wrote the theme song from Shaft !
Come on !
Rumors abound that Hayes was forced by Scientology overlords to quit South Park after the infamous " In the Closet " episode .
Whew !
Good thing it 's not a cult , though !
( Do n't sue . )
Connections :
The other three black Scientologists , who remain shrouded in mystery .
Presumed Operating Thetan Level : the baddest mother -- " Shut your mouth ! " " I 'm just talkin ' ' bout Operatin ' Thetan Levels ! "
" Then we can dig it . "
#4 : BART SIMPSON : SCIENTOLOGIST
Best Known For : Okay , it ' technically Nancy Cartwright , the voice of Bart Simpson Why You Would n't Expect Her To Be a Scientologist :
Do n't have an Engram , man !
Of all people to believe in crazy shit L.Ron Hubbard cooked up on a sailboat while knocking back Coronas , we would n't have pegged the voice of Bart Simpson .
Cartwright says she learned about Scientology in her acting class in 1988 .
It 's frankly mind - boggling that she could have somehow heard about this in a place where people who can't act get in a group to act like trees and believe anything their teacher tells them .
Connections : Mr. Burns ?
Bumble Bee Man ? LENNY ????
Presumed Thetan Level : Four ( self - " auditing " ; gives one the ability to talk like an eight - year - old boy and produce catchphrases that wind up on t- shirts )
#3 : SONNY BONO : SCIENTOLOGIST
Best Known For : being Cher ' ex-husband ; being a Republican congressman ; not wearing a helmet when skiing Why You Would n't Expect Him To Be a Scientologist : Back in the Sonny & Cher days , you totally would have pegged the diminutive , fringe - wearing Bono as the sort of vacuous , henpecked sucker to get roped into a fruity Hollywood cult .
But after he went all Catholic Republican in the '90s , he allegedly put all that hippy nonsense behind him .
However , several sources claim he kept close ties with the Scientologist Church until his death , consulting members frequently on both personal and political issues .
That ' reassuring .
He was also quoted as saying : " My only sorrow is that L. Ron Hubbard left before I could thank him for my new life , " in a full - page ad featured in several newspapers after Elron 's death .
Connections : Widow and replacement congresswoman Mary Bono has also taken Scientology courses .
Bono was introduced to Scientology by Mimi Rogers ( who was also responsible for inducting football player John Brodie , and of course , Tom Cruise . )
Presumed Thetan Level : Slalom
#2 : JERRY SEINFELD : SCIENTOLOGIST
Best Known For : Seinfeld ; questioning the " deal " with airline peanuts ; drilling a minor Why You Would n't Expect Him To Be a Scientologist : Cynical Jewish comedians are better known for having issues with their mothers and getting their laundry back from the drycleaners than worrying why the Galactic Confederacy blew up a bunch of volcanoes , dooming us all to centuries of terror .
Also : he 's Jewish .
We 're pretty sure religion does n't advertise two - for - one specials .
Still , while Seinfeld claims not to be an adherent , " I took a couple courses a number of years ago that I thought were fabulous .
I learned a lot and I had a good experience with it ...
" I think the stuff I learned there really did help me a lot . "
He ' also dismissed articles questioning Scientology as " poor journalism . "
Let that be a lesson to journalists everywhere , from the mouth of Seinfeld himself : stop questioning things .
Connections : Nothing we can prove .
But Michael " N - Word " Richards could probably use whatever well - funded stealth Scientology PR team 's keeping Tom Cruise 's career afloat right about now .
Presumed Thetan Level : What ' the deal with all these levels ?
Has anyone else noticed this ?
#1 : CHARLES MANSON : SCIENTOLOGIST
Best Known For : viciously murdering people , ordering people to viciously murder other people ; carving swastikas into his forehead Why You Would n't Expect Him To Be a Scientologist :
One of the biggest lunatics in American history is actually precisely who we'd expect to be down on the ground with psychotic theories about aliens and immortal spirits .
But here ' the kicker : Manson took over 150 hours of Scientology courses , rejected it as too crazy , and then went on to murder a whole bunch of people .
We 're just saying .
Connections : Peter " Big Gunner " Skinner , the guard he supplies cigarettes to so he can avoid getting raped all the time .
Presumed Thetan Level : Batshit insane , but knows total bullshit when he sees it .

The following correction was printed in the Observer 's For the record column , Sunday December 9 2007
In the article below we said the electricity generating capacity for Britain totalled 12 billion watts .
The actual figure is closer to the 74 billion watts , generated annually by the UK 's power stations .
Additionally , the photograph accompanying this article shows solar panels used in Munich that employ a technology unrelated to the concentrated solar power technology discussed in this article .
Europe is considering plans to spend more than £ 5bn on a string of giant solar power stations along the Mediterranean desert shores of northern Africa and the Middle East .
More than a hundred of the generators , each fitted with thousands of huge mirrors , would generate electricity to be transmitted by undersea cable to Europe and then distributed across the continent to European Union member nations , including Britain .
Billions of watts of power could be generated this way , enough to provide Europe with a sixth of its electricity needs and to allow it to make significant cuts in its carbon emissions .
At the same time , the stations would be used as desalination plants to provide desert countries with desperately needed supplies of fresh water .
Last week Prince Hassan bin Talal of Jordan presented details of the scheme - named Desertec - to the European Parliament .
' Countries with deserts , countries with high energy demand , and countries with technology competence must co-operate , ' he told MEPs .
The project has been developed by the Trans - Mediterranean Renewable Energy Corporation and is supported by engineers and politicians in Europe as well as Morocco , Algeria , Libya , Jordan and other nations in the Middle East and Africa .
Europe would provide initial funds for developing the solar technology that will be needed to run plants as well as money for constructing prototype stations .
After that , banks and financial institutions , as well as national governments , would take over the construction programme , which could cost more than £ 200 bn over the next 30 years .
' We do n't make enough use of deserts , ' said physicist Gerhard Knies , co-founder of the scheme .
' The sun beats down on them mercilessly during the day and heats the ground to tremendous temperatures .
Then at night that heat is radiated back into the atmosphere .
In other words , it is completely wasted .
We need to stop that waste and exploit the vast amounts of energy that the sun beams down to us . '
Scientists estimate that sunlight could provide 10,000 times the amount of energy needed to fulfil humanity 's current energy needs .
Transforming that solar radiation into a form to be exploited by humanity is difficult , however .
One solution proposed by the scheme 's engineers is to use large areas of land on which to construct their solar plants .
In Europe , land is costly .
But in nations such as Morocco , Algeria , and Libya it is cheap , mainly because they are scorched by the sun .
The project aims to exploit that cheap land by use of a technique known as ' concentrating solar power ' .
A CSP station consists of banks of several hundred giant mirrors that cover large areas of land , around a square kilometre .
Each mirror 's position can be carefully controlled to focus the sun 's rays onto a central metal pillar that is filled with water .
Prototype stations using this technique have already been tested in Spain and Algeria .
Once the sun 's rays are focused on the pillar , temperatures inside start to soar to 800C .
The water inside the pillar is vaporised into superhot steam which is channelled off and used to drive turbines which in turn generate electricity .
' It is proven technology , ' added Knies .
' We have shown it works in our test plants . '
Only small stations have been tested , but soon plants capable of generating 100 megawatts of power could be built , enough to provide the needs of a town .
The Desertec project envisages a ring of a thousand of these stations being built along the coast of northern Africa and round into the Mediterranean coast of the Middle East .
In this way up to 100 billion watts of power could be generated : two thirds of it would be kept for local needs , the rest - around 30 billion watts - would be exported to Europe .
An idea of how much power this represents is revealed through Britain 's electricity generating capacity , which totals 12 billion watts .
But there is an added twist to the system .
The superheated steam , after it has driven the plant 's turbines , would then be piped through tanks of sea water which would boil and evaporate .
Steam from the sea water would piped away and condensed and stored as fresh water .
' Essentially you get electricity and fresh water , ' said Knies .
' The latter is going to be crucial for developing countries round the southern Mediterranean and in north Africa .
Their populations are rising rapidly , but they have limited supplies of fresh water .
Our solar power plants will not only generate electricity that they can sell to Europe , they will supply drinkable water that will sustain their thirsty populations . '
There are drawbacks , however .
At present electricity generated this way would cost around 15 - 20 eurocents ( 11 to 14p ) a kilowatt - hour - almost twice the cost of power generated by coal .
At such prices , few nations would be tempted to switch to solar .
' Unless it is extremely cheap , it wo n't stop people using easy - to - get fossil fuels , ' John Gibbins , an energy engineer at Imperial College London , told Nature magazine last week .
However , Desertec 's backers say improvements over the next decade should bring the cost of power from its plants to less than 10 eurocents a kilowatt - hour , making it competitive with traditionally generated power .
Other critics say the the plants would be built in several unstable states which could cut their supplies to Europe .
Again , Knies dismisses the danger .
' It 's not like oil .
Solar power is gone once it hits your mirrors .
It would simply be lost income . '
The European Parliament has asked Desertec to propose short - term demonstration projects .
Ever been touched by a storyline element in a Mario or a Zelda game ?
You can thank Yoshiaki Koizumi , director of Super Mario Galaxy and a 16 - year veteran of Nintendo 's top development teams .
Educated as a filmmaker , Koizumi wanted to get deeper stories into Nintendo 's games – even if Mario creator Shigeru Miyamoto did n't .
" I would sort of try to find sneaky ways to get [ story elements ] in without them noticing too much , " Koizumi said of his early work .
" These are aspects of the games that Miyamoto was n't nearly as fond of , and occasionally did n't like . "
Having spent the better part of the last five years learning about Miyamoto and the development of stories in video games , I found my recent conversation with Koizumi to be absolutely fascinating .
Apparently , he felt the same way : " That was really interesting .
Make sure you print all of this , " he said as I left the room .
Done , sir .
Below , you 'll find the lengthy results of our hourlong conversation , touching on stories , Super Mario Galaxy 's gameplay design and how it relates back to Mario Sunshine , how Koizumi often finds himself filling Miyamoto 's shoes – and how he is sometimes the only one who can understand the legendary game designer 's cryptic comments .
Wired News :
What was your first experience with Mario , as a gamer ?
What was the first Mario game you played , and what kind of effect did it have on you ?
Yoshiaki Koizumi : It was Super Mario Bros .
I felt like it was a really difficult game .
WN : How old were you ?
YK : About 21 .
WN : So why was it so difficult ?
YK : I did n't get really far at all in Super Mario Bros .
because I was n't really good at action games .
The first time I played Famicom was in college , and I 'd had no prior gaming experience whatsoever .
Even though Famicom came out when I was in sixth grade , it was when I was in college that I borrowed one from a friend to play Super Mario Bros .
I realized on World 1 - 1 that I was n't really good at it at all .
I kept dying .
And it was at that point that it occurred to me , what do first - time players think of games like this ?
You jump right in and you just die over and over again .
I found it a little easier to play Zelda , because Link has three hearts .
It 's not like you touch something once and then you 're dead .
WN : You say that you were studying film in school ?
YK : I was studying film , drama , and animation .
I did some storyboarding as well .
WN : So what was your original career ambition ?
YK : I wanted to be a film director .
WN : How did that end up changing ?
Did you go straight to Nintendo out of school ?
YK : After graduation , I had the opportunity to be hired at Nintendo , and I went with it .
And when you ask , " why Nintendo , " my first opportunity to play a Nintendo system was in college , but my ambition had always been to make drama .
That was my goal : Having a character , in a certain kind of world , having him go through a series of actions to accomplish something , and creating a dramatic tension throughout that .
And games seemed like a really good opportunity to create a kind of drama that you do n’t find in films .
It was very interesting .
And Nintendo was geographically very close to my university , Osaka University of Arts .
WN : That 's interesting because you do n't really hear about that kind of career path very often , somebody getting into video games in those days because of an interest in storytelling .
When you got hired , what was your first job , what did they have you doing ?
YK : My first assignment was to do the art and layout and eventually the writing for the manual for The Legend of Zelda : A Link To The Past .
What was funny was that at the time , it did n't seem like they 'd really figured out what most of the game elements meant .
So it was up to me to come up with story and things while I was working on the manual .
So , for example , the design of the goddesses as well as the star sign associated with them .
WN : Have you seen things change since then , where the story is now coming from the game rather than the instruction manual ?
YK : The situation is totally different now .
There are so many people with so many different job titles .
But back then , the people who wrote the manuals often became the people who came up with most of the backstory for the entire game .
The first real game work that I did was on Link 's Awakening .
But at the same time , I came in to write the manual , as I did on the previous game .
But they had nothing in place .
So I ended up making an entire story to go along with the game .
The dream , the island , that was all mine .
And so that was my first experience doing the kind of work that we would now call " event design . "
But there were not too many people at the time with expertise in that area , so I really had free reign to do what I wanted , so long as I did n't make Miyamoto angry .
WN : So , you 're coming in to Nintendo wanting to make dramatic stories in video games , and they tell you okay , make a manual .
Did you tell them , no , I have no experience laying out art for a manual , this is n't what I want to do ?
Or did it make a lot of sense to you that that would be the way that you started ?
YK : I was just really having a good time with all the work they were giving me .
I had plenty of experience drawing and writing in college , and so I was perfectly comfortable doing this .
But every time someone told me , " work on this manual , " and that involved drawing and writing , it usually ended up linking to some other task , where they 'd say , " It 's also okay if you do n't mind working on this . "
So I was very much stimulated by all these possibilities .
WN : So after Link 's Awakening , was your work mostly concentrated on writing for the games themselves ?
Also , in a broader sense , Nintendo 's games do n't usually pursue big , dramatic stories .
How would you compare that to the way other cinematic video games are done ?
What style is better for getting the story across ?
YK : You 're right , EAD does n't tend to focus on the big story in most of their games .
But I was the one coming up with scenarios , just on my own , ever since the time of Link 's Awakening .
But even at that time , I felt like I came up with this entire scenario and a backstory for Link , but nobody really seemed to care .
They were always saying , let 's not try to push the story forward too much .
So I would sort of try to find sneaky ways to get it in without them noticing too much .
For example , I always liked the idea of you coming upon another character and hearing little bits of conversation that slowly begin to reveal different parts of the story .
And that was the way that I tried to work on Ocarina of Time and Majora 's Mask .
A lot of the EAD games that do seem to have a lot of story , a lot of that came from my influence .
But those are aspects of the games that Miyamoto was n't nearly as fond of and occasionally did n't like .
WN : I always thought it was interesting that Miyamoto started off with Donkey Kong , pushing the idea of story in video games , makes this revolutionary game in which you have for the first time this narrative , this main character on a quest .
And then immediately after Donkey Kong , he immediately pulls back from that , does n't want to do it anymore , just wants to concentrate on gameplay .
And that seems to have set the tone for so much of EAD 's content for the last three decades .
YK : When you think about the whole " save the princess " storyline of games being one of Miyamoto 's inventions , I do n't think of that as a story so much as it is a goal .
It 's a way of creating a situation .
There 's not necessarily a buildup and a resolution of a deeper kind , like you 'd find in a novel .
It 's just a situation that motivates the players .
Lacking that kind of detailed nuance , that does n't mean I 'm not interested in a story at all .
It 's just that as a designer , my priorities are a little different .
I tend to convey emotion in slightly different ways rather than just rely on the most obvious kind of narrative that we would think of when we think of storylines .
So Miyamoto gives you the goal , and that 's what you needed in Donkey Kong to play through and accomplish it with the right sense of motivation .
And it 's true that Miyamoto may think of other things outside of that as perhaps extraneous .
But that does n't mean it 's the wrong way to make games .
It 's just two very different styles .
WN : And staying on that subject , one of the things that struck me the most out of Super Mario Galaxy were the storybook sequences .
That was the closest a Mario game ever got to getting an emotional reaction out of me .
Was that your influence ?
YK : For a long time , it really felt like telling a story in a Mario game was something that was n't allowed .
But I felt in this case that the Lumas and Rosalina really needed a story to explain what they were doing out there and to give the players a deeper understanding of their presence .
So telling her story as a fairytale by reading the book to all the Lumas as if they were young children at storytime just seemed like the mood - appropriate way to accomplish this .
Dropping it into the game in the middle of the hub right there as something you could choose if you wanted to , I felt worked very well .
If the book was standing all alone on its own , or if the game story was standing on its own , neither of them work very well as separate elements .
But together , they reinforce each other quite nicely .
And people have the option of hearing that story if they want to , or never going into that room if they do n't want to hear it .
Even so , just making the children 's book was quite a feat .
It was a bit of a struggle for us to get it done .
And a couple things that we cut from the book ended up going into the main story as well .
So it was a pretty good process .
WN : As director of Galaxy , you do a lot of work with Miyamoto .
What was his contribution to this game ?
What was your job , translating between him and the rest of the design team ?
YK : Mario has a creator , Miyamoto , and you have to consider Mr. Miyamoto 's thoughts when you 're making a Mario game .
But we share thoughts back and forth first for quite a long time .
And once I start to outline some really broad strokes about where we 're going with the game , then I can get a little more feedback from Miyamoto .
Then , getting a version together , I have to go to Miyamoto as soon as possible as we can get more feedback .
Over time , as all of these broad ideas get a little more narrowly defined , the feedback becomes a little more subtle , until finally it gets to the point where Miyamoto will give us feedback , and the only person who has any idea what it means is me .
And everyone else who is CC'ed on these emails from Miyamoto have absolutely no idea what he is talking about .
So I 'll translate for everyone else , " I think he 's trying to say this . "
Having that sort of information gap is sort of like a puzzle or a riddle .
It 's like playing Brain Age .
WN : Can you name a specific example of something Miyamoto said that people did n't understand and you had to explain ?
YK : One of the things that makes Miyamoto 's feedback so hard to understand is that none of his sentences have subjects .
So you have to rely on context to understand a statement .
But more than that , Miyamoto may not know himself what he 's trying to say .
Or he may be intentionally vague just to spur thought , just to give people a chance to come up with their own ideas and not limit them to the types of solutions they might be able to find .
And it 's always been like that .
He 's always wanted to give far more abstract answers rather than clear answers .
My role is to cut down that abstraction by giving a few examples of different solutions to problems they 're currently discussing , then sending them over to Miyamoto to see what kinds of reactions they get .
I 'm getting pretty good at it .
We 've been doing it for ten years .
WN : But can you name one specific thing ?
YK : Probably the best example is the very inception of the idea for Galaxy .
For the longest time , Miyamoto would say nothing more specific than , " Hey , can you make something with spherical worlds ? "
And that something had to be defined over a long period of time and eventually tuned into Super Mario Galaxy .
But he kept saying that , " ca n't you make something out of this whole spherical worlds concept ? "
Certainly , it seems like Miyamoto has a reason for this level of abstraction .
I feel like he 's making us work to solve these puzzles on purpose , because it 's a process that unlocks the creativity on our side .
So even though Miyamoto might have some unformed ideas , the very fact that he would put all these challenges in front of us makes me feel very grateful , because it helps the process .
WN : Do you feel that at some point you 'll have to take over for Miyamoto and be the one putting these questions to people ?
YK : Certainly , if that situation presents itself , I 'll be happy to do so .
But I already feel like I 've incorporated that style of working .
When there are members of my team who come to me , even if I know the solution to the problem , I wo n't give them the solution , just the direction .
And they know what they 're supposed to do , from that point .
WN : Getting on to Galaxy specifically , the general opinion of the game is that it's the true sequel to Super Mario 64 and that Sunshine is more of a spinoff – does your team see that as being the case ?
YK : Maybe one of the reasons for that line of thought , that Sunshine was n't really in the line of spiritual progression of these games , and one of the reasons for that is that Miyamoto said that at one point .
That Galaxy is the " true sequel " to Mario 64 .
But as far as the actual themes of the games , Sunshine is very much in my mind in that same progression .
The whole idea , for me , is about the exploration of a hakoniwa , a miniature garden .
It 's like a garden in a box , where if you look at it from different angles , you can see different plants and arrangements .
And you have that sense of surprise and exploration .
There 's always things you can find .
In terms of spiritual successors , I 've never found that to be the case .
Whereas with the Zelda series , each game seems to follow pretty closely from the last with a few stylistic deviations .
But Galaxy really feels like it went back to earlier roots with Super Mario Bros. , in terms of trying to find that same tempo , that same feel .
But for me , it 's a matter of thinking what to do with each next step .
There 's nothing you really throw away .
You think about these ideas and refine them constantly with every iteration of a game series .
So for all the camera problems that you may have found in Mario 64 and Sunshine , even though we did n't realize how to fix those problems then , those solutions presented themselves over time and found their way into this game .
I feel like you really can't have Galaxy without all of the things we learned from Sunshine .
WN : What 's interesting is that Galaxy takes a step more towards linearity .
You do n't have any worlds in Galaxy that look like Mario 64's big sandbox areas where there 's seven or eight stars all in one big location .
Galaxy 's more point A to point B . Why cut down on that exploration ?
YK : In the process of developing , we used this metaphor of a hakoniwa very often .
But creating a hakoniwa is actually incredibly difficult , because there are so many layered elements that have to work together .
In the case of creating a multi- objective level , where you can have several different paths and routes through it to different objectives , we have to blend together , but not create obstructions , where you have to pass over the same terrain .
So it requires a lot of thinking just to layer those pieces on top of each other in ways that do n't obstruct each other .
But not only that , it has to actually work .
It has to be fun .
A lot of the work that I did on Sunshine , thinking about how to keep those elements all working together when you have multiple paths in a single stage , was very much applied to Galaxy in coming up with the " zone system , " which is kind of a simplified version .
We have all of these modular elements , different planets , and flight paths in between them .
So being able to move around those different modules made it so much easier to adjust the balance of difficulty and keep the paths from obstructing each other .
In that sense , setting this game in space was an evolution along that line of thinking .
This is really one of the best ways to create a hakoniwa with those different attributes .
WN : With New Super Mario Bros. on the DS having been a really huge hit in Japan , selling nearly five million units , the biggest - selling DS game , and Galaxy having sold much less , about a tenth of that , what lesson should we take ?
Does that say something about the DS player versus the Wii player ?
Does that say something about 2 - D versus 3 - D gameplay and what resonates with people ?
YK : I do n't really follow sales numbers very closely .
So I actually was n't aware of the sales numbers for either game in that early first period .
But if I had to take a guess , I 'd say that the needs are very different for each person who wants a portable game system that they can carry with them everywhere versus someone who wants a system for the home .
These are different types of people and that would have some effect on sales .
WN : It 's difficult to get other developers to put the effort into big - budget Wii titles .
Knowing that Super Mario 64 blazed a trail in getting people to develop for the analog stick , do you hope that Galaxy will have a similar effect ?
YK : It 's a little bit hard for me to say .
I do n't feel that I am familiar enough with other video game development companies to be able to answer the question directly .
But every company produces very different types of games from Nintendo .
I do n't feel like there 's so much in common there .
But if people really like this game and if there 's demand there , I could imagine that other companies might capitalize on the success of the title and try to produce something similar to it .
WN : So , with Mario Galaxy finished , what 's next ?
YK : Well , considering that * Galaxy * only just finished , we 're still thinking about that .
But the type of development that happens at EAD Tokyo is sort of a project style of development .
People all have all kinds of different things going on , and we try to make that come together to form a game .
So I really have to go back to Tokyo and talk to my staff and have everyone bring all of their ideas to the table .
WN : The " spherical worlds " conversation had been going on for a long time .
And you can see that in older interviews , building up towards Super Mario Galaxy .
Is there anything like that going on right now , any " it would be interesting if a game did this " conversation happening now ?
YK : When making Galaxy , there were a lot of ideas that did n't make it into the final product .
And those are very likely to go into the next game that I work on .
But having said that , there 's no real demo , a proof of concept tech demo or anything like that – it's just ideas , at this point .
WN : * Mario Galaxy * made some use of the Wii remote , in certain areas .
But it was n't really heavy use of the Wii remote .
Do you want to try a game that makes more heavy use of the Wii remote 's functions ?
YK : When we first learned about the concept of the Wii , and were given prototypes , we researched exhaustively :
What things are fun to do ?
What do people want to use it for ?
From those concepts , we came up with a lot of things that could certainly become games , but at the same time , most of these are not Mario games .
It 's not a Mario game if you 're not controlling Mario moving around .
So there 's quite a bit of a challenge in applying a pointer function to that .
Certainly there are a lot of ideas out there that could become games , but none of them have really percolated to the point of an actual project , yet .
I 'm still cleaned out from having made * Galaxy *.
Django's test client is very limited when it comes to testing complex interactions e.g. forms with hidden or persisted values etc .
Twill excels in this area , and thankfully it is very easy to integrate it .
Use twill_setup in your TestCaseSubClass.setUp ( ) method
in your method Use twill_teardown in TestCaseSubClass.tearDown ( ) method
in method
In a test , use something like make_twill_url ( ) to generate URLs that will work for twill .
to generate URLs that will work for twill .
Use twill.commands.go( ) etc. to control twill , or use twill.execute_string ( ) or twill.execute_script( ) .
etc. to control twill , or use or .
Add twill.set_output( StringIO( ) ) to suppress twill output
to suppress twill output
If you want to write half the test , then use twill interactively to write the rest as a twill script , use the example in unfinished_test ( )
Twill will raise exceptions if commands fail .
This means you will get ' E ' for error , rather than ' F ' for fail in the test output .
If necessary , it would n't be hard to wrap the twill commands to flag failure with TestCase. assert_
There are , of course , more advanced ways of using these functions ( e.g. a mixin that does the setup / teardown for you ) , but the basic functions needed are here .

Pro-Tibetan protesters today disturbed a high security ceremony to light the Olympic flame in Greece .
International dignitaries were gathered at Olympia , the site of the ancient Olympics , when three members of the Paris - based Reporters Without Borders ran onto the field to disrupt a speech by Liu Qi , president of the Beijing organising committee and Beijing Communist party secretary .
The demonstrator who got nearest to Liu Qi was carrying a banner showing the Olympic Rings as handcuffs but failed to unfurl it before being arrested .
Police detained the men along with a Tibetan campaigner and a Greek photographer travelling with him in the nearby village of Olympia , just outside the site of the ancient Games .
Lhadon Tethong , director of Students for a Free Tibet , said the men were taken to the local police station .
" One of our colleagues saw them being dragged by about 20 police through town , " she said .
" If the Olympic flame is sacred , human rights are even more so , " Reporters Without Borders said in a statement .
" We cannot let the Chinese government seize the Olympic flame , a symbol of peace , without denouncing the dramatic situation of human rights in the country . "
When the incident took place , Chinese state TV cut away to a pre-recorded scene , preventing Chinese viewers from seeing the protest .
TV commentators on Chinese TV did not mention the incident .
After the arrest of the men the ceremony went ahead smoothly .
Actor Maria Nafpliotou , dressed as a high priestess , used a concave mirror to catch the sun 's rays and light the Olympic flame .
International Olympic committee president Jacques Rogge attended the ceremony and said afterwards : " It 's always sad when there are protests .
But they were not violent and I think that 's the important thing . "
Once lit , Nafpliotou handed the torch to Alexandros Nikolaidis , who won a silver medal in taekwondo at the 2004 Athens Games but the progress of the flame was hindered by protestors along its route .
Several pro-Tibet demonstrators , including a Tibetan woman whose body had been painted red , lay down on the road in the athelete 's path .
A total 645 torchbearers will carry the flame for a week over 950 miles through Greece .
It will make a stopover at the Acropolis before being handed over to Chinese officials at the Athens stadium where the first modern Olympics were held in 1896 .
The flame will travel 85,000 miles across five continents to reach the Olympic stadium in Beijing on August 8 .
Demonstrations continued today in countries neighbouring Tibet .
In northeast India , police stopped nearly 500 Tibetan exiles from marching to the Chinese border to demand a halt to China 's crackdown on protesters in Tibet .
Police blocked their entry into the state of Sikkim that borders China , said an officer , Sonam Bhutia .
The protesters carried Tibetan flags and chanted slogans demanding they be allowed to go to Tibet .
" We have barricaded the road and we shall not allow the Tibetans to continue the march , " Bhutia told the Associated Press .
The Tibetans living in India 's northeast began their march on Thursday from the state of West Bengal and planned to enter China using the Nathu La pass in Sikkim .
" The goal of the marchers is to fight shoulder to shoulder with Tibetans inside Tibet , " said Ugyen Tsewang , general secretary of the Northeast Tibetan Youth Congress , which organized the march .
" We have n't given up our effort yet .
We are persuading the state authorities to allow us continue our march , " Tsewang said by phone from Rongpo , a town in West Bengal state .
" We will start a hunger strike if the state authorities do n't accept our demand , " he said .
" We want to confront the Chinese police and not the Indian police . "
Protests started on March 10 in the Tibetan capital of Lhasa on the 49th anniversary of a failed uprising against Chinese rule .
They turned violent four days later , touching off demonstrations among Tibetans in three neighbouring Chinese provinces .
Beijing 's official death toll from the protests is 22 , but the Tibetan government - in - exile in India has said 99 Tibetans have been killed .
India has generally allowed the Tibetan exiles to protest peacefully , but earlier this month detained several dozen protesters who had planned a separate march from northern India to Tibet to coincide with the opening of the Beijing Olympics , saying India would not tolerate actions that embarrassed China .

NEW YORK ( MarketWatch ) --
Gold futures closed with gains after soaring to a new record high of $ 958.40 an ounce Thursday , boosted by weakness in the U.S. dollar and the metal 's appeal as a hedge against inflation .
Gold for April delivery rose $ 11.40 to end at $ 949.20 an ounce on the New York Mercantile Exchange .
Earlier in the session , gold surged to a new record high of $ 958.40 an ounce .
April platinum futures also hit a record , climbing as high as $ 2,194.80 an ounce .
Platinum finished up $ 49.40 at $ 2,188.20 an ounce .
" Gold has surged on increasing inflation concerns with yesterday 's stronger - than - expected and sharply higher U.S. CPI report , " said Mark O'Byrne , executive director at Gold & Silver Investments Ltd. , in a note .
With the commodities complex continuing to surge , " inflation will continue to increase significantly in the U.S. and internationally , " he said .
Gold , typically regarded as an inflation hedge , gained Wednesday after the Labor Department reported that U.S. consumer prices rose a seasonally adjusted 0.4 % in January .
Inflation was stoked by large increases in energy and food prices but also showed increases in a host of underlying core prices .
See related story .
The European Commission , the executive branch of the European Union , on Thursday hiked its inflation estimate for the euro zone in 2008 to 2.6 % , up from the previous estimate of 2.1 % , according to media reports .
The Commission also expects economic growth in the EU to be 2 % this year , down from its previous estimate of 2.4 % .
Earlier this week , Chinese officials said their country 's inflation rate climbed to its highest level in more than 11 years in January .
The nation 's consumer price index climbed 7.1 % in January from a year earlier , accelerating from a 6.5 % rise in December .
" This type of inflation environment is one in which commodities thrive in -- at least until growth rates start to falter , " said Edward Meir , an analyst at MF Global , in a research note .
" In this respect , however , although the American and European economies are slowing markedly , we are not seeing signs of a synchronized global slowdown just yet in the Asian economies , " Meir said .
" What 's more , and somewhat abruptly , there has been a supply squeeze coming through in some of the metals . "
Dollar sinks
Gold also received a boost from weakness in the U.S. dollar .
The dollar index , which tracks the performance of the greenback against a basket of currencies , fell 0.7 % to 75.56 .
See Currencies .
The greenback was pressured by worse - than - expected manufacturing in the Philadelphia region as reported by the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia .

Adding to bad economic news , the Conference Board said Thursday that the index of leading U.S. economic indicators dipped by 0.1 % in January , as weaker stock prices and housing data drove the gauge to a fourth consecutive monthly decline .
See Economic Report .
Crude - oil futures dropped Thursday , after rallying to a new record high in the previous session , as government data showed U.S. crude inventories rose more than expected in the latest week .
See Futures Movers .
Platinum futures soared to a new record high of $ 2,194.80 an ounce Thursday , surpassing their previous record of $ 2,174 set on Tuesday .
The platinum rally has been propelled by concerns about declining output from South Africa , the world 's biggest platinum producer .
South Africa has been saddled with severe power shortages since mid-January , forcing many major mining companies to operate below capacity and revise their production forecasts accordingly .
Wednesday 's correction in platinum " reflects the metal 's high volatility and extremely overbought conditions , " said James Moore , an analyst at TheBullionDesk.com , in a note .
" However , the dip again served as a bargain - hunting opportunity , as ongoing supply woes in South Africa look set to see the metal move into a much deeper deficit this year and could potentially see price extend to $ 3,000 an ounce , " Moore said .
Also on Nymex , March palladium surged $ 21.30 to end at $ 515.50 an ounce .
March silver gained 19 cents to finish at $ 17.95 an ounce and March copper rose 10 cents at $ 3.81 a pound .
The Amex Gold Bugs Index HUI , edged down 0.1 % to 465.80 points .
As for the sector 's exchange - traded funds , the StreetTracks Gold Trust ETF GLD , +0.84 % was flat at $ 93.25 , the iShares Silver Trust ETF SLV , +2.18 % edged down 0.02 % to $ 176.96 and the Market Vectors - Gold Miners ETF GDX , +1.28 % dropped 0.3 % to $ 50.79 .
Gold warehouse inventories were unchanged at 7.6 million troy ounces as of late Wednesday , according to Nymex data .
Silver stockpiles were also unchanged at 133.9 million troy ounces , while copper supplies stood at 13,978 short tons , unchanged .
Recently there has been a lot of talk about how piracy affects PC gaming .
And if you listen to game developers , it apparently is a foregone conclusion - if a high quality PC game does n't sell as many copies as it should , it must be because of piracy .
Now , I do n't like piracy at all .
It really bugs me when I see my game up on some torrent site just on the principle of the matter .
And piracy certainly does cost sales .
But arguing that piracy is the primary factor in lower sales of well made games ?
I do n't think so .
People who never buy software are n't lost sales .
Is it about business or glory ?
Most people who know of Stardock in the gaming world think of it as a tiny indie shop .
And we certainly are tiny in terms of game development .
But in the desktop enhancement market , Stardock owns that market and it's a market with many millions of users .
According to CNET , 6 of the top 10 most popular desktop enhancements are developed by Stardock .
Our most popular desktop enhancement , WindowBlinds , has almost 14 million downloads just on Download.com .
We have over a million registered users .
If you want to talk about piracy , talk about desktop enhancements .
The piracy on that is huge .
But the question is n't about piracy .
It 's about sales .
So here is the deal :
When you develop for a market , you do n't go by the user base .
You go by the potential customer base .
That 's what most software companies do .
They base what they want to create on the size of the market they 're developing for .
But not PC game developers .
PC game developers seem to focus more on the " cool " factor .
What game can they make that will get them glory with the game magazines and gaming websites and hard core gamers ?
These days , it seems like game developers want to be like rock stars more than businessmen .
I 've never considered myself a real game developer .
I 'm a gamer who happens to know how to code and also happens to be reasonably good at business .
So when I make a game , I focus on making games that I think will be the most profitable .
As a gamer , I like most games .
I love Bioshock .
I think the Orange Box is one of the best gaming deals ever .
I love Company of Heroes and Oblivion was captivating .
My two favorite games of all time are Civilization ( I , II , III , and IV ) and Total Annihilation .
And I wo n't even get into the hours lost in WoW .
Heck , I even like The Sims .
So when it comes time to make a game , I do n't have a hard time thinking of a game I 'd like to play .
The hard part is coming up with a game that we can actually make that will be profitable .
And that means looking at the market as a business not about trying to be " cool " .
Making games for customers versus making games for users
So even though Galactic Civilizations II sold 300,000 copies making 8 digits in revenue on a budget of less than $ 1 million , it 's still largely off the radar .
I practically have to agree to mow editors lawns to get coverage .
And you should see Jeff Green 's ( Games for Windows ) yard .
I still can't find my hedge trimmers .
Another game that has been off the radar until recently was Sins of a Solar Empire .
With a small budget , it has already sold about 200,000 copies in the first month of release .
It 's the highest rated PC game of 2008 and probably the best selling 2008 PC title .
Neither of these titles have CD copy protection .
And yet we do n't get nearly the attention of other PC games .
Lack of marketing on our part ?
We bang on the doors for coverage as next as the next shop .
Lack of advertising ?
Open up your favorite PC game publication for the past few months and take note of all the 2 page spreads for Sins of a Solar Empire .
So we certainly try .
But we still do n't get the editorial buzz that some of the big name titles do because our genre is n't considered as " cool " as other genres .
Imagine what our sales would be if our games had gotten game magazine covers and just massive editorial coverage like some of the big name games get .
I do n't want to suggest we get treated poorly by game magazine and web sites ( not just because I fear them -- which I do ) , we got good preview coverage on Sins , just not the same level as one of the " mega " titles would get .
Hard core gamers have different tastes in games than the mainstream PC gaming market of game buyers .
Remember Roller Coaster Tycoon ?
Heck , how much buzz does The Sims get in terms of editorial when compared to its popularity .
Those things just are n't that cool to the hard core gaming crowd that everything seems geared toward despite the fact that they 're not the ones buying most of the games .
I wo n't even mention some of the big name PC titles that GalCiv and Sins have outsold .
There 's plenty of PC games that have gotten dedicated covers that have n't sold as well .
So why is that ?
Our games sell well for three reasons .
First , they 're good games which is a pre-requisite .
But there 's lots of great games that do n't sell well .
The other two reasons are :
Our games work on a very wide variety of hardware configurations .
Our games target genres with the largest customer bases per cost to produce for .
We also do n't make games targeting the Chinese market
When you make a game for a target market , you have to look at how many people will actually buy your game combined with how much it will cost to make a game for that target market .
What good is a large number of users if they 're not going to buy your game ?
And what good is a market where the minimal commitment to make a game for it is $ 10 million if the target audience is n't likely to pay for the game ?
If the target demographic for your game is full of pirates who wo n't buy your game , then why support them ?
That 's one of the things I have a hard time understanding .
It 's irrelevant how many people will play your game ( if you 're in the business of selling games that is ) .
It 's only relevant how many people are likely to buy your game .
Stardock does n't make games targeting the Chinese market .
If we spent $ 10 million on a PC game explicitly for the Chinese market and we lost our shirts , would you really feel that much sympathy for us ?
Or would you think " Duh . "
You need a machine how fast ?
Anyone who keeps track of how many PCs the " Gamer PC " vendors sell each year could tell you that it 's insane to develop a game explicitly for hard core gamers .
Insane .
I think people would be shocked to find out how few hard core gamers there really are out there .
This data is available .
The number of high end graphics cards sold each year is n't a trade secret ( in some cases you may have to get an NDA but if you 're a partner you can find out ) .
So why are companies making games that require them to sell to 15 % of a given market to be profitable ?
In what other market do companies do that ?
In other software markets , getting 1 % of the target market is considered good .
If you need to sell 500,000 of your game to break even and your game requires Pixel Shader 3 to not look like crap or play like crap , do you you really think that there are 50 MILLION PC users with Pixel Shader 3 capable machines who a ) play games and will actually buy your game if a pirated version is available ?
In our case , we make games that target the widest possible audience as long as as we can still deliver the gaming experience we set out to .
Anyone who 's looked at the graphics in Sins of a Solar Empire would , I think , agree that the graphics are pretty phenomenal ( particularly space battles ) .
But could they be even fancier ?
Sure .
But only if we degraded the gaming experience for the largest chunk of people who buy games .
The problem with blaming piracy
I do n't want anyone to walk away from this article thinking I am poo-pooing the effect of piracy .
I 'm not .
I definitely feel for game developers who want to make kick ass PC games who see their efforts diminished by a bunch of greedy pirates .
I just do n't count pirates in the first place .
If you 're a pirate , you do n't get a vote on what gets made -- or you should n't if the company in question is trying to make a profit .
The reason why we do n't put CD copy protection on our games is n't because we 're nice guys .
We do it because the people who actually buy games do n't like to mess with it .
Our customers make the rules , not the pirates .
Pirates do n't count .
We know our customers could pirate our games if they want but choose to support our efforts .
So we return the favor - we make the games they want and deliver them how they want it .
This is also known as operating like every other industry outside the PC game industry .
One of the jokes I 've seen in the desktop enhancement market is how " ugly " WindowBlinds skins are ( though there are plenty of awesome ones too ) .
But the thing is , the people who buy WindowBlinds tend to like a different style of skin than the people who would never buy it in the first place .
Natural selection , so to speak , over many years has created a number of styles that seem to be unique to people who actually buy WindowBlinds .
That 's the problem with piracy .
What gets made targets people who buy it , not the people who would never buy it in the first place .
When someone complains about " fat borders " on some popular WindowBlinds skin my question is always " Would you buy WindowBlinds even if there was a perfect skin for you ? " and the answer is inevitably " Probably not " .
That 's how it works in every market -- the people who buy stuff call the shots .
Only in the PC game market are the people who pirate stuff still getting the overwhelming percentage of development resources and editorial support .
When you blame piracy for disappointing sales , you tend to tar the entire market with a broad brush .
Piracy is n't evenly distributed in the PC gaming market .
And there are far more effective ways of getting people who might buy your product to buy it without inconveniencing them .
Blaming piracy is easy .
But it hides other underlying causes .
When Sins popped up as the # 1 best selling game at retail a couple weeks ago , a game that has no copy protect whatsoever , that should tell you that piracy is not the primary issue .
In the end , the pirates hurt themselves .
PC game developers will either slowly migrate to making games that cater to the people who buy PC games or they 'll move to platforms where people are more inclined to buy games .
In the meantime , if you want to make profitable PC games , I 'd recommend focusing more effort on satisfying the people willing to spend money on your product and less effort on making what others perceive as hot .
But then again , I do n't romanticize PC game development .
I just want to play cool games and make a profit on games that I work on .
Yesterday , I posted the latest outrageous comments from the losing campaign ’s chief strategist , Mark Penn .
On a conference call , Penn basically said Obama ca n’t win the general election .
I swear , they just sit over at the Clinton HQ in Arlington and make things up .
And , for some reason , despite Penn ’s failed strategy , the media thinks that if he says it , it must have merit .
Whatever .
But bad news for Penn and Team Clinton is that Governor Rendell , who was on the very same conference call with Penn , disagrees .
Rendell said Obama is going to win Pennsylvania in November ( video via Ben Smith ) :
[ youtube=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nE7F56eGIm0]
No one knows Pennsylvania voters like Rendell .
So , the Clinton campaign ’s top surrogate just undermined the latest Clinton talking point .
The Obama campaign obviously disagreed with Penn , too .
They emailed out this statement last night mocking Penn ( who is so mock - worthy ) :
It ca n’t inspire too much confidence in the Clinton campaign when their pollster ignores both polls and math by making comments as divorced from reality as this one .
Senator Obama is leading in delegates , states won , the popular vote , and fares better than Senator Clinton against John McCain in poll after poll , including critical swing states like Iowa , Colorado , Pennsylvania , New Mexico and Wisconsin .
Yep .
And , it ca n’t inspire confidence when the Clinton campaign ’s top Pennsylvania supporter , Ed Rendell , affirms on national t.v. just how divorced from reality Penn is .
At least some people associated with the Clinton campaign are n’t willing to destroy the Democratic party .
Astronomers at the University of Rochester have announced that low - mass stars and possibly even super - Jupiter - sized planets may be responsible for creating some of the most breathtaking objects in the sky .
The news is ironic because the name “ planetary ” nebula has always been a misnomer .
When these objects were discovered 300 years ago , astronomers could n’t tell what they were and named them for their resemblance to the planet Uranus .
But as early as the mid-19th century , astronomers realized these objects are really great clouds of dust emitted by dying stars .
Rochester researchers now say they have found that planets or low - mass stars orbiting these aged stars may indeed be pivotal to the creation of the nebulae ’s fantastic appearance .

A team of astronomers anchored by Eric Blackman , professor of physics and astronomy at the University of Rochester , has studied the consequences of a dying star that possesses an orbiting companion .
“ Few researchers have explored how something as small as a very low - mass star , a brown dwarf , or even a massive planet can produce several flavors of nebulae and even change the chemical composition of the dust around these evolved stars , ” says Blackman .
“ If the companions can be this small , it ’s important because low - mass stars and high - mass planets are likely quite common and could go a long way toward explaining the many dusty shapes we see surrounding these evolved stars . ”
Most medium - sized stars , such as our Sun , will end their lives as planetary nebulae , says Blackman .
The stage lasts only several tens of thousands of years — a blink of an eye for stars that typically live ten billion — so it is a relatively rare sight .
Of the 200 billion stars in our own galaxy , only about 1,500 have so far been identified in the planetary nebula stage .
As the star begins to deplete its fuel near the end of its life , its core contracts and its envelope expands , eventually throwing off its outermost layers millions of miles into space .
Blackman says one time in five , this envelope keeps its roughly spherical shape as it expands , but much more often this envelope contorts and elongates into new and fantastic shapes .
The Rochester team ’s work explored the role of low - mass companions in shaping planetary nebulae stars , both when the companion is in a large orbit and interacts with only the very outer edges of the envelope , and when the companion is in a very tight orbit and so close to the evolved star that the companion is fully engulfed by the envelope .
Blackman , along with post - doctoral fellow Richard Edgar , graduate student Jason Nordhaus , and professor of astrophysics Adam Frank , showed that in the case when the planet or companion star is in a very wide orbit , the planet ’s gravity begins to drag some of the envelope material around with it .
The envelope material — essentially a thin mixture of gas and dust — becomes compressed in spiral waves radiating out from the central star like a twisted wagon wheel , says Blackman .
The dust and gas compresses more and more in these spiral waves until they crest , much like waves breaking on a beach .
Eventually , a torus of dust forms around the star ’s mid-section , likely blocking much of the expanding envelope like a belt around an inflating balloon .
Over time , such constrained expansion can lead to striking shapes , such as seen in the appropriately named Dumbbell Nebula .
“ Originally , we set out just to model the geometry of the envelope under the influence of a binary companion ” says Blackman , “ but Richard Edgar discovered that as the spiral waves break , they release their compressed , pent - up energy in a burst of heat , sufficient to melt the dust into liquid globules . ”
The globules cool slowly enough to give the molecules within time to align into crystal lattices .
Blackman says the team ’s work show ’s how a waist - cinching torus could originate to produce certain types of planetary nebula patterns , but it also suggests an answer for why astronomers have detected the puzzling signature of crystallized dust around evolved stars before the nebulae is formed .
In the case when the planet orbits so closely to the primary star that it becomes engulfed by the envelope , a new type of model is needed .
Nordhaus and Blackman modeled what might happen as the envelope slows the low - mass star or high - mass planet companion , and found that one of three outcomes is likely to occur .
First , as the companion plows through the envelope material , it can “ spin up ” the envelope so quickly that the material is ejected , deforming into a large disk or torus around the star ’s equator .
A second possibility is that the companion spins up the envelope more gently .
This causes the inner regions of the envelope to spin around the parent star faster than the outer envelope material .
This difference in rotation speeds , combined with the convection of material in the envelope , stretches and amplifies the star ’s magnetic fields .
The stretched magnetic fields can act like a giant spring , ejecting the envelope material out the star ’s poles as jets .
The third outcome sees the companion itself ejecting out the star ’s jets , says Blackman .
This scenario applies when the companion is an extremely low - mass star or a massive planet that is too small to eject the envelope before it falls to a violent fate .
The parent ’s intense gravity can shred the planet as its orbit shrinks , eventually smearing the planet into a disk of debris around the star .
This disk is very turbulent and different parts are orbiting at different speeds , generating a magnetic dynamo that again can throw material out the star ’s poles at tremendous speeds .
Unlike the previous scenario , however , Blackman says that material fired out by these jets would include the remains of the planet or companion star itself .
The Rochester team is now calculating the dynamics of the binary relationship and the characteristics of the magnetic dynamos with more precision .
They hope to better understand how these dynamos might facilitate the mixing and transportation of different elements within the nebulae to help produce the distinct chemical signatures astronomers now detect in planetary nebulae .

中島聡さん の おもてなしの経営学 アップルがソニーを超えた理由 ( アスキー新書 ) を読みました。とにかく古川さん との対談が面白い。
「経営学」と題している書籍ではあるのですが、この対談の箇所だけを抜き取ると、一人のソフトウェアエンジニアがどのようにして未来を切り開いたかというエンジニア論の体をなしています。
著者の中島さんの blog ははてなブックマークでも人気エントリーの常連なので、ご存じの方も多いことかと思います。
ところで 1998 年に、マイクロソフトがブラウザ戦争 ( wikipedia : ブラウザ戦 争 ) の結果、独占禁止法で提訴されたことがありました。個人的にはネットスケープがマイクロソフトにボコボコにされて「もうやめて、ネットスケープのライフは
0 よ!」と勝敗が完全についた区切り/象徴である事件だと認識していて、当時はまだそれほど
IT ビジネスに関心がなかったにも関わらず興味を持った出来事でした。対談を読むうちに、このブラウザ戦争のど真ん中で、プログラマとして
Internet Explorer 3.0 を作り 、Windows 98 でシェルとブラウザの統合を実現したのが中島さんだったことを知り、驚きました。
なんてことがさらっと書いてある。一方読者の自分は「な、なんだってー」。いや、中島さんがマイクロソフト時代に
Windows チームにいたというのは伺っていたのですが、古川さんが" もう時効だ!!"とばかりにその裏幕を次から次へと暴露 (? ) するもので、中島さんが Windows の開発においていかに重要な役割を担っていたかというのが嫌というほど伝わってくるという。圧倒されます。
中島さんのおもてなしの経営学を読んでいたら、中島さんがコンピュータの歴史においていかに重要な仕事をされていたかが分かり驚いた。同じく元マイクロソフトの古川さんとの対談の中で、アスキー、マイクロソフト時代のことが詳しく語られている。
中島さんとは何度か直接お会いした事もあるのに、マイクロソフトで活躍されていた、ということを漠然としか知らずにお話させて頂いていて恥ずかしい限りだ。
全くもって 。
例えば Wikipedia の OS / 2 の項 ( wikipedia : OS / 2 ) を見る と
Ver.1.2のリリース後、マイクロソフトはWindowsの開発に注力することになり、以降はIBMのみの開発となった。
と OS / 2 から Windows への方向転換についてあっさり一行で記述されていますが、実際には、マイクロソフト社内では別のOS開発プロジェクト
" Cairo " が本命で 、Windows プロジェクトは冷遇されていたという背景があったそうです。
当時中島さんも Cairo プロジェクトにいたそうですが、理想的な形を追求するあまり分厚いドキュメントはあるものの開発がなかなか進まない状況に業を煮やしてをプロジェクト飛び出しWindows チームに勝手に異動( それが可能な文化が Microsoft にはあったそうです。 ) 、そこから Windows 95 のユーザーインタフェースを作り上げ、ビル・ゲイツへのプレゼン対決で
Cairo に勝利して、結果 Windows 95 がマイクロソフトの正式な次世代
OS としてリリースされた ...なんて裏話があったようです。そんな奇跡が本人たちの口から語られていて、とてもリアル。
これらのエピソード以外にも、マイクロソフト以前のアスキー時代も含めて、びっくりするような逸話が次から次へと語られています。
失礼な話、最近の中島さんの blog を見ていると 、JavaScript や Flash に興味があって最近の流行を追いながらちょっとした
Hack を繰り返している粋なオジサマ、という印象が受ける人が多いと思うのですが( すいません、無礼講で... )
多分このアスキー時代の話やマイクロソフトでの話を聞いてその印象ががらっと変わるという人も多いのではないでしょうか。
話は変わって、ロールモデルの話。梅田さんはエンジニアのロールモデルとしてよくまつもとさんの名前を挙げます。まつもとさんは確かにロールモデルとして他に類を見ないすばらしいエンジニア道を実践されている方だと思います。ただ、開発対象がプログラミング言語であったり、そのユーザが技術者であったり、企業人としてはやや特殊例であったりすることから、自分のような「企業に属しながら企業が求めることに対しエンジニアとしてどう結果を出していくか」という人間には、まつもとさんをロールモデルとしてイメージするのが少し難しい。
一方の中島さんは技術者以外のユーザーに向けてソフトウェアを作ることを目的としている企業に属す人
( 言語処理系やコンパイラを作るというより、ツールやサービスを作ることを模索しているプログラマなど)
が企業内外でどう振る舞うか、そのロールモデルになれるエンジニア人生を歩んで来た方なんだと思いました。しかし、これまでその手の話はあまり具体的に語られて来なかった(
http://satoshi.blogs.com/life/2006/04/windows95.html
のような話に blog で時折触れられているのではありますが )
。そんな中島さんの貴重なエンジニアとしての経験を、同じ時代を共有してかつ技術的な素養がある古川さんだからこそ、昔話として引き出すことができたんだろう、と思いました。
繰り返しになりますが、とても面白かったです。ありがとうございました。
ちなみに中島さんは、知る人ぞ知る GAME80 コンパイラ の開発者でもあります。当時高校生、だそう。うげげ。
One of the easiest ways to improve your networking ability and invigorate your social life is to develop the skill of talking to strangers .
We ’re trained as children to fear strangers ( which is good for safety reasons ) but most people carry this fear into adulthood where it does more harm than good .
It becomes a constraint on the number of people you can meet and interact with .
You get stuck in a box , only open to creating new relationships through people you already know .
If you already know a lot of people , this can work all right , but it limits you to meeting people who are generally like you .
If you are new to an area and do n’t have many friends , the fear of talking to strangers is absolutely crippling .
Fortunately , developing the skill of talking to strangers is easy .
Once you get started the immense benefits and excitement it brings will encourage you to keep going .
It comes down to three things :
Understanding the benefits of talking to strangers .
Knowing how to deal with the occasional rejection or unpleasant encounter .
Breaking down your fear through practice .
Everyone is a Learning Experience
To get an idea of the benefits of talking to strangers , you need to change your mentality .
As tribal creatures , we ’re naturally inclined to fear , nay hate , people we do n’t know .
We instinctually perceive them as dangerous outsiders , seeking to pillage our village and make off with our women and children !
In modern society this simply is n’t true .
Most people are friendly and perfectly open to conversing with you .
It just takes a little effort to cross the stranger barrier .
Each person is an incredible learning opportunity .
What they tell you about themselves .
How they live and interact with the world .
There is a wealth information waiting to be tapped .
Strangers also tell you a tremendous amount about yourself by the way they react to you .
As you gain experience and learn to read body language , these reactions are essential to developing your social skills .
Of course , there are also the priceless relationships you ’ll have the chance to form :
Business contacts –
Who you know ( and what they think of you ) is often more important than what ’s on your resume .
Friendships
Mentors and teachers
Romantic relationships
I think the last point is extremely important .
We all dream of meeting our ideal mate , but when we see someone we ’re extremely attracted to , we ’re usually too intimidated to approach them .
How can you expect to find love with that mentality ?
Dealing with Rudeness and Rejection
Now that you ’re sold on the benefits of talking to strangers , the only other skill you ’ll need is the ability to let rejection roll off your back .
The key to this is not taking it personally .
At least 95{ 54c12dad2cc2b53ae830e39915b1a3e70288dbcbbeb8bbf8395437c5dc3c512c} of the time when a person reacts negatively to you it has absolutely nothing to do with you personally .
Most likely they ’re having a bad day or you caught them at the wrong moment .
Maybe they ’ve been harassed by people before and assume you have bad intentions .
Or maybe they ’re just not that cool and you would n’t gain much from knowing them anyways .
Instead of reliving the incident in your mind and dwelling on your insecurities , imagine reasons for their behavior that do n’t depend on you .
In the 5{54c12dad2cc2b53ae830e39915b1a3e70288dbcbbeb8bbf8395437c5dc3c512c} of cases where you actually caused the negative reaction , treat it as a learning experience .
The problem is n’t you , it ’s your behavior , so examine what you could have done better .
Did you come off pushy ?
Could your personal appearance be better ?
Thinking about these things will go a long way towards improving yourself .
How to Get Started
That hardest part of talking to strangers is getting started .
Before you have experience striking up conversations it can make you nervous and awkward , but the more you do it the smoother and more likeable you ’ll become .
Start Small –
If you ’re a naturally reserved person , you ’ll probably want to warm up a bit .
Start with making eye contact with people you might like to talk to , smiling at them , or saying Hi out of the blue .
Think of possible conversation starters you could say .
Comment on Something – If you see something remarkable , make a comment .
Even if it ’s not at anyone directly , chances are people will hear and react to you .
If you see someone doing or wearing something interesting , tell them what you think .
Keep it positive and most likely they will be happy to chat .
Make a Joke –
If a decent joke pops into your head , just come out and say it .
If someone laughs , that ’s the perfect conversation starter .
This is great for opening dialogue with attractive people of the opposite sex .
That ’s really all there is to it .
Good luck and do n’t get discouraged .
You have nothing to lose but your shyness !
Update : Due to reader request , I ’ve written a post with some more practical tips on appearing friendly and approachable .
Confidence is the key to EVERYTHING .
Ever wondered exactly how self confident you actually are ?

Both night - shift work and chronic sleep deprivation are increasingly implicated in mental and cognitive problems .
* Alzheimer ’s risk : Abnormal insulin levels ( common in shift workers and sleep - deprived people ) may increase the risk for certain neurodegenerative disorders , such as Alzheimer ’s disease , scientists at the University of Washington have found .
Normally , insulin acts on the brain to promote learning and memory .
However , insulin resistance may cause inflammation in the brain , a key process in the development of Alzheimer’s .
* Learning : Proper alignment between sleep times and internal circadian time is crucial for optimal cognitive performance .
And numerous recent studies show learning is enhanced if it ’s immediately followed by restorative sleep .
In other words , students who pull all - nighters studying for an exam are doing themselves more harm than good .
* Mood :
Even moderate changes in sleep times can have a big effect on mood .
Diane Boivin of the Centre for Study and Treatment of Circadian Rhythms at Douglas Mental Health University Institute in Montreal published research last year in the journal Sleep showing that serotonin levels -- a key substance for mood stability -- are lower in shift workers than day workers .
Other studies have found that exposure to bright light in the morning can lift the moods of people with depression , and that prescribed periods of sleep deprivation can interrupt a bout of depression .

* Bipolar disorder : Flawed circadian rhythms may be to blame for bipolar disorder .
In a study published last year in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences , scientists from the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center identified a gene that , if disrupted , causes mice to behave as if they have bipolar disorder .
Correcting the gene mutation could lead to a therapy for the illness , the scientists said .
History may not repeat itself , but , as Mark Twain observed , it can sometimes rhyme .
The crises and conflicts of the past recur , recognisably similar even when altered by new conditions .
At present , a race for the world 's resources is underway that resembles the Great Game that was played in the decades leading up to the First World War .
Now , as then , the most coveted prize is oil and the risk is that as the contest heats up it will not always be peaceful .
But this is no simple rerun of the late 19th and early 20th centuries .
Today , there are powerful new players and it is not only oil that is at stake .
It was Rudyard Kipling who brought the idea of the Great Game into the public mind in Kim , his cloak - and - dagger novel of espionage and imperial geopolitics in the time of the Raj .
Then , the main players were Britain and Russia and the object of the game was control of central Asia 's oil .
Now , Britain hardly matters and India and China , which were subjugated countries during the last round of the game , have emerged as key players .
The struggle is no longer focused mainly on central Asian oil .
It stretches from the Persian Gulf to Africa , Latin America , even the polar caps , and it is also a struggle for water and depleting supplies of vital minerals .
Above all , global warming is increasing the scarcity of natural resources .
The Great Game that is afoot today is more intractable and more dangerous than the last .
The biggest new player in the game is China and it is there that the emerging pattern is clearest .
China 's rulers have staked everything on economic growth .
Without improving living standards , there would be large - scale unrest , which could pose a threat to their power .
Moreover , China is in the middle of the largest and fastest move from the countryside to the city in history , a process that can not be stopped .
There is no alternative to continuing growth , but it comes with deadly side - effects .
Overused in industry and agriculture , and under threat from the retreat of the Himalayan glaciers , water is becoming a non-renewable resource .
Two - thirds of China 's cities face shortages , while deserts are eating up arable land .
Breakneck industrialisation is worsening this environmental breakdown , as many more power plants are being built and run on high - polluting coal that accelerates global warming .
There is a vicious circle at work here and not only in China .
Because ongoing growth requires massive inputs of energy and minerals , Chinese companies are scouring the world for supplies .
The result is unstoppable rising demand for resources that are unalterably finite .
Although oil reserves may not have peaked in any literal sense , the days when conventional oil was cheap have gone forever .
Countries are reacting by trying to secure the remaining reserves , not least those that are being opened up by climate change .
Canada is building bases to counter Russian claims on the melting Arctic icecap , parts of which are also claimed by Norway , Denmark and the US .
Britain is staking out claims on areas around the South Pole .
The scramble for energy is shaping many of the conflicts we can expect in the present century .
The danger is not just another oil shock that impacts on industrial production , but a threat of famine .
Without a drip feed of petroleum to highly mechanised farms , many of the food shelves in the supermarkets would be empty .
Far from the world weaning itself off oil , it is more addicted to the stuff than ever .
It is hardly surprising that powerful states are gearing up to seize their share .
This new round of the Great Game did not start yesterday .
It began with the last big conflict of the 20th century , which was an oil war and nothing else .
No one pretended the first Gulf War was fought to combat terrorism or spread democracy .
As George Bush Snr and John Major admitted at the time , it was aimed at securing global oil supplies , pure and simple .
Despite the denials of a less honest generation of politicians , there can be no doubt that controlling the country 's oil was one of the objectives of the later invasion of Iraq .
Oil remains at the heart of the game and , if anything , it is even more important than before .
With their complex logistics and heavy reliance on air power , high - tech armies are extremely energy - intensive .
According to a Pentagon report , the amount of petroleum needed for each soldier each day increased four times between the Second World War and the Gulf War and quadrupled again when the US invaded Iraq .
Recent estimates suggest the amount used per soldier has jumped again in the five years since the invasion .
Whereas Western countries dominated the last round of the Great Game , this time they rely on increasingly self - assertive producer countries .
Mr Putin's well - honed contempt for world opinion might grate on European ears , but Europe is heavily dependent on his energy .
Hugo Chávez might be an object of hate for George W Bush , but Venezuela still supplies around 10 per cent of America 's imported oil .
President Ahmadinejad is seen by some as the devil incarnate , but with oil at more than a $ 100 a barrel , any Western attempt to topple him would be horrendously risky .
While Western power declines , the rising powers are at odds with each other .
China and India are rivals for oil and natural gas in central Asia .
Taiwan , Vietnam , Malaysia and Indonesia have clashed over underwater oil reserves in the South China Sea .
Saudi Arabia and Iran are rivals in the Gulf , while Iran and Turkey are eyeing Iraq .
Greater international co-operation seems the obvious solution , but the reality is that as the resources crunch bites more deeply , the world is becoming steadily more fragmented and divided .
We are a long way from the fantasy world of only a decade ago , when fashionable gurus were talking sagely of the knowledge economy .
Then , we were told material resources did not matter any more - it was ideas that drove economic development .
The business cycle had been left behind and an era of endless growth had arrived .
Actually , the knowledge economy was an illusion created by cheap oil and cheap money and everlasting booms always end in tears .
This is not the end of the world or of global capitalism , just history as usual .
What is different this time is climate change .
Rising sea levels reduce food and fresh - water supplies , which may trigger large - scale movements of refugees from Africa and Asia into Europe .
Global warming threatens energy supplies .
As the fossil fuels of the past become more expensive , others , such as tar sands , are becoming more economically viable , but these alternative fuels are also dirtier than conventional oil .
In this round of the Great Game , energy shortage and global warming are reinforcing each another .
The result can only be a growing risk of conflict .
There were around 1.65 billion people in the world when the last round was played out .
At the start of the 21st century , there are four times as many , struggling to secure their future in a world being changed out of recognition by climate change .
It would be wise to plan for some more of history 's rhymes .

We are constantly warned by scientists that our planet is in big trouble , so why can't we change direction ?
David Suzuki , one of the world 's leading ecologists , on how humans have lost the vital skill of foresight
As I approach my 72nd birthday , I have reluctantly achieved the position of elder , and it is mindboggling to reflect on the changes that have occurred in my lifetime .
The population of the world has tripled , while technology has exploded from early radio , telephones and propeller planes to the telecommunication revolution , computers , space travel , genetic engineering and oral contraceptives .
And stuff !
My biggest challenge is to staunch the flow of stuff into my life .
But these great successes - economic growth , technology , consumer goods - have come at enormous cost : the degradation of our very life support systems - air , water , soil , energy and biodiversity .
We are now the most numerous species of mammal on Earth and each of the 6.6 billion of us must breathe , drink , eat , be clothed and find shelter .
So the mere act of living means our species has a heavy collective ecological footprint .
When that is amplified by technology ( computers , TV , cars , etc ) used on our behalf , our hyperconsumption and the global economy , we have been transformed into a force that is now altering the biological , chemical and physical features of the planet on a geological scale .
Experts estimate that more than 50,000 species now become extinct annually .
More than half the planet 's forests are gone , and if we continue to destroy them as we are doing there will be no large intact forests left within two decades .
We cannot escape the toxic debris of our industrial activity .
Recently , three members of parliament in Ottawa were tested for more than 80 toxic chemicals and were shocked to learn that all three carried dozens .
The oceans are being depleted .
A global study led by biologist Boris Worm , of Dalhousie University in Halifax , Nova Scotia , predicts that if habitat destruction and overfishing continue , every exploited marine species will be commercially extinct by 2048 .
And for 20 years , climatologists have warned us that human activity is altering the chemical composition of the atmosphere , with consequent climate change occurring at unprecedented speed .
I could go on listing the depressing litany of problems , but the need to take serious action on all of these issues is converging , and we must make major decisions to change course .
How did we arrive at this moment ?
As a biologist , I tend to view things from an evolutionary perspective .
DNA studies reveal that we emerged as a species in Africa some 150,000 years ago - a mere blink in geological time .
The world was a very different place back then .
There were still woolly mammoths roaming the Earth , sabre - toothed tigers , giant sloths in North America and 3 - metre tall moa birds .
Spectacular trajectory
Let 's suppose scientists have discovered time travel , so we take a time machine and hover above the Rift Valley in east Africa 150,000 years ago .
The plains are a spectacular sight , covered with immense herds of mammals ; vast flocks of birds fill the air ; rivers and lakes teem with fish and reptiles .
The clusters of furless , upright apes who are our ancestors are not that impressive .
Those early humans are not numerous , large , strong or fast , or endowed with special sensory abilities .
There is little to indicate the spectacular trajectory this naked ape is about to follow .
But if we watch them for a while , we can recognise their special secret : their behaviour reveals that they are intelligent .
The human brain endowed us with a massive memory , insatiable curiosity , inventiveness , and an ability to think in abstracts .
These qualities more than compensated for our lack of physical and sensory abilities .
That brain created a notion of a future , even though the only reality is the present and our memories of the past .
And because that brain invented a future , we recognised that we could affect that future by what we do in the present .
If we look ahead , we can see where opportunities and dangers lie , and by following a deliberate path we can avoid the hazards , while exploiting the opportunities .
Foresight , I believe , was one of the most important abilities that enabled us to survive and flourish , and continues to underlie our explosive success as a species .
Today , we have all the amplified foresight conferred by scientists , computers , engineers and telecommunications , and for more than 40 years , leading scientists have been looking ahead and warning us that humanity is heading along a dangerous and unsustainable path , while there are benefits and opportunities in moving along a different direction .
For example , in 1992 , a remarkable document called World Scientists '
Warning to Humanity was signed by more than 1,500 senior scientists , including more than half of all Nobel prizewinners alive at that time .
Here is some of what the document said : " Human beings and the natural world are on a collision course .
Human activities inflict harsh and often irreversible damage on the environment and critical resources .
If not checked , many of our current practices put at serious risk the future we wish for human society . . . and may so alter the living world that it will be unable to sustain life in the manner that we know .
Fundamental changes are urgent if we are to avoid the collision our present course will bring about . "
The document goes on to list the critical areas of the atmosphere , water resources , oceans , soil , forests , species extinction , and overpopulation .
Then the words grow even more urgent : " No more than one or a few decades remain before the chance to avert the threats we now confront will be lost and the prospects for humanity immeasurably diminished .
. .
A great change in our stewardship of the Earth and life on it is required if vast human misery is to be avoided and our global home on this planet is not to be irretrievably mutilated . "
This is a frightening document ; eminent scientists do not often sign such a strongly worded missive .
But if the Scientists '
Warning is frightening , the response of the media in North America was terrifying - there was no response .
None of the major television networks bothered to report it , and both the New York Times and Washington Post dismissed it as " not newsworthy " .
And even today , when we have been told we could have as little as 10 years to avoid catastrophe , that is considered not worth reporting , while every antic of Paris Hilton or Britney Spears is reported in breathless detail , not for days or weeks but for months and years .
Instead we hear excuses to ignore the warnings : it will ruin the economy ; technology will solve the problem ; it is not fair when other countries are not included ; there are other priorities demanding immediate attention , etc .
And so we turn our backs on the very strategy that got us to where we are .
Business as usual
For decades , scientists in the US had pointed out that New Orleans was a disaster waiting to happen .
The city lies in an area that is prone to annual hurricanes , half the city is below sea level , and a force 5 hurricane was bound to hit the city , so drastic measures had to be implemented immediately to avoid disaster .
All the while , politicians and businesspeople countered that it would be economically ruinous to take precautionary action , and carried on with business as usual - no doubt crossing their fingers that nothing would happen during their tenure .
We all know what did happen when Hurricane Katrina hit the city in 2005 and confirmed all the predictions scientists had made .
The need to look ahead and manoeuvre to exploit opportunities and avoid threats continues to be just as critical in modern society .
The challenge is to find why we are rejecting foresight , why we can't see what the real threats are that confront us .

Last Sunday and Monday a collective of activists , journalists , retired government officials and theater makers gathered at The Culture Project to begin mock impeachment proceedings against President Bush .
The “ trial by theater ” arose in part out of frustration with Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi ’s pledge to leave impeachment “ off the table ” when her party seized the House majority .
The month long series , called A Question of Impeachment , is intended to spark debate and , participants hope , inspire more robust calls for impeachment from the grassroots .
Monday night ’s event , which was videotaped and posted online here , featured New Yorker writer Hendrick Hertzberg , former Harper ’s editor Lewis Lapham , theater artist Rinde Ekert and others .

A new species of dinosaur unearthed in Mexico is giving scientists fresh insights into the ancient history of western North America , according to an international research team led by scientists from the Utah Museum of Natural History at the University of Utah .
" To date , the dinosaur record from Mexico has been sparse , " said Terry Gates , a paleontologist with the Utah Museum of Natural History , Utah 's designated natural history museum .
The new creature - aptly dubbed Velafrons coahuilensis - was a massive plant - eater belonging to a group of duck - billed dinosaurs , or hadrosaurs .
" Velafrons is a combination of Latin and Spanish meaning " sailed forehead , " in reference to the large sail - like crest that grew atop the dinosaur 's head , " said Rosario Gomez , director of the paleontology program in Coahuila , Mexico .
" The second part of the name honors the state of Coahuila in north - central Mexico , where the specimen was found , " said Gomez .
Utah Museum of Natural History paleontologists teamed up with researchers from the Utah Geological Survey ; Coordinacion de Paleontologia , Secretaria de Educacion y Cultura de Coahuila the Museo del Desierto , in Saltillo , Coahuila , Mexico ; and the Royal Tyrrell Museum , in Drumheller , Alberta , Canada , to excavate and study the 72 - million - year - old specimen .
The species was announced in the December edition of the Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology .
Mexico's arid climate poses challenges for dinosaur hunters , Gates explained .
With little rainfall , there is minimal erosion , which means fewer fossils ever see daylight .
Yet the fossils emerging from Coahuila turn out to be a vital part of the North American story for the latter part of the Age of Dinosaurs .
A Different World
For most of the Late Cretaceous , high global sea levels resulted in flooding of the central , low - lying portion of North America .
As a result , a warm , shallow sea extended from the Arctic Ocean to the Gulf of Mexico , splitting the continent in two .
Dinosaurs living on the long , narrow , peninsula - like western landmass - known as Laramidia , or more simply , " West America , " - occupied only a narrow belt of plains that were sandwiched between the seaway to the east and rising mountains to the west .
Central America had not formed at the time , which made Mexico the southern tip of the continent .
In many ways , the Late Cretaceous is the best - understood time during the Age of Dinosaurs , thanks in large part to over 120 years of dinosaur hunting in Canada , Montana , and the Dakotas .
" Yet the dinosaurs from Mexico have remained a mystery , " noted Scott Sampson , a Utah Museum of Natural History paleontologist and co-author of the study .
Gates described the arid , desert terrain where the dinosaur was recovered as nothing like Mexico during the Late Cretaceous .
About 72 million years ago , this region was a humid estuary near the southernmost tip of West America , an area where salt water from the ocean mixed with fresh water from rivers .
Many of the dinosaur bones are covered with fossilized snails and marine clams , indicating that these animals inhabited environments near the shore .
In addition to isolated skeletons , the researchers found large bonebeds of jumbled duck - bill and horned dinosaur skeletons .
These sites appear to represent mass death events , perhaps associated with powerful storms like those that are known to occur around the southern tips of Africa and South America today .
" The region was periodically hammered by monstrous storms , " Sampson said , " devastating miles of fertile coastline , apparently killing off entire herds of dinosaurs . "
Recovering a Hatchet Head
Until recent years , there have been few large - scale paleontological projects in Mexico focused on the Age of Dinosaurs .
Velafrons stands as one of the first dinosaurs to be named from Mexico .
The creature comes from a rock unit known as the Cerro del Pueblo Formation , which dates to around 71.5 million to 72.5 million years ago .
The skeleton was discovered in the early 1990s on the outskirts of a small town called Rincon Colorado , about 27 miles west of the city of Saltillo .
The skeleton was found by Martha Carolina Aguillon , and excavated over the course of several seasons by members of the Coordinacion de Paleontologia de la Secretaria de Educacion y Cultura de Coahuila under the direction of Jim Kirkland , of the Utah Geological Survey , and Rene Hernandez - Rivera , Instituto de Geología , Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México .
Much of the excavation work was completed by volunteers as a participant - funded research project organized by the Dinamation International Society and the staff of the Museo del Desierto .
On becoming Utah 's state paleontologist , Kirkland encouraged Scott Sampson and his students to take over his role on the Coahuila Paleontological research project .
Then , in 2002 , Sampson spearheaded the first of two paleontological expeditions to Coahuila , by securing funds from the University of Utah and National Geographic Society .
The Utah Museum of Natural History crew , along with other researchers from Mexico , Canada , and the U.S. , undertook the daunting task of completing the hadrosaur excavation , in addition to locating several other sites that contain new dinosaur species .
Armed with a jackhammer and shovels , the crew returned to the Rincon Colorado dig site , where they labored for two weeks through 12 feet of overburden , eventually uncovering the ancient skull .
Upon its arrival at the Utah Museum of Natural History , the skull then required another two years of meticulous preparation by Jerry Golden , a skilled volunteer at the museum .
Based on the development of several bony features on the skull and skeleton , the scientists believe that this animal was still a youngster at the time of death .
Nevertheless , although not yet fully grown , Velafrons would have been on the order of 25 feet long , suggesting an impressive adult size of 30 feet to 35 feet .
Gates explained that Velafrons represents the first occurrence of a crested duck - billed dinosaur in this region of North America .
" The crested duck - billed dinosaurs are an extraordinary example of vertebrate evolution , " he said .
Unlike other animals where the nose bone lies in front of their eyes , these dinosaurs transformed their skulls so that the nose rested atop their skull .
The snout extended backward , up their face , in order to fill the gap left by the relocated nose bone .
Interestingly , breathing was not straight - forward for Velafrons and its kin .
Air flowed through a series of passages from the snout , into their crest , and finally inserting through a hole above their eyes .
Scientists are uncertain what Velafrons ' fan - shaped crest would have been used for , but a leading hypothesis suggests mate attraction , which explains the complex nasal passages as a possible musical instrument .
An Ancient Ecosystem Revealed
In addition to Velafrons , the most recent expeditions recovered remains of a second kind of duck - bill dinosaur , as well as a plant - eating horned dinosaur .
Like its famous cousin , Triceratops , the new Coahuila horned dinosaur bore a massive horn over each eye and a long bony frill projecting rearward .
The Cerro del Pueblo Formation has also yielded remains of large and small carnivores , including large tyrannosaurs ( though smaller , older relatives of T. rex ) , and more diminutive Velociraptor - like predators armed with sickle - claws on their feet .
As well as an abundance of fossilized bones , researchers discovered the largest assemblage of dinosaur track ways known from Mexico , a large area crisscrossed with the tracks of different kinds of dinosaurs .
In all , the emerging picture is one of a diverse group of dinosaurs , perhaps representing an entirely new set of species .
Gates noted that this project is about much more than naming new dinosaurs .
Each new species represents another vital piece of the puzzle as we attempt to comprehend the world of dinosaurs .
As might be suspected , paleontologists are excited about the future paleontological potential of this area .
" I am amazed at how prolific this region is , " Gates said of the amount of material waiting to be collected .
" Given the large number of fossils , the high quality preservation , and the great research team that is working this area , more spectacular discoveries are just around the corner . "
" Dinosaurs from this particular period are important because this is a time that is relatively poorly understood , " said Don Brinkman , a project researcher from Canada 's Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology , who along with Aguillon , is studying the non-dinosaur vertebrates found at the site , including turtles , fish , and lizards .
" The locality in Mexico goes a long way to filling in a gap in our knowledge of the record of changes in dinosaur assemblages throughout the Late Cretaceous era . "
Few dinosaurs from this time period are known in North America outside the Drumheller region of Alberta , which is where the Royal Tyrrell Museum is located .
Brinkman explained that researchers now have two points of comparison to examine not only different dinosaurs , but also different ecologies .
Research teams want to find examples of plant life and smaller animals that co-existed with these dinosaurs .
This information can be compared with collections made in other parts of North America to understand north - south variations in species and entire ecosystems .
Sampson added , " Now that we 've cracked open this amazing window into the world of dinosaurs , we look forward to future expeditions that will undoubtedly reveal more of Mexico 's ancient past . "
In addition to advancing the field of paleontology , the researchers hope that this project in Coahuila may encourage more tourism to the area and bring attention to the Museo del Desierto , where the original specimen will be permanently housed .

Bush seeks armed guards on all flights from Europe RAW STORY
Published : Monday February 11 , 2008
|
Print This Email This Proposal also asks for information on family members of flyers President George W. Bush wants armed guards on all planes flying into the United States from Europe , according to a draft document circulating among the European Union 's 27 member states .
According the document leaked to the Guardian , the administration also wants EU states to supply personal data on all air passengers flying over the United States even if they are not landing in America .
Further , the Administration is also demanding that European airlines provide personal data on non-travelers , such as family members who are allowed beyond departure barriers to help the elderly or infirm board jets embarking for America .
Some diplomats have called the proposal blackmail .
The US has threatened to require west Europeans and Britons to have US visas to enter if their governments wo n't sign on .
But not everyone is biting .
" The Association of European Airlines , representing 31 airlines , including all the big west European national carriers , has told the US authorities that there is " no international legal foundation " for supplying them with data about passengers on flights overflying US territory , " the Guardian says .
The US counters that some passengers " overflying " the US might get access to places beyond security checkpoints during stopover flights .
Already , the Administration has a vast database that they mine for " suspected terrorists , " which has unwitting delayed innocent passengers with the same names as suspects .
The US Department of Homeland Security has already created a system to deploy within months that will " impose a new permit system for Europeans flying to the US , compelling all travelers to apply online for permission to enter the country before booking or buying a ticket , a procedure that will take several days , " the paper notes .
Bush could enlist smaller country to sign onto his new requirements and then use that state as a wedge to pressure other governments .
It appears that Prague will accept the new US requirements .
A senior EU official told the paper the Americans could get " a gung - ho frontrunner " to sign up to the new regime and then use that agreement " as a rod to beat the other member states with . "
Washington is also asking European airlines to provide personal data on non-travellers - for example family members - who are allowed beyond departure barriers to help elderly , young or ill passengers to board aircraft flying to America , a demand the airlines reject as " absurd " .

" We are placing these people back into February .
We are dealing with a public health issue and the extension of Daylight Saving Time at both ends is extending the period of year in which people are most vulnerable to depression . "
— Michael Terman , Columbia University Medical Center
Spring forward , fall back still stands but there 's a new twist this year as daylight saving time starts three weeks earlier and ends one week later .
Clocks around the United States are moved one hour on the second Sunday in March .
With an extra month of extra daylight , you wo n't need to switch on lights as often , which means reduced energy use and electricity bills .
Whether the extra light hour actually saves a substantial amount of energy is up for debate , so this year will be the tester , experts say .
History of Daylight Savings
As far back as the 1700s , people recognized the potential to save energy by jumping clocks ahead one hour in the summer — Benjamin Franklin even wrote about it — although the idea was not put into practice until the 20th century .
During both World Wars , the United States and Great Britain began observing Daylight Saving Time .
After the war , U.S. states were free to choose whether to observe Daylight Saving Time and the calendar start dates of the time change .
The result was time confusion for travelers and newscasters .
In 1966 , Congress enacted the Uniform Time Act , which stated that if any state observed Daylight Saving , it had to follow a uniform protocol , beginning and ending on the same dates throughout the country .

In 1966 , Congress enacted the Uniform Time Act , which stated that if any state observed Daylight Saving , it had to follow a uniform protocol , beginning and ending on the same dates throughout the country .
Meanwhile , the time switch could shake up your biological clock , rattle your mood and give your bones and teeth an extra dose of vitamin D .
It is worth it ?
The change is the result of the Energy Policy Act of 2005 .
Instead of starting on the first Sunday in April and ending on the last Sunday in October , Daylight Saving now begins on the second Sunday in March and ends on the first Sunday of November .
Energy savings was one primary motivation behind the shift , but it 's arguable whether the change will be worthwhile .
The California Energy Commission estimated that the extra month will save the state only one - half of 1 percent of their current energy expenditures .
The Department of Energy issued a report that also predicted relatively small energy savings for the country as a whole , and will issue another report in the fall detailing the actual savings , said Department of Energy spokesperson Tom Welch .
If Congress deems the energy savings too small , they might even revert back to the old start and end dates , he told LiveScience .
" It might be a one - year deal , " Welch said .
Your brain 's clock
Changing household clocks can be a small chore .
Changing your body 's internal clock will be trickier .
A cluster of brain cells located in the hypothalamus acts as your body 's timekeeper .
The neural ticker , also called a circadian rhythm , tells your body when to eat , sleep , wake up and perform many other body functions over the course of a day .
Light is the key to cuing up the internal clock .
For instance , sunrise directs the body to release various " wakeful " hormones , which boost metabolism , blood pressure and body temperature .
Sunset tells the body it 's time to wind down and sleep .
To keep your body systems in sync with local time , your body 's internal clock relies on cues from sunlight , particularly early morning light .
" A long series of research studies over the past 20 years has now focused down on the critical element and that is early morning sunlight exposure , " said Michael Terman , director of the Center for Light Treatment and Biological Rhythms at Columbia University Medical Center .
Time 's a changing
Daylight Saving
Time effectively snatches a morning hour and adds it to your evenings .
That means 7 a.m. Daylight Saving
Time is equivalent to 6 a.m. standard time , so your typically sunlit mornings will be dark .
The morning darkness could keep your biological clock in winter mode .
" We know for the population as a whole that depressive symptoms become worse during the winter months , " Terman said .
Winter blues , affecting about 35 million Americans , are a mild form of seasonal affective disorder ( SAD ) , which affects as many as 12 million Americans .
Symptoms of SAD include depression , sleep problems , cravings for sweets and other carbohydrates , sluggishness and headaches .
The doldrums begin to ramp up some time in the fall and typically remit by the second week of May , Terman said .
" We are making the sun rise even an hour later than it otherwise would during a period when these symptoms should be beginning to improve , " Terman said in a telephone interview .
" We are placing these people back into February , " Terman said .
" We are dealing with a public health issue and the extension of Daylight Saving Time at both ends is extending the period of year in which people are most vulnerable to depression . "
Even if you are down in the dumps , you might want to flash a smile .
The extra daily sunshine later in the day could boost the health of your teeth , said Charles Hildebolt of Washington University School of Medicine .
That 's because sunshine boosts your body 's vitamin D , which is crucial for calcium absorption .
Studies have shown that deficiencies in calcium and vitamin D can lead to dental diseases and overall bone loss .
A Sicilian tour guide who got fed up with answering the same questions about the mafia has written a pocket - sized book he thinks visitors will be unable to refuse .
The Mafia Explained to Tourists - which has been published in Italian , English , Japanese , German , Spanish and French - tackles questions such as : what a mafioso looks like , whether the mafia will exist forever and " why have n't we seen a shoot - out in our 10 days here ? "
" I included the 10 questions I am always asked , so from now I can just hand out the book , " said Augusto Cavadi , a Palermo - based guide and mafia scholar .
The template for his 55 - page , € 5.50 ( £ 4.20 ) book was the frequently asked questions section in a washing machine manual .
Responding to the question , how is it possible that 5 million Sicilians cannot defeat 5,000 mafiosi ? , Cavadi tries to explain the " grey zone " in Sicily , which consists of those who are not part of the mafia but turn a blind eye to its activities .
He also lists books and films which present the mafia realistically .
Cavadi said his book was just as suitable for Italians as for foreign tourists : " Italians sometimes insist there are ' good ' mafiosi who do not kill , as well as ' bad ' mafiosi . "
To clear up any doubt on the matter , the book contains the question : is it true the mafia will not kill priests ?
" They certainly kill them when they take a stand against the mafia , " he said .
As for mobster spotting , Cavadi said it was not straightforward .
" They are usually elegant and polite and move in high circles , " he said .
" I have known dozens , but only found out years later they were mafiosi when they were arrested .
It was 15 years before I figured out my apartment building was owned by a mob family . "
Video : Heavily hyped Minuteman barrier little more than ' cow fence '

A ballyhooed US / Mexico border barrier envisioned by Minuteman founder Chris Simcox is , two years on , little more than a " cow fence , " charge former Minuteman members .
The militia - style border patrol group 's website had hyped a $ 55 million , 14 - foot high , razor wire - topped barrier complete with security cameras and sensors .
But donations which poured in for the ambitious plan have resulted in " little more than an invisible fence to nowhere , " reports Abbie Boudreau for CNN .
Group leaders and members have questioned how donations were actually being spent by Simcox , Boudreau reports .
" To this day , we still do n't know how much the Minuteman Civil Defense Corps has raised , " said one former Minuteman member .
" We do n't have a clue , not a clue . "
For his part , Simcox says the allegations and CNN 's investigation are " part of a smear campaign . "
CHICAGO , Jan 3 ( Reuters ) - Placebos are a surprisingly common prescription , according to a U.S. study in which nearly half of the doctors surveyed said they had doled out a dummy pill at some point .
Researchers at the University of Chicago said on Thursday the study raises ethical questions and suggests a need for greater recognition and understanding of placebo use .
“ It illustrates that doctors believe expectation and belief have therapeutic potential , ” said Rachel Sherman , a medical student at the University of Chicago , whose study was published in the Journal of General Internal Medicine .
The idea behind placebos is that when patients think they are getting an effective treatment , they sometimes feel better , even though the pill has no proven benefit .
They are often used in clinical trials to compare the benefits of drugs , and many times patients taking placebos show some improvement .
But few studies have shown how doctors use placebos in routine practice .
Sherman and Dr. John Hickner , a family medicine professor at the University of Chicago , sent surveys to 466 internists at three Chicago - area academic medical centers .
About half , or 231 , responded .
Of those , 45 percent said they had used a placebo during their clinical practice , a number that surprised the researchers .
But 12 percent of those surveyed said placebos should never be used .
“ I think this shows that it strikes a chord among physicians .
We may underestimate the body ’s natural healing potential , ” Sherman said in a telephone interview .
“ This shows that doctors may think that , too . ”
But Sherman said the practice brings up ethical issues , including whether a doctor has an obligation to provide patients with informed consent .
Of respondents who reported using a placebo in clinical practice , 34 percent said they told the patients the substance was something that “ may help and will not hurt . ”
About a third gave other information to patients including , “ this may help you but I am not sure how it works . ”
Nineteen percent said it was a “ medication , ” and 9 percent called it “ a medicine with no specific effect . ”
Only 4 percent of the doctors said , “ it is a placebo . ”
Part of the reason doctors are not forthcoming about giving a placebo is that in order for it to work , patients need to believe it can help , Sherman said .
One way around this dilemma is to ask all new patients for their consent in advance .
“ The patient could say no .
Then you avoid any of these ethical questions , ” Sherman said .

Hot on the heels of a leak from the Swiss Apple Store , Apple went ahead and popped out an updated Airport Express this morning .
( Please , hold your gasps — we know it 's not Tuesday yet . )
The new Airport Express , which has not seen any technological updates to speak of since its launch almost four years ago , now supports 802.11n ( draft , of course ) .
Finally .
The Airport Express remains at its previous price of $ 99 and does n't appear to have gained any other new features —
Jade speculated over the weekend that it could gain Gigabit Ethernet ( bzzt , it still has a single 10/100 port ) or that it might be able to support a USB hard drive ( bzzt , USB port still only supports a printer and a couple of third - party gadgets , like the Keyspan Express Remote ) .
Still , if you 've been dying for a new Airport Express but have been holding off because of no Draft - N , you should be happy .
Apple says that the new little gadget is available immediately in stores , and it ships within 24 hours from the online store .
There 's not a lot exciting to say about this update otherwise , so we 'll let you guys loose now .
Have fun .
Solving the " last mile " problem is a goal both the telecommunication and cable industries have pursued for years without discovering a single , easily implementable solution .
Now , researchers at the Korea Institute of Science and Technology think they have developed a new type of plastic optical fiber that could potentially be used to provide low - cost fiber connectivity from the consumer to the provider .
Plastic optical fiber is n't as fast as traditional glass , but its 2.5 GB / s transfer speed still represents a meteoric leap beyond copper .
Currently , the majority of optical fiber is prone to breakage ( being made from glass ) , cannot bend , and can be difficult to connect .
The Korea Times reports that the new plastic fiber can be easily bent and connected to additional lines , making it useful in hard - to - reach homes or apartments .
The Korea Institute 's new technology is n't the first flexible fiber we 've seen on the market — various Japanese companies are also working on their own standards — but the institute claims its plastic - based fiber is both faster and of better quality than anything currently available on the Japanese market .
Verizon , in particular , might be interested in plastic optical fibers .
The company 's FiOS technology runs fiber directly into the home of each subscriber , a choice that was costing the company well in excess of $ 900 per subscriber as of last March .
Verizon has already shown an interest in flexible cable , and announced last summer that it wanted to purchase Corning 's new flexible optical fiber as soon as it became available in quantity .
AT&T ( and its U - Verse customers ) could also potentially benefit from cheaper optical fiber .
Instead of running fiber - to - the - home , AT&T 's current U - Verse implementation runs fiber - to - the - node and depends on traditional copper wire to handle the last mile .
This saves AT&T a great deal of money — the estimated per-user cost of U - Verse was only $ 270 ( as of March ) compared to Verizon 's $ 933 — but it severely handicaps the company 's ability to offer its customers higher bandwidth in the future .
If plastic optical fiber is cheaper to purchase and deploy than traditional optical fiber , AT&T could conceivably alleviate its own inevitable bandwidth crunch while still saving money compared to Verizon .
The ESB has this evening announced that it is to embark on an unprecedented capital investment programme of € 22bn .
The board of the company has approved a Strategic Framework to 2020 that will see major investment in renewable energy , the halving of its carbon emissions within 12 years , and the achievement of carbon net - zero by 2035 .
Fifty percent of the overall investment package is geared towards investments in a renewable future .
€ 4bn of this will be directly invested in renewable energy projects and € 6.5 bn will be spent facilitating renewables including smart metering and smart networks .
The company says the plan , which will establish ESB as a world class renewables company , makes emissions reduction and energy efficiency central to its ambitious targets .
By 2020 , ESB will be delivering one - third of its electricity from renewable generation .
This will include over 1,400 megawatts of wind generation , in addition to wave , tidal and biomass .
To promote this , the company says it will invest in emerging green technologies .
The board says it will drive substantial cost reductions in overheads across all its businesses in order to meet its new financial challenges and at the announcement of the initiative up to 400 job losses were forecast .
With the development of a single British - Irish electricity market by 2020 , ESB 's international profile will continue to expand .
The company plans to invest in more generation plants and renewables in Britain and further plants in Europe .
Its chairman , Lochlann Quinn , said the Strategic Framework to 2020 addresses ESB 's response to major imperatives now demanding action .
" ESB is operating in a dramatically changing environment .
Three overarching concerns now exist – the consequences of climate change , energy security and competitiveness of energy supply and ESB is strong , focussed and prepared to deal with them " , Mr Quinn said .
ESB Chief Executive , Padraig McManus , says the blueprint positions them now as a leading energy company in Europe .
Part of the strategy will involve the rollout of smart meters to homes in Ireland allowing householders to better plan their electricity consumption something the board boss says is also a key part of their future strategy .
BAGHDAD , Iraq ( CNN ) -- Adm. William Fallon has resigned as chief of U.S. forces in the Middle East and Central Asia after more than a year in the post , citing what he called an inaccurate perception that he is at odds with the Bush administration over Iran .
Adm. William Fallon had been serving as chief of U.S. forces in the Middle East and Central Asia since 2007 .
Fallon , the head of U.S. Central Command , was the subject of a recent Esquire magazine profile that portrayed him as resisting pressure for military action against Iran , which the Bush administration accuses of trying to develop nuclear weapons .
In a written statement , he said the article 's " disrespect for the president " and " resulting embarrassment " have become a distraction .
" Although I do n't believe there have ever been any differences about the objectives of our policy in the Central Command area of responsibility , the simple perception that there is makes it difficult for me to effectively serve America 's interests there , " Fallon said .
In Washington , Defense Secretary Robert Gates told reporters at the Pentagon that he accepted Fallon 's resignation " with reluctance and regret . "
But , he added , " I think it 's the right decision . "
Watch why some believe Fallon was forced to resign »
" Admiral Fallon reached this difficult decision entirely on his own .
I believe it was the right thing to do , even though I do not believe there are in fact significant differences between his views and administration policy , " Gates said .
Do n't Miss Esquire : The Man Between War and Peace
In a written statement , President Bush praised Fallon for helping " ensure that America 's military forces are ready to meet the threats of an often troubled region of the world .
" He deserves considerable credit for progress that has been made there , especially in Iraq and Afghanistan . "
Fallon , a 41 - year veteran of the Navy , took over as chief of Central Command in early 2007 .
Gates said he will be replaced by Lt. Gen. Martin Dempsey , his deputy , who commanded an Army division in Iraq in the early days of the war and led efforts to train the Iraqi military .
The perception that Fallon has opposed a drive toward military action against Iran from within the Bush administration dates to his confirmation hearings in January 2007 , when he told the Senate that the United States needed to exhaust all diplomatic options in its disputes with the Islamic republic .
But he also has said that the United States would be able to take steps if Tehran were to attempt to block the Strait of Hormuz , the outlet of the Persian Gulf and a choke point for much of the world 's oil .
And he recently told CNN that the United States is looking for a peaceful settlement to disputes " in every case . "
" We 're trying to encourage dialogue and find resolution , " he said .
" In fact , that 's our message to the Iranians out here , given that everybody is nervous and anxious about their activities , is to come forth and explain what they are doing with all the people in the region . "
On Tuesday , Gates said , " We have tried between us to put this misperception behind us over a period of months and , frankly , just have not been successful in doing so . "
But Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid said Fallon 's resignation showed that independent views " are not welcomed in this administration . "
" It is also a sign that the administration is blind to the growing costs and consequences of the Iraq war , which has so damaged America 's security interests in the Middle East and beyond , " said Reid , D - Nevada .
" Democrats will continue to examine these matters very closely in the coming weeks and months . "
Meanwhile , Republican presidential candidate Sen. John McCain offered words of praise for Fallon .
" Under Adm .
Fallon 's leadership at Central Command , the situation in Iraq has improved dramatically , " McCain said in a statement .
" All Americans should be grateful for Adm .
Fallon 's service and respect his decision to retire . "
Gates ' spokesman , Geoff Morrell , said Monday that the secretary and the admiral still had " a good working relationship " and that the Esquire article -- " The Man Between War and Peace " -- had not changed that .
He said Gates had read the article and had no comment on it .

George Bush said other countries still saw Iran as " a problem "
A US intelligence assessment released on Monday said that Iran had halted a nuclear weapons programme in 2003 .
Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad called the US report a " great victory " for Iran .
But Mr Bush said Iran still had " more to explain " about its past actions , and that it must cease uranium enrichment .
He said Iran had yet to acknowledge that it had a covert nuclear weapons programme which ran until 2003 - as stated by Monday 's National Intelligence Estimate ( NIE ) .
The report said Iran was keeping its options open , continuing to enrich uranium , which could be used for nuclear weapons in the future .
' Still a problem '
" The Iranians have a strategic choice to make , " said the US president .
The report gives me a sigh of relief because it is consistent with our assessment
Mohamed ElBaradei
IAEA Director General
World reaction in quotes Media comment Should US change policy ?
" They can come clean with the international community about the scope of their nuclear activities , and fully accept the longstanding offer to suspend their enrichment programme and come to the table and negotiate .
" Or they can continue on a path of isolation that is not in the best interest of the Iranian people . "
Analysts say Monday 's report may undermine Washington 's strategy of attempting to rally other countries to impose stricter sanctions against Iran .
But Mr Bush said he believed Britain , France , Germany and Russia continued to see Iran 's nuclear programme as " a problem , that must be addressed by the international community " .
However , Russia and China - whose acquiescence would be required for any new UN sanctions - have said the NIE report raises questions about the need for new measures .
The head of the International Atomic Energy Agency , Mohamed ElBaradei , said Iran had been " somewhat vindicated " .
Mr ElBaradei said the assessment was consistent with the IAEA 's own , and that he hoped it would allow some space to pursue a diplomatic solution .
' Just path '
Mr Ahmadinejad said in a televised speech that the report had been a " fatal blow " to those who had filled the world for several years with threats , stress and anxiety .
" This report ... is announcing a victory for the Iranian nation in the nuclear issue against all international powers , " he said .
" You saw the report of the US intelligence .
They said clearly that the Iranian people were on the just path , " he added .
He warned Iran 's critics : " If you want to start up a new game , the Iranian people will resist and will not step back one inch .
" If you want to negotiate with us as an enemy , the Iranian people will resist and will conquer you .
If it is on the basis of friendship and co-operation , the Iranian people will be a great friend . "
The BBC's Jon Leyne in Tehran says President Ahmadinejad is relishing the moment , particularly at a time when he has been facing growing criticism within the political elite over his handling of the nuclear issue .
The US has vowed to carry on pushing for a third UN sanctions resolution against Iran - a draft of which could be circulated by the end of the week .

I discovered this article in The Green Sheet , which does a nice job summarizing the actions of DataTreasury and their enforcement of US patents 5,910,988 and 6,032,137 against the entire banking industry pursuant to Check 21 .
For those that may not be familiar with it , The Check Clearing for the 21st Century Act ( " Check 21 " ) was passed by Congress and became effective on October 28 , 2004 .
Check 21 is intended to foster innovation in the payments system and to enhance its efficiency by reducing some of the legal impediments to check truncation .
The law facilitates check truncation by creating a new negotiable instrument called a substitute check , which permits banks to truncate original checks , to process check information electronically , and to deliver substitute checks to banks that want to continue receiving paper checks .
A substitute check is the legal equivalent of the original check and includes all the information contained on the original check .
The law does not require banks to accept checks in electronic form nor does it require banks to use the new authority granted by the Act to create substitute checks ( more information can be found here ) .
The problem here is that DataTreasury is claiming to have a patent on core features used in the Check 21 process .
So now we have a law allowing banks to electronically process checks , but in order to do so , they have to go through DataTreasury 's patent .
Very valuable stuff .
According to DataTreasury , each year Bank of America processes 9.4 billion checks ; Citigroup processes 2.4 billion ; Wachovia processes 4.5 billion ; and Wells Fargo processes 3.7 billion checks .
JPMorgan Chase processed 1.5 billion checks in 2003 .
So far , DataTreasury has been successful in its attempts to go after patent infringers .
It has entered into licensing agreements with some companies , and at least one company , ACS , is permanently barred from ever using its technology .
JPMorgan Chase , which opted to settle with DataTreasury in the infringement suit , is now a DataTreasury licensee .
And DataTreasury has made it clear that they will be going after others .
DataTreasury is currently preparing to take First Data and Ingenico to trial to resolve its claims against them ; it has refiled its claims against Viewpointe Archive , a check - image archiving provider founded by JPMorgan Chase .

ARCHIVES | SEARCH Turkish Defacement Posted by Mikko @ 07:53 GMT
It 's somewhat surprising that still , in late 2007 , there are hobbyist Web defacement gangs that compete in how many Websites they can deface .
Most of these gangs originate from Turkey or Brazil and they keep score on the numbers of their defacements through special defacement archive servers .
Why am I bringing this up ?
Because last night our Web discussion forum server ( forum.f-secure.com ) got defaced by a Turkish gang .
See this screen shot :
Quite embarrassing .
So how did this happen ?
The server itself is quite well hardened , but the web forum software had an unannounced security patch silently released by the vendor nine days ago .
The defacement gang learned of the vulnerability and went through the net searching for vulnerable forums and changed the front page of such forums to their " greeting " .
Most of you probably did n't even know that we have a web forum .
It has never been advertised much .
We 'll let you know when it 's back online .
Editor 's Note :
The forum is once again online .

General William Odom Says Congress Should Impeach and Stop Funding the Occupation
David Swanson
In a wide - ranging hour - long discussion on live radio , General William Odom said he sees two useful things Congress can do : cease funding the occupation of Iraq , and impeach Bush and Cheney .
General Odom earned a national reputation as an expert on the Soviet Union .
In 1977 , he was appointed as the military assistant to Zbigniew Brzezinski , the hawkish assistant to the president ( Carter ) for national security affairs .
From 2 November 1981 to 12 May 1985 , Odom served as the ArmyÂ´s Assistant Chief of Staff for Intelligence .
From 1985 to 1988 , he served as the director of the National Security Agency , the United StatesÂ´ largest intelligence agency , under president Ronald Reagan .
Odom was energized during the radio show and continued the discussion off the air , at which point he told me he ’d wished to mention that al Qaeda ’s websites show a new theme : al Qaeda wants to get the United States to attack Iran .
Odom remarked on a situation in which Lieberman , Olmert , and al Qaeda all agree .
In addition to Iraq and Iran , we discussed on the air the question of the NSA ’s warrantless spying , not that the NSA could n’t hear us off the air as well .

Apple iPod Nanos in San Francisco , September 5 , 2007 .
Apple is in talks with major music companies to offer customers free access to its entire iTunes music library in exchange for paying a premium for its iPods and iPhones , the Financial Times said .
REUTERS / Robert Galbraith
NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - Apple is in talks with major music companies to offer customers free access to its entire iTunes music library in exchange for paying a premium for its iPods and iPhones , the Financial Times said .
Citing people familiar with the talks , the paper said the negotiations hinged on a dispute over the price Apple would be willing to pay for access to the labels ’ libraries .
One industry executive said research showed consumers would pay a premium of up to $ 100 for unlimited access to music for the lifetime of a device , or a monthly fee of $ 7 - $ 8 for a subscription model .
Apple was not immediately available for comment .

Controversial : Actor Robert Downey
Jr is virtually unrecognisble in the trailer for his new film Tropic Thunder
Action man : Robert wore a wig and make - up for the part
Downey
Jr plays a worthy Oscar - winning actor taking on a role originally written for a black actor , and rather than re-write the part , he goes method .
The star studded cast includes comedians Ben Stiller , Jack Black and Alan Partridge star Steve Coogan .
Clearing anticipating a backlash , Downey Jr told a US magazine : " If it 's done right , it could be the type of role you called Peter Sellers to do 35 years ago .
If you do n't do it right , we 're going to hell . "
Downey explained that he kept the character from becoming a caricature because he " dove in with both feet . "
" If I did n't feel it was morally sound , " he said , " or that it would be easily misinterpreted that I 'm just C. Thomas Howell in ( " Soul Man " ) , I would 've stayed home . "

Transformation : Downey Jr. plays overly committed actor Kirk Lazarus , a white man cast to play a black soldier in the satire
The film centres on a group of pompous actors making the most expensive Vietnam war movie ever made .
Fed up with their self - involved cast , the film 's makers drop them into the jungle to take care of themselves , where they get caught up in a conflict they do n't realise is real .
The cast also includes Steve Coogan , Nick Nolte and cameos from Tom Cruise and Tobey Maguire .

All guns blazing : as well as starring in the film , Ben Stiller co-wrote , directed and produced it
Funny man : the cast also includesAlan Partridge star Steve Coogan
Stiller said he was " trying to push it as far as you can within reality , " with the intent of satirising over - the - top actors , not African - Americans .
" I had no idea how people would respond to it , " Stiller told the magazine .
But at a recent screening , black viewers liked the film , he said .
The film , Stiller 's first as director since Zoolander , also sees his character adopt an Asian baby but worries " that all the good ones have gone " .
Paramount is set to release ' Tropic Thunder ' in the U.S. on 15 August .
Originally published in The Independent on Jan. 16 , 2008 .
The President sat chummily beside the all - too - friendly monarch yesterday , enthroned in what looked suspiciously like the kind of casual blue cardigan he might wear on his own Texan ranch ; he had even received a jangling gold “ Order of Merit ” — it looked a bit like the Lord Chancellor ’s chain , though it was not disclosed which particular merit earned Mr. Bush this kingly reward .
Could it be the hypocritical merit of supplying yet more billions worth of weapons to the Kingdom , to be used against the Saudi regime ’s imaginary enemies ?
It was illusory , of course , like all the words that the Arabs have heard from the Americans these past seven days , ever since the fading President began his tourist jaunt around the Middle East .
You would n’t think it though , watching this preposterous man , prancing around arm - in- arm with the King , in what was presumably meant to be a dance , wielding a massive glinting curved Saudi sword , a latter - day Saladin , who would have appalled the Kurdish leader who once destroyed the Crusaders in what is now referred to by Mr. Bush as “ the disputed West Bank ” .
Is this how lame - duck American presidents are supposed to behave ?
Certainly , the denizens of the Middle East watching this outrageous performance will all be asking this question .
Ever since the 1979 Iranian revolution , a Muslim Cold War has been raging within the Middle East — but is this how Mr. Bush thinks one should fight for the soul of Islam ?
Already by dusk last night , the U.S. President ’s world was exploding in Beirut when a massive car bomb blew up next to a 4× 4 vehicle carrying American embassy employees , killing four Lebanese and apparently badly wounding a U.S. embassy driver .
And while Mr. Bush was relaxing in the Saudi royal ranch at Al Janadriyah , Israeli forces killed 19 Palestinians in the Gaza Strip , most of them members of Hamas , one of them the son of Mahmoud Zahar , a leader of the movement .
He later claimed that Israel would not have staged the attack — on the day an Israeli was also killed by a Palestinian rocket — if it had not been encouraged to do so by George Bush .
The difference between reality and the dream - world of the U.S. government could hardly have been more savagely illustrated .
After promising the Palestinians a “ sovereign and contiguous state ” before the end of the year , and pledging “ security ” to Israel — though not , Arabs noted , security for “ Palestine ” — Mr. Bush had arrived in the Gulf to terrify the kings and oligarchs of the oil - soaked kingdoms of the danger of Iranian aggression .
As usual , he came armed with the usual American offers of vast weapons sales to protect these largely undemocratic and police state regimes from potentially the most powerful nation in the “ axis of evil ” .
It was a potent — even weird — example of the US President ’s perambulation of the Arab Middle East , a return to the “ policy by fear ” which Washington has regularly visited upon Gulf leaders .
He agreed to furnish the Saudis with at least £ 41 m of arms , a figure set to rise to more than £ 10bn in weaponry to the Gulf potentates under a deal announced last year — all of which is supposed to shield them from the supposed territorial ambitions of Iran ’s crackpot President , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad .
As usual , Washington promised the Israelis that their “ qualitative edge ” in advanced weapons would be maintained , just in case the Saudis — who have never gone to war with anyone except Saddam Hussein after his 1990 invasion of Kuwait — decided to launch a suicidal attack on America ’s only real ally in the Middle East .
This , of course , was not how the whole shooting match was presented to the Arabs .
Mr. Bush could be seen ostentatiously kissing the cheeks of King Abdullah and holding hands with the autocratic monarch whose Wahhabi Muslim state had only recently showed its “ mercy ” to a Saudi woman who was charged with adultery after being raped seven times in the desert outside Riyadh .
The Saudis , needless to say , are well aware that Mr. Bush ’s reign is ending amid chaos in Pakistan , a disastrous guerrilla war against Western forces in Afghanistan , fierce fighting in Gaza , near civil war in Lebanon and the hell - disaster of Iraq .
The bomb in Beirut , just before five in the evening , must still have come as a rude shock to the luxuriating President who has such close ties with the Saudi regime — despite the fact that the majority of hijackers in the crimes against humanity of 11 September 2001 came from the Kingdom — that he allowed its junior princes to fly home from the United States immediately after the attacks .
Two trips to Mr Bush ’s Texas ranch by King Abdullah [ were ] apparently enough to earn the U.S. President a night in the Saudi king ’s palace - farm , surrounded by groomed lawns and grassy hills .
Heard across many miles of the Lebanese capital , the bomb devastated buildings in a narrow street in the east of the city through which the vehicle was passing , just as the U.S. ambassador — on a different route into the city — was traveling to a central Beirut hotel reception before leaving for Washington .
A State Department spokesman , however , insisted that no U.S. citizens had been hurt .
The American SUV had taken an obscure laneway close to the Karantina bridge to travel north of Beirut along the bank of the city ’s only river when it was struck , leading local Lebanese military officials to ask themselves if the bomber had inside knowledge of the route they were taking .
There was talk that this was a “ dummy ” convoy staged to distract potential bombers from the journey which Ambassador Jeffrey Feltman was taking to a reception at a downtown hotel .
A carpet manufacturer ’s factory was smashed by the blast which tore down roofs and smashed windows more than half a mile from the scene .
For Arab leaders , Mr. Bush ’s message to the Gulf leaders was wearily familiar .
In the 1980s , when the Reagan administration was supporting Saddam Hussein ’s invasion of Iran , Washington spent its time warning Gulf leaders of the danger of Iranian aggression .
Once Saddam invaded Kuwait , America ’s emphasis changed :
It was now Iraq which posed the greatest danger to their kingdoms .
But once the emirate was liberated , the oil - wealthy monarchs were told that — yet again — it was Iran that was their enemy .
Arabs are no more taken in by this topsy - turvy “ good- versus - evil ” narrative than they are by Washington ’s promises to help create a Palestinian state by the end of the year , scarcely a day before Israel publicly admitted to plans for yet more houses for settlers on Arab land amid Jewish colonies illegally built on Palestinian territory .
Yet to understand the nature of this extraordinary relationship with the Gulf monarchs , it is necessary to recall that ever since the President ’s father promised a weapons - free “ oasis of peace ” in the Gulf , Washington — along with Britain , France and Russia — has been pouring arms into the region .
Over the past decade , the Gulf Arabs have squandered billions of their oil dollars on American weapons .
The statistics tell their own story .
In 1998 and 1999 alone , Gulf Arab military spending came to £ 40 bn .
Between 1997 and 2005 , the sheikhs of the United Arab Emirates — Mr. Bush ’s hosts before he continued to Riyadh — signed arms contracts worth £ 9bn with Western nations .
Between 1991 and 1993 — when Iraq was the “ enemy ” — the U.S. Military Training Mission was administering more than £ 14bn in Saudi arms procurements and £ 12bn in new U.S. weapons acquisitions .
By this time , the Saudis already possessed 72 American F - 15 fighter - bombers and 114 British Tornados .
How little has changed in the past 17 years .
On 17 May 1991 , for example , George Bush Sr. said there were now “ real reasons to be optimistic ” about a peace in the Middle East .
“ We are going to continue to work in the [ peace ] process , ” he said then .
“ We are not going to abandon it . ”
James Baker , who was the American Secretary of State , warned on 23 May 1991 that the continued building of Jewish settlements on Palestinian land “ hindered ” a future Middle East peace , just as the present Secretary of State said last week .
At the time , the Israelis were reassured by Dick Cheney that the U.S. would safeguard their “ security ” .
The West may have a short memory .
The Arabs , who happen to live in the piece of real estate which we call the Middle East and who are not stupid , have not .
They understand all too well what George W. Bush now stands for .
After advocating “ democracy ” in the region — a policy which gained electoral victories for Shia in Iraq , for Hamas in Gaza and a substantial gain in political power for the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt — it seems to have dawned on Washington that something might be slightly wrong with Bush ’s priorities .
Instead of advocating a “ New Middle East ” , Mr. Bush , lying amid his silken sheets in the Saudi king ’s palace , is now pursuing a return to the “ Old Middle East ” , a place of secret policemen , torture chambers — to which prisoners can be usefully “ renditioned ” — and dictatorial “ moderate ” presidents and monarchs .
And which of the Gulf despots is going to object to that ?
The day gecko , which lives in the forests of Madagascar , has been recorded begging a bug for its dinner .
The lizard repeatedly nods its head at the insect , called a plant hopper , until it flicks over small balls of honeydew for the gecko to dine upon .
It is not yet understood why the insect so willingly offers up honeydew at the lizard 's behest .
Some believe that the presence of the hungry geckos may keep other predators away from the insect .
The footage was recorded for the BBC One series Life In Cold Blood .
It took the crew several attempts to capture this strange behaviour on camera as plant hoppers are very well camouflaged .
Life In Cold Blood is on BBC One on Monday , 18 February at 2100 GMT and is repeated on BBC One on Sunday , 23 February .
There is much political interest in Chinese trade figures
China 's trade surplus unexpectedly fell in February , suggesting the US slowdown is hitting demand for Chinese goods .
China exported $ 8.6bn ( £ 4.3 bn ) more than it imported last month , down from $ 23.7bn in February last year , according to government figures .
But economists warned that February data are very sensitive to the timing of China 's lunar new year celebrations .
There was more concern that factory gate prices had risen 6.6 % in the year to February .
Factory gate prices measure the amount that manufacturers are paid for their products and is a key indicator of consumer inflation to come .
Premier Wen Jiabao told parliament last week that the battle against inflation is his top economic priority for the year .
" Virtually everything is on the rise - not just fuel , but coal and iron ore , " said Jun Ma , chief China economist at Deutsche Bank in Hong Kong .
" All these things are growing much stronger than fuel , plus labour costs are going up too . "
Consumer prices figures are due out on Tuesday .
REDMOND , Wash .
-Microsoft , which in October officially announced its intent to support model - driven development in a broad strategy known as " Oslo , " is beginning work on a new declarative programming language , a supporting editing tool and other components of the initiative , according to sources close to the company .
Microsoft announced Oslo as part of an amorphous vision for simplifying application development , design , management and deployment .
Company officials said Oslo will represent a core set of technology investments that will encompass both a services infrastructure - spanning server , client and the Internet " cloud " - and an executable modeling platform that will include a general - purpose modeling language , tools and repository .
However , the sources said that at the heart of the Oslo initiative lies a new declarative programming language currently known simply as " D . "
If , as the code name implies , Oslo were a city , D would be the key to Oslo .
According to the sources , D is a new language under development at Microsoft aimed at building applications and components for the Oslo repository .
However , D is but one piece of a much larger puzzle that will include graphical modeling tools and other components .
D is expected to be a textual modeling language suitable for use by business professionals and domain experts .
Accenting D will be a new editing tool known as " Intellipad . "
Intellipad will serve as a text editor for the D language and will further support the development of applications and other content for the Oslo repository .
Although Intellipad is targeted primarily for use with D , it will be capable of supporting other declarative languages , sources said .
It is being designed to be both customizable and suitable for scripting .
The technology also is known inside Microsoft as " Emacs .
Net , " as homage to the Emacs text editor made popular in the Unix environment .
Microsoft and Sun are pushing the Ruby language across various platforms .

In a talk at the Lang. NET conference on the Microsoft campus here Jan. 30 , Don Box , an architect in Microsoft 's Connected Systems Division , said that Microsoft engineers " care deeply about having natural ways to write things down in a text file that are not only natural to write , but more importantly , natural to read . "
The Connected Systems Division is working on D and Intellipad , sources said .
However , other groups within Microsoft , including the Developer Division , are working on different components of the Oslo strategy .
When some Microsoft bloggers began referring to an Emacs .
Net effort late last year and in the early days of 2008 , Burley Kawasaki , director of product management in Microsoft 's Connected Systems Division , issued a statement on the issue .
" The recent reference to a possible ' Emacs.net ' like environment is referring to some of the R&D efforts we 're exploring that would help enable model - driven development to enter mainstream use by the developer community , " Kawasaki said .
" While it 's too soon to announce any specifics in terms of product offerings , this generally referred to some of the early thinking we 're doing around Oslo 's modeling platform currently in development at Microsoft , specifically focused on how developers will want to edit and create declarative models . "
The New York Police Department produced a detailed analysis in 1998 opposing plans by the city to locate its emergency command center at the World Trade Center , but the Giuliani administration overrode those objections .
The command center later collapsed from damage in the Sept. 11 terrorist attack .
“ Seven World Trade Center is a poor choice for the site of a crucial command center for the top leadership of the City of New York , ” a panel of police experts , which was aided by the Secret Service , concluded in a confidential Police Department memorandum .
The memorandum , which has not been previously disclosed , cited a number of “ significant points of vulnerability . ”
Those included : the building ’s public access , the center ’s location on the 23rd floor , a 1,200 - gallon diesel fuel supply for its generator , a large garage and delivery bays , the building ’s history as a terrorist target , and its placement above and adjacent to a Consolidated Edison substation that provided much of the power for Lower Manhattan .
Rudolph W. Giuliani , the mayor then , has acknowledged some police skepticism about the site , but he has described it as resulting from a jurisdictional dispute between police officials and his emergency management director , who had played a role in selecting the site .
The Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers of America has used the Digital Millennium Copyright
Act to fraudulently remove numerous non-infringing works from Scribd , a site that allows the general public to share text files with one another in much the same way that Flickr allows its users to share pictures .
Included in the takedown were : a junior high teacher 's bibliography of works that will excite children about reading sf , the back - catalog of a magazine called Ray Gun Revival , books by other authors who have never authorized SFWA to act on their behalf , such as Bruce Sterling , and my own Creative Commons - licensed novel , " Down and Out in the Magic Kingdom . "
The list of works to be removed was sent by " epiracy@sfwa.org " on August 17 , described as works by Isaac Asimov and Robert Silverberg that had been uploaded without permission and were infringing on copyright .
In a followup email on August 23 , SFWA Vice President Andrew Burt noted that the August 17 list was n't " idle musing , but a DMCA notice . "
The 1998 Digital Millennium Copyright
Act allows copyright holders to use " notices " to force ISPs to remove material from the Internet on a mere say - so .
In the real world , you could n't get a book taken out of a bookstore or an article removed from the newspaper without going to court and presenting evidence of infringement to a judge , but the DMCA only requires that you promise that the work you 're complaining about infringes , and ISPs have to remove the material or face liability for hosting it .
As a result of SFWA 's takedown notice , hundreds of works were taken offline — including several that had not been written by Asimov or Silverberg .
It appears that the list was compiled by searching out every single file that contained the word " Asimov " or " Silverberg " and assuming that these files necessarily infringed on Silverberg and Asimov 's copyrights .
This implies that Robert Silverberg and the Asimov estate have asked SFWA to police their copyrights for them , but it 's important to note that many of the other authors whose work was listed in the August 17 email did not nominate SFWA to represent them .
Indeed , I have told Vice President Burt on multiple occasions that he may not represent me as a rightsholder in negotiations with Amazon , and other electronic publishing venues .
More importantly , many of the works that were listed in the takedown were written by the people who'd posted them to Scribd — these people have been maligned and harmed by SFWA , who have accused them of being copyright violators and have caused their material to be taken offline .
These people made the mistake of talking about and promoting science fiction — by compiling a bibliography of good works to turn kids onto science fiction , by writing critical or personal essays that quoted science fiction novels , or by discussing science fiction .
SFWA — whose business is to promote science fiction reading — has turned readers into collateral damage in a campaign to make Scribd change its upload procedures .
Specifically , in the Aug 23 email , SFWA Vice President Andrew Burt demands that Scribd require its uploaders to swear on pain of perjury that the works they are uploading do not infringe copyright .
SFWA has taken it upon itself to require legal oaths of people who want to publish any kind of thought , document , letter , jeremiad , story or rant on Scribd .
Not just " pirates . "
Not just people writing about science fiction , or posting material by SFWA members — SFWA is asking that anyone writing anything for publication on Scribd take this oath of SFWA 's devising .
Ironically , by sending a DMCA notice to Scribd , SFWA has perjured itself by swearing that every work on that list infringed a copyright that it represented .
Since this is not the case , SFWA has exposed itself to tremendous legal liability .
The DMCA grants copyright holders the power to demand the removal of works without showing any evidence that these works infringe copyright , a right that can amount to de facto censorship when exercised without due care or with malice .
The courts have begun to recognize this , and there 's a burgeoning body of precedent for large judgements against careless , malicious or fraudulent DMCA notices — for example , Diebold was ordered to pay $ 150,000 125,000 for abusing the DMCA takedown process .
I am a former Director of SFWA , and can recall many instances in which concern over legal liability for the organization swayed our decision - making process .
By sending out this indiscriminate dragnet , SFWA has been exposed to potential lawsuits from all the authors whose works they do not represent , from the Scribd users whose original works were taken offline , and from Scribd itself .
In addition to the legal risks , SFWA 's actions have exposed it and its members to professional risk .
For example , the page that used to host my book , Down and Out in the Magic Kingdom now reads , " The document ' Down and Out in the Magic Kingdom ' has been removed from Scribd .
This content has been removed at the request of copyright agent Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers of America . "
Down and Out in the Magic Kingdom was the first novel released under a Creative Commons license , and I 've spent the past four years exhorting fans to copy my work and share it .
Now I 've started to hear from readers who 've seen this notice and concluded that I am a hypocrite who uses SFWA to send out legal threats to people who heeded my exhortation .
In discussing this with my agent , Russell Galen , I was made aware of another potential problem : Scribd does end up hosting infringing works ( just like Flickr , Blogger , LiveJournal and any other site that lets users upload their own files ) that writers and their agents can remove by sending in legitimate DMCA notices ( Russ tells me that he 's sent Scribd notices on behalf of the Philip K Dick estate , another of his clients ) .
When SFWA begins to muddy the waters by asserting that the organization is its members ' representative for copyright , they make it harder for actual copyright enforcement agents to do their job — how much harder will it be for Russ to convince Scribd that he is Dick 's representative now that they 've been burned by SFWA ?
There 's no excuse for this .
Even a naive Internet user should be able to understand that if you compile a list of every file online that has the word " Asimov " in it , you 'll get a lot of works that were n't written by Isaac Asimov included in the search results .
In the case of Down and Out in the Magic Kingdom , the file included a blurb from Gardner Dozois , former longtime editor of Asimov 's Science Fiction Magazine — and it was that " Asimov " in " Asimov 's Science Fiction Magazine " that triggered the takedown .
Even a naive user should know better — and SFWA Vice President Andrew Burt ( who got his position through an uncontested ballot ) is a computer scientist and programmer with experience in this field .
Indeed , he previously created a system called " Shades of Grey " that is supposed to ruin the ebook downloading experience by poisoning the Internet with corrupted copies of ebooks .
He convinced SFWA to appropriate funds from its operating capital to patent this idea , on the basis that publishers would pay SFWA to use it to make science fiction ebooks less attractive to readers ( I do n't understand the logic of this either ) .
During the last SFWA election , he promised to pay this money back .
SFWA 's copyright campaigns have been increasingly troublesome .
In recent years , they 've created a snitch line where they encourage sf lovers to fink on each other for copying books , created a loyalty oath for members in the guise of a " code of conduct " in which we are supposed to pledge to " not plagiarize , pirate , or otherwise infringe intellectual property rights ( copyright , patent , and trademark ) or encourage others to do so . "
What business SFWA has in telling its members how to think about , say , pharmaceutical patents , database copyrights , or trademark reform is beyond me .
In 2005 , SFWA sent out a push - poll to its members trying to scare members off of giving permission to Amazon to make the full text of their books searchable online .
All of this is pretty bad , but this month 's campaign against Scribd takes the cake .
I 'm a dues - paying SFWA member and past volunteer who relies on the free distribution of my books to sell printed books and earn my living .
By fraudulently removing my works from Scribd , SFWA is taking money out of my pocket — it 's the online equivalent of sending fake legal threats to bookstores demanding that they take my books off their shelves .

High Quality on Youtube Posted on Tuesday , March 11 2008
Youtube has slowly started to create better quality versions of many videos , adding links that say , " Watch this video in higher quality . "
See this High Quality example and compare it to Youtube 's Normal Quality .
Comparison of Normal Youtube vs Youtube High Quality
- Normal Youtube High Quality Youtube Screen Res. 320 x 240 480 x 360 Bitrate ~200 kbps ~900 kbps Audio 22 KHz 64 kbps Mono ABR 44.1KHz 96 kbps Mono CBR Frame Rate 30 30 Video Codec Flash Sorenson Flash Sorenson Audio Codec Mp3 Mp3
Update : HD Quality & Embedding
Checkout this video with fmt=22 .
The specs are 1280 x 720 , 30 fps , 2000 kbps video AVC , 232 kbps audio AAC , 44.1 khz stereo .
Most videos do n't support this yet or do not meet the ( unknown ) requirements .
To embed youtube HD quality add &ap=%2526 fmt%3D22 to the end of the embed code urls .
Getting iPod compatible mp4s !
Adding & fmt=6 to the end of any youtube video's url will give you Youtube 's new high quality setting .
Changing the number from 6 to something else yields different formats though it 's not obvious which numbers work .
Format 18 generates an mp4 using h264 with AAC stereo , which is compatible with video iPods .
This is way better than using a service like vixy .
net , which transcodes the crappy quality youtube vid into an mp4 .
Using fmt=18 , you get a video transcoded from the original clip the user uploaded .
The bitrate is lower on the mp4 version , but since the resolution is smaller it compensates .
The h.264 codec has better looking videos at lower bitrates anyway .
We finally see stereo on youtube with the mp4 version !
It has a widescreen 16/9 aspect ratio rather than 4/3 .
Correction :
Previously I thought the mp4 screen resolution was 480 x 270 , but it 's also 480x360 .
If the video is a smaller resolution it wo n't make it bigger , but 480x360 seems to be the max increase .
It could be that both formats have the possibility to be 480x270 if their aspect ratio is close to 16/9 width / height .
The mp4 version may add an additional small audio gain and a small sharpening effect .

Downloading the MP4 and High Quality Videos
Video downloaders like keepvid still work .
Enter the url , click download , now grab the link and add & fmt=6 or &fmt=18 ( for mp4 ) to the end .
The good people at lifehacker created an easy to use firefox extension that will put a download link under each vid .
You can also get the download url if you follow my wireshark tutorial but the process is pretty tedious .
You can do it manually too , but it 's annoying .
Go to any video on youtube , right click then click view source .
Click ctrl+F , which will open a searchbox and type &t= .
Next copy the value after the t= but before any " & " characters .
Grab that and the video_id and your set .
The vid id is the v=something part of the url .
Just copy the variables into the url below .
www.youtube.com/get_video?video_id=&t=&fmt=18
Example
Vid URL : http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVYp2sgA9M0
Find the &t= in the page source and attach to template url above , then download .
The &t= var expires so you cannot setup permalinks to video download urls .
You may want to pass it to a download manager like wget .
If you load it in the browser it will display a bunch of gibberish while it loads the entire video 's ASCII representation into your browser .
Howto Get Videos to Play HQ by Default
This option has not been implemented on many accounts but the howto is already present in the youtube help pages .
You need a youtube account to be able to do this .
Go to your Account page .
Under � Manage My Videos� click the �HQ Video Playback Setting� link .
Select the playback setting that makes sense for you .
Click the � Save� button .
Criteria for a Video to Become HQ
The exact settings are n't know yet for the video to become high quality .
We could assume that the exact minimum settings are the same as encoded format listed above , however youtube has changed their " best format to upload high quality " help page to set the video resolution to 640 x 480 .
Maybe high quality will support different formats and aspect ratios in the future .
It 's best to upload as high quality as possible .
The new multi video uploader makes it easy on a unreliable connection .
Even if your upload times out or you get disconnected it will restart the uploading process exactly where it left off .
Embed High Quality Youtube Clips
Update
This code works fine to embed the mp4 version .
The magic query string var is " &ap=%2526 fmt%3D18 " specifying format 18 .
Just replace ( VIDEO EMBED URL ) with the video ID .
Note that there 's a huge disadvantage in that there is no seeking .
The fmt=6 embed version is less reliable .
< object width = " 480 " height = " 397 " >< param name = " movie " value= " ( VIDEO EMBED URL ) &ap=%2526fmt%3D18 " ></ param >< param name = " wmode " value= " window " ></ param >< embed src= " ( VIDEO EMBED URL ) &ap=%2526fmt%3D18 " type= " application /x-shockwave - flash " wmode = " window " width = " 480 " height =
" 397 " ></embed ></object >
Ignore Below
Currently there is no official way to embed the High Quality videos on your website / myspace / blogs .
It 's possible , but a big hassle , and it 's impossible to turn off autoplay .
Here 's an example you can embed if you want to see it for yourself .
Remove the line breaks for best results
< object width = " 425 " height = " 355 " >< embed autoplay = " false " quality = " high " src= " http://www.youtube.com/player2.swf " flashvars="vq=2
&sourceid=r
&video_id=pVYp2sgA9M0
&l=239
&sk=5E_4xTZlkQqZYuyEXwBRzQU
& fmt_map=18/512000/9/0/115
&t=OEgsToPDskItDX5Cg05utBXEP1wh76mc
&hl=en
&plid=AARIM8FsSohHKlMVAAAAIIAoQAA
& playnext=0 " type= " application /x-shockwave - flash " wmode=" transparent " width = " 425 " height =
" 355 " ></embed ></object >
It only works with youtube 's in - site player , player2.swf , rather than the player youtube has for embeds .
The problem is youtube 's in - site player does not have a variable to turn autoplay on or off and if you try embedding it to your site flash issues a warning that the script is trying to contact a remote server ( youtube.com ) .
Player2.swf seems to have an internal " ap " variable hidden in the actionscript but it seems to just break the vid no matter what options I set .
The key flashvar for high quality is " fmt_map=6/0/7/0/0 " and " fmt_map=18/512000/9/0/115 " for mp4s .
When enabled , the flv file comes from cache.googlevideo.com/videoplayback?itag=6 , without the fmt_map var it comes from cache.googlevideo.com /get_video , with normal quality .
To embed a high quality video you need to go to the video's page on youtube , view source , and grab the flashvar data .
The most important vars are video_id , t , and sk .
Just use the above embed code as a template and replace those values .
As for the rest : L defines how long the video is in seconds , hl is the home language , plid tries to find any associated playlists , playnext plays the next item on the playlist if there is one .
Making your youtube videos High Quality
Youtube will be automatically creating high quality versions of many videos for those that meet the guidelines .
The video quality is bad on youtube , partly because youtube encodes to such a small screen resolution with a low bitrate , but mainly because people post really low quality videos .
The crappy resolution youtube is actually what got it so popular .
Google video had originally allowed 640 x 480 with a great bitrate , but they failed miserably to compete against youtube ( so they later bought em out ) .
It made online video making / viewing possible even on crappy connections .
Take the time to resize your vid and sharpen it a bit before uploading .
A little noise reduction and color correction can't hurt either .
Use virtualdub and avisynth .
They 're free .
Use xvid or x264 and lame acm for the audio .
Divx is fine if you can get the pro version .
See doom9 for tons of guides on video creation / editing / improvement .
Youtube High Quality Hack
There is also a hack using total video converter where if you make an flv with certain settings you can upload a video of super high quality and have youtube keep the screen resolution and bitrate .
Youtube High Quality Hack Settings Howto
Select what you want to encode into an flv in total video converter with these settings .
Cons
Sample Rate : 44100 Hzaudio bit rate : 320.000 kbit / sAudio codec : mp3Custom video bit rate : anyResolution : any
It messes up the time on the video .
A 30 second video can read as 9 minutes .
The way it tells how long the video is seems very random but it constantly says the video is much longer than it really is .
Having the resolution or bitrate too high causes it to not stream well and get stuck .

Planetary scientists have puzzled for years over an apparent contradiction on Mars .
Abundant evidence points to an early warm , wet climate on the red planet , but there 's no sign of the widespread carbonate rocks , such as limestone , that should have formed in such a climate .
Now , a detailed analysis in the Dec. 21 issue of Science by MIT 's Maria T. Zuber and Itay Halevy and Daniel P. Schrag of Harvard University provides a possible answer to the mystery .
In addition to being warmed by a greenhouse effect caused by carbon dioxide in the atmosphere , as on Earth , the early Mars may have had the greenhouse gas sulfur dioxide in its atmosphere .
That would have interfered with the formation of carbonates , explaining their absence today .
It would also explain the discovery by the twin Mars rovers , Spirit and Opportunity , of sulfur - rich minerals that apparently formed in bodies of water in that early Martian environment .
And it may provide clues about the Earth 's history as well .
The challenge was to interpret the planet 's history , based on the data gathered by the Mars rovers -- and especially Opportunity 's discovery of sulfate minerals -- from just tiny fractions of the surface , says Zuber , who is head of MIT 's Department of Earth , Atmospheric and Planetary Sciences and the E.A. Griswold Professor of Geophysics .
" How do you take very detailed measurements of chemical composition at one tiny place on Mars , " she says , " and put it into the context of the broad evolution of the planet ? "
The breakthrough , she said , was when she and her colleagues realized " we 'd been after the wrong molecule . "
After several years of exploring the role of carbon dioxide and the carbon cycle , she said , they realized " maybe the key is sulfur dioxide , not carbon dioxide . "
It was Opportunity 's discovery of the mineral jarosite , which only forms in highly acidic water , that set them thinking about how that acidic environment could have come about .
Sulfur provided the answer .
The new analysis suggests that on Mars , sulfur went through a whole cycle through the atmosphere , bodies of water on the surface , and burial in the soil and crust , comparable to the well - known carbon cycle on Earth .
Through most of Earth 's history , carbon dioxide has been released in volcanic eruptions , then absorbed into seawater , where it fosters the formation of calcium carbonate ( limestone ) , which gets buried in ocean sediments .
Much evidence suggests
Mars may once have had an ocean that covered about a third of the planet , in its northern hemisphere .
Sulfur dioxide dissolves easily in water , so after being spewed into the atmosphere by the giant volcanoes of Mars '
Tharsis bulge , much of it would have ended up in the water , where it inhibited the formation of carbonate minerals but led to the formation of silicates and sulfites , such as calcium sulfite .
These minerals degrade relatively rapidly , so they would not be expected on the surface of Mars today .
But they also allow formation of clays , which have been found on Mars , and which added to the puzzle since clays are usually associated with the same conditions that produce carbonates .
The new picture of a sulfur cycle helps to solve another mystery , which is how early Mars could have been warm enough to sustain liquid water on its surface .
A carbon dioxide atmosphere produces some greenhouse warming , but sulfur dioxide is a much more powerful greenhouse gas .
Just 10 parts per million of sulfur dioxide in the mostly carbon dioxide air would double the amount of warming and make it easier for liquid water to be stable .
The analysis may also tell us something about our own planet 's past .
The early Earth 's environment could well have been similar to that on Mars , but most traces of that era have been erased by Earth 's very dynamic climate and tectonics .
" This might have been a phase that Earth went through " in its early years , Zuber says .
" It 's fascinating to think about whether this process may have played a role " in the evolution of the early Earth .
The work was funded by NASA , a Radcliffe fellowship , the George Merck Fund and a Harvard graduate fellowship .

When I wrote up my list of survey sites that I use on a regular basis to earn a little extra money , I said that I always get cash ( or gift cards where cash is not available ) as my compensation .
I do n’t do surveys that are “ sweepstakes entries ” and I do n’t select prizes .
Ever .
This past week , I almost got suckered into selecting a prize through my own idiocy , and I caught myself just in time .
One of the survey sites I use is called My Survey , and you earn points which can be redeemed for cash ( 1 point = 1 cent , minimum you earn for a very short screener survey is 10 points ) .
The cashout level is pretty low – 1000 points or $ 10 .
The last time I was ready to cash out , for some reason I decided to look at the prizes – I ’d never even looked at them before , I always redeemed for cash and went on my way .
Most of the prizes were uninteresting to me , but one caught my eye .
For 1000 points , you could get 50 4 x 6 prints from Snapfish along with a shipping credit equal to free standard shipping .
As I have mentioned before , I am a scrapbooker .
In my younger and more free - spending days , I accumulated a large collection of scrapbooking papers , stickers , and accessories .
Generally for me , scrapbooking now is a fairly frugal hobby , because all I usually need to buy is prints of the pictures for my project and sometimes an album or more page protectors for an existing album .
Not that these things are cheap , but it is a lot less expensive than buying everything for a project .
Being creative and using birthday presents for scrapbooking gift certificates , I have been able to scrapbook for several years now with very little spent out of pocket .
I have taken advantage of several promotional offers for free picture prints from various online services , but I am always on the lookout for more .
Pictures are not that expensive , but they do add up !
I had gotten a free set of prints from Snapfish in the past through My Points , and I was pleased with the quality of the prints , so this sounded like a great deal .
Free shipping !
50 prints !
Awesome .
Well , until I did some research and really did the math .
For 50 prints , Snapfish ’s price for shipping would be $ 3.44 .
So if I subtract that from $ 10.00 ( what 1000 points redeems for ) that leaves $ 6.56 as the actual cost of the prints , which divides out to a smidge over $ 0.13 per print ( $ 0.1312 to be exact ) .
That still did n’t sound too bad to me , until I looked up the regular price of prints on Snapfish ’s website .
$ 0.09 per print .
Whoops !
If I used 1000 points to claim this prize , it would actually cost me $ 2.06 more ( $ 0.0412 x 50 ) than if I got a $ 10.00 check and then just bought prints through Snapfish ’s website .
This is assuming I pay tax either way – if I pay tax on the prints when using cash and not when using the prize card , that reduces my savings to ~ $ 1.59 , but it is still a savings .
It is less expensive , either way , to get the $ 10 in cash and then just buy 50 prints directly from Snapfish .
The only downside to that is I probably will not buy prints anytime soon – the nice thing about a “ prize ” is that since it is money I do n’t actually have yet , it is easier for me to “ let go ” of it .
Which is n’t a great thing , either .
I need the $ 10 .
I do n’t need more pictures to scrapbook .
That can wait until I am out of debt , or much closer to it .
I have n’t finished using the pictures I already have printed from redeeming some Pampers Points ( more on that in the future , I hate when “ free ” is n’t really “ free ” … ) so it is not like I am sitting around with no pictures to use .
And my birthday is this month .
I may get a new album for my birthday and have plenty of scrapbooking to do , with no new pictures purchased .
The moral of this story is that prizes are generally a bad deal !
Do n’t use one just because it * sounds * good .
Actually do the research and do the math is the lesson I reinforced for myself .
In general , prizes are overpriced as far as how many “ points ” you need to use to get them , and you are better off getting the money and using that to buy the prize yourself .
Remember – it is still money !
Do n’t get a bad deal on a prize just because it is “ free ” – if you can get more cash than the prize is worth , you ’re wasting money and overpaying .

Where else but Japan could you see seas of people gathered around girls dressed in maid outfits in the middle of the street ?
I wonder if we could do this here in the states without protests from all sorts of groups .
I ’m all for womans rights , but some of the girls that cosplay for the public in Japan are making money from it and really enjoy the attention .
But then again , that does sound very similar to a hooker .
Hmm , ok .
Well many of the fans really have a sincere desire to see their favorite characters from Anime in real life .
Hmm , role play ?
Well whatever the case , I would love to see it in the states .
Sure you can see it at any con you go to , but to have an impromptu photo session on some street is the real thing .
I feel bad for the people in the back , if you do n’t get there early , you dont get the optimal front row low spot closest to ground zero .
This is almost like a competition .
Gotta get the infamous panty shot !
Makes you wonder what do they do with the videos …
I ’m sure we will get some of those video cameras here in the states in 2011 .

The race looks poised to swing his way after a series of votes , beginning tomorrow with caucuses in Washington state , Nebraska and the Virgin Islands and a primary in Louisiana .
The Clinton campaign team anticipates that she will lose her lead in the delegate count this month but is banking on her regaining the lead in the mega-states of Texas and Ohio on March 4 and Pennsylvania on April 22 .
It will be psychologically and symbolically important for Obama to take the lead after trailing for so long , albeit not by much .
He is already ahead of his rival in fundraising .
The Clinton campaign is expected to change its tack following the emergence of John McCain as the likely Republican adversary .
The Clinton camp is expected to argue that she is better placed to deal with McCain on security and economics .
Her team is also expected to bring up a testy exchange of letters between McCain and Obama in 2006 .
McCain accused Obama of backtracking on a promise to support him over a bill to restrict lobbying .
He accused Obama of " self - interested partisan posturing " .
Obama responded to say he was " puzzled " by McCain 's outburst .
" It was sad to watch , " said a Clinton campaign source .
" He has no idea how to deal with McCain . "
The two are seeking to win 2,025 delegates , the magic number that would give them a majority of delegates at the party convention in August where the Democratic nominee for the November presidential election will be chosen .
The final tally of delegates has still not been allocated after Super Tuesday .
The 2008 Democratic Convention Watch website today gave Clinton a total of 862 elected delegates to Obama 's 883 .
But when super - delegates - the 700 - plus members of Congress , governors and others who automatically have a vote at the conventions - are taken into account , she has 1,065 and Obama 996 .
Clinton 's team expects Obama to take a bigger share at some point this month .
After this weekend , Virginia , Maryland and Washington DC vote on Tuesday and Wisconsin and Hawaii on February 19 .
There is growing concern in the Democratic party that the two could exhaust one another , deplete funds and damage one another with day - to - day criticism at a time when the Republicans have more or less settled on John McCain .
But the Republicans are by no means united behind their candidate , and president George Bush intervened in the race for the first time today to call on his divided party to back the nominee , though without naming McCain .
Many conservative Republicans are openly hostile towards McCain because of his moderate stance on immigration and his willingness to work with Democrats in the Senate .
While McCain will distance himself from the unpopular president in the run-up to the November election , Bush 's endorsement could help overcome the hostility of the Republican base towards him .
He needs those Republican activists to work for him in the November election .
Meanwhile , prehistoric women , who gathered more - sedentary food , probably found their way to and from the most bountiful and nutritious plants with the help of landmarks .
In a study last year at the University of California at Santa Barbara , evolutionary psychologist Joshua New tested this theory in a farmers ' market .
After a single tasting tour of the market , women could more accurately point to food stalls they had visited , noting , in particular , the locations of foods with high energy content .
With the benefit of food stalls as landmarks , women knew their way around better than men .

Bolstering disintegrating neural connections may help boost brainpower in Alzheimer ’s disease patients , MIT researchers and colleagues will report in the Nov. 8 issue of Neuron .
The researchers zeroed in on the enzymes that manipulate a key scaffolding protein for synapses , the connections through which brain cells communicate .
Synapses are weakened and lost in neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer ’s and Parkinson ’s disease .
“ We identified a major underlying mechanism through which synapses are strengthened and maintained , ” said Morgan H. Sheng , Menicon Professor of Neuroscience at MIT ’s Picower Institute for Learning and Memory .
“ The enzymes involved could be good targets for potential drug treatments . ”
A protein called postsynaptic density - 95 ( PSD - 95 ) is a key building block of synapses .
Like the steel girders in a building , it acts as a scaffold around which other components are assembled .
“ The more PSD - 95 molecules , the bigger and stronger the synapse , ” said co-author Myung Jong Kim , a Picower research scientist .
Previous research had shown that mice genetically altered to have less PSD - 95 experienced learning and memory problems .
In the current study , the researchers identified for the first time the enzymes that work behind the scenes on PSD - 95 , adding a phosphate group to a specific amino acid in the PSD - 95 protein .
This process–called phosphorylation –is critical for PSD - 95 to do its job in supporting synapses .
“ Adding a phosphate group to a single amino acid allows PSD - 95 to promote synapse size and strength , ” said Sheng , who also holds an appointment in MIT ’s Department of Brain and Cognitive Sciences and is a Howard Hughes Medical Institute investigator .
“ Therefore , promoting this process could help improve cognitive function . ”
Sheng believes manipulating PSD - 95 through phosphorylation could lead to bigger and more robust synapses , which would boost brainpower in both normal and diseased brains .
“ It ’s possible that promoting PSD - 95 phosphorylation could also help neuropsychiatric illnesses in which synapse function goes awry , such as schizophrenia , depression and autism , ” Sheng said .
In addition to Sheng and Kim , authors include Picower research scientist Kensuke Futai ; Yasunori Hayashi , MIT assistant professor of neurobiology and RIKEN - MIT investigator ; and Jihoon Yu and Kwangwook Cho of the University of Bristol in England .
This research is supported by the National Institutes of Health .

It brings tears to my eyes , the power it must have taken to do this .
The planets Allatiouray A and B were close together to begin with .
When they were discovered , their atmospheres were abrading against each other , slowly leeching momentum .
They were only a few hundred years away from colliding .
And there was no reason not to let them ; the planets were bald and sterile ; their collision would have been spectacular , but unproblematic .
But some insane sculptor had a better idea ... and when you have power ...
Recruiting an enthusiastic fleet of like - minded sentient starships , he stripped both planets of their atmosphere , spiralling the cocktail of gases off in a thousand - kilometre - wide display which is still on the system 's outskirts , a work of art in its own right .
Then he siphoned heat energy from the planets ' interiors , cooling them and slowing the magma motion inside them until they became inert .
That would prevent minor gravitational fluctuations from perturbing their shared orbits .
Then he flattened them , and killed their ( nominal ) magnetic fields .
There could not be imperfections .
Inert , rigid , solid spheres .
It could have been done with the atmosphere and the rest still present , sure - but it would have required constant maintenance , and that was n't the point .
He wanted his work to be free - standing , and for that he needed to remove additional variables .
After that it was just mathematics ; unbelievably ancient mathematics , applied with surgical precision .
Rotation .
Relative motion .
Matching .
Matching perfectly , to make Allatiouray A and B two planets , locked permanently face - to - face in orbit around each other ...
Using my suit 's inertia controls I pivot in space and plant my feet on fused marble , below me .
Then I stretch up and plant my palms against the rock ceiling above .
Allatiouray A and B are locked in orbit around each other .
And they are separated by a distance of six feet .
I am Atlas , stopping the sky from falling .
I am an action hero , being crushed in a villainous trap .
I am gravity , invisibly binding worlds together .
I am Ed MacPherson , and I am standing on one planet while touching another .

George and Associates have helped supply numerous persons with the ability to produce resultes on a polygraph that violate basic values of most Americans , and no shame from either .
Where is the surprise in that ?
So intenet on destroying the use of insturmentation to aid security of our country is of no concern , just winning a battle against use of polygraphics and " I win You Loose " is the goal .
Congradulations on your accomplishment George and Associates .
Which basic values are on your mind ?
The ones that provide every American is entitled to be bamboozled , lied to and blindly led to believe mistruths and injustices ?
Sorry , those do not match my values .
The instrumentation you speak of does little to provide security to our nation .
In reality it is a detriment to rely upon polygraph evidence as a means of determining truth .
Perhaps a crystal ball would be helpful for national security .
At least it would be a bit easier to hurl toward the enemy than a computer program and blood pressure cuff .
As to the argument you elude to :
It 's currently the best we have at our disposal .
Well , if air travel was plagued with as many accidents as polygraph is with incorrect results would you feel the same ?
Another jet went down , but it 's the best we got .
Lie detection must be scientifically proven before it can receive due reliance .
So far that is not the case .
Maybe we should issue every soldier an M - 1 Garand rather than modern weaponry .
Those rifles worked well in WWII .
Also , you may want to check your local library , university library or law library and see what information you can find about polygraphy .
The information that polygraph testing is not reliable is not found only here .
Just think , according to what you have stated , you believe that for national security purposes , our nation should continue using testing which is easily foiled .
That is according to your statement , not mine .

We live a wonderful life here in our little house in Tahoe .
The location is great , the weather is wonderful , our neighbors rock .
I realize that of the three of us , I am the only one in a comitted relationship , and I am fine with that .
I will be moving out in the next few months , and you will have to find a third roommate .
Before this happens , however , I wanted to make a suggestion that will make the new roommate 's life a little easier .
Stop picking up hitchhikers , bringing them home , and fucking them all over the house .
Yeah , I know , kind of a petty demand .
After all , you can't drive through town without seeing some hot little South American girl with her thumb out .
And Tahoe is kind of lacking in the female department , so I see where you 're coming from .
But really , do you have to bring every girl you pick up home and have loud , house shaking sex with them ?
I admit you 've both got it down to a science :
Pick up hot Brazillian chick , show off the 10 words of Portugese you 've learned , somehow coerce them into coming over and having sex with you , then drive them home and hope to never pick them up again .
I admit , it 's a pretty sweet life .
At first it was mildly entertaining to see what walked in the door .
But after 3 month of constant porno sounds eminating from all corners of the house , it is starting to get on my nerves .
I think what pushed me over the edge was the day I came home and found you two tag teaming some foreign chick in the living room , giving each other high fives over the top of her .
I live in fear of bringing any of my friends over without doing some recon first .
I should not have to call my house and ask if you 're balls deep in some girls ass or if the coast is clear .
None of this was disclosed when I signed the lease .
So please , I beg you to reconsider your actions for the sake of whomever replaces me .
It 's like living in a bad porno .
Sincerely , Your Roommateps .
The next time you ask me to borrow a condom because you 're out , there will be a $ 30 charge per rubber .
It 's the least you can do .

Making loans and fighting poverty are normally two of the least glamorous pursuits around , but put the two together and you have an economic innovation that has become not just popular but downright chic .
The innovation — ​microfinance — ​involves making small loans to poor entrepreneurs , usually in developing countries .
It has been around since the nineteen - seventies , but in the past few years it has seized the imaginations of economists , activists , and bankers alike .
The U.N. declared 2005 the International Year of Microcredit , and the microfinance pioneer Muhammad Yunus won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2006 , while celebrities like Natalie Portman and companies like Benetton have become fervent microloan advocates .
Even ordinary Americans can now get in on the act , at sites like Kiva.org , where you can make a microloan yourself .
( Right now , a clothing vender in Cambodia needs seven hundred dollars to “ purchase more clothes to sell . ” )
This vogue has translated into a flood of real dollars : institutional and individual investments in microfinance more than doubled between 2004 and 2006 , to $ 4.4 billion , and the total volume of loans made has risen to $ 25 billion , according to Deutsche Bank .
Unfortunately , it has also translated into a flood of hype .
There ’s no doubt that microfinance does a tremendous amount of good , yet there are also real limits to what it can accomplish .
Microloans make poor borrowers better off .
But , on their own , they often do n’t do much to make poor countries richer .
This is n’t because microloans do n’t work ; it ’s because of how they work .
The idealized view of microfinance is that budding entrepreneurs use the loans to start and grow businesses — expanding operations , boosting inventory , and so on .
The reality is more complicated .
Microloans are often used to “ smooth consumption ” — tiding a borrower over in times of crisis .
They ’re also , as Karol Boudreaux and Tyler Cowen point out in a recent paper , often used for non-business expenses , such as a child ’s education .
It ’s less common to find them used to fund major business expansions or to hire new employees .
In part , this is because the loans can be very small — frequently as little as fifty or a hundred dollars — and generally come with very high interest rates , often above thirty or forty per cent .
But it ’s also because most microbusinesses are n’t looking to take on more workers .
The vast majority have only one paid employee : the owner .
As the economist Jonathan Morduch has put it , microfinance “ rarely generates new jobs for others . ”
This matters , because businesses that can generate jobs for others are the best hope of any country trying to put a serious dent in its poverty rate .
Sustained economic growth requires companies that can make big investments — building a factory , say — and that can exploit the economies of scale that make workers more productive and , ultimately , richer .
Microfinance evangelists sometimes make it sound as if , in an ideal world , everyone would own his own business .
“ All people are entrepreneurs , ” Muhammad Yunus has said .
But in any successful economy most people are n’t entrepreneurs — they make a living by working for someone else .
Just fourteen per cent of Americans , for instance , are running ( or trying to run ) their own business .
That percentage is much higher in developing countries — in Peru , it ’s almost forty per cent .
That ’s not because Peruvians are more entrepreneurial .
It ’s because they do n’t have other options .
What poor countries need most , then , is not more microbusinesses .
They need more small - to - medium - sized enterprises , the kind that are bigger than a fruit stand but smaller than a Fortune 1000 corporation .
In high - income countries , these companies create more than sixty per cent of all jobs , but in the developing world they ’re relatively rare , thanks to a lack of institutions able to provide them with the capital they need .
It ’s easy for really big companies in poor countries to tap the markets for funding , and now , because of microfinance , it ’s possible for really small enterprises to get money , too .
But the companies in between find it hard .
It ’s a phenomenon that has been dubbed the “ missing middle . ”
The problem is a dearth not just of lenders but also of people willing to buy an ownership stake in companies , like the angel investors and venture capitalists that American entrepreneurs often rely on .
Microfinance has led us to focus on lending , but it can be hard for young companies to get big purely on bank loans , which consume cash flow that could be reinvested in the business .
Supplying the missing middle will require backers who want to invest in companies rather than just lend to them .
There ’s been some progress on this front of late ; three weeks ago , Google.org , the Soros Economic Development Fund , and the Omidyar Network announced that they are setting up a firm in India that will invest only in small - to - medium businesses .
But there have yet to be celebrities speaking up for the missing middle .
Both socially and economically , microloans do a lot of good , working what Boudreaux and Cowen call “ Micromagic . ”
But the overselling of their promise has made us neglect the enterprises that could be real engines of macromagic .
The cult of the entrepreneur that the microfinance boom has helped foster is understandably appealing .
But thinking that everyone is , and should be , an entrepreneur leads us to underrate the virtues of larger businesses and of the income that a steady job can provide .
To be sure , for some people the best route out of poverty will be a bank loan .
But for most it ’s going to be something much simpler : a regular paycheck . ♦

Nicholas Kristof writes :
I changed my mind [ on legalization ] after looking at the experiences of other countries .
The Netherlands formally adopted the legalization model in 2000 , and there were modest public health benefits for the licensed prostitutes .
But legalization nurtured a large sex industry and criminal gangs that trafficked underage girls , and so trafficking , violence and child prostitution flourished rather than dying out .
As a result , the Netherlands is now backtracking on its legalization model by closing some brothels , and other countries , like Bulgaria , are backing away from that approach .
A few points in response : first , " backtracking " could and should have been written as " still maintained as mostly legal throughout the country . "
Second , Germany offers perhaps the best model for legalized prostitution ; by the way , here is one odd description of the German practice in Cologne .
It ’s not so offputting to make me favor a ban .
Third , we should institute drastically higher penalties and enforcement for traffickers in children and their customers .
Do n’t blame adult transactions for that problem or think that is the best resource investment to stop it .
Fourth , legalized prostitution may not be " popular " because it does n’t appeal to the median voter , least of all to the median female voter .
So the mere popularity of Swedish policy does n’t make it a success ; there is less consensual sex going on !
We all debate the topic without bringing up the delicate question of the benefits ( or lack thereof ? ) to the customers .
No one wants to say " I think guys should be able to [ fill in the blank ] more often and more easily , " but that ’s what at least half the story boils down to .
( The other half is the possibility of female empowerment , etc. )
Such a framing maybe sounds bad to you , but that ’s a feeling we need to come to terms with and indeed question .
I see the costs and benefits of legalization as murky .
Should government attempt to steer women away from the psychological tendencies implanted in them by child abuse ?
Indeed , should such steering stop at their choices to become prostitutes ?
When doing our cost - benefit analysis , should we count the preferences of the man sitting quietly at home or the preferences of the man as he approaches the end of the act ?
How should we count the preferences — if at all — of the bluenoses who do n’t like the whole idea of legalization ?
After all , there are lots of them and they just do n’t want legal prostitution .
These are difficult questions .
When push comes to shove it is fundamentally a moral question and that for me means legalization or at least decriminalization .
Ultimately you are threatening to jail or even shoot someone ( should he or she try to leave the jail ) because of a particular interpretation you have placed on their consensual sexual acts .
I have to say " no way " to that one .
Is barter a problem too ?
Andrew Sullivan pointed out that it is legal to pay two people to have sex and film them and sell the film ; it just is n’t legal to pay two people to have sex and simply watch them .
That ’s what I call absurd .
The emotional tone that men and women take during arguments with a spouse can also take a toll on their health .
Utah researchers have videotaped 150 couples to measure the effect that marital arguing style has on heart risk .
The men and women were mostly in their 60s , had been married on average for more than 30 years and had no signs of heart disease .
The couples were given stressful topics to discuss , like money or household chores , and the comments made during the ensuing arguments were categorized as warm , hostile , controlling or submissive .
The men and women also underwent heart scans to measure coronary artery calcium , an indicator of heart disease risk .
The researchers found that the style of argument detected in the video sessions was a powerful predictor for a man or woman ’s risk for underlying heart disease .
In fact , the way the couple interacted was as important a heart risk factor as whether they smoked or had high cholesterol , says Timothy W. Smith , a psychology professor at the University of Utah , who presented the study last year to the American Psychosomatic Society .
For women , whether a husband ’s arguing style was warm or hostile had the biggest effect on her heart health .
Dr. Smith notes that in a fight about money , for instance , one man said , “ Did you pass elementary school math ? ”
But another said , “ Bless you , you are not so good with the checkbook , but you ’re good at other things . ”
In both exchanges , the husband was criticizing his wife ’s money management skills , but the second comment was infused with a level of warmth .
In the study , a warm style of arguing by either spouse lowered the wife ’s risk of heart disease .
But arguing style affected men and women differently .
The level of warmth or hostility had no effect on a man ’s heart health .
For a man , heart risk increased if disagreements with his wife involved a battle for control .
And it did n’t matter whether he or his wife was the one making the controlling comments .
An example of a controlling argument style showed up in one video of a man arguing with his wife about money .
“ You really should just listen to me on this , ” he told her .
What ’s particularly notable about the study is that the men and women filled out standard questionnaires about the quality of their relationships , but those answers were not a good predictor of cardiovascular risk .
The difference in risk showed up only when the quality of the couple ’s bickering style was assessed .
“ Disagreements in a marriage are inevitable , but it ’s how you conduct yourself , ” Dr. Smith said .
“ Can you do it in a way that gets your concerns addressed , but without doing damage at the same time ?
That ’s not an easy mark to hit for some couples . ”
Renault is focusing on the development of an on - board multi-fuel reformer to produce the hydrogen to power the fuel cell , thereby sidestepping the current problems with very high - pressure , cryogenic , or materials - based storage , as well as the need for a hydrogen distribution network .
Renault will present an update on its work on fuel - cell vehicles at the 16th World Hydrogen Energy Conference in Lyons , France , which opens today .
Renault , Nissan and Nuvera Fuel Cells have been working together on this solution since 2002 .
The chemical processes of the on - board reformer .
Click to enlarge .
The on - board reformer transforms the liquid fuel into reformate , a hydrogen - rich gas that can be used to supply the fuel cell .
The process has six distinct stages with five primary systems : a burner , an autothermal reformer ( ATR ) , a high temperature shift ( HTS ) system , a preferential oxidation system ( PROX ) , and a low temperature shift ( LTS ) system .
First , the cracking phase breaks down the long hydrocarbon molecule chains into simpler molecules : hydrogen , water , carbon , etc .
In the next five stages , the gas is purified until it is ready for use with the 45 kW fuel cell .
The reformate emerges with about 40 % H 2 and 100 ppm CO , the rest being water , CO 2 and nitrogen .
At maximum power output , the hydrogen production rate is about 1.4 g/second , according to Renault .
The reformer can run on gasoline , diesel and ethanol , so Renault had to design a special multi- fuel tank for all three .
Trenault chose the multi-fuel approach to reduce concerns about the future availability of hydrocarbons .
It also means that motorists can choose the cheapest available type of fuel .
When Renault announced its Renault Commitment 2009 in February , it confirmed that the group was preparing a broad range of alternative technologies , of which the fuel cell is just one part .

CHICAGO ( Reuters ) - Barack Obama raised a record $ 55 million in February , beating rival Hillary Clinton ’s total and ensuring a big - spending battle for the Democratic presidential nomination in the months ahead .
Obama ’s haul , announced by aides on Thursday , was a fund - raising record for a single month .
It trumped Clinton ’s $ 35 million in February and gave the Illinois senator some much needed good news after two critical losses in Ohio and Texas .
Clinton dodged a possible knockout blow in the presidential race with the wins over Obama on Tuesday , setting up a long and bruising fight for the Democratic nomination to face Republican John McCain in November ’s election .
The New York senator raised $ 4 million over the Internet since her big wins and $ 6 million since the month began , her campaign said .
Clinton spokesman Howard Wolfson criticized Obama ’s promise to be more aggressive in the aftermath of Tuesday ’s losses and likened him to independent prosecutor Ken Starr , a lightning rod for Democratic criticism during the 1998 probe that led to President Bill Clinton ’s impeachment .
“ I for one do not believe that imitating Ken Starr is the way to win a Democratic primary election for president , but perhaps that theory will be tested , ” Wolfson told reporters .
Starr led an investigation of Bill Clinton , Hillary Clinton ’s husband , which focused on Clinton ’s denials under oath about his sexual relations with White House intern Monica Lewinsky .
The House of Representatives impeached Bill Clinton on perjury and obstruction of justice charges , but he was acquitted in a Senate trial .
Starr ’s probe was attacked by Democrats as politically motivated .
Obama said on Wednesday he planned to step up criticism of Hillary Clinton and raise more questions about her national security credentials and issues like her refusal so far to release her recent personal tax returns .
Obama ’s comments were in response to what his campaign called Clinton ’s “ slash - and - burn ” tactics in the contests in Ohio and Texas , where she questioned his readiness to be commander in chief and lead on the economy .
“ When Senator Obama was confronted with questions over whether he was ready to be commander in chief and steward of the economy , he chose not to address the questions but to attack Senator Clinton , and that ’s what we ’re pointing out , ” Wolfson said in a conference call with reporters .
‘ ABSURD ’
Obama ’s campaign quickly labeled Wolfson ’s comments “ absurd . ”

“ After weeks of badgering the media to ‘ vet ’ Senator Obama , the Clinton campaign believes that they should be held to an entirely different standard , ” Obama spokesman Bill Burton said .
“ We do n’t believe that expecting candidates for the presidency to disclose their tax returns somehow constitutes Ken Starr - tactics , but the kind of transparency and accountability that Americans are looking for , ” he said .
The Obama campaign said more than $ 54 million of his February donations were for the primary campaign battle with Clinton .
It included more than 385,000 first - time contributors , bringing the total number of donors to more than 1 million .
Slideshow ( 3 images )
With 12 contests remaining , Clinton still faces a difficult task in overcoming Obama ’s lead in pledged delegates who will choose the nominee at the convention .
But Obama also is unlikely to reach the 2,025 delegates needed to win , turning attention back to their efforts to woo 796 “ superdelegates ” -- party officials and insiders -- who are free to back any candidate and could make the difference in the race .
It also renews the focus on the states of Florida and Michigan , which were stripped of their delegates in a dispute with the national party but held unsanctioned contests anyway .
Talks have resumed about the possibility of a “ do - over ” in those two contests , which Clinton won even though no candidates campaigned .
Obama was not even on the Michigan ballot .
The two campaigns , the state parties and the national party would have to agree on the formats and timing of new contests .
Florida Sen. Bill Nelson , a Democrat , called for a new primary in the state and said the national party should pay for it .
“ We ca n’t go on and ignore two of the largest and most important states , ” he said .
The next contests in the Democratic race are on Saturday in Wyoming , which has 12 delegates at stake , and Tuesday in Mississippi , which has 33 delegates at stake .
The race will then have six weeks until the next battle in Pennsylvania on April 22 .
Clinton , looking to emphasize national security , held a meeting in Washington with top military leaders and experts such as former U.N. Ambassador Richard Holbrooke , former Navy Secretary John Dalton and several retired officers who voiced their support .

AH !
Now everyone suddenly is in agreement that speculators – and not market forces – have been responsible all along for the explosion in the price of commodities like oil and gasoline .
The price of a barrel of oil dropped nearly 10 percent in recent weeks and other commodities declined significantly as well when , in the middle of the Bear Stearns crisis , speculators were forced to unload whatever investments they could in an attempt to raise capital .
Their biggest recent profits were in oil , so – out the door those investments went .
Financial newscasts – which usually cooperate shamefully with the speculators – suddenly changed their tune with questions like : “ Is the commodity bubble over ? ” And , “ Have the speculators been licked ? ”
The answer :
Not yet – even though oil dropped another $ 1.28 a barrel yesterday to $ 100.56 .
( You can bet that the fast money crowd on Wall Street will try to run crude up again on some wobbly pretense or another . )
Also helping to keep commodity speculation alive is this : as long as the Federal Reserve is making interest rates cheaper , bailing out private companies , debasing the value of the dollar and – overall – stoking inflation fears , some people will be more comfortable in assets they can touch and smell .
This is a speculator ’s dream .
But make no mistake about it , speculators – not Americans who drive too much , or Chinese who are beginning to drive or some stray storm in the Gulf of Mexico that causes a refinery shutdown – have been responsible for squeezing the family budget these past few years .
What amazes me most is that Americans are n’t irate about this .
Go ahead , punch a wall !
Or at least slam down a toilet seat !
Even better , kick your elected official in the rear and tell him / her to do something about it .
I ’ve been on this tirade for nearly two years now .
Back in May , 2006 oil was $ 66 a barrel and gasoline was already more than $ 3 a gallon .
The media was playing along , blaming hurricanes , South American and African countries and any other cock - and - bull notion conjured up by Wall Street .
The trouble was , it was n’t any of those things .
The same folks who brought us the subprime crisis were also jazzing the price of oil – all those real and imaged problems around the world were just excuses for getting their way .
In this column on May 23 , 2006 , I did an interview with Red Cavaney , president of the American Petroleum Institute – the industry group that represents the oil giants – and he blamed speculators trading so - called paper barrels of oil for the rise in prices .
I know this was a self - serving statement on Cavaney ’s part – deflecting blame as it did away from the ExxonMobils of the world that are still reaping unimaginably obscene profits at everyone else ’s expense .
But the fact is , Cavaney was right .
There was plenty of oil in the world then and there is plenty now .
And there will be an even more adequate supply of oil if the US economy goes into a recession and people have to put their cars up on blocks .
Since the May 2006 interview , even OPEC members have publicly argued that there is plenty of oil in the world and that the trouble is with speculators driving the price higher .
Again , OPEC wants to blame someone else .
But it just so happens that the Middle East oil producers are also right – as much as we ’d like to , they ca n’t be blamed for high oil prices this time around .
So it ’s amusing that last week , right smack in the middle of the banking system crisis , Vice President Dick Cheney went to Saudi Arabia to ask King Abdullah for more oil .
Cheney should have saved the long flight , booked the shuttle from Washington to New York and banged a few speculators ’ heads .
Here ’s the funny part about all of this – the oil companies either can’t make full price hikes stick , or they are too embarrassed by their good fortune to ask for more a gallon .
Back in mid-2006 , the price of gasoline was about where it is now even though crude oil prices were then more than $ 34 lower .
That extra $ 34 a barrel in the price of a barrel of oil – not to mention much of the price before that – was being caused by speculators .
Gasoline makers wanted no part of that or they ’d have a gallon of gas averaging more than $ 4 by now .
Imagine if the people we vote into office had awakened two years ago and had actually done something about the unnecessary and unwarranted rise in fuel prices .
Yep , imagine what people would have done these past two years with the extra money that ultimately went to oil companies because the insatiable bloodsuckers on Wall Street had decided to take our corpuscles by the barrel instead of merely the pint .
Maybe , just maybe , a few million people would n’t have had to use mortgage money to fill their gasoline tanks .
Perhaps we would n’t have had so many subprime loans on a slab right now .
Maybe there ’d be no financial crisis in this country at all .

Report : Former Fed Boss Says Euro Could Replace U.S. Dollar As Favored Reserve Currency
yahoo.com ^ | September 17 , 2007 | staff
Posted on by kellynla
FRANKFURT , Germany ( AP ) -- Former U.S. Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan said it is possible that the euro could replace the U.S. dollar as the reserve currency of choice .
According to an advance copy of an interview to be published in Thursday 's edition of the German magazine Stern , Greenspan said that the dollar is still slightly ahead in its use as a reserve currency , but added that " it does n't have all that much of an advantage " anymore .
The euro has been soaring against the U.S. currency in recent weeks , hitting all - time high of $ 1.3927 last week as the dollar has fallen on turbulent market conditions stemming from the ongoing U.S. subprime crisis .
The Fed meets this week and is expected to lower its benchmark interest rate from the current 5.25 percent .
Greenspan said that at the end of 2006 , some 25 percent of all currency reserves held by central banks were held in euros , compared to 66 percent for the U.S. dollar .
In terms of being used as a payment for cross - border transactions , the euro is trailing the dollar only slightly with 39 percent to 43 percent .
Greenspan said the European Central Bank has become " a serious factor in the global economy . "
He said the increased usage of the euro as a reserve currency has led to a lowering of interest rates in the euro zone , which has " without any doubt contributed to the current economic growth . "

Maybe gold could make a comeback , or even silver ?
Gosh , gee whillikers , wons , dongs , yen , rubles and rupees could be reserve currencies given enough interest , transfer of wealth , construction of carrier groups , etc .

the euro introduces the one thing the world never saw before : a viable competitor to the dollar for capital .
as a nobody , I put this in an email in 1998 or so to the professor at Columbia credited with starting this whole thing and responded , basically , " bosh . "
I stated that this competition would invariably drive up interest rates which would be a significant burden on a country with a large debt service .
As pitiful an economic engine as the EU is , it is still another game , a place for capital that is hostile to America to be stored .
They can promise rates as high as the moon ; and by the time they finally default , the bad money might just have driven out the good .
This calls for vigilence among the governed in America .

OMG !
I am so glad I have already transferred all of my money market savings into Euros .
Thank you dems !
Soon , if the Dems keep up their treasonous campaign , I will be transferring all my Uros into Iranian Rials .
The dems are THAT bad for our economy , and they are responsible for the skitterish markets , caused by their get out of Iraq campaign .
Well , you do n't have to have more than Economics 101 to know what will happen if the USA leaves Iraq prematurely .
One result is that the Euro will become the reserve currency with which oil is traded internationally .
And the financial markets now show that they think the Dems are winning the battle to leave Iraq .
A pox on you Dems .
I hope you collectively lose billions in your personal investments in the fracas you have caused .
And thank you Alan for leading the way to the demise of the US dollar !
What a POS you are .

Realistically , though , what do you think would happen to American society if unleaded was $ 5 a gallon ?
Far as I can tell Greenspan did n't say that .
Article did n't say that .
That 's a totally different thing from what Greenspan said .
Are you saying that $ 5 / gallon gasoline would be an automatic result of the prediction Greenspan made ?
What 's your argument for that ?
Anyway , to answer your question , quite honestly I do n't think $ 5 / gallon gasoline would make much of a dent in the lives of most people .
Demand for gasoline is rather inelastic , and prices would adjust .
You will recall of course that just a few years ago gasoline was under $ 1 , and it seems to have almost tripled , and somehow we 've survived .
I 'd rather it not happen , obviously , but if it does , I do n't think it will mean the apocalypse .

I received this in an email recently ....
Money is one of the most important inventions of humankind .
Without it , a complex , modern economy based on division of labor , and the consequent widespread exchange of goods and services , would be impossible .
Unfortunately , many experts believe we are on the verge of a financial crisis .
In recent years the value of the US dollar has dropped significantly , inflation has increased , consumer debt has reached an all - time high , and the US housing market has become dangerously unstable .
At present , approximately two thirds of world trade is conducted in dollars and two thirds of central banks ’ currency reserves are held in the American currency which remains the sole currency used by international institutions such as the International Monetary Fund .
This confers on the US a major economic advantage : the ability to run a trade deficit year after year .
US always spends more than it earns , whereas the rest of the world always earns more than it spends .
The strength of the dollar is closely related to the fact that oil , the most important commodity traded in the world , is priced in US currency .
The majority of countries that are oil importers have to buy their oil in dollars , which forces them to keep most of their foreign currency in dollars .
However that could change .
More and more nations are moving away from the dollar .
China , Sweden , Italy , Switzerland , Iran , Russia , the United Arab Emirates and others have already announced plans to gradually move their reserves from the dollar into other currencies such as the euro .
A widespread move away from the dollar could cripple the US economy - a sudden shift could even cause the US dollar to crash .
David M. Walker , Comptroller General of the United States , has warned that the nation is on the path to financial ruin : “ What they do n’t talk about is a dirty little secret everyone in Washington knows , or at least should .
The vast majority of the economists and budget analysts agree :
The ship of state is on a disastrous course , and will founder on the reefs of economic disaster if nothing is done to correct it . ”
If the US government conducts business as usual over the next few decades , a national debt that is already $ 8.5 trillion could reach $ 46 trillion or more , adjusted for inflation .
A hole that big could paralyze the US economy ; according to some projections , just the interest payments on a debt that big would be as much as all the taxes the government collects today .
And every year that nothing is done about it , the problem grows by $ 2 trillion to $ 3 trillion ( yes , that ’s with a “ t ” ) .
It does n’t take a genius to recognize that an economic upheaval is in the making .

Realistically , what do you think will happen to American society if unleaded stays in that $ 2.50 to $ 3.50 a gallon range ?
Same answer .
Lip service to alternative fuels or alternative energy sources ; then pay the bill at the pump .
Until alternative energy sources emerge , nothing will change , except the pump price will continue to go up .
Want to know another way to change this ? =>
Get crude oil , gasoline and other petroleum products out of the futures markets .
Of course , when another energy source does emerge and the people in this country believe it , the futures markets will collapse and lots of big guys will get what they deserve .
( Maybe Hillary will be persuaded to put her campaign funds into these futures markets just before the collapse occurs . )

Cervical screening can spot signs of cancer developing
HPV is a sexually transmitted infection - but only a small percentage of women who catch it develop cancer .
US researchers , writing in the journal Annals of Behavioural Medicine , said that stressed women had a weaker immune response to the virus .
But the study did not prove that stress was the root cause of the problem .
Women who report feeling more stressed could be at greater risk of developing cervical cancer because their immune system can't fight off one of the most common viruses that cause it
Dr Carolyn Fang
Fox Chase Cancer Center
It is already known that the way the body 's immune system reacts when confronted with HPV - short for human papillomavirus - can determine whether the infection causes more serious problems .
Many women appear able to " clear " the virus from their bodies , while in others it can cause a persistent infection which raises the risk of the abnormal cell changes which can eventually lead to cancer .
The latest study , carried out at the Fox Chase Cancer Center in Philadelphia , looked for reasons why , in some women , the immune system is unable to clear the virus .
Their small study asked 78 women who had had abnormal smear tests to fill in a questionnaire about their day - to - day stresses over the previous month , and any major events such as bereavements or divorce over a longer period .
Then the ability of their immune system to respond to HPV16 - the most common variety of the virus linked to cervical cancer - was measured .
Similar tests were carried out on 28 women who had not received an abnormal smear test , and the results compared .
The researchers found that the immune response was poorer among women who reported higher levels of day - to - day stress .
However , there was no correlation between immune response and the number of major events .
No cause
Dr Carolyn Fang , who led the study , said : " Women with higher levels of perceived stress were more likely to have an impaired immune response to HPV16 .
" That means that women who report feeling more stressed could be at greater risk of developing cervical cancer because their immune system can't fight off one of the most common viruses that cause it . "
The researchers admitted , however , that the design of the study meant that it was impossible to look for proof that stress actually caused the immune response , rather than just accompanied it .
A spokesman for Cancer Research UK said that more research would be needed to prove the link .
" We already know that an effective immune response against certain forms of HPV can guard against cervical cancer - this knowledge helped to spearhead the development of cervical cancer vaccines targeting this virus .
" This small study does not provide conclusive evidence that a stressful life directly suppresses the immune system and increases the risk of cervical cancer .
" More work would be needed before we know if there is a relationship between stress levels and the ability to fight HPV infection . "
NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - Three former Drug Enforcement Administration agents filed a $ 55 million defamation lawsuit against the movie studio that made “ American Gangster ” on Wednesday , claiming it tarnished hundreds of reputations .
Denzel Washington arrives for the premiere of the film " American Gangster " in New York October 19 , 2007 .
Three former Drug Enforcement Administration agents filed a $ 55 million defamation lawsuit against the movie studio that made " American Gangster " on Wednesday , claiming it tarnished hundreds of reputations .
REUTERS / Lucas Jackson
The film follows the rise and fall of former Harlem heroin kingpin Frank Lucas , portrayed by Denzel Washington .
His empire undercut the price and quality of heroin sold by the Mafia and when he was caught , Lucas turned informant .
Former DEA agents Louis Diaz , Gregory Korniloff and Jack Toal said NBC Universal , the owner of Universal Studios , falsely claimed the movie was based on a true story and misrepresented the events surrounding Lucas and New Jersey Detective Richard Roberts , depicted by Russell Crowe .
The movie hurt the agents ’ reputations by falsely claiming in text at the end that a collaboration between Lucas and Roberts “ led to the convictions of three - quarters of New York City ’s Drug Enforcement Agency ” agents between 1973 and 1985 , according to the suit , which seeks class action status .
“ With this utterly false and defamatory statement , the defendant has ruined and impugned the reputations of these honest and courageous public servants in the eyes of millions of people , ” the suit said .
NBC Universal , owned by General Electric , denied the allegations , saying : “ American Gangster does not defame these , or any , federal agents . ”
“ The end legend specifically refers to members of ‘ New York City ’s Drug Enforcement Agency ’ -- not the federal Drug Enforcement Administration , where the plaintiffs formerly worked .
We believe the lawsuit is entirely without merit , ” NBC Universal said .
The lawsuit said the public believed the film ’s text referred to federal DEA agents , not police officers , and regardless , no New York police officers were convicted as a result of Lucas ’ cooperation .
The movie , starring Oscar - winners Washington and Crowe , grossed $ 127 million , according to the lawsuit filed in Manhattan federal court .
The suit seeks to stop the film ’s distribution or change the text at the end of the film and turn over all of its profits to a fund for federal DEA agents .
The Drug Enforcement Administration was not immediately available for comment .
“ The only reason people went to see the film is because they thought it was a true story when really it is a pack of lies , ” said Dominic Amorosa , a lawyer for the plaintiffs told Reuters .

いただきました .
ありがとうございます > 著者およびオーム社の中の方 .
Erlang の親玉が書いた入門書の翻訳です .
Erlang は言語として特に斬新なところはなく , 処理系の提供するサービスの出来がいい , というのを伝聞で聞いていた .
読んでみるとたしかにそうだった .
本の内容も言語仕様( 文法 ) の話は前半だけ .
後半は分散だとか並列の話をしている. 面白いのは後半 .
私はお仕事の関係もあって分散メッセージングの仕組みには少し興味があったから , これはとても勉強になった. actor model とか .
知り合いのゲームプログラマと話すたびによく聞かされるのが
" ゲームのオブジェクトは自律的/疎結合 につくっとけ " という話.
actor はそういう感じかもしれない .
actor ( プロセス ) の寿命管理の話もなるほどだった .
死亡通知もメッセージにすればいいのねという.
そのほか Mnesia という Erlang 製データベースについて , 問い合わせが list comprehension なのに驚いた .
quote もないのにどうやって list comprehension を実際の問合せに使うんだろうと思ったけれど , そこは実装側が query handle という仕組み でがんばるらしい .
Expression Template みたいなもんだろうか ...
多少言語が地味でも , " 分散アプリがちゃちゃっと作れますよ " と言われたら心は揺らぐよね .
私が最近さわった新しい言語は VB と Squirrel で , それぞれ VC ++ のマクロとアプリ組み込み用.
どちらの言語にも愛はないけれど , 愛がなくても用はあるからさわらざるをえない.
言語にとって処理系やランタイムの出来はとても大事だと痛感.
C++ と Actor
さて , C++ プログラマであるところの私は悩む : C++ の上でどうやって actor をつくったものか .
たぶん負け戦だけど , どのへんが負け戦かは知っておいて良かろう.
面倒そうに思えたのは三つ .
coroutine
メッセージの直列 化
RPC との相性
どれも C++ プログラマが苦闘して散った分野なのが見てとれる.
coroutine
Erlang の actor は receive ( ) 関数でメッセージが届くのをまつ. 数千の actor が receive ( ) すると , 素朴な実装では数千のスレッドができて , 主記憶を食い潰してしまう .
Erlang や Stackless Python のような ( scheme も？ ) まともな actor システムを持つ言語は , そうした問題を回避している .
actor 自身が使う stack だけなら大した量じゃないから , その部分だけを switch できれば OS のスタック全体を switch するより軽量で済む , というのが 私の理解 .
実装を知らないので違ったらごめんなさい.
C/C++ で coroutine ライブラリというときは , あの手この手でコンテクスト切り替えを実装している .
無理矢理スタックをコピーするものもある.
あまり近づきたくない . できれば言語の上だけでなんとかしたい.
Scala Actor は , それをなんとかしたと主張している .
JVM 上で動く Scala は C/C++ と同じ OS stack の制限を持つ .
どうやってなんとかしたのか. サンプルコード を見てみると ...
def act ( ) { var pongCount = 0 loop { react { case Ping => if ( pongCount % 1000 == 0 ) Console.
println ( " Pong : ping " +pongCount ) sender !
Pong pongCount = pongCount + 1 case Stop => Console.println ( " Pong : stop " ) exit ( ) } } }
react ( ) の引数が block になっている .
一見すると loop ( ) によってループが回りつづけるよるに見えるが , 実際は react ( ) が例外を投げる .
処理はフレームワークに戻り , 受信すべきメッセージが届いたら block の関数オブジェクトが呼び出される .
例外による脱出で continuation を模倣する手法は Java 界隈の標準らしく , Jetty continuation も 似たようなことをしている .
ただし関数オブジェクトでの CPS はしない .
例外で脱出せず利用者側が return してもよさそうだけど , そこは趣味の問題と思う .
というわけで , OS スタック依存言語で actor をするには 関数オブジェクトと例外を組合せればいいらしい .
もっとも C++ は関数オブジェクトを " ぱっと見は連続した " コードに見せる block や lambda のような仕組みがない .
なので Scala 式 Actor がどれだけ有り難いかはわからない . ぐぐってみつけた C++ による actor 実装 Theron では , actor は react ( ) 相当の処理をするために親クラスの Receive ( ) メソッドを実装する .
この方が C++ ユーザ的な馴染みはいいかもしらん.
Scala actor の作者もそうした解決があることは承知している. 解説記 事( PDF ) によれば , インターフェイスを実装してフレームワークに呼ばせる
IoC 形式を 回避した設計を選んだと主張している .
個人的にはどっちでもいいんじゃね , とおもう .
それに IoC を回避した結果 , 親クラスが fat になってしまうのは嬉しくない .
結論 : どれもいまいち .
もっとも lua や Squirrel と繋いでしまえば その上で coroutine が使えるから , 足回りが多少みっともないのは許容できるのかもしれない .
世間のゲーム屋さんはどうしてるんでしょうね.
メッセージの直列化 , RPC との相 性
あとは細かい話ふたつ . まずメッセージの直列化 . Erlang では receive ( ) の引数に任 意 ( たぶん ) の
Erlang 項を渡せる .
項ってのは lisp のリストみたいなやつ .
分散環境だとこれを適当に直列化して遠くの actor に送ったりする .
で , C++ にはそういう軽量な直列化の仕組みがない.
boost :: serialize を使えばいいという反応はありうるが , 適切な deserializer を選ぶ部分が悩ましい .
そういう問題に対する解の一つが RPC だと言える .
ポートに対応する deserizlier と callback を振り分ける仕組みが RPC なわけだから .
RPC の末裔はそれなりに広く使われているわけだけれど , actor とはまったく独立している .
Erlang の RPC は actor の上に実装されている .
できればこういう風にしたい. が , あまり妙案はない .
RPC の serializer はふつうオブジェクトからバイト列への変換を行う .
そこにもう一段中間表現を設ければいいのかもしれない.
バイト列 -> erlang term / lisp list -> オブジェクト みたいな .
C++ からその中間表現を扱う良い API があれば便利なものになるだろう . 効率は落ちそうだけれど .
こうして考えてみると , C++ でも actor model に則った分散環境を 作ることはできそうな気がしてきた .
ただ , それが既存の仕組みと比べて有り難いものなのかはわからない.
とりあえず分散はあきらめて , インプロセスの actor model を作るくらいが妥当なのかもしれない .
世間でいう task - system の中にも actor ぽいのは多そうだしね .

It 's another example of government protecti ...
I can remember when Congress took the disgraceful step of lumping the birthdays of our Founding Fathers into a generic three - day weekend .
Pressure to do so came from federal - employee unions , the travel industry and , of course , Congress itself .
Nobody loves a three - day weekend more than Congress .
The point of the original holidays was to honor the men on their birthdays .
Certainly today ’s Americans need to know more about presidents like George Washington and Thomas Jefferson and their thoughts on public - policy matters .
They are lost completely , however , when it is all turned into an excuse for a minivacation .
Abraham Lincoln ’s birthday was also merged into this generic holiday , and his life , too , is important for Americans to study .
Washington and Jefferson created the republic ; Lincoln destroyed it .
Scholars are at last beginning to dig out the real Lincoln from the layers of deification that were created by cynical men who , while he lived , had habitually referred to him as a " baboon " or an " idiot . "
The real Lincoln is a much more interesting man than the saintly figure created for partisan purposes .
He had his flaws as well as his virtues .
He was a racist .
He was an intensely ambitious man who would say and do anything to win public office .
He was belligerently anti-Christian , though once elected he hid his true beliefs from the public .
He freed no slaves .
And there is some evidence , though circumstantial , that he was homosexual .
He was also an inveterate vulgarian .
Right after delivering the magnificent Gettysburg Address , he ordered the band to play bawdyhouse songs .
Nor , according to his contemporaries , was he tenderhearted .
He is described as indifferent to the enormous suffering his war was causing .
All of these facts were widely known during his lifetime , and most were included in the original memoir by his longtime law partner .
Unfortunately , each subsequent edition was sanitized , so that today most Americans know nothing of the real man who was far more complex than his accepted image .
He was not an intellectual , though one of his cabinet officers said he was " cunning to the point of genius . "
As for the Gettysburg Address , H.L. Mencken put it quite truly when he said it was one of the most beautiful prose poems in the English language , but added that the trouble was it was the South , not the North , that was fighting for a government of the people , by the people and for the people .
Lincoln practically imposed a dictatorship on the Northern states , closed down nearly 300 newspapers and had thousands of people arrested .
Any critic of his administration or the war was dubbed a traitor .
Virtually everything he did was unconstitutional .
And his administration was corrupt .
All Americans need to know the true history of their country , for the country we live in today is a product of that history , not of the fictional history .
You can find out more about Lincoln by reading two books with the same title —
The Real Lincoln .
The modern book is by Thomas DiLorenzo , a fine scholar ; and the older book , a reprint , is by Charles L.C. Minor .
It is published by Sprinkle Publications , P.O. Box 1094 , Harrisonburg , VA 22801 .
In contrast with Lincoln , the more you learn about Washington , the more you realize that he truly was one of the great men of all time .
Very few men can be said to be indispensable , but some historians believe that Washington really was indispensable .
Without him , we might well not have succeeded against the British and almost certainly would not have had the republic he and his contemporaries created .
It ’s no wonder modern politicians do n’t talk about him .
Everything he warned against , they have embraced ; everything he urged us to do , they have neglected to do .
And the mess we are in today only proves how right Washington was and how wrong today ’s politicians are .

White House Press Secretary Dana Perino mentioned in a press conference that she is not allowed to talk about the value of the U.S. Dollar .
She says that the Treasury Secretary is the only one allowed to discuss the U.S. Dollar .
She even said that she would be fired if she talked about the U.S. Dollar .
First off , its ridiculous that the Treasury Secretary is the only one that can talk about the value of the U.S. Dollar since the Federal Reserve is the institution that fixes the price of the U.S. Dollar .
This is just a game of smoke and mirrors the Bush administration is playing because they know that the U.S. Dollar is in the process of losing a good majority of its value .
Watch the video of the Dana Perino below talking about why she ca n’t discuss the U.S. Dollar .

I was at the Dependently Typed Programming ’08 workshop a couple of weeks ago , and it was a lot of fun .
Lots of interesting people were there talking variously about fun programs and implementation techniques .
One thing I thought was a little sad , though , is that we do n’t yet have a real programming language ( that is , a full one you can write programs in and actually run them , and interact with the outside world , read and write files , output HTML , etc , etc … , rather than proof assistants such as Coq and Agda ) in which to try out the ideas for real .
If you want to do that , the best you can do at the minute is Haskell with GADTs , or Tim Sheard ’s Omega .
These are interesting in themselves , but I want to know what we can do with full dependent types .
Can we write the functional programs we know and love in the style we are used to , and add bits of dependency when we want some invariants checked , do we have to approach programming in a new way , or is some combination possible ?
It would be nice to have a system in which to try this out .
I ’ve been working on file handling and concurrency recently , using the type system to manage state to prevent unauthorised access to resources and to ensure locks are managed correctly , even looking at how types can help prevent deadlock .
I ’ve been doing this in Ivor , but I think now is the time to give it a go in a real language .
To this end …
… I ’ve spent the last few weeks hacking on a fledgling dependently typed language called Idris .
It has full dependent types , pattern matching , and some basic IO with Haskell style do notation .
I ’ve tried a few simple examples , including the traditional well - typed interpreter .
Types need to be given for pattern matching functions , but can often be omitted for constants – full type inference is of course impossible with full dependent types .
[ Aside :
An interesting thing about this is the fPlus function in the interpreter example :
fPlus : Term VNil ( TyFun TyNat ( TyFun TyNat TyNat ) ) ;
f Plus = Lam ( Lam ( plusOp ( Var fO ) ( Var ( fS fO ) ) ) ) ;
This needs a type declaration because typed terms exist relative to an environement , so we have to tell the type checker the initial environment is empty .
It turns out we can also just give the environment :
f Plus = Lam { G=VNil} ( Lam ( plusOp ( Var fO ) ( Var ( fS fO ) ) ) ) ;
So inference on terms in Idris gives type inference in the object language . ]
There are a lot of theoretical issues still to sort out in dependently typed programming , such as how full dependent types interact with partial , general recursive functions , or how the universe hierarchy should be organised .
I have decided ( at least as far as this project goes ) not to be interested in such things .
I ’d just like to get on with programming , and deal with such issues when the answers become more clear .
Early days yet , but I ’m going to try using this for real work , and we ’ll see how it goes .
Any interesting updates , I ’ll post them here .
The first entry in Scholars & Rogues ’s 2008 Wish List for the World
Hundreds of thousands of Iraqis have fled the carnage and poverty that our intrusion into their affairs has unleashed .
They ’ve been admitted to two countries ill - equipped to accommodate them : Jordan and Syria .
Meanwhile , the US has kept its borders closed to all but a few token Iraqis .
This past September , though , perhaps in response to the heat it ’s been taking , the State Department created the position of Senior Coordinator for Iraqi Refugees for one John Foley .
The stated intent is to speed up the process of allowing Iraqis to immigrate to the US .
But there ’s a catch — two actually .
One , vetting each applicant , expected to consist of interviews with a series of US officials , could take between four to six months .
So much for speeding up the process .
Presumably , State wants to guarantee that members of murderous militias are culled from the ranks of prospective refugees .
But how many exiles - in - waiting will die of violence or disease in the interim ?
Two , the program is intended to benefit only those Iraqis who , as a result of working for the US are — big of State to finally admit this — in mortal danger .
Or in more danger than the average Iraqi , whose life can be had for a song ( if the fundamentalists allowed music ) .
It looks like the Bush administration , which has given new meaning to the word “ grudging , ” is once again doling out crumbs for the sake of appearance .
Had Bush joined a support group upon becoming sober he might have internalized one of its most important adages : “ Half measures avail us nothing . ”
Like after Katrina , bona fide relief efforts have been palmed off on the private sector .
Once the injustice of that is acknowledged , how can we expedite granting Iraqis refuge ?
The time has come to call Americans out on our complacency , which has made us complicit in the invasion of Iraq and its occupation .
A Democratic candidate for president must break new ground for boldness and rub the plight of Iraqi citizens in our faces .
The death and forced relocation of hundreds of thousands of Iraqis can no longer be ignored .
Already it threatens to become as big a stain on our national soul as slavery and our annihilation of the red man .
Meanwhile , with nearly 4,000 American soldiers dead in a war that ’s also inhaling cash like a whale shark does krill , it ’s disingenuous to claim Americans have n’t sacrificed .
But , most of us have done nothing of our own volition .
The candidate in question must appeal to Americans to finally contribute to , not the war effort , but efforts to heal Iraq from the war .
The citizens of every American city or town that enjoys some degree of prosperousness need to provide jobs and lodging for Iraqis .
What ?
Even those who know Iraq had nothing to do with 9/11 are likely to be jittery about admitting people into our communities who , if they were n’t before , may now be our sworn enemies .
To quell fears , however unrealistic , that Iraqi emigres might form terrorist cells , limit the number of families to one in each town ( or a handful in a large city ) .
To minimize the shock to the system of incorporating a couple hundred thousand new Americans , total participation is critical .
The Iraqis ’ high visibility will further assuage our fears , thus compensating for shortcomings in the vetting process .
Also they ’ll likely be the subject of local newspaper articles and TV news appearances .
As well , they ’ll be trotted out for all manner of civic occasions .
Of course , Iraqis would prefer to remain in their own country .
But it may be ten years before it ’s fit for either man or beast .
Meanwhile , concerns that calls for an influx of refugees would play into the hard right ’s hands and supply it with truckloads of ammunition in the war on immigration are legitimate .
But , denying asylum to Iraqis who deserve refugee status would leave the right wide open to charges it was emulating its arch - fiend , Franklin Roosevelt , whose administration locked out Jews during World War II .
Are we big enough to hold ourselves accountable for the refugees that we ’ve allowed our government to create ?
Let ’s show the world that Americans are once again capable of that generosity of spirit for which , myth or not , we were once famous .
Let ’s say I want a new job .
I ’m not rich or powerful , so my employer is hardly likely to allow me to take a few weeks off â€ ” let alone more than a year â€ ” to search for a new job .
My employer expects me to do my job .
If I want to look for a new job , I ’ll have to do it on my own time â€ ” and probably secretly .
At the moment , there ’s a gaggle of politicians who have jobs â€ ” important jobs â€ ” who are running around the country looking for a new job .
And none of their current employers seems to be complaining all that loudly .
They should be .
I am one such indignant employer .
I ’m irritated that the woman I hired to do a job for me â€ ” be an fully effective senator for the state of New York â€ ” is too busy seeking a new job that she ’s falling down on her current job .
This is n’t a complaint solely about Sen. Hillary Clinton .
Accompanying her on the campaign trail are other officeholders seeking a new job while supposedly working to improve the lot in life of the people who hired them to perform competently in their current jobs .
Like Sen. Clinton , Sen. Barack Obama and Sen. John McCain have current jobs that pay them $ 169,300 a year .
Sens. Chris Dodd and Joe Biden used their current jobs to seek a new job until they withdrew from the 2008 presidential election sweepstakes .
Rep. Dennis Kucinich and Rep. Ron Paul , too , get paid $ 169,300 per annum .
Ditto Rep. Duncan Hunter , who has also used his current job and that fat salary to seek a new job .
Gov. Bill Richardson , paid $ 110,000 by the state of New Mexico , also wanted that nice new job until he , too , withdrew from the presidential race .
They all want this really great new job : $ 400,000 per year , including a $ 50,000 expense allowance .
A nice plane .
Limos to everywhere .
Housing provided .
Housing staff provided .
Best medical benefits in the world .
How can these people perform well in their current jobs if they take up to a year or more to campaign virtually full time for a new job ?
Oh , they say , We have staff people .
We have the most modern , reliable communication equipment to keep in touch .
We can fly chartered planes back to D.C. or the statehouse if need be .
That ’s poppycock .
As it is , these people do not spend full time on their current jobs ; as much as half their time ( if they were n’t seeking a new job ) is spent raising money so they can retain their current jobs .
For any of these candidates to claim that they can perform fully and competently in their current jobs while running for president is political deceit .
Many of these people , when seeking their current job , promised this :
Do n’t worry .
If you hire me , I will serve out my full term .
I ’ll place my full attention on you , the people who hired me .
If these people want to run for president , fine .
Many are suitably qualified to be a competent , if not inspirational , president .
But , damn it , quit your current job first so we can find a replacement who will give us the full attention we need .
It is morally reprehensible for presidential candidates to claim they can fully and competently serve in Congress or a statehouse while running for president .
They demonstrate a lack of courage by holding on to that “ fallback ” job while spending a year seeking another one .
As we measure the character of these candidates , let ’s keep this in mind : Past behavior is an indicator of future performance .

NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - Consumer confidence fell further into recessionary territory in March , hitting a 16 - year low , even as other data showed incomes rose and inflation dipped in February , which should support the Fed ’s efforts to bolster the economy .
The Reuters / University of Michigan Surveys of Consumers said its final index of confidence fell to 69.5 in March -- its lowest since February 1992 , when it was at 68.8 -- from the previous month ’s reading of 70.8 .
Consumers were apparently unimpressed by February ’s 0.5 percent rise in personal incomes , reported by the Commerce Department .
That exceeded forecasts of a 0.3 percent gain made by analysts polled before the release .
However , the best news from the U.S. personal income report may have been the benign reading on underlying inflation , which was 2 percent .
This matched the prior month ’s gain , which was downwardly revised from 2.2 percent .
This latest reading on the “ core ” personal consumption expenditure price index is also just within the Federal Reserve ’s perceived comfort zone .
“ It argues that the Fed can lower rates in the months ahead , ” Zach Pandl , economist at Lehman Brothers in New York , said about the core PCE price reading .
Many officials at the Federal Reserve , which has cut interest rates by 3 percentage points since mid-September in a bid to combat recession risks , have said they prefer to keep the core price gauge in a 1 percent to 2 percent range .
Earlier this week , the presidents of both the Dallas and Chicago Federal Reserve banks warned the central bank needs to be wary of a rise in inflation even as it navigates the United States through an economic slowdown .
The inflation reading provided a boost to Wall Street with the Dow Jones industrial average rising 0.4 percent .
It also helped lift bond prices but pushed the dollar to near a record low around $ 1.58 per euro .

The Commerce Department ’s report also showed signs of economic weakness , with personal spending increasing just 0.1 percent in February .
This was in line with expectations but is down from a 0.4 percent gain in January .
This weakness was consistent with the Reuters / University of Michigan Surveys of Consumers report , which said “ it is now nearly unanimous among consumers that the economy has already entered a recession . ”
Its index of consumer expectations fell to 60.1 , its lowest since January 1992 , when it was at 59.1 .
In February this year it was at 62.4 .
The report showed the final reading on one - year inflation expectations jumped to 4.3 percent in March from 3.6 percent in February .
That was the highest final reading since October 2005 , when gasoline prices were soaring in the wake of Hurricane Katrina , but was down from the preliminary March reading of 4.5 percent .
Excluding the post - Katrina period , the March reading would be the highest since 1990 .
The index of consumers ’ economic outlook for the next 12 months fell to 46 -- the lowest since a similar reading in January 1991 -- from 54 in February .
“ Consumer confidence slipped due to growing concerns about weakening prospects for the economy as well as anticipated increases in unemployment and inflation during the year ahead , ” the Reuters / University of Michigan statement said .
The gloomy confidence data coincided with a disappointing outlook from department store retailer J.C. Penney Co Inc , which pushed shares of many retailers sharply lower .
“ J.C. Penney counts half of American families as its customers , and they are feeling macro-economic pressures from many areas , including higher energy costs , deteriorating employment trends and significant issues in the housing and credit markets , ” Myron “ Mike ” Ullman , chairman and chief executive officer , said in a statement .
There was more dour economic news from the Economic Cycle Research Institute .
Although its Weekly Leading Index ( WLI ) of future U.S. economic growth ticked up in the latest week , as did its annualized growth rate , both still show the U.S. economy headed for recession .
“ With growth in the WLI having stabilized around recessionary readings , the economy remains locked on the recession track , ” said Lakshman Achuthan , managing director at ECRI .
WASHINGTON - President Bush this week declared that he has the power to bypass four laws , including a prohibition against using federal funds to establish permanent US military bases in Iraq , that Congress passed as part of a new defense bill .
Bush made the assertion in a signing statement that he issued late Monday after signing the National Defense Authorization Act for 2008 .
In the signing statement , Bush asserted that four sections of the bill unconstitutionally infringe on his powers , and so the executive branch is not bound to obey them .
" Provisions of the act . . . purport to impose requirements that could inhibit the president 's ability to carry out his constitutional obligations to take care that the laws be faithfully executed , to protect national security , to supervise the executive branch , and to execute his authority as commander in chief , " Bush said .
" The executive branch shall construe such provisions in a manner consistent with the constitutional authority of the President . "
One section Bush targeted created a statute that forbids spending taxpayer money " to establish any military installation or base for the purpose of providing for the permanent stationing of United States Armed Forces in Iraq " or " to exercise United States control of the oil resources of Iraq . "
The Bush administration is negotiating a long - term agreement with Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al - Maliki .
The agreement is to include the basing of US troops in Iraq after 2008 , as well as security guarantees and other economic and political ties between the United States and Iraq .
The negotiations have drawn fire in part because the administration has said it does not intend to designate the compact as a " treaty , " and so will not submit it to Congress for approval .
Critics are also concerned Bush might lock the United States into a deal that would make it difficult for the next president to withdraw US troops from Iraq .
" Every time a senior administration official is asked about permanent US military bases in Iraq , they contend that it is not their intention to construct such facilities , " said Senator Robert P. Casey Jr. , Democrat of Pennsylvania , in a Senate speech yesterday .
" Yet this signing statement issued by the president yesterday is the clearest signal yet that the administration wants to hold this option in reserve . "
Several other congressional Democrats also took issue with the signing statement .
" I reject the notion in his signing statement that he can pick and choose which provisions of this law to execute , " said Speaker Nancy Pelosi , Democrat of California .
" His job , under the Constitution , is to faithfully execute the law - every part of it - and I expect him to do just that . "
Bush 's signing statement did not explain the specific basis for his objection to the prohibition on establishing permanent military bases in Iraq .
An aide to John McCain was suspended from the campaign today for blasting out an inflammatory video that raises questions about Barack Obama 's patriotism .
Soren Dayton , who works in McCain 's political department , sent out the YouTube link of " Is Obama Wright ? " on Twitter at 12:31 Thursday with the tag , " Good video on Obama and Wright . "
It has since been taken down .
Twitter is an online device that allows users to send out short messages and links en masse through computers or PDAs .
McCain and his campaign have repeatedly said that they would stay away from personal attacks on Obama , but the temptation has increased as Wright 's words have dominated the race in recent days .
Last week , they included an op -ed that hammered Wright and Obama in their morning clip package emailed to reporters .
The same day , a campaign aide they regretted doing so .
Informed that Dayton was circulating the video , McCain spokeswoman Jill Hazelbaker said he had been suspended and " reprimanded by campaign leadership . "
" We have been very clear on the type of campaign we intend to run and this staffer acted in violation of our policy , " she said .
She declined to say for how long he was suspended .
Previously an independent blogger , Dayton drew the attention and favor of McCain 's campaign with his frequent attacks on Mitt Romney .
He was brought onto the campaign earlier this year to help in the political department .
An aide said he was doing " low - level political work for [ deputy political director ] John Yob . "
The video Dayton sent , which includes images of Malcolm X , black Olympians raising their hands in the black power salute and the rap song " Fight the Power , " has been rapidly spreading in political circles this week .
As I reported yesterday , it was crafted by a conservative talk radio producer .

This snow palace is one of loads of gigantic snow sculptures that have been built for the 20th International Snow Sculpture show in the Heilongjiang Province , China .
To get an idea of just how massive the sculptures are , check out how tiny all the adults who are working on the sculptures look when they 're standing next to them .
This is one of the largest snow sculptures in the world , measuring a whopping 35 m high and 200 m long - that 's the length of four Olympic swimming pools !
Time for a quick break .
It 's hard work digging all that snow to create these icy works of art .
The exhibition opens to the public on 20 December so time for a few finishing touches .

Security remains very tight in the East Timorese capital , Dili An uneasy calm is reported on the streets of the East Timor capital , Dili , a day after President Jose Ramos - Horta was shot by rebel soldiers .
Patrols by police and international troops were stepped up after acting leader Vicente Gutterres formalised a two - day state of emergency .
Mr Ramos - Horta remains in a serious but stable condition .
World leaders condemned the attack , described by East Timor leaders as an attempted coup .
The rebels also targeted Prime Minister Xanana Gusmao but he was not injured .
The apparently coordinated attacks have raised fears of renewed violence in East Timor , which saw widespread unrest and street battles in mid-2006 .
' Extraordinary situation ' Speaking in a televised address , Mr Gutterres announced the special measures .
JOSE RAMOS - HORTA
Founder of East Timor 's independence movement Spent 24 years in exile after Indonesia invaded Won Nobel Peace Prize in 1996 Former journalist , fluent in five languages
Press urges unity Timorese shock at shooting
In pictures : Timor leader shot " Our country is right now in an extraordinary situation where a state of emergency will bring us back to normality , " he said .
" I ask for your help . "
The 48 - hour emergency order bans all public gatherings and meetings .
Residents must remain at home between the hours of 2000 and 0600 .
Extra Australian troops have begun arriving in East Timor to reinforce peacekeepers and help boost security .
An Australian warship is also in place off the coast of East Timor .
The BBC's Jonathan Head in Dili says the streets of the capital are empty of civilians after curfew .
Peacekeepers and police are out in force on the city streets and an uneasy calm prevails , he says .
" I am going back home early because I 'm afraid of gang fighting or protests , " student Antonio Gomes told Reuters news agency .
Emergency surgery
In the hospital in Darwin , Australia , where Mr Ramos - Horta was taken after the shooting , doctors said he would need further surgery , but said they were hopeful for a full recovery .
Dr Len Notaras said three surgeons had operated on Mr Ramos - Horta for more than two hours on Monday night , dressing wounds and removing shrapnel .
Who are the rebel soldiers ?
Profile : Jose Ramos - Horta
" After losing such a huge amount of blood in the shooting ... he 's very fortunate to have survived , " he told the BBC .
The veteran politician was shot three times in the stomach and chest in the early - morning attack at his residence in Dili .
His bodyguard was also injured and two rebel soldiers , including fugitive leader Alfredo Reinado , were killed .
Rebels also shot at a car carrying Mr Gusmao , but no - one was hurt .
Reinado , a former military officer , had been on the run since the wave of violence that swept through East Timor in mid-2006 .
A decision by then Prime Minister Mari Alkatiri to sack 600 soldiers triggered weeks of clashes between factions of the police and the army .
At least 37 people died and more than 150,000 were displaced .
Australian - led peacekeepers were brought in to help restore security .
Reinado was accused of being involved in several shooting incidents during the violence and charged with murder .
He had been holed up in the mountains with a group of followers for several months .
Our correspondent says the nation has been left badly shaken by the attack , which has exposed the bitterness that still divides it six years after independence .
The country faces many other problems , including serious gang violence , while many people seem addicted to aid and are still living in sodden refugee camps , he says .

COLLEGE PARK , Md.  Ray Stanford pulls into the lot of a fast - food restaurant on a suburban commercial strip and parks at the back .
Wearing high rubber boots and carrying a backpack , he makes his way through the brush and down to a stream bank littered with wrappers and cups .
He 's come to track dinosaurs .
Stanford , a 69 - year - old Texan , has been combing Maryland stream beds for evidence of dinosaurs for the past 13 years .
The result is an unprecedented collection of footprints that were left behind 112 million years ago — found in an area where none had been reported before .
Stanford is about the furthest thing possible from a conventional scientist , and his lack of formal training — he has a high school diploma — is just the start .
His first passion , one he still pursues , is UFOs ; " anomalous aerial objects " is the term he prefers .
Dinosaur tracking was just something he happened on .
As it turned out , he has a knack for it .
Stanford has found hundreds of tracks in the suburbs of Washington and Baltimore .
They reveal an extraordinary diversity of animals living in one place during the early Cretaceous period — about twice the variety previously seen from that geological period .
And he has found the fossilized remains of what he and a Johns Hopkins University paleontologist believe is a previously unknown species , a discovery he lovingly refers to as " Cretaceous roadkill . "
" I just find things .
I do n't know why , " Stanford says .
The discoveries have earned Stanford the respect of the scientific establishment , despite his unusual background .
He has collaborated with Ph.D. - holders on papers and is working with the Smithsonian Institution to find a permanent home there for his collection .
Matthew T. Carrano , curator of dinosaurs at the Smithsonian 's National Museum of Natural History in Washington , is used to getting calls from people who believe they 've found dinosaur footprints or eggs .
More often than not , they 're mistaken .
Stanford was different .
" He did n't show me anything that I did n't think was a footprint , " Carrano says .
Stanford made his first dinosaur discovery in 1994 , while looking for Indian artifacts with his then - teenage children .
Having read a bit about dinosaurs , he spotted something that looked remarkably like a track .
A few weeks later , he saw something similar .
At first he assumed they were just random patterns that looked like tracks .
But he kept thinking about them .
" Ray , how hardheaded can you be ? " he recalls thinking one day as he sat in his easy chair .
" Those are iguanodon tracks ! " David Weishampel , a Johns Hopkins paleontologist who plans to publish a paper with Stanford on the new species of dinosaur he found , says the sheer number of tracks Stanford has found is mind - boggling .
" It 's like , why did n't we see it before ? " Weishampel says .
Stanford chalks it up to " the birder phenomenon . "
A person who badly wants to spot a particular rare bird may be unsuccessful for years .
But " once they spot it , they will then see it many times thereafter , " Stanford says .
" It has to do with an openness in the mind that says , ' Yes , it is here .
Yes , I can see it , " ' he adds .
" There 's nothing strange about seeing more UFOs after you 've seen one — and likewise dinosaur tracks . "
There is one outside factor that has made tracks easier to spot in recent decades : the region 's building boom .
Rapid development has led to more runoff into the region 's streams .
That , in turn , speeds up the erosion that allows underlying rocks where the footprints are embedded to become dislodged .
Picking up the fragments as they 're pushed downstream is a " rescue mission , " Stanford says .
" Once these things get into the Potomac ( River ) , there 's nobody 's chance of finding them . "
Stanford impresses paleontologists not just with his ability to spot tracks , but with his ability to identify and interpret them as well .
As he shows a visitor around his living room , which is crammed with fossils arranged in mounds on the reinforced floor , he launches into vivid stories about each track he picks up .
He points out clues indicating what kind of dinosaur made the track and with which foot .
He 'll note if the animal was running , skidding or crouching , and often he 'll venture a guess about the circumstances .
" This guy was running , " he says , picking up a fragment bearing two different footprints .
" Now , we do n't know that this was at the same time , but here is a larger , ( flesh - eating ) dinosaur .
...
You could almost think that he might be running after this guy . "
" In many cases he 's probably right , " Weishampel says of Stanford 's narratives , " but he has a good imagination as well , which is one of the other tools dinosaur paleontologists definitely need . "
Stanford insists he 's a skeptic at heart .
Though fascinated by UFOs since age 9 , he insists he 's no " UFO buff . "
His goal , he says , is to apply scientific methods to learn about such phenomena .
With backing from some wealthy patrons , he set up Project Starlight International in the 1960s and set about gathering evidence .
Over time , the center began using sophisticated equipment like spectrum cameras and magnetometers .
Though Stanford broke with the organization in the 1980s , he continues the research .
He expresses disdain for UFO conspiracy theorists who are always " begging the government to tell them the truth about these things . "
" That 's a scientific cop-out .
If you want real data , you go out with real instruments and attempt to get it .
And if you do get it , you analyze it and publish it under peer review , " he said .
Stanford regrets that his UFO research , which he considers " an order of magnitude more important " than the dinosaur work , has n't been accepted by the mainstream .
But he 's undeterred .
When Stanford 's wife retires from her job at NASA , the couple plans to move back to Texas , where Stanford will again devote himself to UFOs .
As for the dinosaurs , Stanford wants to transfer his track collection to the Smithsonian before he leaves the Washington area .
His hope is that the highlights , particularly the " roadkill , " will be on exhibit at the natural history museum .
Carrano likes the idea and has proposed an exhibit highlighting " that this was found right here — and this is someone who literally found dinosaur fossils in his backyard , " he says .
Stanford hopes that by sharing his discoveries he might encourage youngsters to look up from their computer screens .
" They do n't realize , " he laments , " that this world is a lot more interesting than any electronic game . "

( CNN ) -- French bank Societe Generale described Sunday how one of its traders allegedly carried out a $ 7.2 billion ( €4.9 billion ) fraud , how the loss came to light and what it is doing to ensure such a case does not recur .
The 31 - year - old trader , Jerome Kerviel , started working at the bank in 2000 and spent his first five years there overseeing traders , the bank said in a five - page summary of events .
" Consequently , he had a very good understanding of all of Societe Generale 's processing and control procedures , " it said .
Kerviel apparently put that knowledge to use after he became a trader for the bank involved in arbitrage -- the practice of buying a portfolio of financial instruments in one market and selling a similar offsetting portfolio at the same time that had a slightly different value .
The idea is that , in such trades , the risk of major loss would be minimized .
In fact , Kerviel 's first portfolio of financial instruments -- in his case futures -- included genuine operations -- but the offsetting portfolio proved to be " fictitious , " the bank said .
" As a result , the trader was able to hide a very sizable speculative position , which was neither consistent with nor related to his normal business activity for the bank , " Societe Generale said .
French police questioned Kerviel on Friday and searched his apartment in a Paris suburb Friday night .
Efforts to reach his attorneys for comment have been unsuccessful .

CNN / Money : Previous financial scandals
Finance Minister Christine Lagarde said Friday that she would meet with banking regulators Monday to establish a timeline of events that led to the massive trading loss .
According to Societe Generale , Kerviel used his early banking experience " to successfully circumvent all the controls which allow the bank to check the characteristics of the operations carried out by its traders , and consequently their real existence , " it said .
For example , it said , Kerviel chose operations that had no cash movements or margin call and that did not require immediate confirmation and he canceled certain operations by using access codes assigned to other bank employees .
In addition , it said , he falsified documents and made sure that his fictitious operations involved different instruments from the ones he had just canceled , thereby reducing his chances of being controlled .
But about mid-January , bank officials detected " abnormal counterparty risk , " and Kerviel 's explanations led to additional controls being placed on his activities , the bank said .
Then , on Friday , January 18 , Kerviel 's bosses were informed and an investigation had begun .
The next day , after a large bank told Societe Generale that it did not recognize an operation , the trader " acknowledges committing unauthorized acts and , in particular , creating fictitious operations , " his employer said .
By early afternoon on Sunday , January 20 , the bank 's fraudulent position had been calculated at approximately 50 billion euros ( $ 73.6 billion ) , and " the unwinding of the fraudulent position begins in particularly unfavorable market conditions . "
In fact , the timing was terrible .
On Jan. 18 , European markets had swooned and two days later , the Asian markets tumbled , too .
By January 23 , " the unwinding " was completed and the total loss calculated at 4.9 billion euros ( $ 7.2 billion ) .
Since then , the bank said , it has tightened its controls to ensure such an operation cannot recur .

As Tibetan protesters continued to rally and demonstrate against Chinese rule , a Foreign Office minister delivered Britain 's strongest condemnation yet of Beijing 's handling of the crisis .
Lord Malloch - Brown called on UK athletes at this year 's Beijing Olympics to " speak the truth " about what was happening in the country .
His surprise intervention exposed growing tensions in British government ranks over how to respond to the unrest in Tibet and China 's human rights record .
Gordon Brown had earlier risked the anger of Beijing by announcing he would meet the Dalai Lama , the exiled Tibetan spiritual leader , when he visits Britain in May .
But the Prime Minister 's instinctive preference for cautious diplomacy was undermined by his minister 's strongly - worded warning to Beijing not to resort to brute force against the demonstrators .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Lord Malloch - Brown said : " China will damage its own interests and the reputation of the event , perhaps irrevocably , if there is extensive violence . "
He said : " We will expect to see our athletes respect both the values of Britain – courtesy and respect for the country where the Games are – but also that supremely important value of speaking the truth as they see it . "
He made it clear he did not support a boycott of the Olympics .
But added : " We , however , as a Government , remain extremely concerned about the situation in Tibet .
We urge restraint by all sides . "
Mr Brown has always been much more restrained in his language over Tibet , perhaps mindful that a full - blown crisis over the Beijing Olympics could have a knock - on effect on the London games in four years ' time .
The Prime Minister disclosed that the Beijing government had told him it was prepared to hold talks with the Dalai Lama .
He revealed yesterday in the Commons that he had spoken with the Chinese premier Wen Jiabao to urge the authorities to show restraint in dealing with protesters .
" I made it absolutely clear that there had to be an end to violence in Tibet , " Mr Brown said .
" The premier told me that , subject to two things that the Dalai Lama has already said – that he does not support the total independence of Tibet , and that he renounces violence – that he would be prepared to enter into dialogue with the Dalai Lama . "
Lord Malloch - Brown 's intervention on the Olympics came as Beijing vowed to take the Olympic torch to Tibet despite the provocation that represents .
" The situation in Tibet has essentially stabilised , the Olympic torch relay will proceed as scheduled , " Jiang Xiaoyu , executive vice - president of the Beijing Organising Committee for the Olympic Games , told reporters .
The prospect of talks between the Chinese government and the Dalai Lama came as demonstrations continued in Tibet , despite a crackdown by Beijing that has killed an unknown number of people .
Whatever undertaking the Chinese premier may have given Mr Brown , in public officials continued to describe the Dalai Lama as a " wolf in monk 's robes , a devil with a human face but the heart of a beast " .
In Dharamsala – home to the Tibetan exiles – hundreds of Buddhist monks and civilians have been marching in protest : " We are showing the world what is happening in Tibet , " said one monk , Tashi .
" If Tibet is lost , then the world will lose peace and compassion . "
CHICAGO ( Reuters ) - Booming ethanol production may help lessen U.S. dependence on foreign oil , but it has already increased the grocery bill for the average American by $ 47 since July , according to a study from Iowa State University .

U.S. ethanol is made primarily from corn , which is a major source of feed for chickens , hogs and cattle .
As a result prices for both meat and eggs will rise , according to the study from the Center for Agricultural and Rural Development , which was partly funded by the livestock industry and released May 11 .
“ We are going to end up paying more for food domestically because we have an ethanol policy that is basically tying the price of corn and feed and the resulting food to the price of imported oil , ” said J. Patrick Boyle , chief executive of the American Meat Institute , one of the organizations which helped fund the study .
The livestock industry held conference call with reporters to draw attention to the impact ethanol is having on food .
“ Energy security is an admirable goal but its benefits of ethanol must be weighed against its consequences , ” he added .
FOOD VERSUS FUEL
The rise in ethanol production during the past year has already raised food prices by $ 47 per person , or 1.3 percent of the cost of a basket of goods typically consumed annually , due to higher corn prices , the study found .
In February this year , corn futures at the Chicago Board of Trade < 0 # C :> hit a 10 - year high of $ 4.37 - 1/ 4 a bushel , which prompted U.S. farmers to plant a record corn crop this spring , according to the U.S. Agriculture Department .
With traders anticipating a large harvest this fall , corn prices have since fallen to $ 3.73 .
The $ 47 increase in food comes as ethanol plants produced 4.9 billion gallons in 2006 .
Ethanol plants are expected to use 27 percent of the U.S. corn crop to make 9.3 billion gallons in the marketing year that starts September 1 , according to estimates from the U.S. Agriculture Department .
If ethanol production climbs to 30 billion gallons a year by 2012 , food prices will have risen a total of $ 67 , or 1.8 percent , the study found .
Meat would cost 7.0 percent to 8.5 percent more , while egg prices would climb 13.5 percent .
Corn prices would climb to $ 4.43 a bushel .
Biotech companies are working to boost the amount of corn that farmers can produce per acre .
The study said that higher corn yields could limit the rise in food prices if ethanol production peaks at 15 billion gallons annually by 2010 .
The study projects that under this scenario , corn prices would peak at about $ 3.43 per bushel in 2009 before leveling off at $ 3.16 per bushel by 2016 .
Ethanol production at that level would equate to approximately 10 percent of U.S. gasoline consumption .

Htwe is one of the 1988 student new generation , he is 27 years old and his father was a member of the A.B.S.D.F ( All Burma Student Democratic Font ) Regiment 216 in 1988 Thai- Burma border .
In 1988 Zaw min Htwe was 7 years old and he did n’t know about the whole story of Burma but he knew thousands of thousand students and people died at that time when the Burma terrorist military junta shoot innocent people down .
He could not completed his school , he went as far as high school year 7 when he left the country because of the political situation .
He was a very active freedom for Burma and hunger strike supporter .
This time Zaw Min Htwe wanted to join on Walk For Freedom and also he wants to write his story for Burma people .
Zaw says ” I could catch a plane to New York or post the Petition letter , I know its easy .
I have my brothers and sisiters I have a good parents with me , I have a house to live and I have enough foods to stay on this land USA .
Living in this country life style is 9 time out of 10 better than Burma , I ca n’t stand sitting in living room watching TV and forget everything past life .
I know this is not right , I have to help Burmese people from my side the best as I can , this walking is not for me and I am not showing myself who I am on the road everyday but I am showing why we are walking on long road , where we are from and why we have to do this for our country .
Realtively , people left in my home country , they have no freedom , they ca n’t do anything I am free to do here .
We all must help people of Burma , please help us ”

This is our regiment camp based on Thai - Burma border , this mountain completely covered with bush land .
After we left home for Democracy in Burma , this is where I grew up with my brothers on this place more than 10 years .
This is not someone writing fiction , this is true story , many life ’s had been buried for Democracy and Burma freedom but this is not finished , we have to do and this is our duty to do .
If I die new generation will take our place and they will take our duty till our country get freedom .
It was for so many reasons that I left my regiment and my friends , but this does not mean that I ran away from my country .
I have always wanted to do something for my country , but I do n’t know what the right way is for me to do this .
Before , I believed we needed international help for Burma , but I have n’t seen any help from the world .
There are only two choices left for every life in Burma , become a fugitive and rebel against their law , or obey their rules and stay with their ruling one - power government .
I already donated my life for my country , and now I have decided to do something that nobody else would do .
Maybe someone has already done this , maybe this is the first time , but I am not crazy and I am going to do this until my job is done .
I have decided to march to New York from my city .
I live in Portland , Oregon , about 2,500 miles east of New York by plane .
Walking this journey will be at least 3,000 miles .
It wo n’t be easy to get there like sitting on a plane is , I know and understand that I will be walking for more than six months , and I do n’t know what I will have to face on my journey .
Athein
A world away from America , the Southeast Asian nation of Burma made headlines in 2007 when Buddhist monks rose up in protest against the ruling military junta .
The Burmese junta responded with violence and thousands of monks have since disappeared .
While some ﬂed for their lives , many others have been tortured , jailed , or killed .
Oppression in Burma began long before last year ’s protests , though .
The military took over the government in 1962 and has ruled with an iron ﬁst ever since .
Over 650,000 people have been displaced and 3,000 villages have been destroyed by the junta , which targets civilians in ﬁghting against rebel groups .
Army battalions routinely conﬁscate land from locals to use for their own proﬁt .
Soldiers rape women with impunity and forced labor is common .
The junta has been destroying the environment to mine gold , jade , rubies , and to build oil pipelines and dams .
They are destroying the peoples ’ lives and land and keeping the proﬁt for themselves .
With an estimated 450,000 soldiers , Burma has one of the largest military forces in the world , and more than one - third of the national budget is spent on it .
The government only uses this force against its own citizens .
Nonetheless , countries like Russia and China continue to sell the Burmese junta the weapons that are the tool of their oppression .
In 1988 , Athein was just 15 years old .
After participating in the August ‘ 88 protests , he found himself marked by the military government and in danger .
With no other choice , he left his home and his family in northeast Burma and joined the multitude of student leaders who were ﬂeeing for their lives .
He traveled on foot through the jungles of Burma to the Thai border , where he joined other students and found shelter with the Karen National Union , an ethnic rebel group .
The students formed the All Burma Students Democratic Front , and continued their struggle against the junta from the border regions of Burma .
Like many other students , Athein eventually made his way to the United States as a refugee – where he continues to struggle for change in his homeland , and works tirelessly to raise awareness about the atrocities the Burmese junta is committing against its own people .
In March , 2008 , Athein will step out from Portland on a journey to the United Nations ofﬁces in New York .
Like thousands of Burmese who have traveled on foot through mountains and jungles in search of refuge , Athein will walk across the United States in a call to action to save Burma .
Along the way he will speak to people in towns across America , telling the story of millions of oppressed Burmese , and collecting signatures on a petition to present to the United Nations .
On August 8 , 2008 , China will hold the opening ceremony of the Beijing winter olympics , an event symbolic of global cooperation and peace .
Athein will present his petition to the UN on this day – 20 years to the date that the Burmese military gunned down 3,000 demonstrators in the now infamous 8 - 8 - 88 protests .
We have been writing for almost 3 years on this site about the privatization of energy data by IHS Energy and the negative impact the lack of accuracy that CERA 's historically optimistic claims are having on energy policy .
The rebuttals and counteranalysis at TOD to CERAs assertions are too numerous to list .
Today at the IHS Energy Conference in Houston , the CEO of IHS Energy , parent of CERA and other energy information agencies , asserted that Peak Oilers do n't have the data to support their claims .
This post is a brief rebuttal to this ' news ' coming out of Houston , and a plea to refocus the questions to what is relevant and probable , not on what is irrelevant and unlikely .
Well right off the bat I should point out , with a track record like the one above , I 'm not sure we want the data that IHS refers to ** , but here are some excerpts from the Bloomberg story this afternoon .
I should also state that it's not CERA 's fault that the traditional media still seems to fawn over their every assurance .
` Peak Oil ' Backers Don't Have Data to Support Claims , IHS Says By Edward Klump
Feb. 13 ( Bloomberg ) -- IHS Inc. , owner of Cambridge Energy Research Associates , said those who espouse the theory that the world 's oil production has already peaked lack evidence to support their claims .
" The only thing that 's relevant is our data , " Jerre Stead , chief executive officer at Englewood , Colorado - based IHS , said today in an interview in Houston .
Believers in the so - called Peal Oil theory " do n't have our data " .
Stead made his comments at an industry conference hosted by Cambridge Energy Research Associates , which is headed by Daniel Yergin , the energy researcher whose Pulitzer Prize - winning book was touted as a bible of the petroleum industry .
Yergin has said supposed oil shortages historically have eased as breakthroughs unlock new sources of crude .
U.S. oil futures jumped 57 percent last year on the way to topping $ 100 a barrel for the first time in January .
Peak Oil supporters include billionaire hedge - fund manager Boone Pickens and Houston investment banker Matthew Simmons .
Stead said some supporters of Peak Oil are interested in being consultants .
IHS is standing by the facts , he said .
" The Peak Oil discussion is useful in terms of trying to enlighten or shine a light on the discussion about where are the reserves today and what 's the production capacity from them " , Ron Mobed , IHS 's co-president , said today in an interview .
` Above - Ground Issues '
He said political concerns in places such as Nigeria present larger problems than getting oil out of the ground .
" The production capacity compared to actual production is moderated much more today by what we call above - ground issues than below - ground issues " , Mobed said .
Cambridge Energy Research Associates last month said worldwide oil production from established fields was declining at a slower rate than estimated by Peak Oil proponents .
Global production capacity for crude oil and condensate could climb from 91 million barrels a day in 2007 to as much as 112 million barrels a day by 2017 , when demand will be 101 million barrels , the firm said .
As a former ( and current ) stock trader , this all strikes me as a stubborn adherence to a fundamental theme , while the technical signals are pointing to the fact that there are some new underlying drivers to the market dynamics that the old school analysts have n't figured out yet .
I long ago gave up relying solely on fundamental analysis and now combine it with the ' trend is our friend ' .
The relevant trend in question is the 800 % + increase in oil prices over the past 8 years .
Something fundamental has changed in this period in the relationship between oil supply to oil demand - perhaps we do n't know precisely what is it is yet , but we do have some clues .
Our own government data , in an EIA release earlier this week , announced downward revisions in Crude +
Condensate oil production for November 2007 , confirming ( for now ) that 2005 is still the standing peak for oil production .
World production through the first 11 months of 2007 averaged 73,223,000 bpd which is 594,000 bpd below the average for 2005 .
November 2007 production is still 582,000 bp/d below the record month of May 2005 .
I do not know if this date will remain the peak for all time ( because I am not privy to the IHS database , of course ) , but since the record of the analysts writing here at theoildrum has been quite accurate for the last couple years , I would put the odds considerably higher than zero that 2005 - 6 was the peak for conventional crude oil .
Of course , it 's quite possible we may continue to expand the definition of what is " oil " to include algal biodiesel , used french fry drippings , oil extracted from garbage dumps , etc. adding on to the already inclusive crude , condensate , ethanol , NGPL , coal - to - liquids , processed tar sand bitumen , etc .
In any case , what is more important than the date of oils maximum production , is that neither the numbers by CERA , nor most data from the EIA show how much this oil costs to extract - the tone of the interview and comments is such that 112 million barrels in 2017 will still mean society can grow , function , etc. without diverting all its resources and natural capital to the endeavor .
Though this graphic from the EIA ( from the EIA report " Performance Profile of Major Energy Producers " ) , shows that finding and production costs , at least as of 2006 , were increasing much faster than the price of oil .
In short , what really matters is how much per barrel a globally interconnected complex society can afford .
Here is the actual ( public / free ) data from EIA graphically represented :
Chart by Matt Mushalik using EIA data showing incremental world oil production since 2001 ( thanks Gail )
Chart by Matt Mushalik using EIA data showing incremental OPEC oil production since 2001 ( thanks Gail ) )
The above graphs take the minimum monthly production for each country for the period 2001 - November 2007 and subtracts this minimum from each monthly production to arrive at an incremental production relative to the minimum .
For example , for the United States , the incremental oil production is the area in dark red in the top graph .
The advantage of this approach it gives a clearer view of how production has been changing recently .
- Note recent peak is well below prior 2005 peak for OPEC .
A Broken Clock is Right Twice a Day
" One should n't be investing with the mindset that oil 's going to be $ 100 forever ... A recession could change that pretty quickly "
This same logic may have precluded nations , regions and individuals from investing in long duration energy assets 2,3..6 years ago when energy was still cheap - that 's one of the biggest losses in all of this - the energy costs of lost opportunities .
Regarding Mr. Yergin 's recession comment , the one event that may finally make one of his price forecasts come true is a recession or depression in OECD nations , which will reduce demand and the ability to pay for oil , especially considering the leveraged - aka supercharged in both directions - nature of our monetary / financial system .
While at that point the broken clock may appear to again be working , the disincentives to invest , potential lack of financing available to new energy projects , ( both oil and alternative ) , and a retracement in revenues while costs remain high , brought about by the lower oil prices may cement 2005 as the global peak .
In other words , be careful in wishing to be right .
Here are some questions I respectfully offer to IHS Energy and CERA :
IHS Energy and CERA and their other subsidiaries are undoubtedly experts on the worlds oil fields .
But does field by field analysis of production capacity give us the answers that we need in todays complex and rapidly changing world ?
Here are some of the issues , from a birds eye view , that I believe the answers to which are very important :
1 ) At each tranche of predicted future oil production , how much will it cost to obtain those barrels ?
Please respond in :
* a ) dollar units ( 2008 inflation adjusted )
* b ) energy terms ( dollars being limited by political will and paper but energy being finite and requiring energy to procure )
* c ) environmental terms ( the planet being a place we not only procure energy from but also need to live on )
2 ) What is the shortfall risk if your data continues to give erroneous predictions of oil price and supply , as it has generally done , at least via your CERA subsidiary so far this century ?
Is the risk losing clients and money , or is the risk something greater ?
3 ) If below ground factors have informed us we have plenty of spare capacity , but we have plateaued for 2.5 years already in an environment of rapidly rising prices , at what point do you start to hire analysts who are experts on ' above ground factors ' ?
( Said differently , do the rules that governed the first half of oil supply apply equally to the era we have now entered ? )
4 ) What does the oil field data suggest the impact of a recession and credit contraction have on the future of supply ?
( e.g. since oil is priced at the marginal unit , some of the more expensive oil may not profitably come to market .
Also , some marginal production players may have higher financing costs or find credit unavailable , thus highlighting a key difference between production capacity and actual production . )
What impact will OECD 's ' borrowing from the future ' via 40 years in a row of debt increasing more than GDP have on the future affordability of oil ( and everything else ) and thus your forecasts ?
5 ) How should society best invest its remaining high quality energy stocks so future generations , including many living today , have reliable flows of energy ?
6 ) To best serve your clients interests ( which would then trickle down to energy policy ) , would you be willing to add interdisciplinary systems analysts to your mensa research staff , and look deeper at the interplay of the many different variables impacting oil availability , beyond just productive capacity ?
Here are some questions for long time theoildrum readers :
1 ) How can analysis and facts trump sound - bites and rhetoric about the urgency of the planetary energy and resource situation , before events themselves precipitate response ?
2 ) Should there be something similar to Sarbanes - Oxley with respect to energy analysis companies charging fees ?
What is the shortfall if IHS / CERA are wrong , or wrong by an order of magnitude ( e.g. peak is now as opposed to in 30 years + ) ?
3 ) If IHS forecasts for 100 mbpd + somehow are correct , how can society shift from using this energy bounty on short term novelty that has become conspicuous consumption , to something more meaningful ?
4 ) How do we get the traditional media , like Bloomberg and CNN , to start asking questions and writing more like scientists ?
** Note regarding data :
In all seriousness , the group of people I interact with at TOD are some smart cookies , and volunteer their time to work on thorny issues related to society 's energy future because there has been little market incentive for others to do so - so any credible data sent our way is welcomed - especially the expensive kind ) .
( A few of the TOD crew are currently working on an independent TOD megaprojects analysis ) .
It would be among my top wishes that the smart folks at IHS / CERA are correct in their oil production and price forecasts .
I will gladly eat crow in exchange for a more stable progressive world that has more time to turn an energy crisis into an energy transition .
When foodies talk about salt , they are usually referring to a blend of chemicals that is dominated by sodium chloride , but a Northern European treat , called salmiakki by the Finnish , is made from a different edible ionic compound — ammonium chloride .
In my opinion , it tastes like window cleaner , but the intense and somewhat irritating chemical has a practical side .
It is known to work as a cough medicine .
Regardless of how you feel about tasting mysterious molecules , offering the bizarre candy to your friends is a fantastic way to make them squirm while reminding them about the broader meaning of the term salt — any neutral compound that can be made by mixing an acid with a base .
Australia accused of helping with notorious CIA rendition flights

Is Australia unwittingly helping the US Central Intelligence Agency with the notorious secret flights known as renditions ?
Australian politicians and defense officials are refusing to address claims that Royal Australian Air Force ( RAAF ) servicemembers are unwittingly involved in CIA flights that transport terror suspects from Afghanistan to face possible torture , Australia 's Seven News reports .
Renditions are opposed by Australia 's government , but as Chris Reason reports , the RAAF admits it has no idea which planes originating from Australian - controlled air space are rendition flights .
Both the present and former governments deny involvement , says Reason .
A former minister under Howard said of the charge , " That is incredibly offensive , to suggest anything of the sort . "
Human rights groups such as Amnesty International stress that the Rudd government has an obligation to investigate the allegations .
CIA renditions reportedly involve harsh interrogation techniques of transported suspects , who are passed through various locales and sometimes handed over to countries that practice torture as a matter of course to extract information .
RAW STORY was the first to reveal the location of a secret CIA prison in Poland in March 2007 .
In related news , a city police chief in the United Kingdom who was leading an investigation of British cooperation in CIA renditions was found dead after having gone missing the day before .
Scientists in Japan have discovered a new species of bacteria that can live in hairspray , according to the results of a study published in the March issue of the International Journal of Systematic and Evolutionary Microbiology .
" Contamination of cosmetic products is rare but some products may be unable to suppress the growth of certain bacteria , " says Dr Bakir from the Japan Collection of Microorganisms , Saitama , Japan .
" We discovered a new species of bacteria called Microbacterium hatanonis , which we found contaminates hairspray . "
" We also found a related species , Microbacterium oxydans in hairspray which was originally isolated from hospital material .
Microbacterium species have been identified in milk , cheese , beef , eggs and even in the blood of patients with leukaemia , on catheters and in bone marrow . "
The scientists looked at the appearance and diet of the bacterium , then analysed its genome to show that it is an entirely new species .
" It has been named in honour of Dr Kazunori Hatano , for his contribution to the understanding of the genus Microbacterium , " says Dr Bakir .
Microbacterium hatanonis is rod-shaped and grows best at 30 °C and pH neutral .
Scientists now need to determine the clinical importance of the new species , as similar bacteria have been found to infect humans .
" Further testing will establish whether the species is a threat to human health , " says Dr Bakir .
" We hope our study will benefit the formulation of hairspray to prevent contamination in the future . "

As a filmmaker he has produced numerous documentaries for HBO .
Groubert is also the former editor of National Lampoon Magazine , MTV Magazine and The Weekly World News .
In addition , he currently writes for the L.A. Weekly , L.A. City Beat , Penthouse , High Times and other publications while on strike and doing stuff like this .
IN 1991 , Stewart Alsop , the editor of InfoWorld and a thoughtful observer of industry trends , predicted that the last mainframe computer would be unplugged by 1996 .
Last month , I.B.M. introduced the latest version of its mainframe , the aged yet remarkably resilient warhorse of computing .
Today , mainframe sales are a tiny fraction of the personal computer market .
But with the mainframe facing extinction , I.B.M. retooled the technology , cut prices and revamped its strategy .
A result is that mainframe technology  hardware , software and services  remains a large and lucrative business for I.B.M. , and mainframes are still the back - office engines behind the world ’s financial markets and much of global commerce .
The mainframe stands as a telling case in the larger story of survivor technologies and markets .
The demise of the old technology is confidently predicted , and indeed it may lose ground to the insurgent , as mainframes did to the personal computer .
But the old technology or business often finds a sustainable , profitable life .
Television , for example , was supposed to kill radio , and movies , for that matter .
Cars , trucks and planes spelled the death of railways .
A current death - knell forecast is that the Web will kill print media .
What are the common traits of survivor technologies ?
First , it seems , there is a core technology requirement : there must be some enduring advantage in the old technology that is not entirely supplanted by the new .
But beyond that , it is the business decisions that matter most : investing to retool the traditional technology , adopting a new business model and nurturing a support network of loyal customers , industry partners and skilled workers .
Update 12/4/09 : In conjunction with Evil Mad Scientist Laboratories , I ’m pleased to announce that you can now buy a kit to actually build Bulbdial Clock !
Visit the product page for more information .
I think we can all agree that sundials pretty much suck .
They only have an hour hand , they do n’t work at night or indoors , their accuracy changes with the seasons , and if you happen to live in the Southern hemisphere they run backwards .
And yet , we all would love to be able to tell the time by looking at shadows , right ?
That ’s why I ’ve come up with the Bulbdial Clock .
The Bulbdial Clock has no hands — just one pole in the center of the clock , and three light sources of varying heights which revolve around the pole casting shadows .
In the model illustrated above , the light sources are each attached to a ring which rotates around the pole .
The innermost ring rotates once per minute , casting a “ second hand ” shadow .
The middle ring rotates once per hour , and casts the “ minute hand ” shadow .
And the outer ring rotates once every 12 hours , casting the “ little hand ” shadow .
The Bulbdial Clock can be used flat like a traditional sundial , or mounted vertically on a wall .
A variation on the design intended for large - scale installation ( such as in a museum ) involves a pole sticking up in the middle of a room , while the light sources are mounted on the ceiling , shining down on the pole as they rotate around it .
The Bulbdial Clock solves most of the sundial ’s problems , but it still has a problem of its own :
It does n’t work in bright light .
So the Bulbdial Clock is best suited for dim spaces such as restaurants and nightclubs .
Update : Evil Mad Scientist Laboratories has built a working model and posted several photos of the process .

This is a guest post from GLBL , who writes about personal finance at Gather Little by Little .
Many sources cite money as the number one cause of marital strife .
Some of you probably know this from first - hand experience .
I can relate , too .
My wife and I are very close , but money has always been a touchy subject , and unfortunately has led to a more than a few “ disagreements ” .
Last year , we decided to get control of our money instead of allowing our money to control us .
I did extensive reading and research , and we began to put some changes into place .
Since then , we 've learned what works for us and what does n't .
We are not experts , but I will say this : since we began this journey , we have n't once fought over our money .
Here are seven actions you can take today to stop fighting with your spouse about money .
They worked for us , and they 'll probably work for you .
Be a Team :
There is No “ I ” in “ Team ”
Between talking with people and listening to callers on The Dave Ramsey Show , I 'm surprised by the number of married people who talk about their finances and converse as if their spouse does n't even exist : “ When I do the budget ” , “ When I pay the bills ” , “ I am working two jobs to provide extra income ” , “ I … I … I ” .
Should n't they be saying “ We ” ?
With so many “ I ”s everywhere , it 's no wonder couples are fighting — they are n't communicating !
The best way to manage your finances is together .
Create your financial plan together , do the bills together , review your net worth together .
If you do anything related to your finances , make sure your spouse is involved and has a say so in the decision process .
Develop a Budget — Together !
From personal experience , one cause of fights ( or “ fussing ” , as we call it in the South ) is one spouse spending what the other spouse considers too much money .
This is generally a problem when the couple is already fairly tight on finances , or when one spouse is far more frugal than the other .
To resolve this issue , create a budget together .
It 's not important how you do it or what method you use , but that you create the budget together .
If both spouses do n't have input in the budget , they wo n't “ have any skin in the game ” .
Both should provide input on the numbers and be part of the process .
Hold Weekly Budget Review Meetings
If one spouse is doing all of the finances , it 's very difficult for the other spouse to know the current financial state .
Even with a budget , a lack of communication can make it difficult to know how much is left in the “ grocery category ” or the “ entertainment category ” .
To solve this problem , pick one night of the week to review your finances .
Pick a time when you and your spouse can devote 15 - 30 minutes without interruption .
For us , this is after our younger children are in bed .
I generally update our finances daily , but I always make sure the budget is updated before our meeting .
I print a copy of the budget that shows the amount we allocated for each category and how much we have remaining .
We review each category and discuss the amounts remaining and any expected expenditures for the week .
If we are short in one area and over in another , we move the money around .
If we are just short , we either decide to cut back and not spend , or we pull the funds from the emergency fund .
Review your finances frequently .
Communicate .
You 'll be amazed at the difference a little communication makes .
Establish an Emergency Fund
The most important thing you can do to keep your finances under control — and to avoid using credit cards and going into debt — is to establish an emergency fund .
Nothing stresses a couple more than running out of money before all the bills are paid .
Even worse is having the air conditioner or the car break down without money to get it fixed .
Establish a $ 1000 - $ 2000 emergency fund and put it in a high - interest savings account .
The emergency fund will cover those unexpected expenses .
The key is that each spouse must agree to not touch these funds without the other 's agreement .
This keeps the emergency fund from being used to buy big - screen TVs or designer pocket books .
It 's Okay to Make Mistakes
Being the detailed geeky type that I am , when we first started budgeting , I wanted the budget to be perfect .
I wanted us to follow it perfectly .
While discussing our finances one night , I found that my wife hated the budgeting process .
After some discussion , I realized it was n't the budgeting process she hated , but how I handled it .
The budget is n't going to be perfect .
It should get better as you do it more , but it will never be perfect .
That 's okay .
If you are off , just move the money around .
If you overspend , tap the emergency fund — just be sure to put the money back .
You 'll find that the longer you follow a budget , the easier and more accurate it becomes .
Like everything else , it 's a journey .
If you 're like us , just having a budget will be a huge leap in the right direction .
Agree to Hold Each Other Accountable
After we agree on the budget for the upcoming month , my wife and I do a pinky shake .
Is this a little silly ?
Sure , but it works for us .
Every time I am in the store and see some new shiny electronic gadget I want , that pinky shake reminds me of the commitment I made .
That little shake makes me question if I need the item or not .
I can't tell you how many times I 've walked out of a store empty - handed because of that little shake .
The point is to think of something both of you can do to commit to each other .
That little reminder is worth its weight in gold .
Get Out of Debt
Debt is a dark cloud that follows you constantly .
Debt puts pressure on your finances , and ultimately on your marriage .
Getting out of debt will give you financial freedom and peace of mind .
If you are in debt , stop getting further in debt right now .
If you have credit cards , shred them .
Is your car payment way too high ?
Sell it and buy something you can afford .
Is your mortgage beyond your means ?
Sell the house .
Once you have stopped going further into debt , begin aggressively paying what you owe .
My wife and I started this process about six months ago , and it 's brought us closer together .
What do you do to keep from fighting over your finances ?
Have you used any of these ideas ?
Have they worked for you ?
Kris and I mostly keep separate finances , so our approach is different .
I 'm curious to hear what works for people with joint accounts .

Truly , is there anyone less logical and self - aware than Bill O'Reilly ?
Well , I guess anyone who watches Bill and believes him ( as opposed to using him for comic relief ) .
Billo brings on former White House Spokesman Tony Snow to agree with him that the left and their media are completely out of touch with America .
Actually , I just described EVERY O'Reilly Factor show , did n't I ?
However , in yesterday 's edition of " When did I wake up on this side of the looking glass ? "
O'Reilly claims that it is the left wants the election to be all about Jesus so they do n't have to deal with the areas in which they 're weak :
O’REILLY : There have been more questions on religion than terrorism .
If the media can keep the argument on Jesus , and not on terrorism , taxes , redistribution of income , all of these things that the Democrats might have a little problem with , then that ’s a big win for the Democrats .
Keep it on Jesus , keep it into the bible thumping ‘ he ’s a Baptist , he ’s a Mormon , Giuliani married three times . ’
Keep it there and you win , that ’s a good strategy , Snow !
SNOW : Ah you know what ?
I do n’t think they ’re going to beat Jesus .
Um , yeah .
That 's why the Republican candidate Mitt Romney had to talk about faith equaling freedom -- because the left wanted him to .
And that 's why Huckabee 's website has a banner that says " Faith . Family .
Freedom " in that order -- because the left wanted him to .
And why the right came to McCain 's defense when he called the U.S. a " Christian nation " -- because the left wanted him to .
And Bill , when did " redistribution of income " become a rallying cry of the right ?
Did you get your talking points mixed up ?
HXQ : A Compiler from XQuery to Haskell Download HXQ - 0.19.0.tar.gz
Description
HXQ is a fast and space - efficient translator from XQuery ( the standard query language for XML ) to embedded Haskell code .
The translation is based on Template Haskell .
HXQ takes full advantage of Haskell 's lazy evaluation to keep in memory only those parts of XML data needed at each point of evaluation , thus performing stream - based evaluation for forward queries ( queries that do not contain backward steps ) .
This results to an implementation that is as fast and space - efficient as any stream - based implementation based on SAX filters or finite state machines .
Furthermore , the coding is far simpler and extensible since it is based on XML trees , rather than SAX events .
Since HXQ uses lazy evaluation , you get the first results of non-blocking queries immediately , while the non-streaming XQuery processors must first parse the entire input file and construct the whole XML tree in memory before they produce any output .
Finally , HXQ can store XML documents in a relational database ( currently MySQL or SQLite ) , by shredding XML into relational tuples , and by translating XQueries over the shredded documents into optimized SQL queries .
The mapping to relational tables is based on the document 's structural summary , which is derived from the document data rather than from a schema .
It uses hybrid inlining to inline attributes and non-repeating elements into a single table , thus resulting to a compact relational schema .
For each such mapping , HXQ synthesizes an XQuery that reconstructs the original XML document from the shredded data .
This XQuery is fused with the user queries using partial evaluation techniques and parts of the resulting query are mapped to SQL queries using code folding rules so that all relevant predicates are promoted to SQL .
This pushes most evaluation to the database query engine , thus resulting to a fast execution over large data sets .
Performance
HXQ shines best when used for data intensive applications .
For example , the XQuery in tests / Test2.hs , which is against the DBLP XML document ( 420 MB ) , runs in 36 seconds on my laptop PC and uses a maximum of 3.2MB of heap space ( using the runtime options +RTS - H2 m - M3.2 m ) .
( All results are taken on an Intel Core 2 Duo 2.2GHz 2GB running ghc - 6.8.3 on a 32 - bit Linux 2.6.27 kernel . )
To contrast this , Qexo , which compiles XQueries to Java bytecode , takes 1 minute 17 seconds and uses 1400 MB of heap space for the same query , while XQilla , which is written in C++ , takes 1 minute and 10 secs and uses 1150 MB of heap space .
For simple XPath queries , the fastest implementation I have ever tried is using SAX pipelines , which runs in 17secs and needs 3 MB heap .
Unfortunately , it is very hard to implement complex XQuery constructs using SAX , and one may end up simulating lazy evaluation using ad - hoc techniques .
For better performance in data intensive applications , one may use the database capabilities of HXQ .
For example , when the DBLP file is shredded into a MySQL database and the appropriate index is created , the above query runs in 90 milliseconds .
HXQ uses the HXML parser for XML ( developed by Joe English ) , which is included in the source .
I have also tried hexpat , tagsoup , HXT , and HaXML Xtract , but they all have space leaks .
HXQ has two XML parsers : one that generates simple rose trees from XML documents , which can be processed by forward queries without space leaks , and another parser where each tree node has a reference to its parent .
Some , but not all , backward axis steps ( such as the parent axis /.. ) are removed from a query using optimization rules .
If there are backward axis steps left in the query , then HXQ uses the latter parser , which may result to a performance penalty due to space leaks .
Installation Instructions ( HXQ without Database Connectivity )
HXQ can be installed on most platforms but I have only tested it on Linux , Mac OS X , and Windows XP .
The simplest installation is without database connectivity ( ie , it can only process XQueries against XML text documents ) .
If you want database connectivity ( over MySQL or sqlite relational databases ) , look at the installation instructions for database connectivity .
First , you need to install the Glasgow Haskell Compiler , ghc .
Optionally , if you want to modify the XQuery parser , you need to install the parser generator for Haskell , happy .
If you are new to Haskell , please read How to install a Cabal package .
The easiest way to install packages in Haskell is using cabal .
On Linux , you can install Haskell and cabal using yum install ghc happy cabal - install .
You must then update the list of known packages using cabal update .
The simplest way to install the HXQ library is by using the cabal command :
cabal install HXQ
( If you use the old base - 3 ghc library , use the option - fbase3 in cabal ) .
Then , to compile the xquery command line interpreter , you download xquery.hs and you do :
ghc -- make xquery.hs -o xquery
tar xfz
runhaskell Setup.lhs configure -- user runhaskell Setup.lhs build runhaskell Setup.lhs install
HXQ consists of the executable xquery , which is the XQuery command line interpreter , and the HXQ library .
To use the HXQ library in a Haskell program , simply import Text.XML.HXQ.XQuery .
Current Status
HXQ supports most essential XQuery features , although some system functions are missing ( but are easy to add ) .
Note that HXQ is a proof - of - concept ( prototype ) implementation ; it 's not fully compliant with the W3C specs .
One may use HXQ as a basis for a fully compliant XQuery implementation ( conforming to W3C test suits ) , but currently I do not have the time to do so .
To see the list of supported system functions , run xquery - help .
Here are some important differences between HXQ and the W3C specs :
Currently , all namespaces in HXQ XQueries must be defined using import schema or declare namespace .
Although HXQ recognizes xmlns : attributes in XML files and XQuery constructions , these namespaces are not imported .
or .
Although HXQ recognizes attributes in XML files and XQuery constructions , these namespaces are not imported .
The XQuery semantics requires duplicate elimination and sorting by document order for every XPath step , which is very expensive and unnecessary in most cases .
This is not currently supported by HXQ but will be addressed in the future ( needs a static analysis to determine when duplicate elimination is necessary ) .
For example , e//*//* may return duplicate elements in HXQ .
may return duplicate elements in HXQ .
Attributes in constructed elements must be either embedded in the start - tag , and / or , if the element content is a sequence , they must appear at the beginning of the sequence as constructed attributes .
XQuery Documentation
The complete XQuery syntax in HXQ is described in hxq -manual.pdf .
I have also written a paper that describes some of the database related methods used in the implementation .
Here some tutorials on XPath and XQuery .
Here are two relevant courses on XML and databases at Stanford and ETH .
Using the Compiler
The main functions for embedding XQueries in Haskell are :
$ ( xe query ) :: XSeq
$ ( xq query ) :: IO XSeq
query
XSeq
[ XTree ]
( IO XSeq )
v
$v
v
XSeq
( XSeq , ... , XSeq ) -> IO XSeq
Here is an example of a main program :
f( x , y ) = $ ( xq " < article > < first > { $x}</ first >< second >{$y}</ second ></article > " ) main = do a <- $ ( xq " < result > { / / for $ x at $ i in doc ( 'data/dblp.xml ' ) // inproceedings / / where $ x / author = ' Leonidas Fegaras ' / / order by $ x / year descending / / return < paper > { $ i , ' ) ' , $ x/ booktitle / text ( ) , / / ' : ' , $ x/ title /text ( ) / / }</paper > / / }</result > " ) putXSeq a b <- $ ( xq " f ( $ a / paper [ 10 ] , $ a / paper [ 8 ] ) " ) putXSeq b
ghc - O2 -- make tests / Test1.hs -o a.out
You can compile an XQuery file into a Haskell program ( Temp.hs ) using xquery -c file .
Or better , you can use the script compile ( on Unix / Mac or Windows ) to compile the XQuery file to an executable .
For example :
compile data / q1.xq
a.out
Using the Interpreter
The HXQ interpreter is far more slower than the compiler ; use it only if you need to evaluate ad - hoc XQueries read from input or from files .
The only function is :
xquery :: String -> IO XSeq
xquery
xquery data / q1.xq
xquery -p xpath - query xml-file
xquery - p " //inproceedings [ 100 ] " data/dblp.xml
xquery - help
XML Schema Validation and Type Inference
Currently , HXQ supports type testing and casting using the XQuery expressions : typeswitch , instance - of , cast - as , etc .
The validation and type inference systems are still a work in progress .
To use type inference , use the option - tp in xquery .
To associate an XML document with an XML Schema , use the XQuery import schema statement .
For example :
import schema default element namespace " dept " at " data/department.xsd " ; validate {doc( " data/cs.xml " ) // gradstudent} ; ( doc( " data/cs.xml " )//gradstudent[.//lastname='Galanis']//address ) instance of element ( address ) *
validateFile
validateFile " data/dblp.xml " " data/dblp.xsd "

The Electronic Frontier Foundation wants to know all there is to know about contacts between Google and a Justice Department official involved in a highly charged 2006 government - snooping dispute that ensnared the search giant .
That DoJ official , Jane Horvath , was subsequently hired by Google last year as senior privacy counsel .
( Update : This statement just arrived from a Google spokesperson : " Google did not work with Jane Horvath on this issue when she was at DoJ. " ...
Do n't know what to make of that other than , if accurate , it would seem as though the DoJ could have told the EFF the same thing six months ago .
...
Next day update here : EFF says that reply completely misses the point . )
The government has for six months refused Freedom of Information
Act requests from EFF to see correspondence between Horvath and Google for the period the former was employed as the DoJ 's first chief privacy and civil liberties officer ( insert laugh track here ) , according to a suit filed yesterday by the EFF .
From the EFF press release :
Jane C. Horvath was named the DOJ 's first Chief Privacy and Civil Liberties Officer in February of 2006 .
At that time , Google was fighting a massive DOJ subpoena asking for the text of every query entered into the search engine over a one - week period .
The DOJ request - part of a court battle over the constitutionality of a law regulating adult materials on the Internet - ignited a national debate about Internet privacy .
The DOJ later scaled back its request , and a judge eventually allowed access to only 5,000 random Google search queries .
In a subsequent news article , Horvath was publicly critical of the DOJ 's initial subpoena , saying she had privacy concerns about the massive request for information .
Horvath 's new job as Google 's Senior Privacy Counsel was announced in August of 2007 .
" Google has an unprecedented ability to collect and retain very personal information about millions of Americans , and the DOJ and other law enforcement agencies have developed a huge appetite for that information , " said EFF Senior Counsel David Sobel .
" We want to know what discussions DOJ 's top privacy lawyer had with Google before leaving her government position to join the company . "
While Horvath 's career path represented a sequence of events guaranteed to raise eyebrows , it 's also not clear from the release what exactly the EFF is suspecting it might find in the Horvath / Google correspondence , so I asked for clarification from Sobel .
" It 's a request that we very well might have made under any circumstances - the DOJ 's chief privacy official 's contacts with the world 's largest private repository of info about online activity , " he writes .
" The fact that she ended up working for Google made it all the more intriguing to know what kinds of contacts there were .
We 're not after anything in particular , just a window into the relationship between these two powerful entities vis - à - vis privacy issues . "
What requires no explanation is why the Justice Department has refused to comply with the EFF 's request for what is clearly public information : the Bush Administration 's fetish for secrecy and bedrock conviction that it operates above the law .
The Justice Department told Associated Press that it had no comment on the matter .
I 've asked Google for a response .
Do n't expect anything meaningful .
( About that I was apparently wrong ; see update above . )
Are You Afraid to Change ?
Afraid to Change
Are you afraid to change ?
We all are .
It ’s a side effect of the way our mind makes sense of the world .
Let me explain .
Let ’s say that your brain did n’t use your experience to help you understand the world .
Your perception of every object , in every moment , would be brand new , and you would spend all your time and attention trying to make sense of the simplest experiences .
That ’s not how your mind works .
Instead , your mind finds patterns in your experience , and tries to fit every new situation into an existing pattern , so you know how to act with minimum conscious thought .
This leaves your conscious mind free to focus on the truly new situations that you experience .
How wonderful it would be if we could calmly , clearly , and consciously analyze our new experiences .
Unfortunately , our mind forces new things into old patterns , even when they do n’t fit .
And when we encounter something that does n’t fit at all into our established patterns , our first instinct is to protect ourselves , while we see if the situation is dangerous .
It ’s the same when we think about changing how we live , or who we are .
You really want those changes .
And you find it pretty easy to imagine how wonderful such a life would be .
Still , part of you does n’t recognize that new “ you ” .
The imagined you does n’t fit into your existing patterns of safe experience , and is treated with caution , until that new you can be experienced and proven safe .
But will you ever get to experience that new you ?
If a new you might be dangerous , the safest alternative is to completely avoid becoming that new you .
And for many of us that danger and fear stops us from making real progress toward our dreams .
The Shared Experience of Joy and Pain
Pain shared is lessened , joy shared is increased Spider Robinson
There are two ways of experiencing the world .
Isolated .
You can experience the world , even people , as objects – unendingly separate and different than you
Connected .
Or , you can experience the world as a thick web , with endless connections between you and everything that seems outside of you
Most of us live with a combination of both points of view , although the isolated , object point of view usually dominates us .
It does n’t seem to be a choice , though .
The way we live is strongly shaped by our personality , and many influences that surround us .
But you have a choice .
You can choose to move toward a life of greater connectedness , or greater isolation .
And that choice is not as simple as being sociable , or moving away from people .
You can be highly sociable with people in a superficial way , so that you remain isolated within .
Do you experience joy and pain in isolation ?
Are your joys and suffering something that exists only within you ?
As the above quote suggests , joy and suffering are different when shared .
Suffering does n’t disappear by sharing it , by expressing it to those that your heart truly connects with .
But the pain is different , weaker , more bearable .
Joy , on the other hand , is not weakened by sharing it with those who you have real connections to .
It grows , not only because others experience joy , but the joy in your own heart is different .
Stories of Joy and Pain
We have many experiences of joy and pain in our lives .
If someone asks you to tell the story of your life , will you tell them a soap opera of every pain and pleasure and joy , regardless of meaning ?
A good story has meaning .
And in our lives , there are moments of pain and joy that have great meaning for us .
You remember the powerful pain and joy that you have experienced .
But only some of those intense moments have led to a greater you .
You may still be wounded and trapped by the emotional pain of some of those moments .
They may be little more for you than uncomfortable baggage that you carry around .
Then , there are other moments of pain that you faced , and through the challenge of the situation , you grew .
Some of your experiences of joy were only momentary pleasures , and you may look back on them with longing , finding the past more pleasant than the present .
Or , your joy may come from the feeling of seeing something great and wonderful .
It may have been a personal achievement , or a touch of something extraordinary .
Did those joys lead you to rededicate yourself to the values and actions which gave rise to them ?
With that rededication , you grew , and became someone more capable of bringing such joy into your life , and the lives of your friends and family .
This joy and pain in our lives that challenged us to grow , brought us into the future .
This is the joy and pain that is truly , personally meaningful .
To grow from such powerful experiences is difficult , for as we ’ve said , we ’re afraid to change
Were you all alone in those challenging moments ?
Did you share these moments of challenge with the right friends , and become energized by their support ?
Did their help enable you to make those moments meaningful ?
Safety in Numbers
Year after year , we make plans to find and live our dreams .
To get there , we must pass through changes that frighten us .
When you feel that you are not alone , you feel stronger .
Challenges that would frighten you , seem small with the support of others .
We can plan alone , and try to walk alone , and seek no help to achieve our dreams .
Or , we can find the right friends , mentors , and a mastermind group to support us , as we do the challenging work of becoming the person of our dreams .
KABUL ( Reuters ) - Some 5,000 Afghans chanted “ death to Denmark ” and “ death to the Netherlands ” in Kabul on Friday , protesting against the reprinting of a cartoon of the Prophet Mohammad in Danish newspapers and a Dutch film on the Koran .
Sporadic demonstrations have sprung up across the deeply conservative country in recent weeks against the cartoons and the film with protesters demanding Danish and Dutch troops be withdrawn from Afghanistan and their embassies shut down .
Protesters gathered around a mosque in the west of the Afghan capital after Friday prayers chanting “ death to Denmark ” , “ death to the Netherlands , “ death to America ” and “ death to Jews ” .
Demonstrators burned Danish and Dutch flags and also an effigy of Dutch right - wing politician Geert Wilders , who is due to release a film thought to be critical of the Koran later this month .
Wilders has given few details of the film , but in the past he has called Islam ’s holy text a “ fascist ” book that “ incites violence ” .
One unidentified speaker addressing the angry crowd through a megaphone from the back of a truck said the Afghan government should expel Danish and Dutch troops and close their embassies within two days or “ we will take action ” .
The Netherlands has some 1,650 troops , mainly in southern Afghanistan and 14 Dutch soldiers have been killed fighting Taliban militants .
Denmark , meanwhile , has 550 troops in northern and southern Afghanistan and 11 of its soldiers have been killed .
Al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden this week warned that Europe would be punished for the cartoons , first published by a Danish paper in September 2005 .
The images ignited violent protests across the world , including in Afghanistan , when newspapers around the world reprinted them the following year .
Last month , some Danish newspapers reprinted one of the cartoons in solidarity with the cartoonist after three men were arrested on suspicion of plans to kill him , sparking more anger .
Many Muslims consider any depiction of the Prophet as offensive .
Resentment is growing against the presence of more than 50,000 foreign troops in Afghanistan .
Many Afghan are frustrated at poor security and the slow pace of development more than six years after U.S. - led and Afghan forces toppled the Taliban after the hardline Islamist movement refused to hand over bin Laden in the wake of the September 11 attacks on the United States .

The third time was the charm for pretest of the new optical ballot scanners at the Cuyahoga County Board of Elections .
Chief Investigator Duane Pohlman reported that the board ran two tests of the scanners on Friday , and during both tests , the computer repeatedly showed an error message .
However , a third test ran successfully .
The Board of Elections said previous tests of the scanners were successful , and officials do not know why the scanners did not initially read the ballots .
Pohlman reported that the BOE is looking into possibly having a batch of bad disks .
Friday 's tests were public pretests that are required by law .
Why must it always come down to Ohio ?

When we set the price of a Lindt truffle at 15 cents and a Kiss at one cent , we were not surprised to find that our customers acted with a good deal of rationality : they compared the price and quality of the Kiss with the price and quality of the the truffle , and then made their choice : About 73 percent of them chose the truffle and 27 percent chose a Kiss .
Now we decided to see how FREE !
might change the situation .
So we offered the Lindt truffle for 14 cents and the Kisses free …
But what a difference FREE ! made .
The humble Hershey ’s Kiss became a big favorite .
Some 69 percent of our customers ( up from 27 percent before ) chose the FREE !
Kiss , giving up the opportunity to get the LIndt truffle for a very good price .
That is from Dan Ariely ’s new and excellent Predictably Irrational : The Hidden Forces that Shape Our Decisions .
Here is Dan ’s book - related blog .
All of a sudden my head is spinning , wondering what a relative price ratio really means ( we ca n’t divide by zero ) .
Or is this just the Alchian and Allen theorem on steroids , namely the claim that fixed charges encourage the consumption of the higher quality good ?
Or I think : " Zero , is there something special about that number ? "
There is more on the way in behavioral economics .

But Hillary  carried on the padded shoulders of the older women in Texas , Ohio and Rhode Island who loved her “ I Will Survive ” rallying cry that “ I am a little older and I have earned every wrinkle on my face ”  has been saved to fight another day .
Exit polls have showed that fans of Hillary  who once said they would be happy with Obama if Hillary dropped out  were hardening in their opposition to him , while Obama voters were not so harsh about her .
Three Hillary volunteers , older women from Boston , approached a New York Times reporter in an Austin , Tex. , parking lot on Tuesday to vent that Hillary has n’t gotten a fair shake from the press .
They said that they used to like Obama but now ca n’t stand him because they think he has been cocky and disrespectful to Hillary .
As Hillary , remarkably and cleverly , put Obama on the defensive about a real estate deal , health care and Nafta , her campaign ratcheted up the retro battle of the sexes when they sent Dianne Feinstein onto the Fox News Sunday - morning talk show to promote the idea that Hillary should not be forced out , regardless of the results of Tuesday ’s primaries , simply because she ’s a woman .
“ For those of us that are part of ‘ a woman need not apply ’ generation that goes back to the time I went out to get my first job following college and a year of graduate work , this is an extraordinarily critical race , ” the senator said .
" So WTF makes you think you can make money in real estate ? "
My delicate and gentle wife poses this question to me one night as I broach the topic that has intrigued me of late .
She levels me with the " you must be out of your mind " look and rolls her eyes .
" I mean , there are things around this house that have needed fixing forever .
You barely know what part of a hammer to hit the nail with .
You think a screwdriver always involved vodka . "
" I 'm not that bad , " I demur , my Man Pride pricked .
" Besides I have watched every single episode of " Flip This House " for the past three years , and the real estate game absolutely fascinates me .
Armando Montelongo and Than Merrill are my heros , although they seem to be focusing their efforts now more on selling their programs than on flipping real estate .
" That 's because there are chumps like you out there who will send them money , " she demurely admonished .
But sweetie , all the pundits say that now is the time to buy !
The prices are low , getting lower , and eventually will rise again as demand increases .
And mortgage rates are low !
We have money to invest , and do you think the stock market is really going to get us great returns ? "
" All those people are the real estate agents ! "
They want you to buy stuff so they make more money . "
" But the Real Estate Guys have said the dumb money is out of the market now ! " I insisted .
" It 's time to get in - to buy !
There are foreclosures , and I hear banks are ready to deal .
There are short sale opportunities . "
" Well , it looks as though more dumb money is about to come in , she said .
But if you 're gonna do this , I guess you 're gonna do it .
But I am going to LMAO the first time you get some psycho tenant calling you to complain about a dripping faucet at midnight .
And DO NOT lose money ! "
So there it was - a wholehearted endorsement and full permission to proceed !
I was good to GO !
So what do I do now ?
How to get started ?
This blog will be a chronicle of my journey into the real estate business , for better or freakin ' worse .
How I got started ( Who did I call ?
Where did I look ? )
How I educated myself ( resources , books , teachers , seminars )
What I learned and what I should have learned
Mistakes - you will learn as I do !
Whether I make or lose money - really .
That 's what this is ALL about .
I really hope to be able to report that I MADE it .
Come along for the ride , if you are interested .
It should be fun .
I promise I will tell the unvarnished truth about my education , accomplishments and abysmal failures .
I do not think for a minute this is going to be easy , but I do think if even moderately successful I will have a great time doing it .
I invite your comments and thoughts .
If you have something to teach me about real estate , by ALL means weigh in .
If you see me screwing up , please tell me .
And if I do something right I want to hear about that too !

The Jewish Circumcision Resource Center issued a statement to Jewish Americans last week to encourage critical thinking about circumcision and dispel various cultural misunderstandings about the practice .
“ We want Jews to know that in this country and abroad , some Jews do not circumcise their sons .
Circumcision is a choice , and now that we know the serious harm caused by circumcision , there are strong reasons to forgo it , ” said Ronald Goldman , Ph.D. , Executive Director .
Dr. Goldman is the author of Questioning Circumcision : A Jewish Perspective , endorsed by five rabbis .
Dr. Goldman also suggests that Jews think about the ethics of causing significant pain and cutting off a natural , healthy body part that has important functions .
“ There are psychological effects of circumcision , too .
Some Jewish men are very dissatisfied , angry , or distressed about being circumcised , ” said Dr. Goldman .
The Center ’s primary intended audience is those Jews who generally evaluate an idea not solely based on its conformance with the Torah , but also in light of its agreement with reason and experience .
For those Jews who decide against circumcision , there are over a dozen rabbis who will lead an alternative welcoming ceremony for baby boys called a brit shalom .
ICGI notes that this is not the first time the ritual has been questioned .
Twice Jewish leadership has considered abandoning the blood rite .
The majority of Jews in the United States belong to secular or Reform groups for which circumcision is optional .
Sun needs to do something drastic else Swing will drown .
Although many people tease about the complexity of Swing , it does do a lot of things right .
Unfortunately the ship has not turned fast enough to reach its potential , and it is losing the race fast to the Web , Air , and WinForms .
Sun seemed to put its might into JavaFX and left Swing itself with a skeleton crew that I feel sorry for .
A lot of the top Swing folk have actually left .
Some for Google , and some for Adobe .
How many people do you think are working on the Swing core ?
I bet you would be shocked .
I think that more people live at Ben ’s house :)
How many young developers do you hear jumping into Swing development ?
The “ cool ” factor is n’t there .
It is all about the Web and Air .
The Air development team is growing fast .
Who can save Swing ?
Sun needs to put its hands in its wallet , but it does n’t appear to be doing anything other than hoping that JavaFX can compete .
Ouch .
Update : I got a lot of emails and comments on this , so I have written up more thoughts on my reasoning .

The record industry is in dire trouble and the major record companies know it .
According to the IFPI ’s most recent figures , “ physical ” music sales were down 11 % to $ 17.5 bn in 2006 , and , blaming piracy — both CD copying and online file - sharing — the IFPI says that overall music sales have fallen for the seventh year running .
However , none of this was unpredicted , and in post - Napster 2003 , Steve Jobs appeared to offer the recording industry a way into the future , through the iTunes Music Store .
People did n’t want to steal music , argued Jobs , and if paid - for downloads could compete on price and convenience , then many of those illegal file traders would be converted back into paying customers .
As a result , Jobs insisted on the unbundling of albums ; instead all tracks would be offered for purchase individually , at the same price — 99 c — whether they be a new release , top 40 hit , or an older and more obscure song .
To which the majors reluctantly complied , and would later learn to regret .
Fast - forward again to 2007 , and although paid - for downloads are on the increase , they are n’t rising nearly fast enough to make up for the loss in revenue from falling CD sales .
By Jobs ’ own admission , on average only three percent of music on an iPod originates from the iTunes Music Store .
As if to rub salt in the wound , iPod sales accounted for nearly half of Apple ’s total revenue for 2006 .
Instead of recognizing that the record industry ’s aging business model , even with the intervention of Jobs , is a broken one and in desperate need of a fix , the response has largely been litigation coupled with the introduction of technology , in the form of DRM , designed to enforce copy protection , which , ultimately , just inconveniences paying customers .
If the iTunes model is n’t the answer , and business ca n’t go on as usual , then what is ?
Here are five alternative models for selling music , many of which are actually being tested by artists , entrepreneurs , and even the major record labels themselves .
Free
If music is becoming ubiquitous , through illegal file - sharing , supported by mass storage MP3 players , then why not just give it away ?
The “ free ” model does n’t mean not making money from music .
Instead , the tracks themselves are treated as a loss leader , designed to promote the artist and drive sales of other associated products , such as concert tickets and merchandise .
Jamendo
Jamendo is a web service that embraces the “ free ” model by helping artists to distribute their music for free , under a Creative Commons license , on peer - to - peer filesharing networks such as BitTorrent or eMule .
Jamendo users can also discuss and rate tracks , as well as make a donation directly to the artists whose music they ’re fans of .
Additionally , Jamendo has an ad-revenue scheme for artists who set - up - shop on the site .
Prince
Prince gave his most recent album away for free , or more accurately , a British Sunday newspaper did .
How much he got paid by the newspaper we do n’t know , but Prince claimed the deal was primarily about getting his music into the hands of as many people as possible and to help promote his upcoming UK tour .
It was later reported that all of Prince ’s UK dates had sold out almost as soon as they went on sale .
However , the move did n’t go down so well with the recording industry .
The UK arm of Sony BMG withdrew from Prince ’s global deal , refusing to distribute the album to UK stores .
Retail store , HMV , was equally unimpressed , with chief executive Simon Fox describing the arrangement as “ absolute madness . ”
SpiralFrog
Launched last month , SpiralFrog lets users download music for free , in return for viewing advertising ( see our full review ) .
In addition to viewing ads while searching for and downloading music , the service requires users to log in to the site and view ads at least once every 30 days , or the downloaded music for the account becomes disabled .
SpiralFrog is built on a revenue - sharing agreement with participating labels , and currently offers a catalog of 800,000 songs and 3,500 music videos .
Pay what you want
Radiohead
Similar to “ free ” , the “ pay what you want ” model came into the public eye most recently when Radiohead released their new album , In Rainbows , with a voluntary price tag .
Fans can choose what to pay for the album , including nothing at all .
Jane Siberry
The artist , Jane Siberry , makes a similar offer to fans , with the difference that they can choose what they ’d like to pay , after they ’ve already downloaded and listened to the album first .
Magnatune
Magnatune is an online music service which has built much of its business around the “ pay what you want ” model .
Albums carry a low minimum price , with fans able to decide how much more to pay after that .
In an email , I asked Magnatune founder , John Buckman , how fans , artists and record labels have responded to the “ pay what you want ” model .
“ New visitors to Magnatune see the “ we are not evil ” slogan and justifiably remain skeptical .
The “ how much do you want to pay ? ” question they get when they click the “ buy ” button is so shocking , so different than any traditional business , that it usually puts a smile on their face and makes them True Believers in the Magnatune Way .
Labels think it ’s insane .
Artists often think it ’s a bad idea * before * they ’ve been signed to Magnatune but when they see that on average they will earn more money with this scheme than setting an $ 8 fixed price ( on average , $ 8.21 ) , and that fans will be able to express their strong positive feelings by optionally paying more ( even , a lot more ) . ”
Buckman also says that even when users choose only to pay $ 5 , they tend to spend more overall , buying several albums at once .
Pay by popularity
AmieStreet
AmieStreet , of which Amazon is a recent investor , is a social market place for artists to connect with fans and promote and sell their music .
The site has pioneered a “ pay by popularity ” model , whereby transparent market forces dictate the price of music .
All tracks on AmieStreet start off free , then the more the track gets downloaded , the more the price increases in increments , all the way up to the industry standard of 98 c .
This is in complete contrast to iTunes , whereby all tracks are priced the same , irrespective of how popular or obscure they are — something which the major labels are desperate to change .
Subscription
Legendary music producer , Rick Rubin , recently told the New York Times that subscription services are the way forward .
“ You ’d pay , say , $ 19.95 a month , and the music will come anywhere you ’d like .
In this new world , there will be a virtual library that will be accessible from your car , from your cellphone , from your computer , from your television .
Anywhere .
The iPod will be obsolete , but there would be a Walkman - like device you could plug into speakers at home .
You ’ll say , ‘ Today I want to listen to … Simon and Garfunkel , ’ and there they are .
The service can have demos , bootlegs , concerts , whatever context the artist wants to put out .
And once that model is put into place , the industry will grow 10 times the size it is now . ”
However , despite what Rubin says , services such as Rhapsody have n’t reached mass adoption , as it ’s not clear that people are ready to “ rent ” their music .
Another reason might be that we have n’t yet reached ubiquitous Internet access .
When all of our music can “ live in the clouds ” , accessible at any time , owning it outright may no longer be that important .
A music tax
It ’s an old idea and one that UMG was rumored to be pushing most recently : some sort of music tax , possibly collected via your Internet Service Provider .
The idea is to charge the customers of ISPs and cellphone carriers a flat - rate fee as part of their data service plan , in exchange for the right to download and share the major record labels ’ music over an ISP ’s network .
That way , filesharing is decriminalized and the recording industry is guaranteed revenue .
Other forms of music tax could include a tax on digital audio players , similar to how some countries tax blank CDs , or direct taxation through government .
All three variations would require the different parties — including all five major labels and government — to agree to work together , something which is very unlikely to happen .
Additionally , if a file - sharing tax makes up the majority of the music industry ’s revenue , it ’s hard to see what incentive there would be for the major record labels , with their huge back - catalogs , to continue to invest in new artists .

This post was last updated : Friday , December 16 , 2016 at 10:32 AM , Central European Time ( CET )
There ’s something chilling about journalists being detained and tried in a foreign country … a prospect made all the more uncomfortable when you throw the “ Dear Leader ” into the mix .
But , do we really know what ’s about to happen ?
Well , aside from the fact that they ’re going to be tried “ according to the indictment of the competent organ “ ?
Frankly , there ’s little information about what Laura Ling and Euna Lee are about to experience , unsurprising considering the state of information flow to and from the reclusive Democratic People ’s Republic of Korea ( DPRK – also known as North Korea ) .
Based on the nuggets available , the DPRK has never held an official trial for a foreigner .
Evan Hunziker , a missionary who swam from China to North Korea in 1996 – now that ’s determination !
– was detained for a few months and then released only to commit suicide a little later .
Hunziker did not have the benefit of legal proceedings .
Here ’s what is known :
Ling and Lee will be tried in the Central Court , the top court in the DPRK .
Typically , this is an appellate court , but for cases considered to be extreme – and against the country itself – it has initial jurisdiction .
In a sense , this would be like to alleged criminals being tried by the Supreme Court in the United States .
So , it looks like the DPRK is trying to make a point .
The judges are elected by the Supreme People ’s Assembly – the North Korea ’s legislative body .
The trial itself will have one judge and two “ people ’s assessors . ”
The latter are essentially “ lay judges . ”
Appeals usually warrant a panel with three actual judges .
% Gallery - 11848 %
% Gallery - 11618 %
% Gallery - 11468 %
Now , this next point is interesting .
You do not have to have any legal education or experience to become a judge .
Before going on a tirade about the injustice of it all , consider the requirements for becoming a Supreme Court justice .
There is no education or experience requirement in the U.S. Constitution .
And , the justice has to be confirmed by the legislative body – which sounds strangely like a legislative body ’s voting to select judges .
In some states , such as New York , the electorate votes for judges , many of whom not only have no legal education or experience but routinely screw up trials because their rulings are contrary to law .
On paper , at least , the two systems are n’t all that different .
The Central Court ’s rulings ca n’t be appealed .
If I remember correctly ( and it ’s been a while since high school civics class ) , you ca n’t appeal a Supreme Court ruling .
To whom would you appeal it ?
Here ’s where it get ’s a little creepy .
In North Korea , the accused does not have the right to defend herself ( or , of course , himself ) and does not have the right to be represented by a lawyer .
A defense attorney can be selected , according to DPRK law , by the defendant , the defendant ’s family or her “ organizational representatives ” – probably Current TV , in this case .
Neither Ling nor Lee has had any legal access , so it seems unlikely that they ’ll get to pick a lawyer .
I doubt Current TV or the families will have much of a say .
Even if they could choose lawyers , pickings are slim .
The U.S. State Department states that there is “ no indication that independent , nongovernmental defense lawyers [ are available ] . ”
The trial will be conducted in Korean , but the defendants will be able to use their own languages during the trial – a trial that is open to the public , unless there is concern that state secrets may be exposed .
Defector testimony suggests that trials are usually closed .
Depending on the exact nature of the charges , the two journalists could spend more than a decade each in a labor camp .
Death is not on the table , as this punishment has been reserved for four crimes since 2004 : trying to overthrow the government , terrorism ( though I do n’t think it counts if it ’s terrorism against a capitalist devil ) , treason and “ suppressing the people ’s movement for national liberation [ huh ? ] . ”
Yep , nice and broad … and you do n’t even need to go to court to be executed .
A day after Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani expelled Yasir Arafat from a concert for world leaders at Lincoln Center , the Clinton Administration sharply criticized the Mayor yesterday for what Washington officials called an embarrassing breach of international diplomacy .
Mr. Giuliani , clearly relishing the controversy , insisted that he could never forgive and play host to Mr. Arafat even though the Palestinian leader has been embraced as a peacemaker by the Israeli and United States Governments .
A spokesman for the United States Mission to the United Nations said the Administration made it clear to the city that Mr. Arafat , the chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organization , could be invited to local events .
Mr. Clinton invited him to a White House reception on Sunday .
" We regard the incident as unfortunate in light of the constructive role that Chairman Arafat has played in the Mideast peace process , " said the spokesman , James P. Rubin .
A senior Administration official in Washington , who insisted on not beingidentified , went even further , saying the incident on Monday night was " an embarrassment to everyone associated with diplomacy . "
But the Mayor , explaining his decision yesterday , called Mr. Arafat a murderer and terrorist , and said he was not impressed by the fact that Mr. Arafat had twice been invited to the White House to sign the Middle East peace accords , or that he shared the Nobel Peace Prize .
" I would not invite Yasir Arafat to anything , anywhere , anytime , anyplace , " Mr. Giuliani said at a news conference yesterday .
" I do n't forget . "
Mr. Giuliani said his antipathy toward Mr. Arafat -- like his antipathy toward the Cuban leader Fidel Castro -- went back to his days as a Federal prosecutor .
As United States Attorney , he investigated several terrorist incidents to which the P.L.O. was linked , including the hijacking in 1985 of the Achille Lauro cruise ship .
As far as he was concerned , the Mayor said , the statute of limitations on those incidents has not run out .
" He has never been held to answer for the murders that he was implicated in , " the Mayor said .
" The U.N. is one thing , the peace process is another thing .
When we 're having a party and a celebration , I would rather not have someone who has been implicated in the murders of Americans there , if I have the discretion not to have him there . "
The Mayor said Mr. Arafat was never invited to the concert , but was given a ticket to it by a country the Mayor did not identify .
A P.L.O. official disputed that statement , saying Mr. Arafat was given tickets by the official organizing committee .
" The Mayor is not telling the truth , " said Muin Shreim , counselor for the Permanent Observer Mission of Palestine to the United Nations .
" I personally picked up the tickets from the New York City Host Committee .
He is lying .
It was an envelope marked ' Palestine . '
There were three tickets inside . "
Mr. Shreim accused the Mayor of pandering to voters , and Nasser al - Kidwa , the Palestinians ' observer at the United Nations , characterized the incident as very sad .
" It only indicates that the office of the Mayor has been hijacked by some fanatics in this city , " he said .
" It is also sad that while boasting about New York as the capital of the world , as a great city -- and it's true -- he has misbehaved in such sensitive political issues . "
The New York Philharmonic concert at Avery Fisher Hall was sponsored by the New York City Host Committee , a private group organized by Mr. Giuliani to sponsor several events surrounding the anniversary .
Last Friday an aide to the Mayor sent the United Nations a list of countries that should be excluded from events sponsored by the committee .
The list included the Palestinian mission and seven countries not recognized by the United States : Cuba , Iraq , Iran , Yugoslavia , Libya , North Korea and Somalia .
The Mayor said yesterday that when he was told that Mr. Arafat had entered the concert hall , he told his chief of staff , Randy Mastro , to ask him to leave .
" Randy told him that he was n't invited , he was n't welcome , and we would prefer that he leave , " Mr. Giuliani said .
" He stayed for awhile , then he left . "
Witnesses said Mr. Arafat heard the first two movements of Beethoven 's Ninth Symphony .
A witness to the incident , who insisted on anonimity , said Mr. Arafat was spotted in the audience because of his Arab headdress .
When Mr. Mastro spoke to him , the witness said , Mr. Arafat smiled and said nothing .
A few minutes after Giuliani Administration officials spoke to Mr. Arafat 's aides in the foyer , Mr. Arafat and his entourage left , the witness said .
Late yesterday afternoon mayoral aides distributed several copies of congratulatory messages that Mr. Giuliani had received from conservative Jewish organizations , including the orthodox Agudath Israel of America , which wrote , " Bravo ! "
Abraham Foxman , the national director of the centrist Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith , said he had no problem with the Mayor 's action , though he did not send any messages of praise to City Hall .
" One can support the peace process and not embrace Mr. Arafat , and I think the Mayor 's entitled not to want to socialize with him , " said Mr. Foxman , who counts himself a supporter of the peace accords .
" The memory is still there , and there will be anger with him a little bit longer . "
The Israeli Government had no comment , but the leader of a Jewish organization that met with Mr. Arafat on Monday pointedly noted that Israel regularly meets with the P.L.O. leader .
" We think it 's important to demonstrate that the normalization of relations between Israel and the Palestinians can go forward , " said Dr. Lawrence Rubin , executive vice chairman of the National Jewish Community Relations Council .
" But clearly Mayor Giuliani has domestic political considerations . "
Two frequent critics of the Mayor -- his predecessors , David N. Dinkins and Edward I. Koch -- scheduled a news conference for this afternoon to " denounce the discourtesy " displayed by Mr. Giuliani to Mr. Arafat and to Mr. Castro .
Mr. Giuliani said Mr. Arafat was not invited because the United States does not have diplomatic relations with the P.L.O .
But the senior Clinton Administration official said that was simply because the P.L.O. represents no country .
The official added that the United States considers the P.L.O. the legitimate representative of the Palestinian people .
After a few years at a large , soulless corporate conglomerate , " Henry L. " needed a change .
Since his skills were in high demand , he had no trouble lining up interviews at several other large , soulless corporate conglomerates .
He 'd grown tired of working at such large companies , though , and started looking into some smaller businesses .
After scrolling through a few pages of job posts , he found one that sounded perfect .
" Small firm in the financial industry seeks skilled , motivated developer . "
Henry took a deep breath and called the number .
" Hello , Tilde Financial Services , this is Gary . "
The Interview
" Hello , my name is Henry L. , and I 'd like to speak with your human resources department regarding the open develo - "
" Oh , you 've got the right guy !
I 'm the development lead .
Can you come in for an interview today ?
I 'm free around 2:00 . "
Henry was stunned .
" Do you want to review my resume fir - "
" Yeah , we 'll go over it when you get here . "
Gary talked really fast — like he was either really smart , really busy , or should 've been doing Micro Machines commercials .
Henry hung up the phone , still stunned .
At his last job , he did n't hear back regarding his application for a month .
Then he had to go through two levels of HR , three separate interviews in five weeks , on top of spending a night in the haunted house , which apparently all of the other employees had to do too before getting an offer .
And here he was , calling the general line which was answered by the lead developer , who had just scheduled him an interview in ... crap , 45 minutes !
Henry scrambled to get ready , printed out a few copies of his resume , and headed out the door .
When he arrived , he was immediately greeted by Gary who politely , though rapidly , introduced himself .
The interview went well , though Henry got the sense that he was talking too slowly for Gary .
While Henry was driving home from the interview , Gary called him with an offer .
Henry accepted , and would start the following Monday .
The New Guy
When Monday came , Henry arrived to his brief orientation session , in which the other 11 people on staff halfheartedly introduced themselves before returning to their desks .
Henry was led to his workspace and told to wait for Ernie to set up his email account .
After a few hours of arranging his desk , trying to remember his coworkers ' names , and committing the food - marking policy for the company fridge to memory , Ernie showed up at Henry 's desk .
" All right , you 're all set now !
Your login is henry.l@tildefinancial.com and your password is T9s6 - uYS . "
Ernie handed Henry a Post - It with the information , as well as instructions for remote access to his email .
" Great .
Is there a password policy I need to follow ?
Should I change it right away ? "
" No , no , no .
Definitely not .
Do not change your password unless I tell you to . "
" I 'm sorry ; why am I not supposed to change the password ? "
Ernie rolled his eyes as if Henry just had asked what letter comes before " B. " " Because , " Ernie explained , " we all share the same password .
It 's so we have access to all the email , even if you leave . "
Henry got the feeling that the date that he'd leave had just moved significantly closer .
" But then ... after I left , would n't that mean that I had access to everyone else 's email with this remote login information ? "
" Well , uh , yeah , I suppose .
Do n't do that , though . "
Henry did n't stay long enough to see how well their honor system - based IT security policy worked for them .

Posted on December 13 , 2007 , Shawn Sines Colorado Church Shooter was Denied Videogames by Parents
Matthew Murray , who killed five people including himself in two Church shootings in Colorado last weekend , was denied access to videogames and other evil influences .
According the Denver Post , Murray was forbidden to play videogames , watch DvDs or listen to rock music .
On another website , a poster named nghtmrchld 26 , believed by police to be Murray , said he rebelled against an upbringing that forbade him from buying rock music , video games and popular DVDs .
All Spin Zone has collected the posts Murray wrote under the name nghtmrchld 26 .
The comments paint a pitcure of an abused individual wading through a haze of rage and depression culminating in the shootings .
Social isolation seems to have been a big factor in Murray ’s upbringing .
When I was a teenager my mother would do a pat down to check for music , DVDs and video games whenever I came out of an electronics store like Best Buy or Circuit City .
I ’d still obtain things anyways , it was like getting drugs from a drug dealer , EVERYTHING had to be done in secret .
lolI remember getting thrown around the room and hit while getting interrogated about whether or not I had video games and DVDs .
Then there were the constant interrogations by the church pastors …
I remember having to listen to everything in secret , at very low volume levels or with headphones , whether it was video games , TV , DVDs , or music / radio .
It ’s unfortunate that the press would focus in on videogames and other taboo forms of entertainment as the trigger rather than years of sexual , physical , psychological , and emotional abuse in a restrictive environment .
However it ’s the perfect fuel to feed certain peoples agendas .
No matter what this young man has gone through , nothing excuses his actions .

The German chancellor , Angela Merkel , yesterday became the first world leader to decide not to attend the Olympics in Beijing .
As pressure built for concerted western protests to China over the crackdown in Tibet , EU leaders prepared to discuss the crisis for the first time today , amid a rift over whether to boycott the Olympics .
The disclosure that Germany is to stay away from the games ' opening ceremonies in August could encourage President Nicolas Sarkozy of France to join in a gesture of defiance and complicate Gordon Brown 's determination to attend the Olympics .
Donald Tusk , Poland 's prime minister , became the first EU head of government to announce a boycott on Thursday and he was promptly joined by President Václav Klaus of the Czech Republic , who had previously promised to travel to Beijing .
" The presence of politicians at the inauguration of the Olympics seems inappropriate , " Tusk said .
" I do not intend to take part . "
Frank - Walter Steinmeier , Germany 's foreign minister , confirmed that Merkel was staying away .
He added that neither he nor Wolfgang Schäuble , the interior minister responsible for sport , would attend the opening ceremony .
Hans -Gert Pöttering , the politician from Merkel 's Christian Democratic party who chairs the European parliament , encouraged talk of an Olympic boycott this week and invited the Dalai Lama to address the chamber in Strasbourg , while another senior German Christian Democrat , Ruprecht Polenz , said a boycott should remain on the table .
" I cannot imagine German politicians attending the opening or closing ceremonies [ if the Tibetan crackdown continued ] , " he said .
Merkel enraged the Chinese leadership a few months ago by receiving the Dalai Lama in Berlin for private talks .
Brown is to meet the Tibetan spiritual leader when he visits Britain in May , but is determined to be in Beijing .
" We are fully engaged in supporting the Olympics , " said David Miliband , the foreign secretary .
" We want to see it as a success , and I think it 's right that the prime minister represents us . "
While announcing that German leaders were staying away from Beijing , Steinmeier denied they were boycotting or staging a political protest against the Chinese military and police campaign in Tibet and surrounding areas .
While expressing scepticism about a complete boycott , he did not rule one out .
" This is not the right moment to talk about a boycott ...
We should watch how the Chinese government deals with the situation in the next weeks and months . "
If Merkel and others do not attend the opening ceremony , it is likely to reinforce a growing sense in China that the Olympics is being used to vilify the host .
China had hoped to use the games to highlight its economic development and growing openness .
But it is increasingly proving an opportunity for critics to bash China 's one - party political system , human rights abuses , treatment of minorities and tightly controlled media .
The Tibet crisis has been pushed on to the agenda of a meeting of European foreign ministers in Slovenia , with the French , who will be presiding over the EU during the Olympics , calling for a team of European officials to be dispatched to China on a fact - finding mission .
British and US diplomats were among a group of outside officials allowed to travel yesterday to Lhasa , the Tibetan capital , for the first time since the crisis erupted a fortnight ago .
The EU foreign ministers are to discuss the China quandary at lunch in Slovenia today , with calls being made for a common European position .
" We do n't support a boycott and do n't intend to boycott the opening of the games , " a British Foreign Office spokesman said .
" None of the 27 [ EU states ] are calling for a boycott yet . "
The French foreign minister , Bernard Kouchner , has described the boycott proposal as " interesting " , while Sarkozy this week hedged his bets and said his attendance depended on China 's conduct .
As we stumble toward another presidential election , it 's never been more clear that our political process is being warped by a corporate stranglehold on the free flow of information .
Amidst a virtual blackout of coverage of a horrific war , a global ecological crisis and an advancing economic collapse , what passes for the mass media is itself in collapse .
What 's left of our democracy teeters on the brink .
The culprit , in the parlance of the day , has been the " Mainstream Media , " or MSM .
But that 's wrong name for it .
Today 's mass media is Corporate , not Mainstream , and the distinction is critical .
Calling the Corporate Media ( CM ) " mainstream " implies that it speaks for mid-road opinion , and it absolutely does not .
There is , in fact , a discernable , tangible mainstream of opinion in this country .
As brilliant analysts such as Jeff Cohen , Norman Solomon and the Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting ( FAIR ) organization have shown , the " MSM " is very far to the right of it .
The mainstream of American opinion wants this country out of Iraq .
The Corporate Media does not .
It refuses to give serious coverage to the devastating human , spiritual and economic costs of the war , and it marginalizes those demanding it end .
The mainstream of American opinion wants national health care .
The CM does not .
The mainstream of American opinion is deeply distrustful and in many ways hostile to the power of large corporations .
Obviously , the CM is not .
The mainstream of American opinion strongly questions whether our elections are being manipulated and stolen .
The CM treats with contempt those who dare report on the issue .
The Corporate Media takes partisan stands ( often in favor of the Republican Party , but always in defense of corporate interests ) by sabotaging political candidacies , especially those of candidates who challenge corporate power .
This year it blacklisted the populist candidacy of John Edwards , suffocating his ability to compete for the Democratic nomination .
Mainstream American opinion is no fan of George W. Bush and does not take him seriously as a credible leader .
A very substantial percentage has long wanted him and Dick Cheney impeached and removed from office .
The CM does not tolerate such a discussion , and utterly marginalizes Rep. Dennis Kucinich , the veteran Congressman who has dared to seriously raise the possibility .
Mainstream American opinion is committed to protecting what 's left of the natural environment .
The Corporate Media makes an occasional show of sharing that concern , but stops where Corporate interests might be impinged .
On the other hand , it promotes failed technologies , such as nuke power , where centralized , corporate profits are huge .

Never in our history has the control of the nation 's sources of information been more centralized , or more at odds with what the country as a whole believes .
This divergence is not limited to the attack pack fringe of far - right bloviators who dominate the Corporate opinion print columns and talk shows .
Virtually all " personal " opinion expressed on the corporate airwaves and in the syndicated big newspaper columns is significantly to the pro-corporate right of moderate American opinion .
The " news " pushed by the major radio / TV networks and newspapers slants unerringly toward the interests of the five major corporations that own the bulk of them .
They bury stories of vital importance while spewing endless hours and column inches at the mind - deadening likes of Paris Hilton and Brittany Spears .
Their excuse is that they " give the public what it wants " and are " in business to make a profit . "
But the real profit centers of the corporations that own the CM are not in providing news and information .
General Electric , Westinghouse , Disney and the other media - financial - industrial behemoths have too much to lose from an accurate reporting of the true news of the world .
To protect their core interests , they are bread - and - circus PR / diversion machines , not real news organizations .
They resemble the old Soviet official mouthpieces Izvestia and Pravda far more than the news providers envisioned in the First Amendment , by Founders who saw balanced , aggressive reporting as the lifeblood of democracy .
Nor does the corporate right never hesitate to attack .
Since Vice President Spiro Agnew assaulted those who dared report the truth about the Vietnam War , the absurd myth of a " Liberal Media " has been used to intimidate and silence mainstream opinion .
In fact , the term is used to apply to any outlet that harbors even the slightest expression of dissent .
Even conservative newspapers or broadcasts that may be overwhelmingly pro-corporate , but which occasionally tolerate a whiff of dissent , are branded as subversive , ungodly and " out of the mainstream . "
There are indeed liberal publications and radio shows in this country .
But it 's no accident that they struggle financially , and for access to the airwaves .
Thankfully , just as the CM solidifies its power over our mass media outlets , the internet has burst forth as an open , wildly diverse medium for mainstream opinion and actual truth .
Its preservation will require what Thomas Jefferson called " eternal vigilance . "
That includes restoring the Fairness Doctrine , enacted by a Republican Congress in the 1920s to guarantee balanced opinion on the emerging electronic medium of radio .
It means a ban on unified corporate ownership of large fleets of radio , TV and print outlets .
It means busting up the monopolies that warp public access to information and opinion .
The word " mainstream " has nothing to do with the massively monopolized machine that has a chokehold on our democracy .
It 's the " Corporate Media , " and there 's nothing mainstream about it .

our surge can beat up your surge
March 25 , 2008 by lestro
by lestro
With all the talk about the great effectiveness of “ the surge ” in Iraq , one little important bit of evidence is always left out when discussing the reduction in violence : the Mahdi Army ’s decision to lay low since last summer .
However , this week Moktada al - Sadr – a guy who went from a terrorist who needed to be killed into a political leader we deal with – decided to reassert himself :
Moktada al - Sadr , the radical Shiite cleric who commands the Mahdi Army and initially called for a suspension of his militia ’s activities in August , called on Monday called for a nationwide civil disobedience campaign , beginning in Baghdad , in response to what his followers say is an unwarranted crackdown .
and what happened ?
all hell broke loose .
Barrages of mortars and rockets pounded the fortified Green Zone area for the second time in three days .
Sadr City , the Baghdad neighborhood that is the center of the Mahdi Army ’s power , was sealed off by a double - cordon of troops , some Iraqi , and others said to be American .
A photographer who was able to get through the cordon found more layers of checkpoints , each one manned by about two dozen heavily armed Mahdi Army fighters clad in tracksuits and T - shirts .
Tires burned in the city center , gunfire echoed against the shuttered stores and teams of fighters in pick - up trucks moved about brandishing machine guns , sniper rifles and rocket propelled grenades .
Then there ’s this :
Tuesday ’s violence raised fears across Iraq that the cease - fire declared by Mr. Sadr was in danger of collapsing , erasing the security gains of the past six months .
So apparently we ’re not the ones keeping the violence down over there .
Does n’t that mean the surge was n’t nearly as effective as we ’ve been led to believe ?
Hmm , no wonder General Petraeus is now backing off the statements he made before Congress in July about troop reductions :
But it now appears likely that any decision on major reductions in American troops from Iraq will be left to the next president .
That ensures that the question over what comes next will remain in the center of the presidential campaign through Election Day .
General Petraeus , speaking to Mr. Bush by secure videoconference during a two - hour meeting of the National Security Council , recommended putting off decisions on further troop reductions for a month or two after the departure in July of five extra brigades sent last year to help secure the nation , the officials said .
They spoke on the condition of anonymity in order to speak freely about internal deliberations .
So next time you hear the president or John W. McCheney tell you the surge is working , at least you ’ll know they are no more telling the truth than Hillary and her Bosnia bullshit …
By the way , 4,000 and counting .

Bill Maher 's New Rules went hard after John McCain for his repeated misstatements on the Iran / al Qaeda connection on Friday 's episode of Real Time :
New Rule :
Old soldiers never die , they get young soldiers killed .
This week John McCain said for the third time in two days , that Iran , a Shi’ite stronghold was training al Qaeda a militant Sunni organization .
That the Hatfields of the Muslim world would be working with the McCoys is so not true even Dick Cheney has n’t said it .
Now the press , which loves McCain because he feeds them BBQ , dismissed this as just one of those senior moments .
Not to worry , he ’s only going to have his finger on the nuclear trigger .
But it ’s not just a ‘ gaffe , ’ it ’s what McCain really thinks .
And therein lies the paradox of this campaign : McCain ’s strength is really his weakness .
He ’s a warrior who ’s dumb about war .
Whoever read The Art of War , chapter three of The Art of War says , “ Know thy enemy . ”
And John McCain plainly does n’t .
He thinks the solution is our presence in the Middle East .
No , the problem is our presence in the Middle East .
That ’s why I do n’t care if John McCain is better than Bush on global warming or torture or campaign finance , because he ’s exactly the same as Bush on the war .
They both do n’t get the same thing .
As long as we ’re setting up shop in the heart of the Arab world , we ’re not keeping America safer .
Bin Laden goes ballistic over cartoons in Danish newspapers , and Goober and Grandpa want to put up a Hooters in Fallujah .
They do n’t “ hate us for our freedom , ” they hate us for our fiefdom .
Winning the War on Terror comes down to this : what will make us safer from pissed off Arab teenagers who are willing to die ?
There are a number of good answers to that question , but occupying their land for the next 100 years is not one of them .
Some people look at McCain and see a tough guy who is going to protect us from the “ Islamofascists . ”
I look at him and see a walking Tom Clancy action figure who is going to get us all killed .
And yet a new poll shows that a majority of Americans believe John McCain is the candidate best qualified to answer when that red phone rings at 3:00 a.m. , because he’d be up anyway , trying to pee .
Yes , 55 % of Americans think it ’s McCain who should answer that phone , because they know John McCain is a warrior .
He will not waver or hesitate .
He will answer that phone and give the order that sends men to die and it will turn out to be a recording asking him if he ’s happy with his mortgage .

Update March 1 , 2011 - The 32 - bit variant of MurmurHash3 is finalized , and this page is deprecated .
Update January 25 , 2011 - I 'm now employed by Google , and will be working on better cross-platform support for SMHasher and Murmur in the near future .
Update November 4 , 2010 - MurmurHash3 has been released in beta form here - http://code.google.com/p/smhasher/
- ( I reserve the right to tweak the constants after people have had a chance to bang on it ) .
Murmur3 has better performance than MurmurHash2 , no repetition flaw , comes in 32/64/128 - bit versions for both x86 and x64 platforms , and the 128 - bit x64 version is blazing fast - over 5 gigabytes per second on my 3 gigahertz Core 2 .
In addition , the library of test code that I use to test MurmurHash ( called SMHasher ) has been released - it 's still rough ( and will only compile under VC ++ at the moment ) , but it contains everything needed to verify hash functions of arbitrary output bit -lengths .
Murmur3 and all future versions will be hosted on Google Code here - http://code.google.com/p/smhasher/
- you can access the codebase via the ' Source ' tab at the top .
Update October 28 , 2010 - A couple of people have reported a flaw in MurmurHash2 , and I 've confirmed it - repetitions of 4 - byte patterns have a much higher chance of collision than expected .
This is not fixable , but should not cause problems in most cases ( it applies only to keys that are identical except for the repeating sections and with those sections 4 - byte - aligned ) .
While investigating the flaw I 've found a new mix function that improves the performance yet again , so I 'll be publishing that as MurmurHash3 .
Update November 16 , 2009 - One of MurmurHash2A 's users found a small bug in the sample C++ implementation that caused the C++ and C versions to produce different hashes for blocks whose size was not a multiple of four .
Bug fixed , code updated .
Extremely simple - compiles down to ~ 52 instructions on x86 .
Excellent distribution - Passes chi-squared tests for practically all keysets & bucket sizes .
Excellent avalanche behavior - Maximum bias is under 0.5 % .
Excellent collision resistance - Passes Bob Jenkin 's frog .c torture - test .
No collisions possible for 4 - byte keys , no small ( 1- to 7 - bit ) differentials .

All detailed testing results have been moved to the Statistics page .
The name , if you 're wondering , comes from the simplest sequence of operations which will thoroughly mix the bits of a value - " x *= m ; x = rotate_left ( x , r ) ; " - multiply and rotate .
Repeat that about 15 times using ' good ' values of m and r , and x will end up pseudo - randomized .
Unfortunately multiply + rotate has a few major weaknesses when used in a hash function , so I used multiply + shift+xor .
I liked the name Murmur better than Musxmusx , so I kept it .
I 've added a random brain - dump discussion page , where I 'll put more info about how I found the hash constants , test methodology , etc .
Bush :
My answer on when I learned about CIA tape destruction ' sounds pretty clear to me '
RAW STORY

At his year - end press conference , President Bush spoke on the economy , but the very first question after his opening remarks was about the ongoing CIA tape destruction controversy .
Bush complained that Congress had stuffed a year - end spending bill with hundreds of projects that he called wasteful and instructed his budget director to explore options for dealing with them .
He said he will ask his budget director to review options for eliminating spending he considers wasteful in the half - trillion dollar spending bill that Congress just passed .
The president did praise Congress for sending him " a spending bill to fund the day to day operations of the federal government .
They passed this bill without raising taxes . "
But he complained that the measure was done so late in the year that it could slow the processing of tax returns to millions of Americans .
He said his administration would " work hard to minimize " such a delay .
The president got a little testy when a reporter asked him for more details on when he first learned about his administration 's destruction of CIA interrogation tapes .
" It sounds pretty clear to me when I say the first recollection is when Mike Hayden briefed me , " Bush said .
" It sounds pretty clear to me . "
Bush said he will reserve judgment about the CIA tape affair until several inquiries are finished .
Later , in a question about the 2008 presidential race , Bush was asked about what qualities he thought a potential president should possess .
After a moment of reflection , he said that strong guiding principles and the willingness to call on frank assessments from advisers were key .
" What are the principles that you will stand on in good times and bad times ?
What will be the underpinning of your decisions ?
What will it be ? " the president said he would ask current Oval Office seekers .
" Because a president needs to be consistent , and a president needs to understand that what may look like a non-issue today could be a big issue tomorrow . "
Taking a somber tone , Bush also said it was paramount that a president rely on honest advice .
" How do you intend to get advice from people you surround yourself with ... and what process will you have in place to ensure that you get the unvarnished opinion of advisers ? " he asked .
" Because whoever sits in that Oval Office is going to find this is a complex world ... "
Following the press conference , House Democratic Caucus chair Rep. Rahm Emanuel ( D - IL ) issued the following statement :  In 2007 , Congress brought change to Washington , but President Bushs veto pen prevented the kind of significant change our country needs .
Rather than usher in support for new sources of energy , the Presidents veto pen prolonged our addiction to oil .
Rather than give 10 million children the health care they deserve , the Presidents veto pen left millions of kids uninsured .
And rather than hold Iraqis accountable for Iraq , Bushs veto pen ensured the American military and taxpayers continue to bear the cost of the war .
2008 can be a year of big change if President Bush joins us in preparing for the future , rather than defending the failed policies of the past . ( with wire reports )
This morning on CNN's Late Edition , The Beard uses a hit piece by the Washington Post 's Dan Balz to show how some people see John Edwards as an angry , partisan and divisive candidate who has angered many Democrats .

To be honest , I 'm happy with all the Democratic candidates we 've had to chose from and I 'm ecstatic about the huge number of Democrats who have shown up so far to vote this primary season -- but Edwards has gotten the shaft from the media and is not well liked by the wealthy elite who own them , so it 's not surprising to see him being attacked for his populist message .
There has been a growing chorus of pundits referring to Edwards as a possible " Kingmaker , " giving his delegates to Obama at the end of the primary season , but it does n't appear that 's even a consideration for him .
Edwards handles the angry accusations exactly the way you 'd expect him to :

Tired of all the knee - jerk banter from fanboys about whose operating system is the most secure ?
So are the organizers of the CanSecWest security conference , which will be held in Vancouver later this month .
And with a contest awarding as much as $ 20,000 worth of prizes , they 're likely to breathe fresh life into a stale debate .
This year 's Pwn2 Own competition will place three brand - new , fully patched laptops side by side : a Fujitsu U810 running Vista Ultimate , a Vaio VGN - TZ37Cn running Ubuntu 7.10 and a MacBook Air running Leopard .
The first person to remotely run code on each one gets to take the machine home , and is can be entered into the running for an award potentially worth $ 20,000 from TippingPoint , whose Zero Day Initiative pays bounties to researchers for responsibly disclosing vulnerabilities .
At last year 's Pwn2 Own contest , conference organizers challenged attendees to hack into one of two fully patched MacBookPros to claim the machine and a $ 10,000 bounty from TippingPoint .
Security guru Dino Dai Zovi , spent less than 12 hours doing just that , crafting a QuickTime exploit that allowed him to take complete control of the machine .
CanSecWest's Pwn2Own contests are useful because they allow us to isolate the technical strengths and weaknesses of a given platform from its popularity .
Acrimonious debate has fomented for years about whether the high number of real - world Windows exploits - compared to those of OS X , Linux and other operating systems - is a natural consequence of having a 90 - percent chunk of the market or the result of sloppy and insecure coding practices at Microsoft .
There 's at least some merit to the argument that organized cyber crime gangs - just like makers of popular games Half - Life 2 and Crysis - do n't write for the Mac and Linux because the smaller market shares make it impossible to get a return on the investment .
The Pwn2Own contest , by offering a considerable incentive for exploits of these platforms , helps to neutralize the economic variable .
" These computers are REAL and FULLY patched , " conference organizer Dragos Ruiu wrote in an email announcing the rules .
" All third party software is widely used .
There are no imitation vulnerabilities .
Any exploit successfully used in this contest would also compromise a significant percentage of the internet connected hosts . "
The rules for this year 's contest include :
Limit one laptop per contestant
The same vulnerability can't be used against more than one box
Attacks will be performed using a cross-over cable ( with the attacker controlling the default route ) or using radio - frequency by special arrangement .
Winning exploits must target a previously unknown vulnerability ; vulns that have already been reported to the affected software maker or a third party are not eligible .
Each of the machines will include widely deployed applications , including web browsers ( Internet Explorer , Safari , Konqueror and Firefox ) , instant messengers ( AIM , MSN , Yahoo , Adium , Skype and Pigdin ) and email clients ( Outlook , Mail.app , Thunderbird , kmail , mutt ) .
El Reg will be attending CanSecWest , which runs from March 26 - 29 .

Expelled !
By PZ Myers
Posted March 21 , 2008
There is a rich , deep kind of irony that must be shared .
I 'm blogging this from the Apple store in the Mall of America , because I 'm too amused to want to wait until I get back to my hotel room .
I went to attend a screening of the creationist propaganda movie , Expelled , a few minutes ago .
Well , I tried ... but I was Expelled !
It was kind of weird -- I was standing in line , had n't even gotten to the point where I had to sign in and show ID , and a policeman pulled me out of line and told me I could not go in .
I asked why , of course , and he said that a producer of the film had specifically instructed him that I was not to be allowed to attend .
The officer also told me that if I tried to go in , I would be arrested .
I assured him that I was n't going to cause any trouble .
I went back to my family and talked with them for a while , and then the officer came back with a theater manager , and I was told that not only was n't I allowed in , but I had to leave the premises immediately .
Like right that instant .
I complied .
I 'm still laughing though .
You do n't know how hilarious this is .
Not only is it the extreme hypocrisy of being expelled from their Expelled movie , but there 's another layer of amusement .
Deep , belly laugh funny .
Yeah , I 'd be rolling around on the floor right now , if I were n't so dang dignified .
You see ... well , have you ever heard of a sabot ?
It 's a kind of sleeve or lightweight carrier used to surround a piece of munition fired from a gun .
It is n't the actually load intended to strike the target , but may even be discarded as it leaves the barrel .
I 'm a kind of sabot right now .
They singled me out and evicted me , but they did n't notice my guest .
They let him go in escorted by my wife and daughter .
I guess they did n't recognize him .
My guest was ...
Richard Dawkins .
He 's in the theater right now , watching their movie .
Tell me , are you laughing as hard as I am ?

This happened at the opening of the 129th National Guard Association general conference .
There are about 1,800 Guardsmen from Puerto Rico currently in Iraq .
" The daily death toll of Americans and their allies has caused irreparable anguish here in Puerto Rico , and throughout the country .
The same could be said for the people of Iraq , " Acevedo said .
Here 's the thing , though -- this story was moved by the Associated Press and it has gotten almost zero coverage .
Try to find it in your local paper .
It 's even difficult finding it with a Google search .
On the other hand , if 4,000 Guardsmen stood and cheered for a call to stay the course you can bet it would be 24/7 on cable TV news .
Update :
Army Chief of Staff Gen. George Casey spoke to the Guardsmen group on Sunday and splashed cold wateron everyone :
Studio audience commentary
But clearly audible : " These are race - based questions , " shouts a male voice in the audience at the Cashman Center in Las Vegas .
He spoke after Tim Russert opened with several attempts to re-engage Clinton and Obama on the racially - charged feuding that consumed much of the last week .
He drew some remorse from each , but a steadfast refusal to rejoin the combat .
But on the heckler 's central point : Agree ?
Disagree ?
UPDATE : I 'd initially heard " race - baiting . "
Here 's the video from Breitbart TV , source of the quote above .
Oil market analysts think Opec is likely to cut production in March
The main contract for light sweet crude closed at $ 100.74 a barrel , up 73 cents .
At one stage during the session it rose as high as $ 101.32 per barrel .
Traders again blamed worries that the Opec oil producing nations might announce production cuts at their meeting on 5 March .
Opec , which supplies 40 % of the world 's oil , is concerned that the slowing US economy is reducing the demand for oil .
Hedge funds
" Supply worries and comments by some Opec members that the group might not raise output at their March meeting provided the catalyst for the sharp rally , " said Kevin Norrish , an analyst at Barclays Capital .
Traders said that hedge funds were buying up oil .
Their interest has been prompted by rising inflation .
" Traders are going into the oil market because it's what is causing the inflation and those assets are most likely to appreciate , " said Rob Kurzatkowski , futures analyst with optionsXpress .
There is concern that higher oil prices will boost inflation .
To counter that investors have been putting their money into gold , which hit a record on Wednesday .
The main gold contract at the New York Mercantile Exchange closed $ 8 higher at $ 937.80 an ounce .
One fairly common coding style I have seen from more experienced developers is what I will call highly - aggressive null checking .
Such developers have most likely been burned by null pointer exceptions in the past and hence have evolved a style of coding which confirms that parameters or fields are non-null before using them .
The code below shows a typical example of this coding style .
public void placeOrder ( Customer customer , Order order ) { if ( customer != null && order != null ) { // ... } }
I am not a big fan of this style of coding , although I do appreciate that it results in more robust code than code that ignores null checking completely .
My coding style instead uses precondition checks to assert that parameters or fields are not null before using them .
Rewriting the above example in my style results in the following code .
public void placeOrder ( Customer customer , Order order ) { assert customer != null ; assert order != null ; // ... }
These two styles different in their approach to error handling : mine uses the fail fast principle , while the first uses the degrade gracefully principle .
See my article on Fail Fast or Degrade Gracefully for details on the differences between the two .
Long - time readers may find my preferred style surprising given my stated preference for the degrade gracefully approach .
Let me clarify my position .
I still do prefer the degrade gracefully approach , especially for the higher level application architecture & design .
My use of fail fast at the detailed coding level is based primarily on my philosophical view of coding , which is to use the technical computer language ( Java in the above example ) to construct a language representing the business problem domain .
The placeOrder method becomes part of the syntax of this business language that semantically only makes sense to apply to an actual customer & order .
Having the method handle null arguments does not make sense when expressed in terms of the business language .
From a more pragmatic viewpoint , having either the customer or order be null almost certainly reflects an error in the calling code .
Blindly ignoring null values throughout the code base significantly increases the risk of errors going undetected .
One special case of aggressive null checking that really bothers me is checking for null collections .
Below is an example :
public class Customer private List orders ; public List getOrders ( ) { return orders ; } } public class CustomerProcessor { public void checkOrders ( Customer customer ) { if ( customer.getOrders ( ) != null ) { for ( Order order : customer.getOrders ( ) ) { // ... } } } }
In terms of the business domain , a customer can have zero or more orders .
So the collection can be empty .
But the relationship exists for every customer – a null collection has no business meaning .
Checking if a collection is null therefore adds meaningless noise to a method .
My approach instead is to have a class invariant that the collection is always defined , which then avoids the need for null checking .
This is easily accomplished by initializing the collection at the time of definition .
Rewriting the above code in my style results in the following :
public class Customer private List orders = new ArrayList ( ) ; public List getOrders ( ) { return orders ; } } public class CustomerProcessor { public void checkOrders ( Customer customer ) { for ( Order order : customer.getOrders ( ) ) { // ... } } }
I believe that this style of coding is more readable and understandable , in large part because it more closely matches the problem domain being modeled without the baggage of extra null checks .
This approach does require more thought regarding whether fields and parameters can or should be null , which is perhaps one reason why aggressive null checking is often used instead .
My approach can be compared to defining the nullity of columns in a database schema .
One advantage with database design is column nullity is an explicit part of the database schema language , whereas programming languages such as Java provide no explicit support for the concept .
I have long though that an explicit syntax for nullable versus non-nullable variables would be an interesting experiment .
I have seen experimental languages with such a feature but I have not heard of any remotely mainstream language that does so .
One possible syntax is to suffix nullable variables with a question mark .
The compiler could then verify at compile time that such variables are checked if they are null before being used .
Additionally at run time an exception could be thrown if a non-nullable variable is assigned a null value .
Below is an example of what such a revision to Java would look like :
public void placeOrder ( Customer customer , Order order , Discount ? discount ) { // Customer and Order are not nullable , Discount is nullable // Invoking a method on discount here would be flagged as an error by the compiler : double percentageDiscount = 1.00 ; if ( discount != null ) { //
No error because we have checked if discount is null percentageDiscount = discount.calculatePercentage ( ) ; } //
Can invoke methods on order and customer without checking if they are null .
order.prepareToBePlaced(percentageDiscount ) ; customer.addOrder( order ) ; }
I am not a language designer so I do not know all the ramifications of such a language change .
Therefore I am not saying that this should be added to Java , merely that it is a possibility .
If you do want compiler support for dealing with nulls , then one alternative is to use the Eclipse IDE and enable its Java compiler for performing a static compile time analysis to warn of the use of variables that may be null ( see image below ) .

It 's infuriating that the Bush administration has gone so far around the Constitution without any accountability from those who are charged with oversight , yet the few journalists and whistleblowers that have tried to shine a light on the actions of the Bush administration are fighting to not go to jail .
Case in point : James Risen , the reporter who broke the warrantless wiretapping story and who is now fighting to not go to jail after being subpoenaed to reveal his sources .
Rick Karr looks at how the Bush administration has consistently sought to squelch journalists and whistleblowers like Risen , Sibel Edmonds , and even Talking Points Memo .
The entire episode ( including an interview with Rep. Henry Waxman on government oversight ) can be viewed online .
Transcripts below the fold .
BILL MOYERS : If the Chairman of powerful oversight committees can't get straight answers from the Bush Administration , you can imagine how hard things are for whistleblowers exposing the truth about government conduct , and muckraking journalists digging behind the news .
James Risen , for one .
He exposed power grabs ... and intelligence blunders inside the Administration ... and is fighting now to stay out of jail .
Here 's my colleague Rick Karr to bring us up to date .
RICK KARR : You may not know James Risen 's name , but you probably know his work :
He 's one of the NEW YORK TIMES reporters who broke the story of the Bush administration listening in to phone calls and reading email , without search warrants .
That story infuriated some conservatives .
A popular blog accused Risen and his co-author of treason for revealing sensitive information , and pundit William Bennett said the reporters deserved jail time .
Bennett may get his wish .
A federal prosecutor has asked a grand jury to look into a book that Risen wrote .
It details not only warrantless wiretapping but also how , when it came to covert operations in the Middle East , the Administration made " mistake piled on mistake " caused an " espionage disaster " and was " operating in the blind " when it came to Iran .
Risen was subpoenaed to tell a grand jury who he talked to about Iran — in other words , to reveal his anonymous sources .
So far , the reporter has refused to talk .
And recently , his lawyer moved to quash the subpoena .
Some veteran investigative journalists wrote letters in support of that motion .
One of them told me that if Risen is forced to testify , the public will be the real loser .
Here 's why : Anonymous sources have a lot to lose if their identities are revealed because a lot of them are powerful or prominent .
So , if the Federal government can force a reporter like Risen to reveal their identities , those sources will clam up .
There 'd be more corruption and wrongdoing in Washington that the public would never learn about .
Administration officials seem not to mind keeping the public in the dark .
But for muckrakers and whistleblowers , it 's getting harder and harder to expose corruption and wrongdoing .
Take the case of former FBI agent Sibel Edmonds :
She blew the whistle on massive incompetence at the Bureau — sloppy translations , missed messages from terror suspects .
She even alleged that insiders were leaking secrets to foreign agents .
She lost her job for it .
Just after Congress got interested in her story — and a bipartisan group of Senators said they found her claims credible enough to warrant an investigation — the administration retroactively classified everything that she knew , pretty much shutting down any chance of an investigation .
U.S. journalists have found it nearly impossible to look into her claims .
Over the past year , there 's been only one article on her in a major newspaper , and it simply announced that she'd won a freedom - of - speech award .
Meanwhile , the TIMES OF LONDON has published three stories — just this year — digging into her claim that Administration officials sold secrets to foreign governments .
Sometimes the Administration 's efforts to squelch critics seem downright petty : Reporters for the Web site TALKING POINTS MEMO , for example , led the way in showing how the Administration encouraged federal prosecutors to go after Democrats , but go easy on Republicans .
So the Department of Justice kicked the web site off of its press list .
A small thing , sure , but it rankled one member of the House enough that he asked Attorney General Michael Mukasey about it at a hearing .
Mukasey 's response ?
" I do n't know . "
Recently , the Department of Justice reinstated TALKING POINTS MEMO to its press list — right around the same time that the web site won an award for its reporting on the Department of Justice .
So , Administration officials stonewall lawmakers and try to silence critics — or just make their jobs harder .
That 's not news .
But this time , a reporter could go to jail .
The irony in James Risen 's predicament is that he was one of the reporters who revealed that the Administration could never have secretly listened in on phone calls , or read emails , without help from big telecom firms — the conglomerates that supply most Americans with phone or Internet service .
After the article appeared , civil - liberties advocates filed lawsuits against the conglomerates trying to hold them accountable for helping the Administration break the law .
Just recently , the Senate voted to grant those telecom companies immunity from the lawsuits — to let them off the hook — while the reporter who'd exposed them fought to stay out of jail .

[ digg- reddit - me ] Updated :
After reading the speech and seeing how it is being received , I am updating the tense of the piece to reflect this afternoon ’s events .
For the full text or video of the “ A More Perfect Union ” speech , go here .
There have been many crucial tests and defining moments of this primary , one of the most invigorating in memory and certainly , the most exciting in my lifetime .
There was Hillary ’s stumble in Philadelphia ; there was Mr. Obama ’s Jefferson - Jackson speech in Iowa ; there was Iowa itself , gloriously arcane ; there was an energy pulsing through the nation in the days after – and then the tears of proud woman and the resurrection of an old man in New Hampshire ; there were dirty tricks and subtle slanders and oversensitive bristling ; then after a few more rounds of bruising battle , it became a grudge match ; Mr. McCain clinched his nomination and took shots at the two Democratic titans as they pummeled one another – one candidate unable to clinch the win ; the other unable to allow herself to lose .
There have been many important days in this campaign already – subtle turning points and dramatic victories .
But today , March 18 , 2008 will prove the most crucial .
In Iowa we learned about a man and a movement ; and after New Hampshire , we learned that this movement and this man were strong enough to withstand negative attacks and setbacks .
Today though is not about the “ movement ” .
It is about Mr. Barack Obama and what he can do .
I subscribe to a variation on what is called the “ great individual ( or man ) theory of history . ”
It seems clear to me that some men and women at crucial times have been able to alter the course of history .
These historical figures were able to do so because their unique combination of gifts and talents matched the opportunity their time gave them .
Abraham Lincoln during the Civil War ; Martin Luther King , Jr. during the 1960s ; Mohandas Gandhi before the birth of India ; Winston Churchill during World War II ; and in a negative sense , Adolf Hitler in the 1930s .
These all happened to be men who captured the zeitgeist of their times , who were able to channel events beyond their control to achieve the ends they sought .
They achieved great successes because the forces of history – demographics , geography , cultural trends , technology , politics , and most of all chance – conspired to give these individuals an opportunity for which they were uniquely suited .
I – along with most Americans – believe that we , as a nation , are on the wrong path .
I can name many specific issues – but the sum total of these specifics is more than the sum of these parts .
There is something ineffably rotten in the state , in the nation that is more serious than all the specific maladies .
No candidate , no leader will be able to fix all of this – or even much of it .
But what is needed – more than anything – is an historical change of course .
I believe that Mr. Barack Obama is the only candidate or leader of any sort in America who is capable of initiating this change of course today .
I believe that now is the time of opportunity to change course – the first since 1992 ; and that the opportunity is ripe today for historical change ( in part because of Mr. Bush ’s astounding incompetence which has – as one Republican congressman put it in the Washington Post , “ destroyed the Republican brand ” – and in part because of underlying trends ; and in a large measure because of Mr. Obama himself – because he has been able to call on many latent forces in American cultural , social , and economic life .
However , throughout the past several weeks , Mr. Obama has been deluged with attacks on his pastor , on his race , on his supposed secret religion .
These attacks , designed to attack the core of his appeal , have begun to have an effect .
Today Mr. Obama has responded , and while we are still waiting to see the full effect of this speech on the political environment , he seems to have done everything he set out to .
But for him to prove himself as a transformational leader , his response must defuse the attacks and call Americans to a higher purpose .
If he cannot , then he still is likely to beat Ms. Clinton for the nomination ; and though weakened , he seems to match up well against Mr. McCain and has a solid chance of prevailing in November .
And if elected , I believe he will still be an exceptional president .
Based on what I have seen so far , Mr. Obama has passed this high threshold .
Today we will see if Mr. Obama can re-shape the media environment and the politics to his needs – if he can create a moment that will break the poisonous spell of repeated loops of Reverend Wright saying , “ God damn America ! ” ; of a black man dressed in traditional Somali garb ; of the constant iterations of black !
man ! ; if he can become one of the “ great men of history ” able to shape events as well as respond to them .
Mr. Obama has shown he can hit back – and in a vicious news cycle , he wins as often as not against the Clinton press machine – with twenty years of media experience and press relationships .
In this traditional politics – Mr. Obama can win .
But he cannot win as big as he needs to – and he cannot be the figure we need as a nation at this moment to correct our course .
Today is not the day on which Mr. Obama ’s candidacy rests ; he is well - positioned regardless .
But today we have seen Mr. Obama rise above the fray , the petty attacks and the identity politics – and take the first steps to becoming the transformational leader many of us hope he will be .
N.B. Although in this piece , I have spoken in generalities and of history , I have often been more specific :

Those complaints originate using their cookie cutter form that allows you to easily spam the FCC .

Yarmouth Port , MA funchords MVM Complaint Disposition Reason issue is Congressional Bulloney
The following offends my sensibilities :
... quoting the article ... a new study today showing the FCC also does a poor job tracking citizen complaints .
Can we compare the FCC with the FTC for a moment ?
How many innocent people have been scammed for thousands by Internet fraud , while the FTC lets Western Union pocket the profits from these acts ?
Other than erecting a " be careful " web page , they 've done nothing .
83 percent resulted in no enforcement Why ?
Because that 's the way it works .
The FCC and FTC can't do everything .
It has to pick and choose its battles .
The number of complaints about any one particular thing is certainly a factor , as is the impact of the issue within the complaint .
They can't close a complaint as " unfounded " because the complaint probably was n't unfounded .
The metric important to me is whether they picked from among the issues pool those things with concern the most people and those things that concern people the most .
Everything else falls into some varying degree of " optional , " IMHO .
I 'm sorry .
I do n't like the Republicans , nor do I like what Powell and Martin did to broadband competition .
I am , of course , happy to see that what Comcast did was offensive enough even to Margin that it appears that action is coming .

I think that like all politicians , they pick the issues that have the most vocal complainers , not necessarily the issues that concern the most people .
Thus it 's no big surprise that they go after things like Janet Jackson 's nipple and P2P .

To think there is nothing better for congress to do than have yet another hearing into " corruption " .
What they really need to do is hold a hearing on an organization that has no corruption .
That would be news indeed .
Last week ’s post summarized the outcome of the just - completed Evolang conference in Barcelona by reporting the collapse of the long dominant paradigm of generative grammar founded by Noam Chomsky and expanded by many others .
The old paradigm made no contributions to the new results reported in Barcelona ; reports often contradicted the generative paradigm ; some speakers directly and energetically criticized the old paradigm and got away scott free in the discussions that followed .
So what did the Barcelona conference leave its participants to build on ?
In Thomas Kuhn ’s classic account of paradigm shifts a group of working scientists have a common set of assumptions , practices , and achievements ( the paradigm ) that inspires many questions and arguments .
This paradigm runs into trouble when some problem that it cannot handle refuses to be swept under the table , and finally it is replaced by a new paradigm .
A famous example is the replacement of Aristotelian physics by that of Galileo and Newton .
Does that story fit what happened in Barcelona ?
To some degree , yes .
A question has arisen that the generative paradigm cannot answer : how did humans evolve a brain that supports language ?
Long forbidden , the question of language origins finally became legitimate when two workers in the generative tradition , Steven Pinker and Paul Bloom , published a paper ( here ) that specifically called for an evolutionary account of the rise of generative grammar .
Pinker then wrote a popular book , The Language Instinct , that assumed generative grammar had evolved .
That book ’s success probably marked the peak of the generative paradigm ’s influence .
Pinker and Bloom ’s paper directly inspired a series of bi-annual conferences about the evolution of language , the 7th of which has just ended in Barcelona .
Although the Barcelona conference established that the old paradigm does not work , the second part of Kuhn ’s story — the rise of a replacement paradigm — did not happen .
There was no stunning paper that resolved all the problems and established a new basis of further research .
But there were clues from different presentations and many of them pointed to bits and pieces of a theory proposed by Terrence Deacon in his book , The Symbolic Species .
Deacon ’s work was not picked up in its entirety , but parts of it have moved center stage .
Piece number one says Language and the brain co-evolved .
The generative paradigm assumed that some part of the brain evolved specifically to generate sentences .
This idea held great prominence in Pinker ’s book .
He argued that specific “ modules ” had evolved to process sentences .
The evidence for this assumption was that children learn to speak with astonishing rapidity .
Therefore , the brain must have special equipment to perform this task .
Deacon ’s response was that evolution can work the other way around .
Language can adapt to the abilities of the speakers by changing so that it is easier to learn .
They two sides argued more from theory and logic than from data , but not anymore .
Deacon ’s approach can now claim a variety of empirical evidence .
The most direct evidence came from Simon Kirby ’s presentation .
( See : Language Structure is Cultural , Not Genetic )
He described an experiment in which a person is taught a simple “ language ” whose sound system has been randomly generated by a computer , whose meanings are based on simple associations , and that has no syntax .
As you might expect , the person learning such a language has trouble , but eventually is able to say things in it .
A second person learns the language by observing how the first user speaks .
A third person learns from observing the second .
A fourth observes the third , and so on through ten “ generations ” of learners .
By the end , learning the language had become a much easier task , the sound system had developed regularities , and syntax had appeared .
The speakers had found and regularized ways to express relationships .
This experiment shows exactly what Deacon expected and generative grammarians did not .
There will have to be more experiments to determine whether the outcome emerges from syntactical modules or something else , but the generativists have been thrown on the defensive .
A second piece of evidence came from David Gil ’s presentation ( See : Complex Grammar has a Simple Solution ) in which he described one of Indonesia ’s languages , Riau .
It turns out to be much more simple than many of the languages generative grammarians have enjoyed studying .
Riau speakers are perfectly capable of learning a more complex language and many of them do , so there is no simple correlation between language complexity and brain structure , or language complexity and cultural complexity .
Again , this kind of finding is exactly what a reading of Deacon would predict , and a generativist would not .
Generativists have a fallback position , one mentioned in passing in Derek Bickerton ’s presentation .
The fact that we do n’t use a feature of language does not mean that the capacity for using that feature is absent from the brain .
So more work will follow , but , as before , it is the generativists who are on the defensive .
Third , was Friedmann Pulvermüller ’s several presentations ( See : Brain Circuitry Challenges Linguistic Models ) arguing that the brain does not have the expected modules .
Instead , the brain works in a straightforward way , connecting many parts to produce and listen to sentences .
Instead of modules , the whole brain works together .
In a luncheon conversation between Pulvermüller and a linguist I heard him specifically reject the idea that the brain uses the syntactic “ trees ” that generativists are so fond of .
Defenders will argue , as one did at Pulvermüller ’s presentation , that language does n’t work as he suggests , but it is again the generativists who are on the defensive , looking for a counter - explanation .
Eavesdropping as I was , I jumped into that luncheon conversation to ask what they thought of the partial trees proposed in the presentation by Gary Marcus ( see : The Practicality of Studying Language Origins ) .
Pulvermüller and his friend agreed that Marcus did an excellent job in disproving the generativist assumption that the brain is splendidly efficient at producing and parsing sentences .
They did not think , however , that he had made clear his alternative .
So again , we come to a point where Deacon ’s ideas look promising , but more work will be needed to resolve the matter .
This success of Deacon caught me quite by surprise , and was not predicted before the conference .
Deacon himself was not there to urge on his case .
By chance Marcus and I were on the same plane to Barcelona , so we took a cab together .
Deacon ’s name came up and Marcus said he thought parts of Deacon ’s book were excellent , but much of it was quite obscure .
I said when I started my blog I had expected to be citing Deacon often , but had found that I seldom had a reason to cite him .
We rode on in agreement that Deacon had not shown the way .
Yet there were Deacon ’s ideas a few days later , providing a beacon while generative theory had run out of things to say about the evolutionary question .
Another bit of Deacon ’s ideas also gained new prominence by the end of the conference , but this post is already long enough so I will save that news for next week .
A tiny bank in Kansas City , Mo. , has become the first bank in the country to fail this year — but it 's unlikely to be the last .
Federal regulators on Friday shuttered Douglass National Bank , an African - American - owned bank with $ 59 million in assets that was named in honor of the 19th - century abolitionist Frederick Douglass .
The bank , which has roots stretching back to the 1940s , had struggled of late , losing $ 1.3 million in 2007 and $ 4.3 million in 2006 .
Although its recent losses were tied to bad commercial real estate loans , not residential mortgages , the bank 's problems are nonetheless linked to the global mortgage crisis that has ripped through the financial services industry , says William Michael Cunningham of Creative Investment Research .
" It 's this secondary and tertiary impact of the crisis in the subprime market that 's beginning to impact smaller institutions mainly through [ the slowdown in ] consumer spending , " Cunningham says .
Douglass is the first bank to fail in 2008 and the fourth since February of last year .
Before that , federal regulators had n't shuttered a bank since June 2004 .
But Cunningham expects other small banks — especially those with weak profits and deteriorating capital bases — to follow suit in the coming months , as the slowing economy limits borrowers ' ability to repay loans .
Larger banks , such as , say , Bank of America or Citigroup , are far less likely to experience a similar rise in failures .
Such banks have more capital to protect against losses and greater access to additional funds should they need them .

Top 10 Bad Things That Are Good For You
( Image credit : Dreamstime )
Beer quells heart disease and chocolate staves off cancer ?
Though often tagged with a disclaimer , studies that tell us to eat , inhale and generally indulge in " bad stuff " is music to our ears .
So go ahead and enjoy these bad - for - you remedies - everything in moderation , as they say - until the next study inevitably overturns the research .
Sex
( Image credit : Dreamstime )
Scientists have found that the benefits of sex go beyond immediate , ahem , gratification and satisfying the goal of procreation .
Besides the obvious evolutionary purposes , we can all take pleasure in the news that having sex is an easy way to reduce stress , lower cholesterol and improve circulation throughout the body .
As if you needed another excuse .
Chocolate
( Image credit : Dreamstime )
Chocolate lovers rejoice : study after study lately has touted the magical benefits of the indulgent treat , which is packed with the antioxidant flavonols that prevent certain cancers and keep your arteries from clogging .
The most recent news ?
These powerful chemicals may even increase blood flow to the brain , warding off dementia .
Just stick to the highest cocoa content possible - the bars packed with sugar do n't help your health one bit .
Red Wine
( Image credit : Dreamstime )
A crucial ingredient in the diets of the world 's heart - healthiest populations - like those Bordeaux - guzzling French - red wine has long been known to have potent anti-cancer and artery - protecting benefits .
The key , some studies indicate , is an antioxidant found specifically in the skin of red wine grapes , called resveratrol .
The latest studies even link resveratrol to greater endurance , a reduction in gum disease and Alzheimer's .
White wine , which is fermented after the skins are removed , is less beneficial according to some studies .
Marijuana
It 's medicinal , we swear !
Marijuana , often associated with memory loss , is ironically now being hyped as a way to stave off the ultimate form of memory loss : Alzheimer's .
Recent studies on mice suggest that anti-inflammatories found in the drug prevent the clumping of brain proteins , one major cause of the disease .
So when should you start preventative therapy ?
We suggest waiting for the human studies to wrap up .
Maggots

They 're creepy , slimy and altogether ooky , but maggots can save your life .
These squirmy larvae are science 's newest wonder - cure and were approved in 2003 as the Food & Drug Administration 's only live medical device .
Placed on serious wounds , maggots mimic their " wild " lifestyle and munch on bacteria and dead tissue , stimulating healing and helping to prevent infection .
Sunlight

Exposure to the sun 's rays is necessary to survive , but can also kill youin gross , cancerous quantities .
Asthmatics , at least , could benefit from measured doses of ultraviolet rays , according to scientists .
Sunlight suppressed the immune reactions that cause asthma in some lab studies with mice and could be used to treat humans afflicted with the disease in the future .
And sunlight - even if indirect , such as on a shaded porch - is known to boost the mood .
Extra sunlight can help office workers avoid afternoon drowsiness , a recent study found .
There 's still no excuse to head outside and bake , however .
LSD
( Image credit : Wikimedia commons , public domain )
We 're definitely not in the business of advocating drug use .
But check out this interesting science :
In heavy drinkers , small doses of LSD have been thought to help bypass the rock - bottom stage of alcoholism and prevent relapses .
These studies - some decades old - were done in closely monitored , clinical settings ; many patients have n't had a drink in the many years since .
It 's an interesting finding that needs a lot more investigation , and not a remedy that should ever be tried at home .
Meantime , and this may come as no surprise , recent study of 36 volunteers who took an LSD - like drug in a lab setting had them reporting mystical experiences and behavior changes that lasted for weeks .
Coffee
( Image credit : Yuri Arcurs | Dreamstime )
Java is one of the most debated substances around .
Is it good for you ?
Is it bad for you ?
Both ?
The consensus , now anyways , seems to favor those who enjoy their morning jolt — unrelated studies claim coffee is a major source of antioxidants in our diet and can help lower your risk of diabetes .
Something in the beans is also thought to ease the onset of cirrhosis of the liver and pancreatitis , good news for those who like to party hard all night before their morning caffeine boost .
Anger
( Image credit : Dreamstime )
If you 're one of those people who tends to bottle things up , only to explode ... do n't hold it in so long .
Studies show that bursts of anger here and there are good for the health , and can be an even more effective coping mechanism than becoming afraid , irritated or disgusted .
Anger , like the consumables in this list , however , is best in moderation : stay angry for long periods of time and you 'll be plagued with a host of health issues , like blood pressure , sleep disorders and lung damage .
Beer
( Image credit : Jlvdream | Dreamstime )
The newest bad kid on the block , beer has long been overshadowed by its healthier alcoholic cousins .
While no one 's suggesting you switch that glass of antioxidant - rich Pinot Noir for a tall glass of lager - there 's still that beer gut to worry about - new research has suggested that moderate beer intake can actually improve cardiovascular function .
Now if only a scientist will discover the health benefits of ballpark franks and chicken wings .
Heaven .
Deanna Corbin , 46 , would live in Los Angeles if she could .
But she can’t , at least not with a modicum of space and safety , not on her $ 38,000 salary as an administrative secretary .
So Corbin gets up at 4 a .m. every day and hustles her 11 - year - old daughter out the door by 5 for the two - hour drive from their apartment in Lancaster to downtown L.A .
Most days , they do n’t return home until 8 p.m. , when Corbin tries to devote some time to her daughter ’s homework before they both collapse into bed .
It all begins again at 4 the next morning .
This is the harsh reality for thousands of working - class people priced out of one of the priciest cities in the world .
From housing and food to energy and entertainment , Los Angeles is increasingly out of reach for those living paycheck to paycheck .
Advertisement
“ It ’s a crisis , ” said Gil Duran , a spokesman for Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa .
“ We have to have a city of mixed incomes with affordable housing for workers . ”
Easier said than done .
But planning and public - policy experts say steps can be taken to protect the city ’s social and economic diversity .
It ’s just a question of priorities .
Any discussion of getting priced out of L.A. has to begin with housing , by far the biggest expense for most people .
Never mind buying .
Even with the real estate market on the ropes , buying a house or condo remains a fantasy for the majority of Southern Californians .
The real story here is rentals .
About 60 % of L.A. residents are renters , according to the National Multi Housing Council , an industry group .
That compares with a nationwide average of 32 % .
Advertisement
The Department of Housing and Urban Development says families should n’t spend more than 30 % of their annual income on housing .
But here , many people pay up to 50 % of their income for an apartment .
Runaway housing costs , in turn , tend to push wages higher , which can cause the price of just about everything else to climb as businesses seek to recoup their expenses .
One reason housing prices are so high is a requirement that newly built multiunit dwellings ( and condo conversions ) provide at least one -- usually two or three -- parking space per unit .
This inflates the cost of each apartment and discourages construction of smaller , more affordable units because developers would be required to provide even more parking .
“ The fixation on parking in Los Angeles has driven up the price of housing and increased congestion on our streets , ” said Donald Shoup , a professor of urban planning at UCLA .
He said including two spaces with a unit can add about $ 45,000 to construction costs .
Advertisement
One solution would be to waive the parking requirement for smaller apartments , thus creating an incentive for developers to place more such units on the market .
And because there ’d be no parking cost built into the rent , such units would ( in theory ) be cheaper than apartments that come with extra room for vehicles .
This could have the added benefit of increasing demand for public transportation -- presuming , that is , people would trade car ownership for reduced rent .
Increased demand would hopefully spur development of commuter - friendly projects like a long - delayed Westside subway line .
But Gail Goldberg , L.A. 's planning director , said any proposal that includes cutbacks in parking tends to go nowhere .
“ People feel like there ’s already not enough parking and that people are intruding into their neighborhood .
This is a difficult discussion to have . ”
Meanwhile , a coalition of community , religious and business interests called Housing L.A. is pushing City Hall to require developers to include affordable housing in new projects and to slow the conversion of rental units into condos .
Advertisement
These are worthwhile goals , but they ’re strongly opposed by deep - pocketed developers and real estate firms .
So good luck with that .
A more politically practical remedy may be to ease zoning requirements for mixed - use properties , thus allowing creation of urban villages featuring retail outlets at street level and moderately priced living spaces overhead .
This is already happening to some extent above a handful of subway stations , such as the Wilshire Vermont Station project in Koreatown .
But creation of dynamic transit villages throughout L.A. remains a distant prospect at best .
Instead , we ’re forced to settle for tacky strip malls and soulless commercial zones .
You get in and you get out .
There ’s little incentive to stroll the neighborhood or just hang out .
Advertisement
Large swaths of Santa Monica , Pico and La Cienega boulevards come to mind for their character - free approach to neighborhood ambience .
“ We ’ve emphasized separation of land use , ” said Raphael Bostic , a professor of urban planning and real estate at USC .
“ We keep residential with residential and commercial with commercial .
It ’s very hard to get both on the same parcel . ”
One place that ’s changing is downtown , where renovations of once - moribund buildings are bringing in new residents , resulting in more of an East Coast atmosphere where commercial and residential properties co-exist side by side .
The trade - off for increased housing stock , though , is higher density , and that wo n’t win you many friends among neighborhood activists or at City Hall .
Adding more people per city block can be a tough sell in a city that seems overcrowded to begin with .
Advertisement
“ Density is like a four - letter word these days , and that ’s a real challenge , ” Bostic said .
The upshot is that more and more people are being pushed farther from their jobs , farther from the city they ’d like to call home .
That ’s what happened to Corbin , who moved from Torrance to Lancaster after a 2005 divorce .
“ I looked for a place in Los Angeles , ” she said .
“ But there was nothing affordable in a decent area for a single mother with two daughters .
Advertisement
“ My choice was either a drug - riddled , gang - infested neighborhood or a place so small I could n’t even get my furniture in . ”
Corbin pays $ 975 monthly for a two - bedroom apartment more than 70 miles from where she works .
Her younger daughter attends school in L.A. so that Corbin can get to her quickly if something goes wrong .
Her older daughter is 18 and stays most days with friends in Torrance while attending a community college .
Corbin is n’t sure what awaits her older child once she graduates .
She only knows that she does n’t want her daughter to have to spend four hours commuting every day like she does .
“ I ’m telling her that she has to stay in school and get an education , ” Corbin said .
“ That ’s going to dictate where she lives .
It ’s going to dictate how she lives . ”

Valuable life - lessons I ’ve learned from playing the Legend of Zelda games .
I ’ve actually written little pieces of this in spare moments over the past two years or so , but never published it anywhere .
There were quite a few more points originally , but I lost the file and had to start again from scratch .
In any case , I came across the list today , and thought it worthy of inclusion in my blog .
I ’ll no doubt add to it from time to time .
Firstly , and most importantly , no matter where you might find yourself , you can always obtain a sword nearby .
No matter where you go , somewhere within a two - mile radius there are at least two better swords than the one you have .
Despite the ready availability of large , padlocked chests , most people prefer to keep their valuables in clay pots .
Breaking such pots and stealing their contents does not enrage their owner , even if the owner is watching you at the time .
Regardless of what is happening around them , people always close doors behind them .
Bushes and long grass are littered with valuable items , including jewels , arrows and bombs .
Happily , it is impossible to accidentally collide with these items ; they only appear after the greenery is cut down .
Whilst on a horse , riding over items which are hidden in grass or bushes picks up those items .
Riding over arrows does n't impale your horse , nor does riding over bombs kill you instantly .
Item - rich plant - life has a strange sort of intelligence ; when cut down , it often leaves behind the very type of item you need at that moment ( or that you 'll need in the next area ) .
You can run and jump and climb , without any breaks , for an unlimited period of time .
If you forward - roll just as you hit the ground , even relatively long vertical drops do n't hurt you in the least bit , and certainly do n't break your legs or neck .
You do n't bleed , ever .
When hurt , you flash red all over ( including your clothes ) .
The passage of time is slightly more complex than most people generally believe .
In fact , time passes normally only when you 're outwith a specific township , dungeon or island .
When you enter such an area , dawn or nightfall will not arrive until you leave .
The most powerful item you can possibly possess is not a sword , nor a magical staff , nor flaming arrows - it 's a small rustic ocarina .
Playing certain simple melodies can have a gigantic effect on your surroundings and on yourself , achieving such spectacular results as altering your physical form , or transporting you to another place .
Despite these melodies being very short and easy to learn , and despite every musical instrument in the world only being able to play the same few notes , no - one ever discovers the melodies by accident .
You have to be specifically taught them .
Nor will they work until someone has formally told you how to play them .
That 's magic for you .
You never need to eat or sleep , and drinking things ( notably milk ) often gives you increased ability to withstand enemy attacks .
Fairies are commonplace , especially amongst the forest folk ( the Kokiri ) .
Despite fairies ' reputation for being wise and gentle , they very much enjoy dishing out biting sarcasm .
You can carry any amount of bulky , volatile items and still run just as quickly as when you 're carrying nothing .
Most people are quite stupid , entirely failing to suspect that tall , black - armour - clad , evil - eyed men with dramatic names might be up to no good .
They do n't even sense that there 's a problem when those men start glowing in strange colours , or laughing maniacally .
Evil masterminds , no matter how many legions of foes or ingenious traps they might place in your path , always make the same fatal mistake : they ensure that there is always a way for you to progress towards a final confrontation with them .
Not once in all of recorded history has any final boss ever had the foresight to simply break the Boomerang in half , thus thwarting the young hero 's quest at the outset .
It 's entirely reasonable to carry 50 arrows in a single small quiver .
It 's also entirely reasonable to carry 30 football - sized bombs , and still run and jump and be knocked down by enemies without any risk of detonation .
Conveniently , bombs which are about to detonate flash red , warning you to get out of their immediate vicinity .
Despite each single unit of currency being roughly the size of a prizewinning trout , you can readily carry several thousand of them in a small leather bag .
The second most powerful item you can possess is n't a weapon either ; it 's a simple child 's mask .
Wearing a mask can cause all manner of fabulous alterations to your form and identity .
However , most masks are good enough to retain just enough of your normal clothing so that you can still be visually identified .
Do n't worry : your sword will never dull , even if you spend extended periods whacking it into solid rock walls .
No matter how many generations have prized a unique and powerful gem , the present leader will always be willing to give it to anyone who gets rid of a few invading monsters .
This is true even if the gem can be used to attain an even more powerful mythic item , or indeed open a doorway through time itself .
Music plays a large part in life .
Every location has its own distinctive background music - you even know when you 're crossing from one area to the next , because the current area 's music fades .
Additionally , an area 's music is different at night .
No - one knows why this happens .
Some people have their own background music .
This becomes particularly important when the person is evil .
If you 're approaching someone , and suddenly you hear insistent , sinister music , it 's a fair bet that the person is n't entirely friendly .
In fact , they may well attempt to kill you with all possible haste .
If there 's no sinister music , the person is utterly harmless , regardless of how they might appear .
This is a nice convenience , since otherwise we'd have to judge people based on their actions and general behaviour , which would be much more complicated .
I would n't want to live in a world where that kind of guesswork was necessary .
If a yellow arrow appears above a person 's head , coupled with the sinister music we mentioned , you 're in for a fight .
If a green arrow appears above something , it 's important that you investigate .
A fairy will normally accompany each person , and point out such things .
Even though you 'll find plenty of graveyards on your travels , you 'll find that most creatures simply disappear into thin air when you kill them , rather than leaving behind any remains .
Though you may frequently hack your way through legions of hideous and deadly creatures , you will be utterly unable to walk past even a small boy until you present him with the rare item he wants .
Nor will there be another way around , no matter how far you go .
Most evil creatures try to make a spectacular entrance whenever possible , so you might quickly stop being impressed by their arrivals .
However , if an enemy 's name appears dramatically in the air in front of them , coupled with blaring trumpet notes , you should know that you 're in for a hell of a fight .
No matter how nightmarishly horrible and unbelievably fast and powerful a " boss " enemy is , they absolutely always have a clearly - marked weak point .
By some sense of cosmic irony , they 're usually particularly vulnerable to the new weapon you picked up just a couple of minutes before .
If you 're having trouble locating a boss ' weak point , look for anything which flashes or changes colour .
Apparently evolution did n't see fit to get rid of such personally hazardous indicators .
Do n't be naive when it comes to doors .
There are many more exotic kinds of doors than you might be aware of .
For example , if you encounter a locked door and nearby there are some unlit torches , you can probably open the door by lighting the torches .
It 's not entirely clear how this can work when the doors are made of solid stone and you 're in an era long before electronics or even sophisticated mechanics , but it works nevertheless .
What 's even more fascinating is the distinctive secretive jingle which will play once you 've successfully unlocked such a door .
Some people suspect that a small orchestra follows each person around throughout their life , constantly waiting just off - camera .
I remain unsure .
There are , however , some normal doors out there , which require ordinary keys .
Just keep in mind that even though all door - keys are essentially identical , a key will only work in the general location you found it .
Conveniently , if it's at all important that you gain access to a locked room , there will always be a suitable key in the general area ( though you may need to really look for it ) .
The concept of locking the door and throwing away the key has n't reached Hyrule or any of the surrounding lands or parallel dimensions .
You 'll encounter switches everywhere , and I do n't mean light - switches .
Most switches are actually spectacularly large affairs , sometimes being up to half your height .
Some switches stay down themselves , but some require a heavy item to be placed on them .
Some switches need to be shot with an arrow ( and amazingly , you can do this any number of times without damaging the switch or even scratching its paint ) , and some are even more exotic , needing fire or ice or some magical substance to trigger them .
For all of this fabulous magic and technology , the Hylians still have n't mastered the internal combustion engine .
It 's quite common for things to be invisible .
Happily , you 'll almost always be able to find a magical lens which allows you to see nearby invisible items .
Invisible creatures are also usually good enough to leave a shadow behind , and to make sinister noises before they attack you .
For reasons which are unclear , once you 've found yourself in a strange , new land , you will be utterly unable to leave .
You will be able to travel to various diverse locations within the general area , but you will never be able to simply turn around and just leave the kingdom to sort out its own problems .
Thankfully , when someone promises you a reward in exchange for performing a task for them , they will always keep their word .
In the worst possible case scenario , they may simply ask you to perform a further task or two before furnishing the promised item .
In all of the history of the world , and despite such things being relatively commonplace , no - one but you has ever realised that joining together four heart - pieces increases your ability to resist enemy attacks .
When crossing from one high - up place to another , it 's comparatively rare to find a bridge .
After all , why go to all the trouble of building a whole bridge , when you can simply suspend blocks of solid rock in mid-air , hundreds of feet above the ground ?
For bonus points , make the solid blocks move around , following a specific repeating route .
Doing a forward - roll as an enemy attacks you will usually allow you to escape harm .
This works even if the enemy is covered in spikes , electroshock devices , or other such things .
If you find a gap which is only slightly too wide for you to jump across , try to be sensible about how you 're going to traverse it .
It 's really quite ridiculous to think you should build a makeshift bridge of some kind , or use a rope , or any such thing .
The rational thing to do is to search for a pair of boots which allow you to defy gravity for brief periods .
Contrary to popular belief , your own physical strength is mostly irrelevant when it comes to determining how much weight you can lift .
The important thing is the colour of your gloves , and the material they 're made from .
You do n't need to lose much sleep about the possibility of being deceived by a liar .
All liars not only look decidedly wicked , but they also cackle " heh ! heh ! " throughout all of their lies , so you can probably spot them without too much trouble .
Learn to have respect for pieces of wood .
Even if your sword can slice clean through a six - foot muscular werewolf , it will bounce uselessly off a simple wooden fence .
Luckily , the jarring force of the recoil will never tear ligaments in your arm nor dislocate your shoulder or damage your neck .
It really pays to be good .
Good people are immune to practically all forms of attack , including detonation of large bombs immediately beside them .
However , try as you might , you will never qualify for this righteous invulnerability ( even if you save entire kingdoms , or indeed entire planets , single - handedly ) .
Life is truly unfair sometimes .
If you enjoy speaking to mentally subnormal people who have no concept of how to avoid danger , speak to general townsfolk .
If , however , you 'd like to engage in mature debate with keenly aware and genuinely useful people , speak to the townsfolk 's children ( particularly female children who live on farms ) .
Most people are pathologically incapable of solving the daily problems their lives present them with .
No matter whether they 've misplaced a precious pet , been charged with cutting the grass , fallen ill , been changed into an animal , require to milk a cow , need to deliver a letter , or any of a thousand other things , the solution is the same : ask a complete stranger of pre-teen age who has pointy ears and green clothes .
Got some lessons I ’ve missed ?
Post them in the comments .
U.S. Attorney General Michael Mukasey addresses the media in Ankara , February 15 , 2008 .
REUTERS / Umit Bektas
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - The Bush administration said on Saturday U.S. telecommunications companies have agreed to cooperate “ for the time being ” with spy agencies ’ wiretaps , despite an ongoing battle between the White House and Congress over new terrorism surveillance legislation .
The Justice Department and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence issued a joint statement saying wiretaps will resume under the current law “ at least for now . ”
“ Although our private partners are cooperating for the time being , they have expressed understandable misgivings about doing so in light of the ongoing uncertainty and have indicated they may well discontinue cooperation if the uncertainty persists , ” the statement said .
On Friday U.S. Attorney General Michael Mukasey and Director of National Intelligence Michael McConnell said telecommunications firms have been reluctant to cooperate with new wiretaps since six - month temporary legislation expired last weekend .
As a result , they told Congress , spy agencies have missed intelligence .
Democrats accused the Bush administration of fear - mongering and blamed it for any gaps .
President George W. Bush has said he would not compromise with the Democratic - led Congress on his demand that phone companies be shielded from lawsuits for taking part in his warrantless domestic spying program .
The measure passed by the Senate would provide retroactive lawsuit immunity to firms which cooperated with warrantless wiretaps that Bush authorized after the September 11 attacks .
But the House of Representatives has opposed it , and Democratic leaders of both chambers said they would try to find a compromise .
Democratic leaders of congressional intelligence and judiciary committees issued a statement on Friday saying they were committed to passing new legislation and urged Bush to support an extension of the temporary law .
Bush has said he would hold out for a permanent overhaul of the 1978 surveillance law .

A federal judge has dismissed the civil lawsuit filed against top Bush administration officials by former CIA operative Valerie Plame Wilson and her husband , former Ambassador Joseph Wilson .
The judge , John Bates of the US District Court in Washington , DC is a Bush appointee who previously dismissed a lawsuit filed by the federal government against Vice President Dick Cheney .
That suit sought access to Cheney ’s energy task force documents .
Since his tenure on the federal bench began six years ago , Bates ’s legal opinions and rulings supporting the administration ’s executive powers stand in stark contrast to his legal work as an assistant US attorney .
He worked for Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr prosecuting President Clinton ’s Whitewater investment deals .
In 1997 , Bates successfully argued for the release of thousands of pages of White House documents related to Hillary Clinton ’s conversations about Whitewater .
In January 2003 , Senator Patrick Leahy ( D - Vermont ) , chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee , suggested that the judge was a hypocrite by pursuing access to White House documents when Clinton was in office while supporting Cheney ’s claims of executive privilege in refusing to turn over his energy task force documents to Congress .
“ When that guy was working for Ken Starr , he wanted to go open the dresser drawers of the White House , ” Leahy said .
“ I guess it ’s a lot different when it ’s a Republican vice president . ”

Self - Censorship by Journalists
If the government 's account of 9/11 is not accurate , would n't the media have been " all over it " ?
Is n't the fact that most mainstream media sources do n't spend much time covering these issues show that there 's nothing there ?
No .
Initially , there has been self - censorship by journalists .
Several months after 9/11 , famed news anchor Dan Rather told the BBC that American reporters were practicing " a form of self - censorship " :
Indeed , journalists who have even asked innocuous questions about 9/11 have been threatened .
And , referring to another topic , a leading MSNBC news commentator has said that there is self - censorship in the American media , and that :
As Air Force Colonel and key Pentagon official Karen Kwiatkowski has written ( at page 26 ) :
Censorship by Higher - Ups
If journalists do want to speak out about 9/11 , they also are subject to tremendous pressure by their editors or producers to kill the story .
The Pulitzer prize - winning reporter who uncovered the Iraq prison torture scandal and the Mai Lai massacre in Vietnam , Seymour Hersh , said :
In fact many journalists are warning that the true story is not being reported .
See this announcement and this talk .
And a series of interviews with award - winning journalists also documents censorship of certain stories by media editors and owners ( and see these samples ) .
There are many reasons for censorship by media higher - ups .
One is money .
The media has a strong monetary interest to avoid controversial topics in general .
It has always been true that advertisers discourage stories which challenge corporate power .
Indeed , a 2003 survey reveals that 35 % of reporters and news executives themselves admitted that journalists avoid newsworthy stories if “ the story would be embarrassing or damaging to the financial interests of a news organization ’s owners or parent company . ”
False flag terrorism is the most controversial topic there is .
Exposure of the truth about 9/11 would challenge the government and the corporate status quo .
Exposure of the truth of 9/11 would directly damage the bottom line of the war profiteers ( see below ) .
It would also damage the financial interests of the news organizations , since revelation of the truth would show how bad the mainstream media has been in covering real news , thus encouraging more people to get their news from other sources .
In addition , the Bush administration is allowing tremendous consolidation in ownership of the airwaves .
The large media players stand to gain billions of dollars in profits if the administration continues to allow monopoly ownership of the airwaves by a handful of players .
The media giants know who butters their bread .
So there is a spoken or tactit agreement : if the media cover the administration in a favorable light , the MSM will continue to be the receiver of the government 's goodies .
And censoring the truth about 9/11 is a large part of covering the administration in a favorable light .
Drumming Up Support for War
In addition , the owners of American media companies have long actively played a part in drumming up support for war .
It is painfully obvious to anyone with two brain cells to rub together that the large news outlets studiously avoided any real criticism of the government 's claims in the run up to the Iraq war .
It is painfully obvious that the large American media companies acted as lapdogs and stenographers for the government 's war agenda .
Indeed , veteran reporter Bill Moyers criticized the corporate media for parroting the obviously false link between 9/11 and Iraq ( and the false claims that Iraq possessed WMDs ) which the administration made in the run up to the Iraq war , and concluded that the false information was not challenged because :
always
But this is nothing new .
For example , the mainstream media also played footsie with the U.S. government right before Pearl Harbor .
Specifically , a highly - praised historian has documented that the Army ’s Chief of Staff informed the Washington bureau chiefs of the major newspapers and magazines of the impending Pearl Harbor attack BEFORE IT OCCURRED , and swore them to an oath of secrecy , which the media honored ( page 361 ) .
Also listen to this interview
And an official summary of America 's overthrow of the democratically - elected president of Iran in the 1950 's states , " In cooperation with the Department of State , CIA had several articles planted in major American newspapers and magazines which , when reproduced in Iran , had the desired psychological effect in Iran and contributed to the war of nerves against Mossadeq . " ( page x )
In fact , the large media companies have drummed up support for all previous wars .
For example , Hearst with the Spanish - American War .
And the military - media alliance has continued without a break ( as a highly - respected journalist says , " viewers may be taken aback to see the grotesque extent to which US presidents and American news media have jointly shouldered key propaganda chores for war launches during the last five decades . " )
Indeed , the American press hasserved the elites in disseminating their false justifications for war .
Why ?
One of of the reasons is because the large media companies are owned by those who support the militarist agenda or even directly profit from war and terror ( for example , NBC is owned by General Electric , one of the largest defense contractors in the world -- which directly profits from war , terrorism and chaos ) .
Another seems to be an unspoken rule that the media will not criticize the government 's imperial war agenda .
9/11 was one of the main justifications for the Iraq war , as well as the entire American imperial war agenda .
Revealing the truth about 9/11 would undermine the main reason for those wars , and therefore , is in direct conflict with the media giants ' efforts to drum up support for war .
And the media support is n't just for war : it is also for conspiracies by the powerful .
For example , a BBC documentary shows that
then
Moreover , " the tycoons told General Butler the American people would accept the new government because they controlled all the newspapers . "
See also this book Have you ever heard of this conspiracy before ?
It was certainly a very large one .
And if the conspirators controlled the newspapers , how much worse is it today with media consolidation ?
Censorship by the Government
Finally , as if the media 's own interest in covering up things like 9/11 and in promoting war is not strong enough , the government has exerted tremendous pressure on the media to report things a certain way .
Indeed , at times the government has thrown media owners and reporters in jail if they 've been too critical .
The media companies have already felt great pressure from the government to kill any real coverage of 9/11 other than the official story and attacking straw men .
For example , Dan Rather said , regarding American media , " What you have is a miniature version of what you have in totalitarian states " .
Tom Brokaw said " all wars are based on propaganda " .
And the head of CNN said :
ordered
( the expert has an impressive background ) .

Can We Win the Battle Against Censorship ?
" All tyranny needs to gain a foothold is for people of good conscience to remain silent "

" To stand in silence when they should be protesting makes cowards out of men . "
- Abraham Lincoln
" Our lives begin to end the day we become silent about things that matter . "

" Powerlessness and silence go together .
We ... should use our privileged positions not as a shelter from the world 's reality , but as a platform from which to speak .
A voice is a gift .
It should be cherished and used . "
– Margaret Atwood
" There is no act too small , no act too bold .
The history of social change is the history of millions of actions , small and large , coming together at points in history and creating a power that [ nothing ] cannot suppress . "
- Howard Zinn ( historian and 9/11 truth advocate )
Indeed , former military analyst and famed Pentagon Papers whistleblower Daniel Ellsberg said that the government hasthe media not to cover 9/11 , saying :
Of course , if the stick approach does n't work , the government can always just pay off reporters to spread disinformation .
Indeed , an expert on propaganda testified under oath during trial that the CIA employs THOUSANDS of reporters and OWNS its own media organizations
And famed Watergate reporter Carl Bernstein says the CIA has already bought and paid for many successful journalists .
See also this New York Times piece , this essay by the Independent , this speech by one of the premier writers on journalism , and this and this roundup Indeed , in the final analysis , the main reason today that the media giants will not cover the truth about 9/11 is that we live in a fascist country ( see point number 6 ) .
Fascism actually means the blending of the government and corporate interests , and the American government and mainstream media have in fact been blended together to an unprecedented degree .
The cards are heavily stacked against the media covering the facts disproving the government 's version of 9/11 or the many credible people who have questioned that story .
We are up against tremendous forces working to censor those facts .
But we have the ability to outsmart the bad guys .
We can " be the media " ourselves .
We can be the movie - makers , the commentators , the reporters and writers .
A thousand voices are louder than one voice with a megaphone .
We cannot leave governance to our " leaders " , as " The price of freedom is eternal vigilance " ( Jefferson ) .
Similarly , we cannot leave news to the corporate media .

A shining example of how the media engaged in a witch hunt as part a coordinated campaign to sink the presidential campaign of Congressman Ron Paul is when they attacked him for vaguely racist comments made by other people in the 80’s , while completely ignoring the fact that Republican frontrunner John McCain openly said he hated " gooks " more recently .
James Kirchick ’s New Republic hit piece , which was echoed by every sector of the establishment media for weeks on end , was a vitriolic , biased , and agenda - driven smear attack that lumped in half - truths , outright lies and guilt by association in an attempt to demonize Ron Paul as a racist .
Bear in mind that the comments Kirchick based his article on were largely drawn from newsletters put out in the 1980 ’s of which Ron Paul had no editorial control over .
Despite the fact that the comments were made by other people , Ron Paul apologized anyway and yet the feeding frenzy that ensued blatantly exposed the fact that the establishment had been chomping at the bit to seize on anything negative to attack the Congressman with .
Meanwhile , John " Keating Five " , ahem I mean John " anti-corruption " McCain , disgracefully said he hated " gooks " in public for assembled reporters to hear during his previous presidential campaign in 2000 .
" I hated the gooks .
I will hate them as long as I live , " McCain said on his campaign bus .
‘ So what ?
This happened eight years ago and McCain apologized for it soon after ’ , would be the likely Neo -Con riposte .
Compare it to Ron Paul , who is still apologizing for comments made by other people 20 years ago , as establishment hacks ninny and obsess about his imaginary links to white supremacists .
But McCain can openly spew racist slurs in public and the media does n’t even give it the time of day when the man looks set to go head to head with Hillary for the White House and possibly become the President for over 12 million Asian - Americans , or " gooks " as McCain calls them .
Double standards ?
That hardly covers it .
The corporate media are once again protecting their war candidate , Mr. " bomb bomb bomb Iran " , Mr. " stay in Iraq for 100 years " while crucifying Paul for comments made by other people that pale in comparison to McCain ’s personal vitriol about his deep - seated hatred of " gooks " .

I discovered that programming in Point - Free Style can be addictive !
Today , I wrote two perverse functions using PFS before discovering I had spent almost two hours just two add two lines to my code !!!
Here 's the one of the two : Sorry if it did n't fit in your screen .
I used the namepurposedly : can you imagine what this function does ?
If you can't come up with a solution in less than 1 minute , the above code is a failure as it means nothing to you ( i.e. its meaning is not apparent ) .
Try with the following version : Sorry for the bad layout .
It took two hours to me to figure out how and where to put all those .
and $ in the first version but it was fun , just like winning a game .
On the other hand , I wrote the second version as I was writing this post .
I think the reason why I write PFS code much much slower lies both in my lack of knowledge of PFS programming and my way of reasoning about programs .
Nevertheless , PFS is appealing to me because I 'm used to write shell scripts to automate things on the systems I manage : PFS is all about composing and piping functions , mostly like you compose and pipe shell programs .
I wonder if I 'll be able to guess the meaning of the PFS functions I wrote after some months : we 'll see .
As a side note , I noticed that the following pattern is coming up rather often when coding in FPS : which means :

In a two - year study , wives of circumcised men were 58 % more likely to contract HIV than wives of intact men .
The study , presented at the Conference on Retroviruses and Opportunistic Infections in Boston , was carried out in Uganda and funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation .
It compared the annual HIV incidence in the wives of men who had been circumcised to wives of men who remained intact .
The study ’s principal investigator , Maria Wawer of Johns Hopkins University , said the results were “ unexpected and somewhat disappointing ” .
Both groups reported the same level of condom use .
Wawer said the results posed a challenge to the mass roll - out of male circumcision in Africa .
Wawer was a researcher on a 2007 Ugandan clinical study that concluded circumcsion lowered the rate of infection in men .
Researchers had predicted that this “ benefit ” extended to women .
Yet , this does not appear to be true .
The circumcision clinical study done by Wawer , Ronald Gray , and others at Johns Hopkins was severley criticized by peers .
ICGI ’s opinion of male circumcision as an HIV preventative is that it will cause more infections , not less , and that it will divert money that should be going into proven efforts such as free condoms , increasing nutrition , and purifying water supplies .
" Oh , East is East , and West is West , and never the twain shall meet , / Till Earth and Sky stand presently at God 's great Judgment Seat . "
Anthony Pagden does n't quote Kipling 's famous lines in " Worlds at War " ( Random House , 625 pages , $ 35 ) , his colorful and informative book about the dire things that have happened when the twain have met over the last 2,500 years .
It would be surprising if Mr. Pagden , a historian at UCLA , did quote Kipling , at least unironically .
The poet 's frank imperialism , his earnest belief in the irreconcilability of races and civilizations , has long been taboo in intellectual circles .
As long ago as 1942 , George Orwell wrote that " it is no use pretending that Kipling 's view of life , as a whole , can be accepted or even forgiven by any civilized person . "
Click Image to Enlarge Granger Soldiers clash in a battle during the First Crusade , as depicted in a 15th - century French manuscript illumination .
Yet the subtitle of Mr. Pagden 's book 
" The 2,500 - Year Struggle Between East and West "  shows how , in the post - September 11 , 2001 , era , this once - discredited worldview is roaring back to life , under the more neutral name of " the clash of civilizations . "
With Osama bin Laden and his accomplices vowing to restore the seventh - century caliphate , it is once more possible to think of civilizations as having essences , which do not change , rather than potentialities , which do .
This covert essentialism is what makes " Worlds at War , " for all its righteous passion in defense of the West and its freedoms , a troubling book .
In his eagerness to point out what is admirable in the Western tradition  liberty , individualism , reason , the separation of religion from power 
Mr. Pagden risks turning history into a Manichean pageant , in which the West is always fighting for justice against an unjust and unreasonable East .
This is an old - fashioned way of viewing history , and Mr. Pagden often sounds like a Whig historian , chronicling the triumph of progress over its stubborn enemies .
His method is to retell some of the most famous chapters in European history , from ancient Greece to World War I , in each case focusing on the conflict between a variously defined Europe and a variously defined Asia .
These events come down to us heavily encrusted with myth : From the Persian Wars to the Crusades to Lawrence of Arabia , they are stories Europe has used to explain itself to itself .
Ordinarily , one would expect a historian to approach such myths with forensic caution  to probe for the facts beneath the legends , and above all to complicate what time has simplistically moralized .
Yet Mr. Pagden 's approach is just the opposite .
He seems to want to revive the power of these myths in order to restore ideological confidence to an apathetic Western public .
" It seems unlikely that the long struggle between East and West is going to end very soon , " he writes on the book 's last page .
" The battle lines drawn during the Persian Wars more than twenty - three centuries ago are still , in the selfsame corner of the world , very much where they were then . "
It is the kind of call to arms we might expect from a politician or a polemicist .
Coming from a historian , it is surprising , because it seems to negate the first principles of history , which are contingency and change .
If Americans are Athenians and Muslims are Persians , then nothing that has happened since the Battle of Marathon really matters ; history is not a process , still less a progress , but an eternal deadlock .
The odd thing is that Mr. Pagden 's book , simply because it traverses so much time and space , effectively undermines its own thesis .
Take the Persian Wars , the first act in the clash of civilizations , in which a grand Eastern despotism , ruled by the Achaemenid monarchs Darius and Xerxes , tried to snuff out the small but resilient democracy of Athens .
It is certainly true that , had the Greeks lost the battles of Marathon and Salamis , the course of European history would have been different .
Mr. Pagden quotes J.S. Mill 's verdict that Marathon was " a more important event in English history " than the Battle of Hastings , when the Normans conquered England itself .
Yet the closer one looks at this history , the more ambiguous it becomes .
Athens may have been a democracy in the early fifth century B.C.E. , but it had not been one a hundred years before , and it would n't be one a hundred years later .
The foundational works of Greek political thought , Plato's " Republic " and Aristotle 's " Politics , " were antidemocratic in tendency .
On the other hand , the culture of the Ionian Greek cities that were under Persian rule was hardly stifled by Eastern despotism :
The origins of philosophy lay with Ionian Greeks like Heraclitus and Anaximander .
All this suggests that , had Persia extended its overlordship to the west coast of the Aegean , much that we prize in Greek culture would still have existed , though in different form .
Certainly the fate of democracy as a political system could not have been permanently decided by just two battles .
If even today we remember Persia as an effeminate despotism , the first incarnation of an eternally menacing East , it is largely because of the way this image was perpetuated by later writers .
It is thanks to Herodotus , Mr. Pagden shows , that the Persian Wars became a morality play about the superiority of Greek isonomia , or equality before the law , to Persian absolutism .
Yet conveniently , two centuries later on , when Alexander the Great reversed Xerxes 's campaign  leading a Greek empire on an aggressive campaign into Asia  the stigma of despotism did not attach to him .
On the contrary , as Mr. Pagden writes , what looked like monolithic imperialism in the Persians was , in Alexander , an enlightened vision of a world state : " [ H ]e introduced into Greece , and subsequently into the whole of Europe , an ambition for universalism that would determine the future of the continent . "
According to one 20th century historian Mr. Pagden quotes , the League of Nations itself could be traced back to Alexander 's example .
This sort of rewriting of the past in line with the concerns of the present is not exactly blameworthy .
It is how the past is made to live ; perhaps we can only be perfectly objective about histories we no longer care about .
Yet it also blurs the complex truth of history and encourages us to draw a too straight line between past and present .
Everything we currently prize about our civilization is made to flash out at us from each moment of our past , while everything that currently shames us is tactfully draped .
Nor is it only the West that engages in this sort of mythologizing .
We can see it at work , for instance , when the Ottoman emperor , Mehmed the Great , the conqueror of Constantinople , visited the site of Troy in 1462 and declared : " It was the Greeks ... who ravaged this place in the past , and whose descendants have now through my efforts paid the right penalty , after a long period of years , for their injustice to us Asiatics at that time and so often in subsequent times . "
Of course , there was no connection at all  ethnic , religious , or linguistic  between the Turks and the Trojans , and not much more between the Byzantines and the Achaeans .
By insisting that European and Asian were transcendental , eternal identities , Mehmed was simply harnessing the emotions of the past to the policies of the present  just as Virgil did when he claimed that the Trojan prince Aeneas had founded Rome .
Or , more to the point , as Ayman al - Zawahiri did when , just after September 11 , 2001 , he compared the attacks to the Battle of Hattin , where Saladin defeated the Crusaders in 1187 .
In his closing pages , Mr. Pagden makes clear that today it is Islamic fanatics , dreaming of ancient power and purity , who are most enamored of the myth of an eternal hostility between East and West .
Yet Mr. Pagden 's response , it often seems , is to reciprocate that hostility : to identify Islamic fanaticism with Persian absolutism , and to dismiss both as representatives of an eternally malignant Asian or Eastern identity .
This leads him to some startlingly simplistic and moralistic judgments .
" History in the Islamic world ... has always moved at a different pace , " he writes ; or again , " Islam is a simple faith , which is certainly one reason for its success . "
It is hard to imagine that any scholar of Islam or the Middle East  which Mr. Pagden is not  would ever write this way about a faith and a civilization that span continents and millennia .
Inevitably , such antagonism to the East leads to an unearned complacency about the West and its values .
In " Worlds at War , " the essence of the West is always found in Pericles and Montesquieu , never in Nero or Napoleon .
A more balanced approach would acknowledge that , if the West has achieved things we hold sacred  as we should  it has always been the result of internal struggle .
What are now the cherished principles of Western civilization , from democracy to racial equality , have all started out as critiques and became generally accepted only after long and sometimes violent conflict .
For much of the world , much of the time , the most conspicuous qualities of the West were its violence , intolerance , and lust for domination .
The African slave trade and the Holocaust , too , belong to the historical identity of the West .
" Worlds at War " would be a more convincing book if it took account of the fact that wars over principles and values do n't just take place between worlds , but within them .

In various fields of human study there are problems that have never been solved .
Some theories have been put forward , but not one fully satisfies the question .
So put on your thinking cap and see if you can solve any of the ten unsolved problems listed here :
10 .
What caused the great depression ?
The Great Depression was a dramatic , worldwide economic downturn beginning in some countries as early as 1928 .
The beginning of the Great Depression in the United States is associated with the stock market crash on October 29 , 1929 , known as Black Tuesday .
The depression had devastating effects in both the industrialized countries and those which exported raw materials .
International trade declined sharply , as did personal incomes , tax revenues , prices and profits .
Cities all around the world were hit hard , especially those dependent on heavy industry .
Construction was virtually halted in many countries .
What turns a usually mild and short recession or “ ordinary ” business cycle into a great depression is a subject of debate and concern .
Scholars have not agreed on the exact causes and their relative importance .
The search for causes is closely connected to the question of how to avoid a future depression , and so the political and policy viewpoints of scholars are mixed into the analysis of historic events eight decades ago .
The even larger question is whether it was largely a failure on the part of free markets or largely a failure on the part of governments to prevent widespread bank failures and the resulting panics and reduction in the money supply .
Those who believe in a large role for governments in the economy believe it was mostly a failure of the free markets and those who believe in free markets believe it was mostly a failure of government that exacerbated the problem .
You can read some theories about the origins of the depression here .
9 . What is the origin of language ?
The origin of language ( glottogony ) is a topic that has attracted considerable speculation throughout human history .
The use of language is one of the most conspicuous and diagnostic traits that distinguish Homo sapiens from other species .
Unlike writing , spoken language leaves no trace .
Hence linguists have to resort to indirect methods in trying to decipher the origins of language .
At some stage of human evolution , one or more systems of verbal communication emerged from proto-linguistic or non-linguistic means of communication .
Chimpanzees and humans split from a common ancestor some six million years ago , a terminus post quem for linguistic evolution .
Since then all other hominids , who may have given clues as to how language developed , have gone extinct .
Many theories have been put forward to explain the origins of language , you can read some here .
8 . What started the Industrial Revolution ?
The Industrial Revolution was a period in the late 18th and early 19th centuries when major changes in agriculture , manufacturing , and transportation had a profound effect on socioeconomic and cultural conditions in Britain and subsequently spread throughout the world , a process that continues as industrialisation .
The onset of the Industrial Revolution marked a major turning point in human social history , comparable to the invention of farming or the rise of the first city - states ; almost every aspect of daily life and human society was eventually influenced in some way .
The causes of the Industrial Revolution were complex and remain a topic for debate , with some historians seeing the Revolution as an outgrowth of social and institutional changes brought by the end of feudalism in Britain after the English Civil War in the 17th century .
As national border controls became more effective , the spread of disease was lessened , therefore preventing the epidemics common in previous times .
The percentage of children who lived past infancy rose significantly , leading to a larger workforce .
One question of active interest to historians is why the industrial revolution occurred in Europe and not in other parts of the world in the 18th century , particularly China , India , and the Middle East , or at other times like in Classical Antiquity or the Middle Ages .
Numerous factors have been suggested , including ecology , government , and culture .
7 . How is language acquired ?
Language acquisition is the process by which the language capability develops in a human .
First language acquisition concerns the development of language in children , while second language acquisition focuses on language development in adults as well .
Historically , theorists are often divided between emphasising either nature or nurture ( see Nature versus nurture ) as the most important explanatory factor for acquisition .
One line of debate is between two points of view : that of psychological nativism , i.e. , the language ability is somehow “ hardwired ” in the human brain , and that of the “ tabula rasa ” or Blank Slate , i.e. , language is acquired due to brain ’s interaction with environment .
6 . What are numbers ?
The question here is : what are numbers , sets , groups , points , etc . ?
In mathematics , a structure on a set , or more generally a type , consists of additional mathematical objects that in some manner attach to the set , making it easier to visualize or work with , or endowing the collection with meaning or significance .
Are they real objects or are they simply relationships that necessarily exist in all structures ?
Although many disparate views exist regarding what a mathematical object is , the discussion may be roughly partitioned into two opposing schools of thought : neo-platonism , which asserts that mathematical objects are real , and formalism , which asserts that mathematical objects are merely formal constructions .
5. Paradox of the heap
Also known as the sorites paradox , the paradox of the heap is a paradox that arises from vague predicates .
The paradox of the heap is an example of this paradox which arises when one considers a heap of sand ( or a haystack ) , from which grains are individually removed .
Is it still a “ heap ” when only one grain remains ?
The problem is essentially one of philosophy of language , wherein terms may be relative and indefined , as opposed to problems in mathematics – wherein all terms by nature have some definition – even if it is only as a variable .
Here is an example of the paradox in action :
A heap of sand is comprised of a large collection of grains .
( Premise 1 )
A heap of sand minus one grain is still a heap .
( Premise 2 )
Repeated applications of Premise 2 ( each time starting with one less number of grains ) , eventually forces one to accept the conclusion that a heap may be composed of just one grain of sand .
On the face of it , there are some ways to avoid this conclusion .
One may object to the first premise by denying that a large collection of grains makes a heap ( or more generally , by denying that there are heaps ) .
One may object to the second premise by stating that it is not true for all collections of grains that removing one grain from it still makes a heap .
Or one may accept the conclusion by insisting that a heap of sand can be composed of just one grain .
The paradox is tricky for philosophers because they must explain why one of the two premises , or the conclusion , is wrong even though they appear to be self - evident .
4 . Do black holes exist ?
Do black holes really exist ?
Do they radiate , as expected on theoretical grounds ?
Does this radiation contain information about their inner structure , as suggested by Gauge - gravity duality , or not , as implied by Hawking ’s original calculation ?
If not , and black holes can evaporate away , what happens to the information stored in it ?
( Quantum mechanics does not allow information to be destroyed )
Or does the radiation stop at some point leaving black hole remnants ?
Is there another way to probe their internal structure somehow , if such a structure even exists ?
While general relativity describes a black hole as a region of empty space with a pointlike singularity at the center and an event horizon at the outer edge , the description changes when the effects of quantum mechanics are taken into account .
Research on this subject indicates that , rather than holding captured matter forever , black holes may slowly leak a form of thermal energy called Hawking radiation .
However , the final , correct description of black holes , requiring a theory of quantum gravity , is unknown .
3. Untriseptium
The name untriseptium is used as a placeholder , as in scientific articles about the search for element 137 .
Transuranic elements ( those beyond uranium ) are , except for microscopic quantities and except for plutonium , always artificially produced , and usually end up being named for a scientist or the location of a laboratory that does work in atomic physics .
Because the significance of element 137 was first pointed out by the physicist Richard Feynman , element 137 is sometimes informally called Feynmanium ( symbol Fy ) .
Any element with an atomic number of greater than 137 would require 1s electrons to be traveling faster than the speed of light .
Since the early 1900 ’s , physicists have thought that this number ( 137 ) might be at the heart of a GUT , or Grand Unified Theory , which could relate the theories of electromagnetism , quantum mechanics , and most especially gravity .
However , physicists have yet to find any link between the number 137 and any other physical law in the universe .
It was expected that such an important equation would generate an important number , like one or pi , but this was not the case .
The question here , is what are the chemical consequences of having an element , with an atomic number above 137 , whose 1s electrons must travel faster than the speed of light ?
Is “ Feynmanium ” the last chemical element that can physically exist ?
2 . Why do we dream ?
The events of dreams are often impossible , or unlikely to occur , in physical reality : they are also outside the control of the dreamer .
The exception to this is known as lucid dreaming , in which dreamers realize that they are dreaming , and are sometimes capable of changing their dream environment and controlling various aspects of the dream .
The dream environment is often much more realistic in a lucid dream , and the senses heightened .
There is no universally agreed - upon biological definition of dreaming .
General observation shows that dreams are strongly associated with REM sleep .
REM sleep is the state of sleep in which brain activity is most like wakefulness , which is why many researchers believe this is when dreams are strongest , although it could also mean that this is a state from which dreams are most easily remembered .
During a typical lifespan , a human spends a total of about six years dreaming ( which is about 2 hours each night ) .
It is unknown where in the brain dreams originate — if there is such a single location — or why dreams occur at all .
1 . What are the chemical origins of life ?
What are the chemical origins of life ?
How did non-living chemical compounds generate self - replicating , complex life forms ?
In the natural sciences , abiogenesis , the question of the origin of life , is the study of how life on Earth might have emerged from non-life .
Scientific consensus is that abiogenesis occurred sometime between 4.4 billion years ago , when water vapor first liquefied , and 2.7 billion years ago , when the ratio of stable isotopes of carbon , iron , and sulfur points to a biogenic origin of minerals and sediments and molecular biomarkers indicate photosynthesis .
There is no truly “ standard model ” of the origin of life .
But most currently accepted models build in one way or another upon a number of discoveries about the origin of molecular and cellular components for life .
As of 2007 , no one has yet synthesized a “ protocell ” using basic components which would have the necessary properties of life ( the so - called “ bottom - up - approach ” ) .
Without such a proof - of - principle , explanations have tended to be short on specifics .
However , some researchers are working in this field , notably Steen Rasmussen at Los Alamos National Laboratory and Jack Szostak at Harvard University .

Not - so - rich buy Texas Lottery 's $ 50 ticket
AUSTIN —
When top lottery officials last winter announced the introduction of a $ 50 scratch - off game — the priciest lottery ticket in the nation — they said they hoped to appeal to a particular type of player :
The affluent .
As it turns out , the $ 50 game , called $ 130 Million Spectacular , has fared best in middle - income neighborhoods typically not considered affluent , according to six months of sales data analyzed by the Houston Chronicle .
The Chronicle looked at each of the state 's ZIP codes with at least 1,000 adult residents , dividing them into groups based on their median household income in the 2000 census .
The analysis found that sales of the $ 50 Spectacular surged across middle - income ZIP codes , seeing strong per-capita sales in areas both with incomes of just more than $ 30,000 and in those with earnings upwards of $ 50,000 and $ 60,000 .
Sales figures dropped off in both rich and poor areas , although the state 's poorest ZIP codes — those with median incomes of $ 20,000 or less — saw stronger per-capita sales than the richest , with incomes of $ 90,000 or more .
While the analysis is imperfect because it does not account for people who may buy lottery tickets in a ZIP code where they do n't live , and whose incomes may differ from the median there , it bolsters numerous other studies indicating that lottery games tend to be most popular among the non-affluent .
" The lottery was never designed for rich people , " said Rep. Garnet Coleman , D- Houston .
He called the $ 50 ticket a state - orchestrated scheme to entice people of limited means to spend more .
" The people who play are still people who can least afford to spend $ 50 ... they 're people who struggle to live off what they make . "
Despite the criticism , the state is n't about to turn its back on its high - priced games .
" The $ 50 ticket salvaged our entire fiscal year last year , " said Robert Tirloni , projects manager for the Texas Lottery Commission , bringing $ 137 million to state coffers since the game 's debut in May and helping the commission close a $ 93 million gap in revenue between 2006 and 2007 .
Texas lottery commission spokesman Robert Heith said the games are voluntary and are designed to entertain .
He added that his agency has one overriding mission : to generate revenue for Texas public schools .
Last year , more than $ 1 billion of the $ 3.8 billion raised from lottery sales went to public education .
Habitual players
The $ 50 scratch - off game did so well in Texas that the state , without fanfare , launched in November a second $ 50 game called $ 130 Million Payout Bonanza .
Together , the two games have generated $ 158 million in revenue .
Of the 25 ZIP codes with the highest per capita sales from the spectacular game , 18 had incomes below the state average of $ 40,000 in the last census .
And though sales of the $ 50 ticket dropped off in higher - and lower - income areas , people in poor areas still spent more on the tickets .
Average per capita sales were 22 percent higher in ZIP codes with a median household income of $ 20,000 and below , compared with ZIP codes with median household earnings of $ 90,000 and above .
Laura Estrada , 33 , can't seem to get enough of the high - dollar tickets .
She earns just more than $ 22,000 a year as a customer sales representative for a party store in north Austin but spends anywhere between $ 100 and $ 200 a week on scratch - off tickets , including the $ 50 games .
She loves the rush .
" Losing $ 50 makes you perspire ; it makes you nervous .
' Gosh , I should n't have bought that . '
But then you win and it makes you feel great , " she said .
Estrada harbors no illusion :
She knows the lottery is a money drain for habitual players like herself .
But it 's her favorite hobby .
So she does n't calculate the losses ; she concentrates on the wins , like the $ 200 she collected on a $ 50 ticket .
She has to think hard about how many $ 50 tickets she 's bought to win that one — between six and 10 , she estimates .
Her reason for continuing to play ?
" I have to try to get my money back . "
State lotteries have always faced charges that the games they promote are regressive in nature because they appeal to those least able to afford them .
Critics say that 's especially true with scratch - off games .
A 2006 study commissioned by the state of Texas seemed to back that up .
Players with a high school education or less spent an average of $ 20 a month on Texas scratch - off games , twice what college graduates spent .
Those earning $ 12,000 or less spent an average of $ 16 on scratch - off tickets a month , 45 percent more than players who earned between $ 75,000 and $ 100,000 .
Gaining in popularity
Lottery officials had said they want to target groups not normally associated with scratch - offs .
" Now , I think the idea of bringing people with higher disposable income into our customer base is a very important one , " Commissioner Jim Cox said last year when discussing the launch of the $ 50 game .
Scratch - offs , with their instant results and catchy themes , have soared in popularity in Texas in recent years , even as the number of people playing lottery games overall has declined .
Texas introduced about 100 instant - ticket games last year ; scratch - off games as a whole accounted for close to 76 percent of the commission 's revenues .
And nearly a third of all scratch - off sales were from high - dollar tickets priced at $ 10 , $ 20 , $ 25 , $ 30 and $ 50 .
" With scratch - offs , we have the ability to put out new games , with new themes , we have a lot more flexibility to change the product and keep the games alive and fresh , " Tirloni said .
The state spends $ 33 million a year promoting the games that inspire dreams of instant riches , but several years ago eliminated funding for programs to help problem gamblers .
Rob Kohler , a lobbyist with the anti-gambling Christian Life Commission of the Baptist General Convention of Texas , said the lottery may have been harmless when games cost no more than a buck , but not now .
He said Texas voters who approved the creation of the state lottery in 1991 could not have fathomed tickets selling for $ 50 a pop .
" The most expensive lottery ticket has gone from costing no more than a candy bar to now being the most expensive item in convenience stores , " Kohler said , adding : " The state should not be in the business of separating the citizens from their dollars .
Fifty dollars is a big part of what people spend on groceries , and in some areas , a good percentage of what they spend on rent . "
A $ 100 ticket ahead ?
Heith , the lottery spokesman , said it would be impossible to conclude that tickets bought in a particular area were actually purchased by people who live there .
" We really do n't know until we can actually stand at the door and poll each person exiting a store ( with a $ 50 ticket in hand ) where they live , " Heith said .
Cliff Spiegelman , a professor of statistics at Texas A&M University , scoffed at that argument and said the state could accurately and fairly easily discern the demographics of people buying the $ 50 tickets .
It would just have to hire a survey company such as Gallup .
" The organizations that track likely voting outcomes can also track likely lottery sales , " Spiegelman said .
The Hill Country town of Leakey had the highest per capita sales in the state , and a median household income in the last census of $ 26,000 .
Tristan Elmore , co-manager of the Fuel City store in Leakey , where spending on the $ 50 game hit a whopping $ 89 for every adult ( 1,114 ) in town , can hardly keep the game in stock .
" I can not believe how many tickets we sell .
It 's become a competition among locals , a one - upmanship , " she said .
" We have people who come in and buy two or three at a time . "
James Rinn , a former finance director for the lottery , said the state should have a broader mission than money collection .
" Clearly , there needs to be a social aspect , " he said .
" Let 's generate revenue , but not to the detriment of those who can least afford it . "
The state has pondered introducing a $ 100 ticket and last year ordered up a study to determine whether enough Texans would embrace it .
Tirloni called a $ 100 ticket " the next step , though we 're not there yet . "
He added , " Whenever we put out a ( higher - priced ticket ) , it 's been successful . "

San Antonio Express - News researcher Julie Domel contributed to this report .

NOTE : There are a number of other ideas that we are not now advocating — including direct majority voting on presidential elections ; run -off votes when candidates fail to win 50 % ; various scenarios to control or change campaign finance and media access in the electoral process ; and even direct voting on legislation — that will provoke controversy and discourse within the Open Source Party .
Some of these ideas may be added to the platform following a radically open and democratic process that will be suggested at the end of this statement .
NOTE : There is plenty of room here for dynamic , open debate among Open Source Party members , including whether to reform or repeal The Patriot Act and what kind of surveillance is necessary and appropriate for the defense of the nation .
Also , ending the " drug war " could involve anything from reform of draconian policies and medicalization of illegal drugs , to an outright end to prohibition .
Again , we will follow a radically open and democratic process that may add to the party platform .
NOTE : Here we can have a dynamic discussion about many possible aspects of defending the US , including , the size of the military budget and the interests of what President Eisenhower called a military - industrial complex ; what to do about weapons systems and weapons testing ( including nuclear ) ; whether we should provide weapons to other nations and under what circumstances ; whether to allow mercenary groups to operate out of the US ; whether and when to participate and help in peace negotiations among other nations as a humanitarian act ; whether and when to participate with other nations in interventions in extreme cases of genocide ; whether or when to intervene in extreme cases if and when another nation launches repeated interventions of its own and seems clearly bent on regional or global conquest in the tradition of Genghis Khan , Napolean and Hitler ; how to cope with the development of nuclear weapons by other nations ( and by our own ) ; whether or not to have military alliances and what our degree of commitment to them should be ; and whether and when to cooperate with the UN .
NOTE : Obviously , there 's nearly infinite room here for debate and discussion about these solutions , but we imagine a passionate discourse about whether the transition can happen primarily through encouragement of the market or whether it should emphasize government solutions .
We also look forward to an interesting debate among Open Source Party members over whether to develop and deploy more nuclear power .
NOTE : Again , there is nearly infinite room for new ideas and debate here , including questioning the essential premise — thus the " let 's explore " aspect of this part of the platform .
Open Source currency may be achievable through networks of trust , through virtual money ( like Linden Dollars ) or simply by removing the state from the equation and then publicly encouraging a multiplicity of exchange signals .
We are most of all intrigued by ideas that might lead toward a post - scarcity monetary system .
Note :
There is tremendous room for discussion and debate about other measures to rein in corporations , including — no doubt — discourse about whether to simply take away corporate advantages or to regulate them , democratize them , utilize the corporate approval process to punish corruption and / or anti-social activities , ad infinitum .
Note :
This requires lots of real creative thinking and there is lots of room for discussion and debate around the nuances of netiquette and law .
Visit our newly re-purposed MondoGlobo Network to get more involved with this idea and / or in a social network for people who question authority .
This proposal is meant to be considered alongside , or in conjunction with my other recent QuestionAuthority proposal .
They can both be discussed within active , dedicated groups at the new MondoGlobo social network , along with related issues .
again in this year 's election .
Ralph Nader and whoever the Libertarians and Greens nominate as their candidates will drag their asses around the country , sometimes saying interesting and important things , sometimes not .
Many of us will wish , once again , that there could be a dynamic discourse about the many real issues and problems that get ignored ; and then we will vote ( or not ) for the one who has at least a fingernail grip on sanity , or for one of the sad and hopeless alterna - candidates .
But we could make the political season less depressing by using networking tools to create a very large and dynamic discourse about the things that we believe really need to change , and we could evolve a new political organization that would be ready to kick up some noise by the time the next political season ( 2010 ) rolls around .
In that spirit , I propose a Liberal / Libertarian / Other unity party that will develop ideas and solutions to America 's political problems through an Open Source process that will be engaging and fun .
We will have online conferences , social networks and wikis , we will have meetups , we will have parties , we will create games that model likely real world responses to our proposed ideas , we will field candidates starting in 2010 , get " crazed " anti-authoritarians on TV and radio , and maybe change a few things before the apocalypse , the Singularity , the second coming , the complete conquest of the world by Google , the election of another generation of Bushes and Clintons , or whatever other event you may be expecting .
There are two ways to go with an Open Source Party .
One way would be to just throw it open to everybody .
Everyone gets to pour their ideas into the maelstrom whether they 're anarchists or fascists , conservatives or moderates — or if they just miss Ross Perot .
But I 'm not an absolute believer in the wisdom of crowds and all that .
I prefer another idea .
I would bring together people who feel they are in agreement with at least 5 of the 7 points in the party platform below – giving us a starting point from which to launch activities on the basis of the platform and to have interesting fun in a democratic process that adds to or subtracts from the platform .
We ask you to please endorse the Open Source Platform below .
You can demonstrate your endorsement of the Open Source Platform by joining the dedicated group on the MondoGlobo Network and / or by contributing money to the " establishment campaign . "
By so doing , you 'll send a message to the nation and the world .
Here , then , is the Open Source Party Platform ...
It 's a wacky , wacky idea that may have started in early Greece and was cautiously revived during the American Revolution in 1776 when voting rights were granted to property owning white males living in most states of that Union .
Since then , the hint of democracy has grown and spread , but the actual practice has been far from complete .
Recently , many citizens of the US have questioned whether democracy is still in practice here at all .
It 's an excellent question .
The Open Source Party suggests two steps to ensure actual democracy .
One person / one vote : Every US citizen over 18 has a Social Security number .
Many activities on the internet are protected from fraud by strong data encryption .
Surely , computer geniuses thinking together in an Open Source process can come up with a way that every person over 18 can use his or her number to effectively and efficiently vote once and only once .
Citizens can vote from their homes or they can vote from public polling stations using social security numbers tied to data encryption .
If this solution is n't possible , let 's brainstorm others .
Should n't actually having a democracy be a priority for the world 's oldest " democracy " ?
Demolish the duopoly :
There are dozens of rules and regulations designed by the two political parties that have had a virtual monopoly on power for many decades that prevent other political parties and independents from competing on a fair playing field .
We should eliminate all those barriers that give unfair advantage to the ruling parties .
Here we have yet another notion that only cranks subscribe to — that civil liberties can survive crime , mind - active substance use , and even terrorism .
For starters , we seek the return of civil liberties , rights , and basic , sane conduct by the Executive branch of government that has been lost in the post 9 - 11 environment .
This includes the reform or repeal of the ( mostly ) unnecessary Patriot Act ; the return of Habeas Corpus ; the end of essentially infinite surveillance rights for the federal government ; limits to privilege and secrecy in the executive branch ; the end of — or the imposition of judicial limits onto — presidential signing statements .
( What have I forgotten ?
You tell me . )
We support strong free speech that includes an end to implicit censorship through government intimidation , and an end to the so - called " War on Drugs , " which has resulted in frequent violations against limits on search and seizure and an abhorrently high percentage of US citizens imprisoned .
Or , if you prefer , let 's stop playing the world 's policeman .
However you phrase it , we should no longer invade or attack sovereign nation states , either directly or indirectly , that have n't attacked us by force of arms .
The emphasis of American foreign policy needs to change from " defending our interests " to " defending our sovereignty .
"
A tremendous number of energy pioneers have been thinking and working for decades on energy solutions that do n't involve oil , natural gas or coal .
These organizations include Rocky Mountain Institute , Pliny Fisk ’s Center for Maximum Potential Building Systems , and the folks at WorldChanging , ad infinitum .
Let 's bring people like these together to map out how best to bring us as completely into the age of clean energy as possible within 10 - 20 years — whether through the state , the market , decentralized voluntarism , or all three .
Monetary policies and systems change all the time and it is always necessary to remind ourselves that " money " is a symbol ( presumably ) of wealth , and not an actual material value .
We should encourage and empower a public discourse around how money should be issued , understood , defined and valued .
Ultimately , we may want to think in terms of an " Open Source " monetary system and we may want to encourage " alternative " forms of currency .
Corporations today have the rights but not the responsibilities of persons , and our laws are riddled with other advantages that tilt the balance of economic and political power in favor of these giants .
This platform suggests a simple libertarian approach toward disempowering what some have called the corporatocracy by removing their state advantages .
Digital stuff exists in a land without scarcity .
It is natural and spontaneous that when people reside there , they tend to share and to re-purpose content without guilt .
On the other hand , " content creators " need to pay bills just as much as programmers and other virtual laborers do .
We need to support the natural evolving ecology of copying and sharing on the web .
At the same time , we need to find a way to sufficiently reward creative content .
We suggest that decisions to take on " official " activities and to make additions or subtractions to and from the Open Source Party platform would take place along the lines of " near consensus . "
We would suggest a 75 % yes vote among registered members would be requuired to adopt any action or platform point .
We also suggest that the democratic process would include serious campaigning and some degree of hilarity .
We suggest that erecting a pay wall would be instrumental not only in helping to finance a dynamic organization but necessary to keep out all but the most motivated griefers , and help us to verify the legitimacy of voters , who would vote only once .
Naturally , we would hope that enthusiasts who can would contribute substantially more .
We imagine that this in - group , Open Source , participatory democratic process could be a way in which people who have been more or less on the fringe of American politics can encourage one another to think clearly in terms of actually making policy .
It 's very easy to stand outside the system and protest or call for some absolutist ideological solution ( " Anarchy , dudes ! " ) , but it 's more interesting and valuable to try to realistically envision the consequences of policy .
We also want to emphasize again the ample potential to keep this playful — to create dynamic virtual worlds ( in Second Life , or wherever ) , games , fanciful as well as serious candidacies , videos and podcasts , songs , etc .
Such media can now be created by a large proportion of the general internet public , so why not do it ?

Well maybe it is a little clearer why the first thing Pelosi did after she became speaker of the house was to take impeachment off the table .
According to the Washington Post beginning in 2002 leading lawmakers both Republican and Democrat where briefed on the so called enhanced interrogation techniques including waterboarding .
The lawmakers who held oversight roles during that time period included Nancy Pelosi , Jane Harman , Bob Graham , John Rockefeller IV , Porter Goss , and Pat Roberts .
The only one that objected the technique was Representative Jane Harmon .
http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/12/08/AR2007120801664.html?hpid=topnews
So it looks as though Speaker Pelosi and other Democrats have colluded with the Bush administrations torture techniques because she knew about them but did not report them .
Senator Biden has called for an independent counsel to investigate the destruction of the torture tapes that have been in the news for the last week .
It seems though Senator Jay Rockefeller D( W.V. ) chairman of the Senate intelligence Committee does not think there is a need for an independent counsel because he said “ it is the job of the intelligence committee to do that . ”
I believe that the foxes are guarding the hen house .
This is starting to make some sense why after the Democrats took control of Congress that no serious investigation of this administrations lawlessness has occurred .
We the people need to make sure that there is an independent counsel appointed to investigate the destruction of the terror tapes and to determine who is complicit in this administrations total disregard for the rule of law .
The fox should not be guarding the hen house and we must enhance the improvements already made in Congresses ethics reform laws this year to include , a standing independent investigating body to watch Congress and the President .
Without this who are we to trust , the politicians ?????

Sacrificing an Economic Adviser By Arnold Kling
Tyler is upset .
It seems the Barack Obama campaign is distancing itself from Austan Goolsbee , who is indeed a first - rate economist …
Which kinds of advisers will flourish best in a “ message consistency ” environment ?
Independent and critical minds , able and willing to speak the truth to power ?
My view is that it does not take much for an economic adviser to become expendable .
In a world of close substitutes , if the cost of one goes up a tad , you pick another .
If Goolsbee freelanced up in Canada , then it ’s easy to see why you might want to let him go .
( Another scenario is that he “ took one for the team , ” in which case you still let him go , but he is more of a hero for it . )
I think if I were in an advisory position , I could understand the desirability of remaining inconspicuous .
There is mostly downside for the politician in having his or her economic advisers make headlines .
I think I would be ok with message discipline in that sense .
What I could n’t handle would be telling a whopper in public in order to support the President ’s decisions .
“ These steel tariffs actually are in the interest of consumers … ”
I could n’t say something like that without my nose getting long , or , more realistically , just breaking out with a case of the giggles .
Megan worries that it shows that Obama is not so committed to free trade .
To which I cannot respond any more eloquently than Glenn Reynolds .
It is difficult to find a westerner who does not intuitively support the idea of a free Tibet .
But would Americans ever let go of Texas or California ?
For China , the Anglo - Russian great game for control of central Asia was neither inconclusive nor fruitless , something that cannot be said for Russia or Britain .
Indeed , China was the big winner .
Boundary agreements in 1895 and 1907 gave Russia the Pamir mountains and established the Wakhan Corridor - the slender eastern tongue of Afghanistan that borders China - as a buffer to Britain .
But rather than cede East Turkestan ( Uighurstan ) to the Russians , the British financed China 's recapture of the territory , which it organised into Xinjiang ( which means " New Dominions " ) .
While West Turkestan was splintered into the hermetic Soviet Stans , China reasserted its traditional dominance over Xinjiang and Tibet , today its largest - and least stable - provinces .
( Beijing has now accused the Dalai Lama of colluding with Muslim Uighur separatists in Xinjiang . )
But without them , the country would be like America without all territory west of the Rockies : denied its continental majesty and status .
Every backpacker who has visited Tibet and Xinjiang in the past decade knows that the Chinese empire is painfully real : the western region 's going concern is undoubtedly Chinese Manifest Destiny .
With the end of the civil war in 1949 , China endeavoured immediately to overcome the " tyranny of terrain " and tame the interminable mountain and desert landscapes with the aim of exploiting vast natural assets , establishing penal colonies and military bases , and expand the Lebensraum for its exploding population .
Both Tibet and Xinjiang have the misfortune of possessing resources China wants and of being situated on the path to resources China needs :
Tibet has vast amounts of timber , uranium and gold , and the two territories constitute China 's geographic gateway for trade flow outward - and energy flow inward - with Kazakhstan , Kyrgyzstan , Tajikistan , Afghanistan and Pakistan .
Decades of labour by the army and swarms of workers have paved the way for unchallenged Chinese dominance .
The high - altitude train linking Shanghai and Lhasa that began service in 2006 represents not the beginning of Chinese hegemony , but its culmination .
Tibet and Xinjiang today set the stage for the birth of a multi-ethnic empire in ways that resemble nothing so much as America 's frontier expansion nearly two centuries ago .
Chinese think about their mission civilatrice much as American settlers did : they are bringing development and modernity .
Asiatic , Buddhist Tibetans and Turkic , Muslim Uighurs are being lifted out of the third world - whether they like it or not .
They are getting roads , telephone lines , hospitals and jobs .
School fees are being reduced or abolished to promote basic education and Chineseness .
Unlike those Europeans who seek to define the EU as a Christian club , there are no Chinese inhibitions about incorporating Muslim territories .
The new mythology of Chinese nationalism is based not on expunging minorities but granting them a common status in the paternalistic state : Uighurs and Tibetans , though not Han , are told they are Chinese .
" The Soviet Union collapsed because they experimented with glasnost prematurely , before the achieved unity among the peoples , " explains a Chinese intellectual in Shanghai who studies central Asia .
Large empires are maintained through a combination of force and law ; and as recent weeks illustrate , China is determined not to waver .
In even the remotest corners of Tibet , small bases house platoons of the People 's Liberation Army , with soldiers menacingly practising martial arts twice daily in public squares , often right next to ancient Buddhist stupas .
Inaccessible jungle areas designated environmentally protected zones are often actually military encampments .
Signs trumpeting " Tibet power " refer strictly to the Chinese electricity company .
China has pumped in billions of development dollars , hoping to generate goodwill among the scarcely 3 million Tibetans .
In Lhasa , crumbling stone quarters have been replaced with sturdy homes built along thoroughfares connecting the city to the new railway station .
The consequence of Chinese modernity , however , is that a city that once symbolised cultural authenticity has become merely a gateway to the remote plateaus where wild yak still outnumber people .
An even greater prize than Tibet is the far larger and more populous Xinjiang , with its oil deposits , deserts and mountains .
Its demographic dilution has been dubbed " apartheid with Chinese characteristics " .
Xinjiang 's Muslims have always been unruly , even briefly securing an independent East Turkestan at the end of the civil war .
But massive Han resettlement began with the " Develop the west " campaign of the 1950s , and in the cultural revolution Xinjiang was sealed off for a massive pogrom of mosque destruction and Qur'an burning .
Violent clashes in Urumqi , Xinjiang 's capital , in 1996 proved that no peaceful Islamic culture would prevail in a Chinese - dominated environment .
China suspended all mosque reconstruction and launched a " Strike Hard " campaign , imprisoning and executing hundreds of suspected separatists .
Today one can see the results of a programme Mao and Deng began , but never completed : a railway and highway transporting coal , migrants and goods across the Taklamakan desert , facilitating the Hanification of a province where Uighurs now make up only half the population .
The annihilation of local people , history and architecture , and their replacement with shiny skyscrapers paying tribute to modern Chinese capitalism , make Urumqi the Shanghai of the northern Silk Road .
A six - lane freeway runs through the city , and the Han majority fill up spiffy Japanese cars at the large Sinopec and PetroChina petrol stations .
Urumqui buzzes with traders from Russia to Pakistan and all Stans in between , who buy cheap Chinese goods to be sold back home at a profit .
Uighurs are now a marginalised minority in the city .
Chinese tourists crowd the few accessible natural attractions , making the emerald - coloured Heavenly Lake no longer very heavenly .
Ironically , China 's near absolute sense of security over both provinces is the greatest hope for a Chinese glasnost : China no longer faces any meaningful resistance to its rule and so some day may lighten up .
Spiritual Tibetans have long looked south to Nepal and India for their cultural underpinnings , and in the 18th century Tibet was allowed a functional autonomy from China , a model the current Dalai Lama has proposed .
Once he passes the scene , China might be less anxious about cultural exchange between Buddhists , further restoring Tibet 's role as the Silk Road passage it was when Dunhuang 's Caves of the Thousand Buddhas were carved , more than a millennium ago .
Tibetans and Uighurs will gradually become more prosperous than their neighbouring Mongols , Kyrgyz , Tajiks , Afghans , Pakistanis , Indians , and Nepalis - and this may provide a basis for Chinese claims of a benevolent hegemony elsewhere in Asia .
But China will achieve that dominance before it talks about it .

Hollywood ’s Triple - A list actors have started becoming integrally involved in trying to solve the Writers Guild strike against the Hollywood CEOs .
I ’ve just been told that George Clooney today is volunteering to personally set up a so - called “ mediation panel ” including himself and with plans to ask Steven Spielberg , Tom Hanks and John Wells ( the executive producer of ER and a controversial ex-WGA president ) to be part of it , plus 3 or 4 bigwigs who are siding with the producers .
The offer came in a phone call today with Harvey Weinstein who promptly volunteered to be part of the panel .
Clooney suggested its purpose should be to oversee the talks and tell the WGA as each term is bargained “ you have to live with this and get over it , ” and tell the AMPTP “ you have to live with that and get over it ” , Weinstein quoted George as saying .
It ’s also Clooney ’s idea that everybody would be locked in the room together and not leave until the deal is done .
FRIDAY UPDATE : A Clooney insider tells me : “ It would be more accurate to say that George has and would offer to help , including putting a group of people in a room that know both the CEOs and the writers personally .
And that of course he would do anything to get this over .
He did n’t use any of the rhetoric that ’s being attributed to him [ by Weinstein ] .
His stance has always been to find common ground and not alienate each other . ”
This follows a London interview by that other Triple - A lister Tom Hanks linking the fate of the upcoming Academy Awards to the studios ’ continued refusal to “ get down to honest bargaining ” .
Both Clooney and Hanks are making it clear publicly that they ’re concerned about the writers strike ’s collateral damage .
Hanks said corporate bosses should remember that many ancillary businesspeople were suffering from the studios and networks refusing to restart negotiations with the Writers Guild .
“ There are caterers and carpenters … and electricians and gaffers , ” Hanks told Reuters in London Wednesday night .
“ There are a lot of people out there associated with the industry , for whom the sooner this work stoppage is over the better . ”
And Clooney said much the same thing when he appeared onstage at Monday night ’s Critics Choice Awards ( photo above ) : “ When the strike happens , it ’s not just writers [ affected ] …
Our hope is that all the players will lock themselves in a room and not come out until they finish .
We want this to be done .
That ’s the most important thing . ”
Now that Clooney and Hanks are at the head of the line , then Will Smith , George Clooney , Brad Pitt , Angelina Jolie , Reese Witherspoon , Russell Crowe , Denzel Washington , Jodie Foster , Julia Roberts and other AAA - listers may follow their lead .
As I wrote way back on November 7th soon after the WGA strike started and have said repeatedly since , the only time I ’ve ever heard of Hollywood CEOs caving on a major negotiation is when they get in the same room with a major star .
There ’s just something so needy within the Hollywood moguls ’ psyche that they want to be liked and respected by the creatives they in turn like and respect .
( I assume this is why these businessmen make TV and movies instead of toothpaste and mattresses . )
Therefore , any professional , personal and even psychological pressure put by these top - of - the - heap artists on the studio and network bosses could make all the difference in solving this strike .
Today it should be sufficient to post numbers only .

Gov. Bill Richardson and Sen. Barack Obama January 10 , 2008 in Santa Fe , New Mexico .
Click on the Play Button to see what Jack and our viewers had to say .
( PHOTO CREDIT : GETTY IMAGES )
FROM CNN's Jack Cafferty :
It could be the beginning of the end for Hillary Clinton .
Bill Richardson 's endorsement of Barack Obama today is huge .
Richardson , after all , served under President Bill Clinton as ambassador to the U.N. and secretary of the Energy Department .
He 's also a friend of the Clintons who watched the Super Bowl together with the former president last month .
So it could n't be easy for Hillary Clinton when Richardson – whom both candidates had lobbied hard for an endorsement – came out today and called Obama a " once-in-a- lifetime - leader . "
Richardson said the speech Obama gave on race " appealed to the best in us . "
The New Mexico governor and former presidential candidate 's endorsement carries a lot of weight .
He 's the only Hispanic governor in the country , which presumably will help Obama in the Hispanic community .
He 's also a superdelegate , and this may be the key .
Richardson could potentially have a lot of influence over the remaining undecided superdelegates , which is still roughly half of the almost 800 party insiders .
Today he suggested that it 's time " for Democrats to stop fighting amongst ourselves and to prepare for the tough fight we will face against John McCain in the fall . "
Clinton shrugged off the endorsement saying that both she and Obama have many great endorsers and it's the voters who will ultimately decide this election .
But when it comes right down to it , there are endorsements and then there are endorsements .
Yesterday Dick Morris , former political adviser to President Clinton said the race is over and Obama has won .
Today Bill Richardson , who likewise has ties to the Clintons , announces he 's endorsing Obama .
Here ’s my question to you :
How significant is Bill Richardson 's endorsement of Barack Obama ?
Interested to know which ones made it on air ?
Alexandra from Toronto writes :
Very significant for 2 reasons : 1 ) If a personal friend and former staffer in the Clinton administration is not backing Hillary , it shows that there are character flaw issues with the Clintons .
2 ) It will encourage other superdelegates to rally around their obvious front - runner so that they can start fighting the Republicans .
Jed from Chico , California writes :
While it 's easy to overplay the importance of some of these endorsements , this is likely to be the most important endorsement for either side to date .
While I am confident Obama can lead , Bill Richardson was by far the most qualified out of all the candidates on either side .
He was the only Democrat with extensive foreign policy , legislative and executive experience desired in a commander - in - chief .
If anyone was ready to lead on day one with the judgment and experience necessary it was him .
Forget Obama / Clinton .
This year 's Democratic ' Dream Ticket ' is Obama / Richardson .
Allison writes :
Unbelievable !
Clinton wins New Mexico , Richardson gets " 1 % " of the vote , and yet he endorses Obama ?
Not only can he not carry his own state , he goes against the will of the people in New Mexico .
As far as I 'm concerned , Richardson just sold his soul for special favors that will never come to fruition .
Velle from Halifax writes :
I thought it was very significant that Gov Richardson tactfully and subtly challenged Hillary to quit her campaign and pitch in and help the party to defeat McSame and Company .
I see by Hillary 's reply that she still considers herself more important than the party , the country and the people .
Kevin from Sacramento writes :
Jack ,
The endorsement was big , but what I found compelling was Gov. Richardson 's well delivered speech - which dealt with issues ranging from race , to readiness , to personal anecdotes .
In fact , the speech was so good , only Senator Obama could have hoped to follow it .
And , of course , this could not have come at a more important moment for Senator Obama .
My hat is off to the amigo from New Mexico .
John writes :
Jack , Richardson has to lose the beard .
No one will take you seriously if you look like Wolfman Jack .

JAKARTA ( Reuters ) - Indonesia ’s president urged his predominantly Muslim nation on Monday not to use violence in protests at a film on Islam by a right - wing Dutch lawmaker , and said world leaders had a moral responsibility to take action .
Slideshow ( 4 images )
Indonesia has banned broadcasts of the film by Geert Wilders , leader of the Dutch anti-immigration Freedom Party , President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono told a news conference .
“ I also urge that people do not conduct actions such as vandalism , sweeping ( for opponents ) and other violent activities because Islam and other religions never allow these , ” he said .
Yudhoyono called on the Dutch government and parliament to stop broadcasts of the film , which accuses the Koran of inciting violence , and urged international media and Web sites to ignore
Wilders launched his short video “ Fitna ” -- an Arabic term sometimes translated as “ strife ” -- on the Internet last week , drawing condemnation from Muslim nations .
“ I feel world leaders have the moral responsibility to cooperate to prevent and stop such activities as the making of the Fitna film , ” added Yudhoyono , who said the government intended to ban Wilders from visiting Indonesia .
About 50 members of a hardline Indonesian Muslim group held a protest outside the Dutch embassy earlier in the day , some calling for the death of Wilders .
Dozens of police , with two water cannon , did not intervene during the protest by white - clad members of the Islamic Defenders ’
Front , some of whom hurled eggs and plastic water bottles into the compound of the Dutch embassy in Jakarta .
“ I call on Muslims around the world , if you run into the maker of the film , kill him , ” said one speaker at the rally
“ Geert Wilders is a Christian terrorist , ” declared a placard held up by a protester .
“ Kill Geert Wilders , ” read another .
The Front is notorious for its past raids on nightspots the group accused of harboring prostitutes and drug dealers .
In 2003 , the group ’s leader , Mohammad Rizieq Shihab , was jailed for seven months for inciting violence .
Wilders ’ film intersperses images of the September 11 , 2001 attacks on the United States with other Islamist bombings and quotations from the Koran , Islam ’s holy book .
It urges Muslims to tear out “ hate - filled ” verses from the Koran and starts and ends with a cartoon of the Prophet Mohammad with a bomb under his turban , accompanied by a ticking sound
The cartoon , first published in Danish newspapers , ignited violent protests around the world and a boycott of Danish products in 2006 .
Many Muslims regard any depiction of the Prophet as offensive .
Protests against the Dutch film have been small scale in Indonesia , the world ’s most populous Muslim nation and a former Dutch colony .
BEIJING ( Reuters ) - China accused the Dalai Lama on Sunday of using unrest in Tibet to back demands for Tibetan independence ahead of the August Olympic Games in Beijing .
The verbal attack on the exiled Tibetan leader , accused on Saturday of colluding with Muslim Uighur separatists in China ’s western Xinjiang region , was part of an intense propaganda and security drive to stifle anti-Chinese unrest before the Games .
Unrest in Tibet began when Buddhist monks demonstrated in the capital , Lhasa , on March 10 , the 49th anniversary of a failed uprising against Chinese rule , and on subsequent days .
Five days later anti-Chinese rioting shook the city .
Chinese authorities said one policeman and 18 civilians were killed .
Anti-government protests then flared in nearby provinces with large ethnic Tibetan populations , leading to violence in which several people were killed and many injured .
In Sichuan , Gansu and other troubled provinces troops continued conspicuously patrolling the streets of Tibetan towns , and kept schools and Buddhist monasteries under tight guard .
The official Xinhua news agency reported on Sunday that 94 people had been injured in Tibetan areas in Gansu , almost all of them police .
The Dalai Lama , the spiritual leader of Tibetan Buddhism , has in recent days criticized the violence and said he wants talks with China to negotiate autonomy , but not independence , for his homeland .
But the government is intensifying propaganda telling its citizens and the rest of the world that the Dalai Lama , not failings in government policy , caused the trouble in Tibet and accusing him of wanting to ruin the Beijing Olympic Games .
“ We must ... win the final victory in all respects against the secessionist forces to help ensure a successful Olympic Games with a stable social situation in the Tibet Autonomous Region , ” Xinhua quoted Tibet ’s governor , Qiangba Puncog , as saying .
The ruling Chinese Communist Party ’s official newspaper , the People ’s Daily , said on Sunday that the Dalai Lama , winner of the 1989 Nobel Peace Prize , had never abandoned violence after fleeing China in 1959 following a failed revolt against Beijing .
“ The so - called ‘ peaceful non-violence ’ of the Dalai clique is an outright lie from start to end , ” the paper said .
“ ... The Dalai Lama is scheming to take the Beijing Olympics hostage to force the Chinese government to make concessions to Tibet independence . ”

STICKING POINT
Beijing ’s efforts to isolate the Dalai Lama could become a sticking point with Taiwan ’s President - elect Ma Ying - jeou , who said the exiled leader would be welcome on the disputed island , and that an Olympic boycott was possible .
China calls Taiwan a breakaway province that must accept reunification .
“ The Dalai Lama , if he wants to visit Taiwan , he ’d be more than welcome , ” Ma told a news conference in Taipei on Sunday , a day after his landslide election win .
Slideshow ( 14 images )
“ If the situation in Tibet worsens , we would consider the possibility of not sending athletes to the Games , ” said Ma -- who wants closer economic ties and political dialogue with China .
On Saturday the Peoples Daily accused the Dalai Lama of planning attacks with the aid of violent Uighur separatist groups seeking an independent East Turkestan for their largely Muslim people in Xinjiang .
Up to now , most of the ferocious criticism of the Dalai Lama came from the official press in Tibet but others are joining in .
“ Tibet is an inseparable part of China .
In the history of the world there has never been a country or a government that has ever recognized Tibetan independence , ” Ngapoi Ngawang Jigme was quoted by Xinhua as saying on Sunday .
The 86 - year - old is a vice chairman of the Chinese People ’s Political Consultative Conference , the top advisory body to parliament .
He represented Tibet in 1951 , signing the surrender agreement with Beijing a year after Chinese troops took control of Tibet for the Communist winners of China ’s civil war .
China ’s denunciations of the Dalai Lama have drawn applause from many Han Chinese citizens , who have said Western critics fail to appreciate their government ’s efforts to develop Tibet .
But the campaign has begun to draw some domestic critics .
On Saturday , a group of 29 Chinese dissidents urged Beijing to end the bitter propaganda , allow United Nations investigators into Tibet , and open direct dialogue with the Dalai Lama .
Troops have choked off much travel in Tibetan areas and blocked access by foreign reporters , and officials have said they are also guarding against unrest in Xinjiang .
Human infants are born with an innate mathematical ability that allows them to count large numbers of objects more easily than groups of two or three .
A new study of 4.5 month old infants ' " number sense " suggests that emphasizing language before numbers is the wrong way to teach kids about the world .
Babies can figure out when there 's been a change in the number of a large group of objects before they can understand language .
Therefore communicating with toddlers via numbers could become the best way to shape young minds .

The study of babies ' math skills — which did involve silly EEG hats like the one above — also revealed something more general about human brains .
When we look at a group of objects , different parts of our brains process the number of objects and the type of objects .
So we recognize how many duckies there are with a different brain region than the one that recognizes that we are looking at duckies .
Says a release about the study :
Behavioral experiments indicate that infants aged 4 ½ months or older possess an early " number sense " that allows them to detect changes in the number of objects .
However , the neural basis of this ability was previously unknown .
This week in the online journal PLoS Biology , Véronique Izard , Ghislaine Dehaene - Lambertz , and Stanislas Dehaene provide brain imaging evidence showing that very young infants are sensitive to both the number and identity of objects , and these pieces of information are processed by distinct neural pathways .

This cartoon reminds me of many conversations I ’ve had .
Special to The Libertarian Enterprise
I was thinking of my dad the other day , and those thoughts kind of stuck with me .
When I was growing up , I remember whenever he and I did something together , fishing , going to watch him play baseball with his buddies , or even playing catch in the back yard , I had Dad all to myself .
If we went some place , and he wanted to talk to mom , he had to stop at a pay phone , and if mom wanted to talk to him or me , well , she was out of luck .
We did n't have cell phones , and other than Little League , we did n't have organized sports .
Kids had to make up their own games and set their own rules .
After a while you recognized who the leaders were and who the followers were .
Many times it was n't the biggest kid who set the tone for the day  a lot of times a smart small kid could get things going his way .
We played in the streets or in the empty lot on our block .
We built forts and climbed trees , we walked down to the Mississippi , or we rode our bikes down there to fish , and sometimes we just rode around doing nothing but talking to each other .
Here I am in Tallahassee , a city much like the one I grew up in .
Saint Paul was also a State Capital , and both cities have lots of parks , and both are clean .
The big difference I see is that Tallahassee does n't have any children .
Oh , I am sure there are kids here .
It 's just that they are not visible .
Today in America kids do n't play games in the street , and they do n't ride their bikes or walk to the park or the river to fish .
Today everything is organized .
Parents tell me they have their kids in soccer , baseball , and swimming , and marching bands are big down here , but every sport or event is planned and run by adults .
Kids do n't get to pick their teams , and they sure do n't get to make up their own rules .
They do n't even get to transport themselves , because then they would be alone without parental supervision , and they might get hurt .
When I was a child , if I got hurt over at Mikey Kane 's ( my best friend ) house , his mom would patch me up , and if it were bad enough , she would call my mom .
Mikey and I were outside in the summer at least 12 hours a day playing .
The streets and parks were filled with kids doing the same .
Today , children grow up in the presence of adults .
They are not allowed to go off on their own and explore what it is to grow up .
They do n't get to make their own decisions , and they sure do n't get to do anything that might be a little bit dangerous .
Well , we as a country are going to pay for that sometime in the future .
Someday America is going to run out of leaders , because we have stopped our young people from thinking for themselves .
Someday , no one will be around to tell these now adults what to do , and they will be scared .
That is why today so many people are willing to let the government walk all over their freedoms , because they are scared , and they do n't know how to think for themselves .
As more and more of our " protected " children become adults , it will be easier and easier for Washington to take control of everything they do , and those young Americans wo n't even think there is anything wrong , because they have always had some one taking care of them .
Two More Bushes Get High
In compiling the lists of successful people who used illegal drugs for my book I avoided mentioning those in the modern entertainment industry .
The first reason is that the arts are one of the only areas in which the admission of drug use will not cripple a career so the revelations are endless .
( For sample see LINK . )
Second , artists , e.g. rock stars , tend to sensationalize their drug usage to appear wild , crazy , and tormented .
This tends to reinforce the stereotypes rather than break them .
Third , an artist is not considered to have a “ real job ” by much of our populace .
For those reasons I usually do n’t bother noting modern artists .
In this blog entry I am going to make an exception .
As comedian and talk - show host , Bill Maher , pointed out in his 2002 NORML conference address , prominent drug users need to come out of the closet .
As with the early gay movement , recreational drug users cannot overcome negative stereotypes when their successful members hide .
Maher proceeded to out Harrison Ford and Ted Turner in his speech .
While any outing is noteworthy , the most impressive outing I know of is Ashton Kutcher ’s 2003 outing of the twin daughters of President George W. Bush , Jenna and Barbara .
Kitty Kelley , the queen of unauthorized biographies , has investigated influential people – Frank Sinatra , Nancy Reagan , Jackie Onassis , and the Royal Family – and yet she wrote that people were the most fearful to talk about the Bush clan .
Add the fact that First Children are still given relatively gentle treatment by the media and it is unlikely someone was going to out young Jenna and Barbara .
Enter Kutcher .
Kutcher not only outed the Bushettes , but he did it with flair .
In the 2003 Rolling Stone cover story the former underwear model openly revealed his past enjoyment of marijuana .
He also described attending a Los Angeles Nike party in the early 2000s in which Jenna and Barbara were in attendance .
Despite the fact his friend lewdly commented , “ I ’d fucking nail the shit out of that bitch ! , ” in earshot of Secret Service agents , the Bush girls still inquired what Kutcher was doing after the party .
Everyone ended up at Kutcher ’s afterwards .
Kutcher revealed that the Bushes engaged in underage - drinking in his abode with the Secret Service right outside .
At one point he went upstairs to his aforementioned friend ’s room and in his words :
… I can smell the green wafting out under his door .
I open the door , and there he is smoking out the Bush twins on his hookah .
As usual , when a celebrity says something “ too ” honest their public relations staff has to then attempt obfuscation .
In this case , Kutcher ’s spokeswoman said he was not contrite about the outing because “ he did n’t say what was being smoked or who was doing the smoking .
” Her statement is comical to anyone familiar with marijuana parlance .
( For you east coasters , “ smoking out ” is the equivalent of “ smoking up . ” )
George W. Bush smoked marijuana and now his daughters have as well .
There is nothing wrong with this , of course , except for Bush ’s hypocrisy .
Bush has a horrible record regarding marijuana tolerance .
Despite promising in 2000 to respect states ’ independence in determining marijuana policy , he has done the exact opposite , in fact the federal government under Bush has done everything in its power to prevent other countries from giving marijuana users greater liberty .

There ’s no end to the trading scams that plague foreign exchange ( forex ) traders who are too willing to believe the unbelievable .
Nearly all of them could be avoided by even the most inexperienced FX traders if they kept this simple rule in mind :
If it sounds too good to be true , it probably IS too good to be true .
Unfortunately , far too many people forget those words when greed takes over their common sense .
According to the United States Commodity Futures Trading Commission ( CFTC ) , the U.S. government agency that is charge regulating commodity futures and options markets in the United States , there has been a marked increase in FX trading scams in the last couple of years and they expect those numbers to keep rising as more and more investors discover the Foreign Exchange market .
One of the most common trading scams involves the promise of easy or fast money .
These promises take many forms but they all have one thing in common theyre lies , and they frequently go something like this :
I ’ll show you how to make thousands of dollars every week , guaranteed !
“ Our secret method outperforms 90 % of all domestic investments ! ”
“ There are no bear markets in Forex .
You ca n’t lose !
“ Make a 30 - 40 % rate of return , every month , we guarantee it !
These are the kinds of claims that people are receiving in their snail mail and e-mail every day .
Worse , thousands of people actually fall for these scams .
These scams usually come attached to offers including :
Forex Trading Ebooks
Many of Forex trading ebooks claim to offer “ FX Training ” or some Perfect Forex Trading System .
These are nothing but a scam .
They often have a big price tag too .
Avoid at all costs !
Forex Trading Forecast
Many traders would like you to believe they are so good at predicting the forex market , you should pay to hear their predictions !
These are complete nonsense and should be avoided .
Currency Trading Signals
These are similar to forex forecasts , except they actually send you a FX Trading Signal signal via email , sms etc telling you to place a trade .
It is my view that these are often setup by people who can not trade profitably and have moved their efforts to selling signals .
Many of these companies have their past performance on their website .
In my experience , most of the past performance claims are complete nonsense .
Also , let ’s look at it from their point of view , they can come up with a fx trading system and let people pay them to see if it works or not on a live account .
Not a bad deal for them , huh ?
These can also be known as “ Forex Alerts ” or “ Forex Services ” .
Currency Trading Seminars and FX Training
Let ’s do an FX Trading seminar ?
Does n’t that sound appealing .
Do the Seminar and then be able to go and make money trading FX .
Most of the time , it does n’t quite work like that .
I am not saying all FX training programs are scams , but certainly the vast majority of them are .
They can be extremely expensive too !
Save your money for your currency trading account !
I have seen many claim to be the “ Top Forex Trading course ” , often costing several thousand dollars .
Many of these FX Courses do not teach anything that is not freely available online at forex trading sites like this .
Managed Forex Account Scam
Many Managed Forex Accounts are scams .
They are offered by traders who know they cannot successfully .
In other words they suck .
They market their forex managed accounts offering high returns to hopeless investors .
They can trade other peoples money at no risk to themselves .
Sometimes they even get paid for each trader they make regardless if it wins or loses , encouraging them to make more trades .
Not all Forex Managed Accounts are scams , but the vast majority are .
If you want to invest , do thorough due diligence .
Other things to look out for :
FX traders who will manage your trades for you .
All you do is send them money .
FX Traders who reveal their insider secrets to you when you buy their e-book or sign up for their training course .
FX traders who sell foolproof software trading platforms , or manual systems that make all of the decisions for you .
Even the most proficient FX traders in the world rarely end up on the winning end of a trade more than 65 % of the time , with 45 % being the norm .
This means that anyone who is claiming higher success rates , especially in the range of 90 % or better , should start smelling funny to you the moment you read their claims .
Secondly , if there were traders who were able to achieve such magnificent results , why in the world would they even think about selling those secrets to the average trader ?
They could simply utilize their secrets every day and become billionaires by year ’s end .
Are you starting to smell anything suspicious yet ?
You should be .
There is another type of FX trading scam that is not so easy to spot , unfortunately .
And that ’s because these scammers do not make outrageous claims .
They simply go about methodically stealing your money once they get their hands on it .
Well , not always stealing it directly , but defrauding you of it nonetheless .
Here ’s an excellent case in point :
In October 2005 a brokerage house named Refco , arguably the largest and most esteemed FX broker in the world , filed bankruptcy after the CEO became involved in a billion - dollar scandal that , when exposed , brought the company to its financial knees and ultimately destroyed it .
Now , even though none of that billion dollars belonged to the over 17,000 investors who had accounts with Refco , they lost every penny in their investment accounts nonetheless .
Here ’s how that happened .
As the case wound its way through the bankruptcy courts , some of the largest creditors , including big names like Bank of America and others , succeeded in convincing the bankruptcy court that those 17,000 + customers were actually unsecured creditors and they would have to stand in line behind all of the secured creditors in order to get at least some of their money back .
The problem was , of course , there was n’t enough money to pay both the secured and unsecured creditors , so these 17,000 + traders , people just like you and me , lost it all in minutes after the decision by the court was affirmed .
This was able to occur because Refco did not segregate their investors accounts from their general funds and , as a result , these accounts were not protected from creditors .
And the rest , as they say , is history .
I hope that this article has helped you develop your nose for scams and that you ’ll always ask questions , the right questions , before you invest in the FX market .
Kripalu Maharaj the First Jagadguru in over 700 Years
Kripalu Maharaj was born into a highly respected Bramin family in the village of Mangarth , near the city of Allahabad , on the Sharat Poornima , the night of the full moon , in October of 1922 .
For Hindus , Sharat Poornima is the time when Krisna and Shri Raseshwari Raha Rani are thought to have revealed the true bliss of Vrindavan on a night some 5000 years ago .
Kripalu Maharaj is only the 5th personality in the last 2500 years , and the first in over 700 years to be accorded the status of Supreme Jagadguru , ‘ world teacher , ’ or ‘ master of masters . ’
His followers hold that his spiritual stature and divine personality are beyond the understanding of the material mind , and that his divinity can never be comprehended abstractly , but only by direct experience through his presence .
He is known to his adoring devotees as Shri Maharaji Ji , and at 81 years of age , Kripalu Maharaj still takes an active role in teaching the devotional philosophy of Bhakti yoga to thousands of adoring followers in northern India and throughout the world .
According to his followers , Kripalu Maharaj belongs to a special category of saints that are called rasik saints .
The personalities of these rasik saints is such that they are viewed as the most loving and intimate manifestations of the divine self , and to experience their presence is to experience the dissolution of all formalities into pure and all encompassing divine love .
From the time of his birth and while he was growing up , Kripalu Maharaj impressed others with his unique and virtuous being .
At the age of 14 , he traveled to Indore for the purpose of studying Sanskrit literature .
Once in Indore , Kripalu Maharaj astounded his teachers by mastering all of his subjects in just two years .
He left Indore at the age of 16 , in a state of divinely absorbed consciousness and walked to Chitakroot and Sharbang .
Everywhere Kripalu Maharaj went , people saw the physical expressions of his Bhao consciousness , the state of divine ecstasy , and invited him into their homes , where he stayed sometimes for hours and sometimes for days , but all the while , always in the Bhao state .
From Citrakoot and Sharbang , Kripalu Maharaj traveled on the Mahoba and to Jhansi .
Everyplace he went , everyone who encountered him experienced the manifestation of his loving being and glimpsed through his being his divine state of consciousness .
Guest : Legal journalist Mark Joseph Stern on Amy Coney Barrett : Also : GA SoS orders pre-election testing stopped on new , touchscreen voting systems after major errors found affecting all 159 counties ...
If you have n't already heard about the huge news regarding Donald Trump 's taxes , I strongly recommend you go read it , because it 's quite stunning .
And yet , we did n't have enough time on today 's BradCast to more than wave at that news at the top of the show .
That 's because the news at the U.S. Supreme Court is about to change this nation for a generation , according to our guest today , and perhaps forever .
And not for the better .
Also , we 've got news that broke late Friday night out of Georgia that you almost certainly have n't heard about , but that is jaw - dropping and could result in an absolute disaster for every voter who chooses to vote at the polls in all 159 counties in the key battleground state this year .
[ Audio link to full show follows below . ]
So , with that encouraging warm up , we turn first to the weekend 's nomination of Judge Amy Coney Barrett by Donald Trump to become the sixth rightwing justice on the U.S. Supreme Court following the recent death of progressive icon Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg .
Before Ginsburg was even buried ( her funeral is scheduled later this week ) , Trump wasted no time in naming Barrett , a proud disciple of the late Justice Antonin Scalia , to the high court .
That as more than 20 states are already voting in this year 's Presidential election .
No nominee has ever been named this close to a Presidential election , and Republicans vow to have her seated before Election Day , even though they refused to even give Barack Obama 's nominee , Merrick Garland , a hearing after Scalia died almost 300 days before the 2016 election .
Republicans claimed at the time that " the American people should have a voice in the selection of their next Supreme Court Justice , " since voting had already begun in the primaries that year .
At the same time , as multiple polls make clear , huge majorities of Americans believe whoever is elected in November should be the one to name the next Justice to SCOTUS .
While disingenuous , duplicitous , dishonest , hypocritical Republicans lied in 2016 about that , they could n't care less in 2020 .
So they are planning to ram Barrett through the confirmation process as quickly as possible , according to our guest today , Slate 's great legal reporter MARK JOSEPH STERN , so that she will be seated in time for the Court to throw the election to Trump as needed .
" Donald Trump has selected her for the express purpose of handing him the election by nullifying enough Democratic votes to secure him a second term , " Stern makes clear at the outset .
" He has said that out loud on multiple occasions .
We have every reason to believe that was his chief criterion in selecting Barrett . "
Beyond that , as to what Barrett 's vote on the Court on other issues will mean for this nation , for health care , for abortion rights , for gun rights , for voting rights , for the environment , for LGBTQ rights , for immigration rights and much more , Stern pulls no punches today .
The outlook is bleak .
Very bleak .
" She is going to allow states to ban abortion , to punish and prosecute women who terminate their pregnancies , and even to let Congress ban abortion nationwide so that no state can give people access to the procedure , " Stern details in his no-uncertain - terms litany of what Americans can expect under a 6 to 3 Court led by Barrett .
" She isis against almost any kind of gun control law , including basic gun safety laws that keep violent criminals from obtaining firearms .
...
She does not believe in the right to vote .
She believes that states should be able to strip individuals of their right to participate in democracy for arbitrary and discriminatory reasons .
...
She does not support LGBTQ equality .
She rejects the idea of same - sex marriage .
She does not even believe it 's real marriage , so far as we can tell .
...
She is going to strip our federal laws of all environmental and labor regulations that have any effect .
She is going to abolish the federal government 's ability to regulate carbon emissions , mercury , lead , to protect workers from labor exploitation , " he explains before summing up : " She is going to remake this entire country 's law in a way that might satisfy a robber baron of the 1800s , but will make every one else feel --- rightly --- like they 're living in the dark ages . "
Other than that , she 's great !
Actually , that 's just a partial list of what he says should be expected if / when she is confirmed .
But he 's equally clear about what he sees as the only way that Democrats --- and the nation itself --- can now be preserved .
And that is the expansion of the Supreme Court with the addition of 4 more seats to restore the Court majority to liberals who should rightly have it after the GOP stole the Court majority from them in 2016 .
Presuming Dems take the White House and Senate majority this year , Stern argues : " Nothing else the Democrats do is going to matter if they do n't begin here first .
This is it .
This is the test .
If Democrats fail this , there might not be any coming back from it . "
Would such a " radical " move make things worse ?
Will it lead to an endless cycle of SCOTUS Wars and the delegitimization of the Court itself ?
Stern speaks to all of that and much more today .
Please tune in .
Then , the news that you almost certainly have n't heard out of Georgia .
On Friday night , the Secretary of State 's office informed elections officials in all 159 counties that they should immediately stop pre-election testing of the state 's brand - new , $ 100 million , unverifiable touch - screen Ballot Marking Device ( BMD ) voting system due to what Election Director Chris Harvey described in an email as " an error in the November database which will require every county to get a new database for the November 3 , 2020 election . "
" I am very sorry to have to tell you this , " Harvey continued , somewhat understating how serious this matter is .
" I know that everyone is working as hard as they can to be prepared .
We will do everything we can to minimize the delay this will cause .
I will give you an update Monday on any ETA for your new database . "
While it 's still unclear when the corrected databases ( or whatever the problem actually is ) will be available , the Coalition for Good Governance , which has a long - running federal lawsuit to block the use of the state 's new unveriflable touchscreen voting systems --- which every voter in the state is forced to use at the polling place , instead of safer , verifiable , hand - marked paper ballots --- filed a motion on Friday night explaining to the court that it is simply too late to properly test the 80,000 or so separate pieces of the system , as required by law , before Early Voting begins in two weeks .
" [ U ] nder the current plan , " the Coalition spells out in the filing , pre-election " Logic and Accuracy testing is required for 34,000 touchscreens , 34,000 BMD [ Ballot Marking Device ] printers , 8,600 pollPads [ electronic pollbooks ] , 3,800 precinct scanners , and 175 high volume mail ballot scanners , " adding that " A far more manageable , realistic , and safe solution for an orderly and defensible November election is to use hand marked paper ballots instead of the BMD touchscreens and printers , while maintaining a single BMD in every polling place for accessibility needs , to satisfy the requirements of HAVA [ the federal Help America Vote Act ] . "
The federal judge who found the state 's previous , 20 - year old touchscreen systems to be unsecure , unverifiable and , therefore , unconstitutional , is set to make a ruling at any moment on whether the new systems are equally unconstitutional and should be banned like the old ones were last year .
She called all the parties in the case to an emergency hearing on Monday following Friday 's stunning news , placing into question whether the state will be able to use the systems at all this November .
We will have much more on this disturbing story as it develops in coming days .
But this is just another reason why it is insane to use these types of systems in any election , much less the most critical one in this nation 's history .
In addition to the entire state of Georgia --- a key battleground state this year --- similar unverifiable touchscreen Ballot Marking Device systems are being used for the first time this year in many of the most Democratic - leaning counties in key battleground states including Pennsylvania , Ohio , North Carolina and Texas , among others , not to mention Los Angeles County in California , the most populous voting jurisdiction in the nation ...

A Fox affiliate managed to get ahold of the TSA 's raw data on luggage theft on their watch and is reporting that a whopping $ 31 million worth of valuables disappeared from the aviation system in the past three years .
Many of these items went missing from within suitcases , pilfered in transit after the TSA inaugurated its no -locks policy on checked bags .
Now that 's security .
A former KCI baggage handler , who asked us not to identify her , said she knows theft happens even in Kansas City .
" There was never anybody who said I did that , " said the baggage handler .
" But there was always talk .
So and so found something in a bag .
Shoes were one .
Another one was perfumes , really expensive brands . "
She said the best time for luggage to be tampered with is when it's in the baggage hold area .
That 's where it is stored before it 's loaded onto the plane .
" You will have one person down there and all they are doing is transferring bags to different carts , " said the former baggage handler .
" It only takes one person .
So you would just be in a room by yourself . "
She said one way to get away with the crime was to rifle through a bag and then put it on the wrong plane headed to the wrong city .
When the luggage is finally located , it would be unclear where the crime took place .

MARCH 7 - 9 , 2008 in Washington , D.C. : NCOR
National Conference on Organized Resistance MARCH 10 to 12 , 2008 ( Monday to Wednesday ) in Washington , D.C. : Stop - Loss Congress
This March , while tens of thousands of Americans in Washington , D.C. , and all over the United States will be participating in acts of nonviolent civil resistance to protest the ongoing occupations of Iraq and Afghanistan , and involuntarily deployed U.S. soldiers and innocent civilian victims will begin another year of occupation , torture , and murder , U.S. congress members will be on vacation ( from the 15th to 30th , technically a " district work period " ) , ignoring the killing and suffering they have enabled , supported , and financed .
To intensify the irony , Congress has condoned a widespread stop - loss policy in the military which requires soldiers to involuntarily extend their tours and prolong the killing .
It is time to Stop - Loss Congress !
On Monday March 10 , and Tuesday March 11 , we will deliver " official " stop - loss notices to all members of Congress in their Capitol Hill offices .
These will notify them that all of their LEAVES , VACATIONS and HOME VISITS HAVE BEEN CANCELLED until further notice .
Just as they require that active - duty personnel endure involuntary extensions of their tours of duty , we , the people for whom they work , are notifying them that they , too , will have their tours of duty INVOLUNTARILY EXTENDED until every foreign soldier and mercenary is out of Iraq , and home .
When all the troops and contractors get home , then Congress can go home , and no sooner .
This is a typical condition due to the fact that children are so commonly pushing their backs that they create against the back of their head with best baby flat head pillow .
Another idea to aid stop flat head syndrome is to make use of a support pillow when baby is seated in a service provider , baby bouncer , swing , etc .
Considering that baby is relaxing her head against a soft pillow instead of a tough seat back , there is less pressure being put on the rear of her head .
This is also because of exactly how soft baby 's skull is so pressure on any kind of area can alter the shape of baby 's head .

I ’m putting together a small suite of tests of things that break in Python 3 , and ways around it .
Specifically , I ’m trying to see if it is possible to write code that runs both in Python 2.6 and Python 3.0 .
The answer so far is a resounding No !
But this is because only one thing : u ” is n’t recognized in Python 3 .
A quick explanation of the problem :
In Python 2.5 , there are two “ stringy ” types , str and unicode .
The first one used for 8 - bit strings and 8 - bit binary data , the second for unicode strings .
You differ between the two by marking the second type with a u in front , hence a unicode string is u’string ’ .
In Python 3 , all strings are unicode .
Hence , there is no need for the u ” syntax to separate unicode strings from normal strings .
Instead it has a byte - type , used for 8 - bit binary data .
These are separated by having a b in front of the byte type , b’data ’ .
Python 2.6 allows b ” syntax as forwards compatibility .
b’ data ’ is jst the same as just writing ‘ data ’ in Python 2.6 .
So in 2.6 , both ‘ string ’ , b’data ’ and u’unicode ’ is valid code .
However , in Python 3 , u ” fails , which means that any 2.6 code that uses unicode will fail under 3.0 .
Should we care ?
I mean , we are not supposed to write code that runs under both 2.6 and 3.0 .
Instead we are supposed to write code that works under 2.6 and the convert it to 3.0 .
Yeah , we are supposed to .
This is correct .
But I ’ve been doing some tests , and the fact is , most straight python - code will run under both 2.6 and 3.0 .
The major hurdle is that the lack of u ” support in 3.0 means that you ca n’t use unicode .
OK , it ’s possible to get around .
You can do this trick :
try : u = unicode except NameError : u = str text = u ( " This is unicode " )
This runs under both 2.x and 3.0 .
But it ’s pretty ugly .
And this way it ’s impossible to have anything else than ascii in the string , as the line u( “ Här har vi unicode ” ) will in 2.6 attempt to convert the text - string “ Här har vi unicode ” to unicode with the ascii-encoding , which will fail .
Result :
It ’s practically impossible to get an application that needs unicode to run under both 2.6 and 3.0 unless you do the above ugly trick everywhere .
And this is in fact pretty much the only hurdle .
Others , as the print statement , turns out to not be a problem .
print ( “ Hey , this works like %s ” % something ) works fine under both .
The new “ as ” syntax when catching exceptions is supported in 2.6 , and so on .
The things that does need a bit of special code that I have found so far is imports of renamed modules ( like StringIO ) , and special casing of iterkeys ( ) , xrange ( ) if you really need them , and so on .
But so far , the code that I typically write would be easily adaptable to run under both 2.6 and 3.0 , except for the fact that I use unicode a lot , and that wo n’t work .
So , PLEASE , allow the u’text ’ syntax in Python 3.0 .
If you do , all my compatibility worries are gone .
You can get rid of it in 3.1 if you must .
THE importation of laser pointers is likely to be outlawed after six flights into Sydney were thrown into chaos .
The federal Minister for Home Affairs , Bob Debus , said the powerful beams should be treated as a serious weapon .
Mr Debus said yesterday the co-ordinated attack using four green lasers on Friday - which forced air - traffic controllers to change the flight paths of the six aircraft - was very serious .
Penalties for offenders would be increased .
" The use of these laser pointers against aeroplanes is unbelievably stupid and cannot be tolerated , " Mr Debus said .
" It 's obvious that we cannot tolerate this sort of use of these devices when they obviously bring so much potential danger to the lives of aircraft passengers . "

Subject : Fresh as the moment when the pod went pop ! ... as the slogan for Birds Eye peas in the 1970s used to go .
This Del Monte film from 1939 still looks good even after all these years .
Granted the domestic scenes are amusing , as they differ somewhat from modern so - called ' sensibilities ' , and the father is so incredibly stilted and hammy in his grimacing delivery ... but WOW !
a magic book that zooms you into a whole World of Pea - dom .
I 'd sit through 5 mins of happy family guff any day of the week to get to the other 15 mins of the film , and it makes you wish there was a whole series of shorts with the magic book variously whisking you off to look at Del Monte tinned peaches or pineapple chunks for instance ...
The harvesting scenes are very dated indeed - pitchforks ! - and it's good that something once so banal and commonplace has been preserved on film for us to now marvel at its oddity .
As mentioned , the narration is rather fruity and overwritten -' aluminum prairie schooners ' [ whatever one of those might be ] , 'mr & mrs pea must be thinking life is one long rumba dance by now ...' , that sort of thing ... but you know , I kind of like it - it adds warmth and nostalgic charm .
Where this film really excels though is the pea sorting footage .
Just about every conceivable form of machine is used to shake , wash , separate , grade , float , channel , mix , convey the peas into the waiting hands of the manual sorters with their eagle eyes and little vacuum tubes .
This film is a real joy , and the parts of it that seem odd to our jaded modern eyes are precisely what makes it so charming and worthy of watching .
It reminds me more than a little of many ' through the round window ' industrial silent shorts that used to crop up on 1970s childrens TV which I used to love and miss profoundly .

Subject : Absurdism in everyday reviews
While everything is absurd in an era of total absurdism , the dinner scene depicted in this infomercial ( which is essentially what it was , lacking only the hard sell ) was typical of an American dinner table and conversation from practically the founding of the country to the mid 1960s .
It is impossible to believe now , but families used to sit down at least once a day and actually TALK to each other , sometimes for up to an hour .
Parents were even able ( and permitted ) to help in their children 's education .
An encyclopedia in the living room or den was as common in the last century as an iPod in the pocket is now .
It is perhaps worth considering that these films were made to appeal to the people of the era when the film was made .
To do that they had to depict people and situations that the normal people of the time could relate to .
Much as commercials and movies depict the mayhem and war zone that is modern America today so that we can believe that we are seeing realistic situations and will go out and buy the sponsor 's products .
- August 4 , 2006 Absurdism in everyday reviews
Beginning in England in the 17th century , the European world was stricken by what looks , in today 's terms , like an epidemic of depression .
The disease attacked both young and old , plunging them into months or years of morbid lethargy and relentless terrors , and seemed - perhaps only because they wrote more and had more written about them - to single out men of accomplishment and genius .
The puritan writer John Bunyan , the political leader Oliver Cromwell , the poets Thomas Gray and John Donne , and the playwright and essayist Samuel Johnson are among the earliest and best - known victims .
To the medical profession , the illness presented a vexing conundrum , not least because its gravest outcome was suicide .
In 1733 , Dr George Cheyne speculated that the English climate , combined with sedentary lifestyles and urbanisation , " have brought forth a class of distemper with atrocious and frightful symptoms , scarce known to our ancestors , and never rising to such fatal heights , and afflicting such numbers in any known nation .
These nervous disorders being computed to make almost one - third of the complaints of the people of condition in England . "
To the English , the disease was " the English malady " .
But the rainy British Isles were not the only site visited by the disease ; all of Europe was afflicted .
The disease grew increasingly prevalent over the course of the 20th century , when relatively sound statistics first became available , and this increase cannot be accounted for by a greater willingness on the part of physicians and patients to report it .
Rates of schizophrenia , panic disorders and phobias did not rise at the same time , for example , as they would be expected to if only changes in the reporting of mental illness were at work .
According to the World Health Organisation , depression is now the fifth leading cause of death and disability in the world , while ischemic heart disease trails in sixth place .
Fatalities occur most dramatically through suicide , but even the mild form of depression - called dysthemia and characterised by an inability to experience pleasure - can kill by increasing a person 's vulnerability to serious somatic illnesses such as cancer and heart disease .
Far from being an affliction of the famous and successful , we now know that the disease strikes the poor more often than the rich , and women more commonly than men .
Just in the past few years , hundreds of books , articles and television specials have been devoted to depression : its toll on the individual , its relationship to gender , the role of genetic factors , the efficacy of pharmaceutical treatments .
But to my knowledge , no one has suggested that the epidemic may have begun in a particular historical time , and started as a result of cultural circumstances that arose at that time and have persisted or intensified since .
The failure to consider historical roots may stem , in part , from the emphasis on the celebrity victims of the past , which tends to discourage a statistical , or epidemiological , perspective .
But if there was , in fact , a beginning to the epidemic of depression , sometime in the 16th or 17th century , it confronts us with this question : could this apparent decline in the ability to experience pleasure be in any way connected with the decline in opportunities for pleasure , such as carnival and other traditional festivities ?
There is reason to think that something like an epidemic of depression in fact began around 1600 , or the time when the Anglican minister Robert Burton undertook his " anatomy " of the disease , published as The Anatomy of Melancholy in 1621 .
Melancholy , as it was called until the 20th century , is of course a very ancient problem , and was described in the fifth century BC by Hippocrates .
Chaucer 's 14th - century characters were aware of it , and late - medieval churchmen knew it as " acedia " .
So melancholy , in some form , had always existed - and , regrettably , we have no statistical evidence of a sudden increase in early modern Europe , which had neither a psychiatric profession to do the diagnosing nor a public health establishment to record the numbers of the afflicted .
All we know is that in the 1600s and 1700s , medical books about melancholy and literature with melancholic themes were both finding an eager audience , presumably at least in part among people who suffered from melancholy themselves .
Increasing interest in melancholy is not , however , evidence of an increase in the prevalence of actual melancholy .
As the historian Roy Porter suggested , the disease may simply have been becoming more stylish , both as a medical diagnosis and as a problem , or pose , affected by the idle rich , and signifying a certain ennui or detachment .
No doubt the medical prejudice that it was a disease of the gifted , or at least of the comfortable , would have made it an attractive diagnosis to the upwardly mobile and merely out - of - sorts .
But melancholy did not become a fashionable pose until a full century after Burton took up the subject , and when it did become stylish , we must still wonder : why did this particular stance or attitude become fashionable and not another ?
An arrogant insouciance might , for example , seem more fitting to an age of imperialism than this wilting , debilitating malady ; and enlightenment , another well - known theme of the era , might have been better served by a mood of questing impatience .
Nor can we be content with the claim that the apparent epidemic of melancholy was the cynical invention of the men who profited by writing about it , since some of these were self - identified sufferers themselves .
Robert Burton confessed , " I writ of melancholy , by being busy to avoid melancholy . "
George Cheyne was afflicted , though miraculously cured by a vegetarian diet of his own devising .
The Englishman John Brown , who published a bestselling mid-19th - century book on the subject , went on to commit suicide .
Something was happening , from about 1600 on , to make melancholy a major concern of the reading public , and the simplest explanation is that there was more melancholy around to be concerned about .
And very likely the phenomena of this early " epidemic of depression " and the suppression of communal rituals and festivities are entangled in various ways .
It could be , for example , that , as a result of their illness , depressed individuals lost their taste for communal festivities and even came to view them with revulsion .
But there are other possibilities .
First , that both the rise of depression and the decline of festivities are symptomatic of some deeper , underlying psychological change , which began about 400 years ago and persists , in some form , in our own time .
The second , more intriguing possibility is that the disappearance of traditional festivities was itself a factor contributing to depression .
One approaches the subject of " deeper , underlying psychological change " with some trepidation , but fortunately , in this case , many respected scholars have already visited this difficult terrain .
" Historians of European culture are in substantial agreement , " Lionel Trilling wrote in 1972 , " that in the late 16th and early 17th centuries , something like a mutation in human nature took place . "
This change has been called the rise of subjectivity or the discovery of the inner self and since it can be assumed that all people , in all historical periods , have some sense of selfhood and capacity for subjective reflection , we are really talking about an intensification , and a fairly drastic one , of the universal human capacity to face the world as an autonomous " I " , separate from , and largely distrustful of , " them " .
The European nobility had already undergone this sort of psychological shift in their transformation from a warrior class to a collection of courtiers , away from directness and spontaneity and toward a new guardedness in relation to others .
In the late 16th and 17th centuries , the change becomes far more widespread , affecting even artisans , peasants , and labourers .
The new " emphasis on disengagement and selfconsciousness " , as Louis Sass puts it , makes the individual potentially more autonomous and critical of existing social arrange - ments , which is all to the good .
But it can also transform the individual into a kind of walled fortress , carefully defended from everyone else .
Historians infer this psychological shift from a number of concrete changes occurring in the early modern period , first and most strikingly among the urban bourgeoisie , or upper middle class .
Mirrors in which to examine oneself become popular among those who can afford them , along with self - portraits ( Rembrandt painted more than 50 of them ) and autobiographies in which to revise and elaborate the image that one has projected to others .
In bourgeois homes , public spaces that guests may enter are differentiated , for the first time , from the private spaces - bedrooms , for example - in which one may retire to let down one 's guard and truly " be oneself " .
More decorous forms of entertainment - plays and operas requiring people to remain immobilised , each in his or her separate seat - begin to provide an alternative to the promiscuously interactive and physically engaging pleasures of carnival .
The very word " self " , as Trilling noted , ceases to be a mere reflexive or intensifier and achieves the status of a freestanding noun , referring to some inner core , not readily visible to others .
The notion of a self hidden behind one 's appearance and portable from one situation to another is usually attributed to the new possibility of upward mobility .
In medieval culture , you were what you appeared to be - a peasant , a man of commerce or an aristocrat - and any attempt to assume another status would have been regarded as rank deception .
But in the late 16th century , upward mobility was beginning to be possible or at least imaginable , making " deception " a widespread way of life .
You might not be a lord or a lofty burgher , but you could find out how to act like one .
Hence the popularity , in 17th - century England , of books instructing the would - be member of the gentry in how to comport himself , write an impressive letter and choose a socially advantageous wife .
Hence , too , the new fascination with the theatre , with its notion of an actor who is different from his or her roles .
This is a notion that takes some getting used to ; in the early years of the theatre , actors who played the part of villains risked being assaulted by angry playgoers in the streets .
Within the theatre , there is a fascination with plots involving further deceptions : Shakespeare 's Portia pretends to be a doctor of law ; Rosalind disguises herself as a boy ; Juliet feigns her own death .
Writing a few years after Shakespeare 's death , Burton bemoaned the fact that acting was no longer confined to the theatre , for " men like stage - players act [ a ] variety of parts " .
It was painful , in his view , " to see a man turn himself into all shapes like a Chameleon ... to act twenty parts & persons at once for his advantage ... having a several face , garb , & character , for every one he meets " .
The inner self that can change costumes and manners to suit the occasion resembles a skilled craftsperson , too busy and watchful for the pleasures of easygoing conviviality .
As for the outer self projected by the inner one into the social world : who would want to " lose oneself " in the communal excitement of carnival when that self has taken so much effort and care to construct ?
So highly is the " inner self " honoured within our own culture that its acquisition seems to be an unquestionable mark of progress - a requirement , as Trilling called it , for " the emergence of modern European and American man " .
It was , no doubt , this sense of individuality and personal autonomy , " of an untrammelled freedom to ask questions and explore " , as the historian Yi-Fu Tuan put it , that allowed men such as Martin Luther and Galileo to risk their lives by defying Catholic doctrine .
Which is preferable : a courageous , or even merely grasping and competitive , individualism , versus a medieval ( or , in the case of non-European cultures , " primitive " ) personality so deeply mired in community and ritual that it can barely distinguish a " self " ?
From the perspective of our own time , the choice , so stated , is obvious .
We have known nothing else .
But there was a price to be paid for the buoyant individualism we associate with the more upbeat aspects of the early modern period , the Renaissance and Enlightenment .
As Tuan writes , " the obverse " of the new sense of personal autonomy is " isolation , loneliness , a sense of disengagement , a loss of natural vitality and of innocent pleasure in the givenness of the world , and a feeling of burden because reality has no meaning other than what a person chooses to impart to it " .
Now if there is one circumstance indisputably involved in the etiology of depression , it is precisely this sense of isolation .
As the 19th - century French sociologist Emile Durkheim saw it , " Originally society is everything , the individual nothing ...
But gradually things change .
As societies become greater in volume and density , individual differences multiply , and the moment approaches when the only remaining bond among the members of a single human group will be that they are all [ human ] . "
The flip side of the heroic autonomy that is said to represent one of the great achievements of the early modern and modern eras is radical isolation and , with it , depression and sometimes death .
But the new kind of personality that arose in 16th - and 17th - century Europe was by no means as autonomous and self - defining as claimed .
For far from being detached from the immediate human environment , the newly self - centered individual is continually preoccupied with judging the expectations of others and his or her own success in meeting them : " How am I doing ? " this supposedly autonomous " self " wants to know .
" What kind of an impression am I making ? "
It is no coincidence that the concept of society emerges at the same time as the concept of self .
What seems most to concern the new and supposedly autonomous self is the opinion of others , who in aggregate compose " society " .
Mirrors , for example , do not show us our " selves " , only what others can see , and autobiographies reveal only what we want those others to know .
The crushing weight of other people 's judgments - imagined or real - would help explain the frequent onset of depression at the time of a perceived or anticipated failure .
In the 19th century , the historian Janet Oppenheim reports , " severely depressed patients frequently revealed totally unwarranted fears of financial ruin or the expectation of professional disgrace " .
This is not autonomy but dependency : the emerging " self " defines its own worth in terms of the perceived judgments of others .
If depression was one result of the new individualism , the usual concomitant of depression - anxiety - was surely another .
It takes effort , as well as a great deal of watchfulness , to second - guess other people 's reactions and plot one 's words and gestures accordingly .
For the scheming courtier , the striving burgher and the ambitious lawyer or cleric of early modern Europe , the " self " they discovered is perhaps best described as an awareness of this ceaseless , internal effort to adjust one 's behaviour to the expectations of others .
Play in this context comes to have a demanding new meaning , unconnected to pleasure , as in " playing a role " .
No wonder bourgeois life becomes privatised in the 16th and 17th centuries , with bedrooms and studies to withdraw to , where , for a few hours a day , the effort can be abandoned , the mask set aside .
But we cannot grasp the full psychological impact of this " mutation in human nature " in purely secular terms .
Four hundred - even 200 - years ago , most people would have interpreted their feelings of isolation and anxiety through the medium of religion , translating self as " soul " ; the ever - watchful judgmental gaze of others as " God " ; and melancholy as " the gnawing fear of eternal damnation " .
Catholicism offered various palliatives to the disturbed and afflicted , in the form of rituals designed to win divine forgiveness or at least diminished disapproval ; and even Lutheranism , while rejecting most of the rituals , posited an approachable and ultimately loving God .
Not so with the Calvinist version of Protestantism .
Instead of offering relief , Calvinism provided a metaphysical framework for depression : if you felt isolated , persecuted and possibly damned , this was because you actually were .
John Bunyan seems to have been a jolly enough fellow in his youth , much given to dancing and sports in the village green , but with the onset of his religious crisis these pleasures had to be put aside .
Dancing was the hardest to relinquish - " I was a full year before I could quite leave it " - but he eventually managed to achieve a fun - free life .
In Bunyan 's Pilgrim 's Progress , carnival is the portal to Hell , just as pleasure in any form - sexual , gustatory , convivial - is the devil 's snare .
Nothing speaks more clearly of the darkening mood , the declining possibilities for joy , than the fact that , while the medieval peasant created festivities as an escape from work , the Puritan embraced work as an escape from terror .
We do not have to rely on psychological inference to draw a link between Calvinism and depression .
There is one clear marker for depression - suicide - and suicide rates have been recorded , with varying degrees of diligence , for centuries .
In his classic study , Durkheim found that Protestants in the 19th century - not all of whom , of course , were of the Calvinistic persuasion - were about twice as likely to take their own lives as Catholics .
More strikingly , a recent analysis finds a sudden surge of suicide in the Swiss canton of Zurich , beginning in the late 16th century , just as that region became a Calvinist stronghold .
Some sort of general breakdown of social mores cannot be invoked as an explanation , since homicides fell as suicides rose .
So if we are looking for a common source of depression on the one hand , and the suppression of festivities on the other , it is not hard to find .
Urbanisation and the rise of a competitive , market - based economy favoured a more anxious and isolated sort of person - potentially both prone to depression and distrustful of communal pleasures .
Calvinism provided a transcendent rationale for this shift , intensifying the isolation and practically institutionalising depression as a stage in the quest for salvation .
At the level of " deep , underlying psychological change " , both depression and the destruction of festivities could be described as seemingly inevitable consequences of the broad process known as modernisation .
But could there also be a more straightforward link , a way in which the death of carnival contributed directly to the epidemic of depression ?
It may be that in abandoning their traditional festivities , people lost a potentially effective cure for it .
Burton suggested many cures for melancholy - study and exercise , for example - but he returned again and again to the same prescription : " Let them use hunting , sports , plays , jests , merry company ... a cup of good drink now and then , hear musick , and have such companions with whom they are especially delighted ; merry tales or toys , drinking , singing , dancing , and whatsoever else may procure mirth . "
He acknowledged the ongoing attack on " Dancing , Singing , Masking , Mumming , Stage - plays " by " some severe Gatos , " referring to the Calvinists , but heartily endorsed the traditional forms of festivity : " Let them freely feast , sing and dance , have their Puppet - plays , Hobby - horses , Tabers , Crowds , Bagpipes , &c , play at Ball , and Barley - breaks , and what sports and recreations they like best . "
In his ideal world , " none shall be over - tired , but have their set times of recreations and holidays , to indulge their humour , feasts and merry meetings ... "
His views accorded with treatments of melancholy already in use in the 16th century .
While the disruptively " mad " were confined and cruelly treated , melancholics were , at least in theory , to be " refreshed & comforted " and " gladded with instruments of musick " .
A little over a century after Burton wrote The Anatomy of Melancholy , another English writer , Richard Browne , echoed his prescription , backing it up with a scientific ( for the time ) view of the workings of the human " machine " .
Singing and dancing could cure melancholy , he proposed , by stirring up the " secretions " .
And a century later , even Adam Smith , the great prophet of capitalism , was advocating festivities and art as a means of relieving melancholy .
Burton , Browne and Smith were not the only ones to propose festivity as a cure for melancholy , and there is reason to believe that whether through guesswork , nostalgia , or personal experience , they were on to something important .
I know of no attempts in our own time to use festive behaviour as treatment for depression , if such an experiment is even thinkable in a modern clinical setting .
There is , however , an abundance of evidence that communal pleasures have served , in a variety of cultures , as a way of alleviating and even curing depression .
The 19th - century historian JFC Hecker reports an example from 19th - century Abyssinia , or what is now Ethiopia .
An individual , usually a woman , would fall into a kind of wasting illness , until her relatives agreed to " hire , for a certain sum of money , a band of trumpeters , drummers , and fifers , and buy a quantity of liquor ; then all the young men and women of the place assemble at the patient 's house , " where they dance and generally party for days , invariably effecting a cure .
Similarly , in 20th - century Somalia , a married woman afflicted by what we would call depression would call for a female shaman , who might diagnose possession by a " sar " spirit .
Musicians would be hired , other women summoned , and the sufferer cured through a long bout of ecstatic dancing with the all - female group .
We cannot be absolutely sure in any of these cases - from 17th - century England to 20th - century Somalia - that festivities and danced rituals actually cured the disease we know as depression .
But there are reasons to think that they might have .
First , because such rituals serve to break down the sufferer 's sense of isolation and reconnect him or her with the human community .
Second , because they encourage the experience of self - loss - that is , a release , however temporary , from the prison of the self , or at least from the anxious business of evaluating how one stands in the group or in the eyes of an ever- critical God.
Friedrich Nietzsche , as lonely and tormented an individual as the 19th century produced , understood the therapeutics of ecstasy perhaps better than anyone else .
At a time of almost universal celebration of the " self " , he alone dared speak of the " horror of individual existence " , and glimpsed relief in the ancient Dionysian rituals that he knew of only from reading classics - rituals in which , he imagined , " each individual becomes not only reconciled to his fellow but actually at one with him " .
The immense tragedy for Europeans , and most acutely for the northern Protestants among them , was that the same social forces that disposed them to depression also swept away a traditional cure .
They could congratulate themselves for brilliant achievements in the areas of science , exploration and industry , and even convince themselves that they had not , like Faust , had to sell their souls to the devil in exchange for these accomplishments .
But with the suppression of festivities that accompanied modern European " progress " , they had done something perhaps far more damaging : they had completed the demonisation of Dionysus begun by Christians centuries ago , and thereby rejected one of the most ancient sources of help - the mind - preserving , life - saving techniques of ecstasy .

Every year , the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence is briefed by the chief of U.S. intelligence on potential threats to the nation .
The list is sobering , but usually predictable and typically includes global terrorism , nuclear proliferation and regional conflicts .
But this year , there was a surprising potential foe : the falling dollar .
In his report to Congress last week , Director of National Intelligence Michael McConnell went beyond the conventional world of spycraft .
Mr. McConnell specifically acknowledged " concerns ...
DETROIT  Chrysler said Thursday that it will shut all but its most essential operations worldwide for two weeks in July , a first for the struggling No. 3 U.S. automaker as it attempts to cut costs and preserve cash .
The broad shutdown the weeks of July 7 and July 14 was announced to employees in an e-mail from Chief Executive Bob Nardelli .
Nardelli said the move is needed to help Chrysler to create " efficiency across organizational lines and boost productivity . "
Chrysler , General Motors and Ford typically idle their U.S. plants in July for vacations and shut individual manufacturing operations at various times to retool when they have car and truck model changeovers .
Chrysler , which is in a restructuring that includes trimming some vehicle lines and offering buyouts to its 44,000 U.S. hourly workers , lost $ 1.6 billion in 2007 .
The automaker has been accelerating restructuring efforts since Cerberus Capital Management acquired a nearly 80 % stake from Daimler last summer .
The U.S. auto market has slumped by a wider margin than most analysts anticipated since Cerberus completed the acquisition of its majority stake in Chrysler .
The company has indicated that it is trying to step up its restructuring efforts in response .
Nardelli has repeatedly said the automaker would focus on bolstering its cash position , and Chrysler has taken a number of cost - cutting steps in recent weeks .
Chrysler announced last week that it was shutting a design studio outside San Diego it has maintained since the early 1980s .
The automaker has also taken a hard line in negotiations since late last year with bankrupt parts supplier Plastech Engineered Products in an effort to steer clear of a more expensive bailout for the privately held company .
Chrysler 's U.S. sales were down almost 13 % the first two months of this year .
Chrysler spokeswoman Mary Beth Halprin said the automaker will remain staffed in some areas during the summer shutdown to support its sales network .
GM spokesman Dan Flores said the No. 1 U.S. automaker plans to idle its U.S. plants the first two weeks of July this year , as it has in the past .
Ford is also planning a two - week shutdown of its North American assembly plants in July , similar to past years , spokeswoman Angie Kozleski said .

We Are All Prisoners Now
Paul Craig Roberts
" They re locking them up today
They re throwing away the key
I wonder who itll be tomorrow , you or me ? "
~ The Red Telephone ( LOVE , 1967 )
At Christmas time it has been my habit to write a column in remembrance of the many innocent people in prisons whose lives have been stolen by the US criminal justice ( sic ) system that is as inhumane as it is indifferent to justice .
Usually I retell the cases of William Strong and Christophe Gaynor , two men framed in the state of Virginia by prosecutors and judges as wicked and corrupt as any who served Hitler or Stalin .
This year is different .
All Americans are now imprisoned in a world of lies and deception created by the Bush Regime and the two complicit parties of Congress , by federal judges too timid or ignorant to recognize a rogue regime running roughshod over the Constitution , by a bought and paid for media that serves as propagandists for a regime of war criminals , and by a public who have forsaken their Founding Fathers .
Americans are also imprisoned by fear , a false fear created by the hoax of " terrorism . "
It has turned out that headline terrorist events since 9/11 have been orchestrated by the US government .
For example , the alleged terrorist plot to blow up Chicagos Sears Tower was the brainchild of an FBI agent who searched out a few disaffected people to give lip service to the plot devised by the FBI agent .
He arrested his victims , whose trial ended in acquittal and mistrial .
Raising doubts among Americans about the government is not a strong point of the corporate media .
Americans live in a world of propaganda designed to secure their acquiescence to war crimes , torture , searches and police state measures , military aggression , hegemony and oppression , while portraying Americans ( and Israelis ) as the salt of the earth who are threatened by Muslims who hate their " freedom and democracy . "
Americans cling to this " truth " while the Bush regime and a complicit Congress destroy the Bill of Rights and engineer the theft of elections .
Freedom and democracy in America have been reduced to no-fly lists , spying without warrants , arrests without warrants or evidence , permanent detention despite the constitutional protection of habeas corpus , torture despite the prohibition against self - incrimination  the list goes on and on .
In todays fearful America , a US Senator , whose elder brothers were ( 1 ) a military hero killed in action , ( 2 ) a President of the United States assassinated in office , ( 3 ) an Attorney General of the United States and likely president except he was assassinated like his brother , can find himself on the no-fly list .
Present and former high government officials , with top secret security clearances , cannot fly with a tube of toothpaste or a bottle of water despite the absence of any evidence that extreme measures imposed by " airport security " makes flying safer .
Elderly American citizens with walkers and young mothers with children are meticulously searched because US Homeland Security cannot tell the difference between an American citizen and a terrorist .
All Americans should note the ominous implications of the inability of Homeland Security to distinguish an American citizen from a terrorist .
When Airport Security cannot differentiate a US Marine General recipient of the Medal of Honor from a terrorist , Americans have all the information they need to know .
Any and every American can be arrested by unaccountable authority , held indefinitely without charges and tortured until he or she can no longer stand the abuse and confesses .
This predicament , which can now befall any American , is our reward for our stupidity , our indifference , our gullibility , and our lack of compassion for anyone but ourselves .
Some Americans have begun to comprehend the tremendous financial costs of the " war on terror . "
But few understand the cost to American liberty .
Last October a Democrat - sponsored bill , " Prevention of Violent Radicalism and Homegrown Terrorism , " passed the House of Representatives 404 to 6 .
Only six members of the House voted against tyrannical legislation that would destroy freedom of speech and freedom of assembly and that would mandate 18 months of congressional hearings to discover Americans with " extreme " views who could be preemptively arrested .
What better indication that the US Constitution has lost its authority when elected representatives closest to the people pass a bill that permits the Bill of Rights to be overturned by the subjective opinion of members of an " Extremist Belief Commission " and Homeland Security bureaucrats ?
Clearly , Americans face no greater threat than the government in Washington .
Every day , Coca - Cola trucks slowly weave their way through New York traffic , eventually stopping at up to 18 grocery stores , restaurants , and bodegas .
As a truck makes a delivery , the engine idles , burning fuel and spewing fumes .
But as of Wednesday , Coca - Cola Enterprises started to do things differently in New York .
It is using hybrid delivery trucks , which operate just like the cars , using a combination of batteries and horsepower .
When the trucks are unloading , there will be no fumes and idling diesel engines .
Instead , the shiny new red-and - white trucks will have 32 percent better fuel economy .
And the hybrids ' greenhouse - gas emissions will be 90 percent less than those from regular trucks , according to the manufacturer of the new vehicle .
" It 's a small step , but it 's one of those steps that if we keep taking , we will be leaving a better world for our kids , " says Mayor Michael Bloomberg .
Coca - Cola 's transition to hybrid trucks is part of a push by urban delivery companies to cut their greenhouse - gas emissions .
As with the hybrid cars , demand for the green trucks is so strong that companies such as Coca - Cola are willing to pay a 35 to 40 percent premium over the cost of a normal delivery truck .
Both FedEx and UPS are also building hybrid fleets in urban areas .
In return , the companies cut their fuel consumption .
" You get a return on the investment , but more importantly , it 's the right thing to do , " says John Brock , president of Coca - Cola Enterprises in an interview at the company 's giant distribution center in the South Bronx .
Environmental groups , who have pressed for cleaner air to deal with various health issues , are pleased to see the shift .
The Coca - Cola distribution center , for one , is in a heavy industrial area with many trucks on the road .
Medical testing has found high rates of asthma among local residents .
" That area has some of the nation 's highest asthma rates , so looking for ways to reduce vehicle emissions is good , " says Jason Babbie , senior environmental policy analyst at NYPIRG , a nonprofit policy lobbying group in Albany .
" This is definitely a positive step . "
Groups trying to promote corporate responsibility think it 's a good example as well .
" It 's managing a regulatory risk , " says Allison Hannon of the Climate Group , which tries to get businesses and government to work together on climate issues .
" There is going to be a price on carbon , the cost of energy is going to go through the roof , and for some companies , it will catch them by surprise . "
Cutting down on greenhouse - gas emissions in urban areas is considered an important step in slowing climate change , since urban areas account for as much as 80 percent of the gases .
" It 's where you can make the biggest difference , " says Ms. Hannon , who is based in New York .
Shifting over to the hybrid delivery trucks could be one way to cut down on emissions .
For example , the average Coca - Cola truck in New York logs 44,000 miles a year on the city 's streets .
Because of traffic , it frequently does not get above 30 miles per hour , which is hardly fuel efficient .
" This really is a big deal , " says Mr. Bloomberg , who has his own plan to dramatically reduce New York 's greenhouse - gas emissions .
UPS , with one of the largest truck fleets in the nation , has purchased 50 hybrids for short - haul deliveries .
It estimates that on an annual basis , it will save 44,000 gallons of fuel and will cut emissions by 457 metric tons of carbon dioxide .
FedEx is also operating 75 hybrids for short hauls .
By the end of the year , Coca - Cola will have five hybrid trucks on the streets .
By the end of next year , it will have 120 nationwide .
It would like to add more , but , Brock says , " it 's a question of capacity " by the manufacturers .
The Coca -Cola trucks are made by International Truck and Engine Corp. , and the hybrid system is supplied by Cleveland - based Eaton Corp .
Eaton went into full production in July and says it 's now ready to produce as many as companies want to order .
" But there are some limitations with the OEMs [ original equipment manufacturers , such as International ] and how many they can build , " says Ken Davis , vice president of light / medium duty transmissions at Eaton Corp. in Kalamazoo , Mich .
As more companies buy the hybrids , the cost will start to come down , says Mr. Davis .
" We have a very aggressive program to get the cost down over the next three years , " he says .
The potential market for the hybrids , Davis estimates , is about 15,000 trucks per year , or about 10 percent of 150,000 trucks produced annually .
" But who knows .
It could go to 15 to 20 percent depending on the cost of fuel , " he says .
Coca -Cola and its archrival PepsiCo are starting to push each other on a green agenda .
Earlier this year , Pepsi announced a significant investment in renewable power – equal to the total amount of energy used by the company 's US operations .
And Pepsi is now testing hybrid delivery trucks , Davis says .
" Stay tuned , " he says .
Michelle Obama says GOP using ' ultimate fear bomb '

Michelle Obama , wife of the Democratic presidential frontrunner Sen. Barack Obama , says that Republicans are using fear to scare voters as they continually invoke her husband 's middle name , Hussein , to highlight false stories about Obama 's personal ties to Islam .
Mrs. Obama refers to the GOP tactic as " the fear bomb , " says MSNBC 's Keith Olbermann .
" They threw in the obvious , ultimate fear bomb that we 're even hearing now : they said his name , " Mrs. Obama exclaimed .
" They said , ' Look out for his name , when all else fails .
Be afraid of his name and what they could stand for , because it 's different . ' "
Olbermann reports that the Republican National Committee denounced usage of the Illinois senator 's full name by local GOP organizations .
Columnist Jonathan
Alter says of Obama 's purported Muslim connections and the Republican promotion of same , " This is not a dispute over facts , this is an Internet lie that people believe . "
Historians will argue over whether George W. Bush is the worst president the United States has ever endured .
But that is not the point .
Five years after Bush 's ill - starred invasion of Iraq , three years after Hurricane Katrina and seven months into the unravelling of the U.S. financial system , the point is that the 43rd president of the United States – regardless of his ranking in the pantheon – is a unique and unmitigated disaster .
Whether Bush is more of a warmonger than James Polk , who in 1846 manufactured a crisis with Mexico in order to seize what is now California , more tolerant of cronyism than poker - playing Warren Harding ( 1921 to 1923 ) , or more unlucky than William Harrison ( he died after catching cold at his 1841 inauguration ) is interesting but irrelevant .
What we do know is that this president , this " decider " ( to use his favoured term ) , decided his way into a war that has destroyed the nation he was allegedly trying to free , destabilized further an already rickety Middle East and given Islamic terrorism a whole new raison d'etre .
Bush is not the first U.S. president to take a cavalier attitude to civil liberties .
Abraham Lincoln did so during the Civil War , while modern presidents reaching back to at least John Kennedy and Dwight Eisenhower have sanctioned the use of illegal assassination .
During the 1960s , when Bush was still a hard - drinking frat boy , American experts operating under presidential authority were teaching enhanced torture techniques to their Latin American counterparts .
Bush did n't initiate the practice of extraordinary rendition – sending suspects abroad to be tortured .
That honour goes to Bill Clinton .
In short , the road to Abu Ghraib and Guantanamo Bay was open well before Bush took office in January 2001 .
But the current president has soared to new heights .
His predecessors at least had the grace to be embarrassed about dabbling on the dark side .
By contrast , Bush and Vice - President Dick Cheney positively gloat about their attempts to subvert human rights .
True , most of the bad press against Bush stems less from his actions themselves than from the fact that they have failed .
Had Lincoln lost the Civil War , history might well have treated him as a bum .
Had the U.S. succeeded in Iraq and Afghanistan , Bush might be considered one of America 's great presidents .
But Bush did not succeed there , or indeed in most of his efforts .
With a few notable exceptions , such as stacking the Supreme Court with conservative justices , his record is one of failure .
His attempt to beef up the government - subsidized health - care system for seniors has bogged down in confusion .
His thrusts at social security reform were stillborn .
An alleged fiscal conservative , he drove the U.S. treasury into deficit to pay for his wars and tax cuts .
Part of the reason is ideology .
Bush did little when Hurricane Katrina destroyed New Orleans , in large part because he does not think governments should involve themselves in matters of social welfare .
His efforts in the current financial crisis are equally half - hearted and for much the same reason .
But there is something else , something disturbingly feckless about Bush .
This has nothing to do with his malapropisms ( " The only way we can win is to leave before the job is done " ) , his insistence on snuggling into bed early every night or his alarming propensity for bicycle accidents .
At a very basic level , Bush is incompetent .
He likes to play at commander - in - chief of the U.S. armed forces .
But in any other country a commander - in - chief who orchestrated an adventure as disastrous as the Iraq war would be court - martialled .
He clearly has a native cunning that stands him well in the game of politics .
But at a deeper level , there seems to be something missing – a neural disconnect in his brain that at crucial moments causes him to be divorced from the constraints of rational thought .
How else to explain the abrupt turnarounds such as his 2003 decision to disband the entire Iraqi army ( a decision that fuelled the subsequent insurgency ) just a few weeks after agreeing that these forces should be kept intact ?
In some public events , he seems fully at ease .
But in others – particularly his infrequent , televised press conferences – he seems to be observing events from another dimension .
Among U.S. historians , it has become great sport to rank the country 's presidents .
Bush vies with many for the title of absolute worst – from Ulysses S. Grant , who oversaw a post - Civil War era so corrupt it was known as Grant 's Barbecue , to Richard Nixon of Watergate fame , to Herbert Hoover , the hapless president in charge during the stock market crash of 1929 .
But Grant , Hoover and even Nixon did not do as much damage worldwide .
Americans may still be debating Bush 's legacy .
I suspect the rest of the world has made up its mind .

BAGHDAD , Iraq ( CNN ) --
Iraq is sending troops for a " decisive " battle with al Qaeda in Iraq militants in Mosul -- one of the cities where the fighters remain strong -- Prime Minister Nuri al - Maliki said Friday .
Extra police and soldiers are being deployed to the northern city to strip al Qaeda in Iraq of its sanctuaries and " incubators " there , Iraqi Interior Ministry spokesman Maj.
Gen. Abdul Karim Khalaf said .
Iraqi and U.S. forces have tackled the militants elsewhere in Iraq , but both admit it will be a hard fight in Mosul , the capital of Nineveh province hit by a massive blast Wednesday that killed 34 people .
Al - Maliki said the attack , which was followed the next day by the assassination of the province 's police chief while inspecting the damage , drove him to order the crackdown .
" This heinous crime committed against our people and sons in Nineveh hurt us but also gave us a push to expedite the activation of the operations command , " he said in Karbala .
Khalaf of the Interior Ministry told reporters about 3,000 police would be added to the Mosul force .
He said it would be a " big job " but added : " Our intelligence has infiltrated al Qaeda [ in Iraq ] . "
Mosul , one of Iraq 's largest cities , remains a nagging problem for U.S. and Iraqi authorities .
Watch U.S. troops at work in Mosul 's " Wild West " »
The city has been a destination for insurgents crossing into Iraq from Syria .
Nineveh is one of the four northern Iraqi provinces where U.S. and Iraqi forces are combining to try to root out insurgents in Operation Iron Harvest .
The others are Diyala , Tameem and Salaheddin .
The actions of al Qaeda in Iraq and their ability to attack are beginning to change because of the U.S. and Iraqi security forces , U.S. Army Maj. Gen. Mark Hertling , commander of Multinational Division North , told reporters earlier this week .
" I think a year ago we were often reacting to al Qaeda and what they were going to do next , " he said on Tuesday .
" Now I think the tables have turned a little bit , and they are attempting to react [ to ] where we 're going to go next , and that 's a critical difference . "
Hertling said that " we still have a very tough fight to go " in Mosul .
But he added that there were growing numbers of capable Iraqi soldiers in the north that would help to prevent al Qaeda in Iraq regaining footholds once troops sent in to shut them down had moved on to other areas .
Meanwhile , the U.S. military announced Friday that coalition troops killed one person and detained 19 others in northern and central Iraq in raids targeting al Qaeda in Iraq .
Five of the arrests were in Mosul .
Troops there seized two wanted individuals allegedly involved in the Ansar al Sunna insurgent group and three suspects thought to be senior terrorist leaders who have links to other militants in the region .
" We will continue to pursue al Qaeda in Iraq and other extremists wherever they take sanctuary , " said Maj .
Winfield Danielson , spokesman for Multi-National Forces - Iraq , the formal name for the U.S. - led forces .
Also Friday , Iraqi authorities gave new details about fighting a week ago involving a Shiite messianic cult in the southern cities of Basra and Nasiriya , saying that 53 people died and more than 100 were wounded .
They also announced a ban on the Ansar al - Mehdi movement suspected of starting the clashes and gave a warning to it and other such groups .
Authorities said the fighting began when cult members attacked Shiite pilgrims during the observance of Ashura , a four - day commemoration of an early Shiite martyr , a grandson of Mohammed .
Security forces then squared off with the cult members .
The Interior Ministry 's Khalaf said 30 cult members and seven security forces were killed in Basra , while six cult members and 10 security forces died in Nasiriya .
In Basra , 40 cult members and 22 security forces were wounded , while nine cult members and 47 forces were wounded in Nasiriya .
There were 172 people detained in Basra and 206 in Nasiriya .

Home Equity Loan Find personalized rates :

NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
Wall Street investors did n't exactly celebrate the Federal Reserve 's emergency rate cut Tuesday , but home owners with expensive lines of credit on their mortgages should jump for joy .
Shortly after the Fed announced a reduction of its federal funds rate to 3.5 percent from 4.25 percent , most major banks reduced their prime lending rates by the same amount .
Since the Fed rate affects how much consumers pay on credit card debt , home equity lines of credit and auto loans , consumers ' monthly debt obligations should slide along with the rate cut .
For home owners with home equity lines of credit , it should n't be long before they see lower monthly loan payments .
" That rate will drop three - quarters of a percentage point fairly soon , " said Holden Lewis of Bankrate.com .
" Probably in about two billing cycles . "
The Fed 's dramatic rate cut - its largest since 1984 - wo n't do much to help consumers with their credit card debt , however .
According to Bill Hardekopf , chief executive of LowCards.com , credit card issuers may choose to lower their annual interest rates by three quarters of a point .
However , for a balance of $ 5,000 , that amounts to only $ 3.13 a month .
" That 's not enough to make a consumer rich , " Hardekopf said .
Hardekopf said he expects most credit card companies to lower their rates , though it 's not guaranteed .
For example , after the most recent quarter - point rate cut , in December , Capital One raised most consumer card rates by half a point , expert said .
" The Fed rate cut is not a guarantee that credit card rates will go down , " said John Ulzheimer , president of Credit.com Educational Services .
The trickle down impact on car loans and mortgages is less direct , experts said .
Adjustable - rate mortgages are based on a number of variables , including the interbank market rate known as Libor and the Fed funds rate .
" The rate cut may have already been priced in by the lenders , " said Ulzheimer .
" Though it was a surprise , the rate cut has been discussed for a while . "
Of course , there is one piece of bad news for consumers in Tuesday 's rate cut .
Interest rates for savings accounts , certificates of deposit and money market accounts will go down as well .
Said Ulzheimer , " It 's ' thank you ' on one end , and ' no thank you ' on the other end . "
BERLIN ( Reuters ) - A woman in Germany who became pregnant after an online sex auction has won a court battle to force the Web site that hosted the sale to reveal the names of the winners , so she can find out who ’s the father .
Six different men won Internet auctions to have sex with the woman in April and May last year .
They were only known to her by their online names , a spokesman for a court in the southwestern city of Stuttgart said Wednesday .
“ The woman wanted to discover which one of the men had made her pregnant , ” the spokesman said .
“ So she needed their contact details .
Of course , if they ’re not willing to go along with the gene test , she ’ll have to take them to court . ”
The woman asked the site ’s operator to reveal the true identity of the men , but it refused , citing a confidentiality clause in its terms and conditions .
The court ruled in her favor , saying the child ’s right to know who its father was took precedence .
The court declined to give the woman ’s age and nationality .
Portal 2 Confirmed by Valve
" Well , I believe Doug Lombardi who is our lead marketing director at Valve , has announced Portal 2 , " said Swift in an interview with G4TV .
Lombardi had previously stated that more Portal was on the way , but Swift 's comment is the first mention of a true sequel to be made thus far .
No further details on the project were provided .
Portal won the Game Developers Choice Award for Game of the Year last night in San Francisco .
It also took home the awards for Innovation and Best Game Design .

The $ 34 trillion Medicare problem Superdrugs for superbugs Pfizer CEO : No " mega - deals " on the horizon
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
Democrats have long served as the traditional enemy of Big Pharma , but in this presidential campaign , the left is taking the lion 's share of drugmaker money .
Democratic senators Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton are the top recipients of donations from the pharmaceutical industry , according to The Center for Responsive Politics , a non-profit , non-partisan research group in Washington , D.C. Meanwhile , donations to Sen .
John McCain , who was recently endorsed by President Bush as the official Republican candidate , pale in comparison .
Obama maintains a slight edge over his Democratic rival , with $ 181,000 in Big Pharma donations through Jan. 31 , compared with Clinton 's $ 174,000 , according to the center .
McCain is far behind with $ 44,000 .
This is in spite of the fact that all three candidates have consistently bashed the pharma industry and vowed to lower drug prices , which would take a bite out of corporate profits .
But it was n't always this way .
Big Pharma , voting with its wallet , used to be more of an enthusiastic supporter for the Grand Old Party .
In the 2004 presidential election , drugmakers donated $ 516,000 to the Bush campaign , a huge increase over the $ 280,000 provided to Sen .
John Kerry , the Democratic candidate from Massachusetts , according to the center .
A changing climate
There are two reasons for the recent shift in funding .
The Bush administration may still control the White House , but Republicans no longer control Congress .
Democrats hold the majority in the House , and the parties are evenly split in the Senate .
Drugmakers could be trying to secure access to the ruling party by courting their traditional enemies .
" Since the Democrats took control of Congress in 2006 , money has shifted away from Republicans , to the Democrats who hold the keys to the kingdom , " said Massie Ritsch , a spokesman for The Center for Responsive Politics .
" The pharmaceutical industry is one that would lean Republican if it did n't have to make friends with the party that 's in power right now . "
Merck spokesman Ron Rogers said his company has never announced support for a specific candidate and " has always sought to work with both Republicans and Democrats on the issues that affect pharmaceutical innovations whether one party or the other has controlled the Congress of White House . "
Schering - Plough spokesman Steve Galpin said his company has not donated to any presidential candidates .
Other drugmakers contacted on this issue - Pfizer and Eli Lilly & Co. - did not comment by press time .
Secondly , the distinctions have blurred between the two parties ' relationship with big business .
Democrats have traditionally been seen as enemies to the pharmaceutical industry , while Republicans are supposed to be their allies .
" I think what you can say about the philosophical divide is that the Republicans as a party believe in free markets and the Democrats want to socialize our healthcare system , " said Barbara Ryan , pharma analyst for Deutsche Bank North America .
But with McCain as the conservative contender for the White House , the issues are no longer black and white .
Ryan noted that the current campaign lacks hard and fast party differences in healthcare .
In fact , the policies from of Clinton , Obama and McCain are uniformly unfriendly toward Big Pharma .
The high cost of prescriptions
Much of their political ire is focused on drug prices .
All the candidates co-sponsored a bill early last year to allow the re-importation of U.S. - made drugs back from Canada , where they 're cheaper .
But the bill failed to pass the Senate .
McCain , who has described himself as " the biggest enemy of the pharmaceutical industry in Washington , " has been particularly vocal on re-importation .
" Why should n't we be able to re-import drugs from Canada ? " he asked during the New Hampshire republican debates in January .
" It 's because of the power of the pharmaceutical companies . "
" Do n't turn the pharmaceutical companies into the big bad guys , " countered Mitt Romney , the former presidential candidate who has since dropped out of the race .
" Well , they are , " said McCain .
Campaign crosshairs are also focused on the Bush administration 's ban on drug - price negotiations between the government and drug companies .
This ban was included in the 2003 Medicare Modernization Act .
Removing it could result in lower drug prices , which would put the squeeze on pharma sales .
Obama and Clinton have clearly stated that they oppose the ban on price negotiations .
" [ Clinton ] has been very much against the non-negotiation ban , said Gene Sperling , her economic advisor , as well as former director of the National Economic Council for former President Bill Clinton .
" She feels that that puts the government in a worse position than a big company . "
Obama , on his campaign Web site , has vowed to repeal the ban that prevents the government from negotiating with drug companies , estimating it could result in savings of up to $ 30 billion for patients .
McCain 's stance on this issue is n't clear .
When Democrats failed to pass a bill last year that would have eliminated the ban , he was n't present for the vote .
McCain 's office did not return calls and emails asking about his position on this issue .
Business as usual
But even with all the political rhetoric , Wall Street does n't seem to be paying attention .
Paul Alan Davis , manager of Charles Schwab's $ 800 million healthcare portfolio , which includes holdings in Pfizer ( PFE , Fortune 500 ) , Merck ( MRK , Fortune 500 ) , Johnson & Johnson ( JNJ , Fortune 500 ) , Schering - Plough ( SGP , Fortune 500 ) and other major pharma companies , said he was n't sure which of the candidates posed the biggest shake - up for the industry - if at all .
He also said that the campaign is not a factor in his investment decisions .
" I think it 's probably easier to talk about change to get votes than it is to actually change the system , " he said .
In an impressive volte - face , Microsoft has decided that Internet Explorer 8 will default to being compliant with web standards after all , and will not , as previously announced , require web pages to explicitly opt in to conforming behavior .
Internet Explorer presently has two modes for displaying web pages : " quirks " mode , for showing old or particularly badly - formed pages , and " standards " mode , for showing pages that appear to conform to the various specifications that govern the web .
The problem with this was that IE 7 does n't honor the standards very well , and so its " standards " mode is n't all that standard .
IE 8 , due to go into private beta imminently , is set to be a huge improvement on this front , and should be a truly standards - compliant version of Internet Explorer .
This had Microsoft concerned .
The obvious thing to do would be to make " standards " mode more standard .
The part of this that concerned the company was that there are pages out there that put the browser into " standards " mode , but are n't actually standard — instead , they depended on IE 7's nonstandard " standards " mode .
To address this , Microsoft said that developers would have to opt in to true " standards " mode .
Otherwise , web pages would be stuck with a kind of " IE 7 " mode .
This plan caused a considerable reaction in the web development community .
Although many were sympathetic to Microsoft 's desire to not " break the web , " the general consensus was that this move would retard web development even further and undermine the entire purpose of web standards .
Surprisingly , Microsoft has changed its mind .
Internet Explorer 8 will default to true standards compliance after all , and developers who want IE 7 behavior will have to explicitly choose it .
Microsoft is citing its new interoperability initiative as the impetus behind the change .
This move , designed primarily to stave off further EU intervention , emphasizes support and promotion of open standards in a way that the company has n't previously done .
This move should also help to fend off Opera 's antitrust complaint , which argues that the EU should force IE into better standards compliance .
Although I 'm glad to see the change ( I understood why they wanted to have the opt - in behavior , but I did n't agree with it ) , it 's not entirely clear why the company has changed its stance .
The arguments that were made at the time of the original announcement were not unexpected or surprising ; Microsoft knew what the criticisms would be and attempted to justify its choice in spite of them .
Nothing has really changed between now and then , and Microsoft 's argument for the opt - in behavior is just as strong now as it was six weeks ago .
If the company honestly believed that its approach was , from a technical perspective , the best one — and the software giant certainly put quite some effort into designing and defending it — then it should be of some concern that politics should have caused it to switch .
Do n't get me wrong — I 'm glad that they 're going to make " standards " mode standard .
I just wish they were doing so for the right reasons .

■ Trac を設置するときは静的ファイルを分離すると速い
Trac のマニュアル ( TracCgi ) に書いてあることだけど、意外と知らない人がいそうなのでメモ。 特に、レンタルサーバに CGI として設置する場合には重要なポイント 。
デフォルト状態の問 題
Trac をデフォルトの状態で動かすと、 Trac のロゴやスタイルシートや JavaScript ファイルが、みん な Trac プログラム経由でのアクセスとなる。 例えば、 Trac を CGI とし て
http://www.example.jp/trac.cgi
に設置したとすると、 Trac のロゴ は
http://www.example.jp/trac.cgi/chrome/common/trac_logo_mini.png
という URL になる。 Firebug などで見れば分かるけど、すべて CGI を経由するので負荷がかかってレスポンスが遅くなる。
対策…静的ファイルの分離
静的ファイル を Web サーバから直接参照できる場所に置くことで、負荷を大きく下げることができる。
Trac の静的ファイルは、ソースから入れた場合 は
/opt/local/share/trac/htdocs
に入っている。 ディレクトリは環境によって /usr / local / share だったり、 $ HOME / share だったりする。 setup .py を使った場合 は
/opt/local/lib/python2.5/site-packages/Trac-0.11b1-py2.5.egg/trac/htdocs
あたりに入ってる（うちの MacBook Pro の場合） 。
このディレクトリを 、 Web サーバの DocumentRoot 以下からシンボリックリンクを張って参照できるようにする。
$ cd /var / www $ ln -s $ TRAC_HTDOCS trac_common
※ TRAC_HTDOCS は前述の htdocs ディレクトリの場所に読み替え て
次に、 trac.ini を編集して Trac にこの静的ファイルの場所を教えてあげる。 [ trac ] セクションの htdocs_location に指定する 。
[ trac ] htdocs_location = /trac_common
こうすれば、先ほどのロゴの URL は
http://www.example.jp/trac_common/trac_logo_mini.png
になる。 こうすれば画像やスタイルシートの読み込み時に CGI が起動されなくなる 。
ちなみに
僕は Subversion が使えて自由度の効く TextDrive に Trac を設置しているけど、海外にサーバがあるので遅延が大きい。 なので、静的ファイルだけを国内の別サーバから取得するようにしている。 さっきの例で言うと 、
Trac 本体 が
http://www.example.jp/trac.cgi
とすると、静的ファイルは、
http://static.example.jp/trac_common/trac_logo_mini.png
という感じ。 trac.ini にも以下のように書いている。
[ trac ] htdocs_location = http://static.example.jp/trac_common
レンタルサーバの場合は体感的にわかるほどの違いがあるので、ぜひやってみるといいよ。

Andover And Shoreview gt Two endorsed for state House seats
Two newcomers have won backing in state House races .
Ted Butler won the Democratic - Farmer - Labor Party endorsement Saturday at the House District 49A convention .
Butler , who manages the finances of the University of Minnesota ’s employee health care plans , wants the seat left open by Rep. Chris DeLaForest , DFL - Andover .
DeLaForest announced last month he would not seek another term because he wanted to spend more time with his family .
Peggy Scott , a small - business owner , received GOP endorsement in that race last month .
GOP candidate John Kappler survived eight ballots to win the endorsement in House District 53A at a convention earlier this month .
Kappler , a college teacher from Shoreview , beat out former state Sen. Mady Reiter and Laura Merickel , both of Shoreview .
Rep. Paul Gardner , DFL - Shoreview , currently holds the seat .

Babbitt gt Bar owner to fight smoking citation
A bar owner in Babbitt who was cited for hosting a “ theater night ” to get around the statewide smoking ban says he ’ll fight the citation in court .
Tom Marinaro proudly framed his citation — which his attorney says is the first one issued in connection with “ theater night ” — and hung it on the wall at Tank ’s Bar .
Babbitt police gave Marinaro the $ 300 petty misdemeanor ticket Friday .
A patron who was smoking in the bar was also given a ticket .
Tank ’s
Bar , like other bars in the state , has hosted “ theater night ” to get around a law that bans smoking in workplaces , including taverns and restaurants .
A loophole in the law allows actors and actresses to smoke as part of a theatrical production , so several bar owners have hosted performances so patrons can smoke indoors .
Marinaro ’s attorney , Mark Benjamin , said he ’ll argue that the theatrical production clause in the law is unconstitutionally vague .
The Minnesota Department of Health addressed the issue of theater nights on March 5 , saying bars hosting such nights are violating the spirit of the smoking ban .

At The Capitol gt Pawlenty taking on bovine TB problem
Gov. Tim Pawlenty is taking a harder line against bovine tuberculosis in northwestern Minnesota .
Pawlenty visited Roseau County on Monday to highlight measures to contain the disease , which has infected four cattle herds since October and also has been detected in area deer .
Agriculture officials are worried deer will spread the disease to more cattle or dairy herds .
The governor warned those who feed deer they could face fines and jail time as enforcement of a feeding ban is stepped up .
He also announced expanded out - of - season deer hunting permits to cull more deer in the infected area and urged farmers to fence in their feeding areas to keep the deer out .
“ It ’s a serious concern not only in this area but for the whole state because livestock agriculture is very important to our state economy , ” Pawlenty said .
State Agriculture Commissioner Gene Hugoson said the federal government is set to downgrade a bovine TB ranking for Minnesota , making it more expensive and difficult for producers to move animals across state lines .
An application is pending that would limit the downgrade to the affected part of northwestern Minnesota , but the entire state will be under the lower ranking at least until August , Hugoson said .

At The Capitol gt Nursing home cuts meet opposition
Opposition is lining up to Gov. Tim Pawlenty ’s budget plans for nursing homes .
Foes include House Republicans who offered their own plan on Monday .
House Minority Leader Marty Seifert said his members do n’t back Pawlenty ’s proposals to delay state aid for nursing homes and other long - term care providers .
“ Our caucus is not supportive of that little piece of the governor ’s budget , ” said Seifert , R- Marshall .
Instead , House Republicans want to take some of the surplus in a fund collected for the MinnesotaCare health plan for the working poor and send about $ 30 million to nursing homes .
Their plan would give nursing homes a 2.25 percent increase in aid — with the cost more than covered by the Health Care Access Fund ’s surplus .
A bipartisan group of long - term care supporters outlined other problems with Pawlenty ’s plan .
Lawmakers backing the Long - Term Care Imperative said Pawlenty ’s budget would cut nearly $ 32 million from nursing homes , which are already struggling to keep their doors open .
They ’re looking to head off the cut and bump nursing home aid by 3 percent .
To pay for it , they ’re calling on Pawlenty to give up a proposed 1/8 - cent cut in the state sales tax .

Minneapolis gt Ellison gets backup on housing crisis
Boarded - up homes sat vacant , and “ for sale ” signs dotted the snowy street where Democratic Rep. Keith Ellison came Monday to talk about the housing crisis with a high - ranking congressional colleague .
“ It was the American dream , ” Ellison said , with Rep. Rahm Emanuel , D - Ill . , at his side .
“ What you ’re looking at here on this block is the American nightmare . ”
Ellison , Minneapolis Mayor R.T. Rybak and other officials and community organizers concerned about the high rate of foreclosures described the problem : Predatory lenders and investors had taken advantage of people , leaving more than 800 Minneapolis homes sitting vacant and vulnerable to criminal activity .
Ellison and Emanuel , the Democrats ’ fourth - ranking House leader , said a congressional proposal that would provide $ 300 billion in new loan guarantees to help refinance at - risk mortgages could make a difference in neighborhoods like north Minneapolis , where more than 500 homes have gone vacant .
It would also provide $ 10 billion in loans and grants for local governments and nonprofit organizations to rehabilitate vacant , foreclosed homes .

Madison gt Panel says judge ’s ad race - baiting
An independent group monitoring the state Supreme Court race says the first television ad by Burnett County Judge Michael Gableman is “ highly offensive and deliberately misleading . ”
The Wisconsin Judicial Campaign Integrity Committee called on Gableman on Monday to take the ad off the air .
The group says the spot is in the offensive , race - baiting style reminiscent of the Willie Horton ad from the 1988 presidential race .
The ad places a picture of a convicted rapist and Supreme Court Justice Louis Butler on the screen at the same time .
Both are black .
Butler handled the man ’s appeal of his rape conviction when he worked as a public defender .
The monitoring group says the ad is unbecoming of Gableman as a sitting judge .

The younger of two brothers who survived a Christmas Day tiger attack at the San Francisco Zoo was arrested on suspicion of trying to steal two video game controllers from a San Leandro store , police said Friday .
Paul Dhaliwal , 19 , hid two Nintendo Wii controllers in his pants at the Target store at the Bayfair Center mall about 6:30 p.m. Thursday , San Leandro police Lt. Tom Overton said .
Store security officer Michael Marucut , dressed in plain clothes , told authorities that he witnessed the theft and followed Dhaliwal as he walked past the cash registers , " never making an attempt to pay for the concealed items , " the police report said .
Once Dhaliwal walked outside the store , Marucut and several other security officials confronted him .
Dhaliwal " was uncooperative and immediately began to resist , " Marucut wrote in a statement included in the police report .
Dhaliwal was subdued and placed under citizen 's arrest .
Officer Warren DeGuzman arrived and took Dhaliwal into custody .
After he was read his rights , Dhaliwal " admitted to selecting and concealing the merchandise , " DeGuzman wrote in his report .
But Dhaliwal said he never left the store with the items , the police report said .
Dhaliwal , whose scars from the tiger attack are still visible on his head , was arrested for petty theft , Overton said .
Dhaliwal posted $ 1,500 bail shortly before 3 p.m. Friday , police said .
The incident at Target happened on the same day the brothers filed a claim against the city of San Francisco , seeking unspecified monetary damages in connection with the tiger attack .
A message left for Paul Dhaliwal was n't returned .
The alleged shoplifting incident is n't his first brush with the law .
In February , both he and his brother , Kulbir Dhaliwal , 24 , who also survived the tiger attack , were in court to seek the personnel records of San Jose officers who arrested them after they scuffled with police on Sept .
7 . But at a hearing Friday , the defense withdrew that motion , said Stuart Scott , a Santa Clara County deputy district attorney .
An attorney for Paul Dhaliwal did not return a call for comment .
After that incident , both men were charged with public intoxication and resisting arrest , both misdemeanors .
Paul Dhaliwal was also charged with misdemeanor battery on a police officer .
The brothers were arrested after they allegedly refused to cooperate with officers who reported seeing them chase two men down the street , according to police reports .
Paul Dhaliwal is accused of hitting an officer in the chest with his forearm as the officer tried to restrain him , leading to the battery charge .
He stopped resisting only when an officer held a stun gun to his neck and threatened to use it , according to a police report .
Kulbir Dhaliwal cursed at officers while kicking the security partition in a squad car , forcing police to pull him out and put him in leg restraints , the police report states .
In February , Paul Dhaliwal pleaded not guilty to marijuana possession after being cited Dec. 21 for allegedly having 1.8 grams of pot in his pocket while in the parking lot of a Milpitas hotel .
He had been placed on probation three days before that incident after pleading no contest to felony reckless driving and other charges for leading police on a 140 mph chase on April 28 , court records show .
We are all familiar with the congestion and infinite amount of things that are going simultaneously at the airport .
On really busy days , we carry our heavy bags , search for the gate , take off our shoes , remove the laptop from our bag , put the laptop back in our bag , put our shoes back on , and continue to lug our baggage with us .
Would n’t it be pretty cool if we at least could get rid of the burden of having to carry our luggage or suitcases ?
We could always wait for Tony , the robotic luggage to come around and help us or use the RoboPorters in Japan .
Newly added for passengers arriving at Kita Kyushu airport are RoboPorters to assist with your bags .
I do not mean an actual , sometimes smiling , human being , but an emotionless robot that will help you lug your bags to their destination .
This could be done in two ways : either tell it where the bags need to go , or use its onscreen map to mark the destination .
At first thought I saw this as the lazy man ’s amenity , but at second thought … why not ?
Our luggage are sometimes so heavy , and hundreds of things are going through our mind , including phone calls , time tables , co-travelers , and more .
We kind of deserve to be able to focus on the things that we have to do ourselves .

We recently acquired what might be the worst toaster in the history of the world .
It ’s pretty fancy and shiny and microprocessor controlled .
And it makes toast .
But here ’s what I have to do to use it :
Choose the number of slices , and bagel or bread .
Remember whether it counts the slices from the left or the right ( the left ) .
Insert the bread .
Push down the handle .
Choose toast or defrost .
Make sure the darkness level is right .
( This does n’t count , because it usually is ) .
Press on .
Wait till it beeps .
Lift the handle I pressed in # 4 .
Turn it off .
Most toasters , of course , consist of steps 3 and 4 only .
I thought about this when I got a note from eBay asking me to pay my bill for an item I sold last month .
It says :
To view your invoice and make a payment :
1. Go to http://www.ebay.com and click " My eBay " at the top of most eBay pages .
You will need to sign in .
2. Click the " Seller Account " link ( beneath " My Account " on the left side of the page ) .
3 . Click the " View invoices " link , and then select the invoice you want to view from the pull - down menu .
4 . To make a payment , click the " make a one - time payment " link in the " eBay Seller Fees " section .
It took me more than 11 clicks to send them $ 6 .
The opportunity online is to fix your toaster .
When you want to make toast , the site should get out of the way and let you make toast .
Clinton plays up duck hunting experience before Wisconsin contest Michael Roston
Published : Tuesday February 19 , 2008
|
Print This Email This Hillary Clinton may be aiming to win primary contests in Wisconsin and Hawaii this Tuesday , but on the campaign trail in recent days , it was her duck hunting experience that she wanted voters to pay attention to .
According to the LA Times , Clinton first brought up her hunting experience in a campaign speech over the weekend .
And on Monday , she offered more details of the time she succeeded in shooting a duck .
" They wanted to embarrass me .
So , OK , the pressure was on .
So I shot , and I shot a banded duck , " she said in an appearance .
" And I was as surprised as they were . "
When a voter joked that she might teach Vice President Cheney , who accidentally shot friend Harry Whittington in the face while quail hunting , how to use his rifle , Clinton added in her own crack .
" Once he 's out of the office and the Secret Service is not around to protect people from him , we better be careful about where he goes hunting , " the New York Daily News ' Michael McAuliff quoted her saying .
" A little gun-safety protocol would be useful , do n't you think ? "
In a country where some voters value the Second Amendment more than any of the other protections guaranteed by the Bill of Rights , presidential candidates have had to tread carefully when discussing their experiences with firearms .
When questions were raised about Democratic Senator John Kerry 's commitment to defending the right to bear arms , the 2004 presidential candidate made photos available to the press of a duck hunting trip .
But Kerry 's public efforts made little difference to the National Rifle Association 's Political Victory Fund , which declared that the candidate " wants to ban guns in America . "
Clinton may face similar attacks .
Already the NRA 's Institute for Legislative Action speaks of " De- Clintonizing America , " warning that , " Hillary Clinton sits in the U.S. Senate while plotting a return to the White House . "
Democrats are n't the only presidential hopefuls who have been savaged for speaking too glibly about their limited hunting experience .
When former Republican candidate Mitt Romney called himself an experienced hunter on the campaign trail in early 2007 , he was forced to backtrack and admit that he had mostly shot " varmints . "
The explanation became a punchline on the trail for weeks afterward , likely harming perceptions of the candidate 's sincerity .
Video clips of Clinton 's appearance can be viewed at a Fox News blog .

また、2007年8月17日における 121.83.34.92 と 2007年10月25日におけ る 121.84.201.240 も近いアドレスとなっている。
さて、これらのIPアドレス（時刻とIPアドレスの組）を、WinnyネットワークのIPアドレスと突き合せてみた。
先月28日の日記に書いたように、2006年8月末からWinny稼動ノード数の観測を行っている。Winnyはアクセス制御機能を有しておらず、不特定多数から接続されるサービスであるため、2006年7月16日の日記に掲載したようなプログラムで、ノードを渡り歩くcrawlerを走らせることができる。このプログラムでは、接続時に公衆送信されてきたクラスタワードやキー情報などを観測し保存している。
残念ながら、2006年8月末より前のデータは持ち合わせていないので、2007年2月以降の6つのIPアドレスについて突き合せてみた。

これらは同一人物と推定される。
次に、これら期間中のこれらIPアドレスのWinnyノードから、どんなキーが公衆送信されていたか調べてみた。全部掲載するのは面倒なので、かいつまんで3つの期間についてのみ。
以下は、24時間に当該ノードから発信されたものとして受信したキーのうち、受信時刻、ノードアドレス、ハッシュ値、ファイル名を示しており、ファイル名の拡張子に異常が見られる（大量の空白で拡張子が偽装されている）ものを除いて、「〓」で一部を伏せた。なお、これらのうちの
4 % 程度は、Winnyの仕組み上「中継」によるものも含まれているので、必ずしもこれらの全部がこのノードで配布されていたとは限らない。
