THESE days , it ’s awfully hard to get on Harvey R. Miller ’s calendar .
A 75 - year - old lion of the bankruptcy bar , Mr. Miller has been consumed by the largest corporate liquidation in American history : Lehman Brothers , the storied investment bank that set off one of the most harrowing episodes in the financial crisis when it collapsed in mid-September .
Mr. Miller ’s workdays begin around 8 in the morning and , if he is lucky , end near 11 at night .
This combative , outspoken lawyer says that some days do n’t seem to end at all , but merely expand into the next , dissolving into tense meetings and complicated hearings in overheated courtrooms .
Although Mr. Miller has been involved in landmark bankruptcy cases before  including those of Eastern Airlines , R. H. Macy and Global Crossing  Lehman ’s is in a class by itself because of volatile markets , continuing government investigations , the involvement of federal regulators and a possible wave of other corporate implosions .
From his perspective as Lehman ’s undertaker , Mr. Miller believes that the fallout from the firm ’s messy bankruptcy could have been avoided .
Regulators could have stepped in , he says , not necessarily to save Lehman , perhaps , but to head off the meltdown that followed .
“ They totally missed it , ” he says .
“ Look what happened . ”
McNabb was 8 - for - 18 for 59 yards and two interceptions and a fumble -- a miserable 13.2 quarterback rating .
One week earlier , he threw three interceptions and lost a fumble in an overtime tie with Cincinnati .
After that game , the 10 - year veteran said he did n't realize an NFL game could end in a tie .
With the Eagles down 10 - 7 at halftime Sunday , Philadelphia coach Andy Reid turned to Kevin Kolb , a second - round pick who did n't throw a pass as a rookie last year and had attempted nine throws this season .
In fairness to McNabb , he did n't get much support from the running game :
The Eagles had 35 yards rushing in the first half , and McNabb had 7 of them .
Scientists at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem have succeeded in reversing brain birth defects in animal models , using stem cells to replace defective brain cells .
Neural and behavioral birth defects , such as learning disabilities , are particularly difficult to treat , compared to defects with known cause factors such as Parkinson ’s or Alzheimer ’s disease , because the prenatal teratogen – the substances that cause the abnormalities -- act diffusely in the fetal brain , resulting in multiple defects .
Prof. Joseph Yanai and his associates at the Hebrew University - Hadassah Medical School were able to overcome this obstacle in laboratory tests with mice by using mouse embryonic neural stem cells .
These cells migrate in the brain , search for the deficiency that caused the defect , and then differentiate into becoming the cells needed to repair the damage .
New brain cells ( green stain ) induced in the heroin damaged brain by transplantation of neural stem cells .
Generally speaking , stem cells may develop into any type of cell in the body , however at a certain point they begin to commit to a general function , such as neural stem cells , destined to play a role in the brain / nervous system .
At more advanced developmental stages , the neural stem cells take on an even more specific role as neural or glial ( supporting ) cells within the brain / nervous system .
In the researchers ’ animal model , they were able to reverse learning deficits in the offspring of pregnant mice who were exposed to organophosphate ( a pesticide ) and heroin .
This was done by direct neural stem cell transplantation into the brains of the offspring .
The recovery was almost one hundred percent , as proved in behavioral tests in which the treated animals improved to normal behavior and learning scores after the transplantation .
On the molecular level , brain chemistry of the treated animals was also restored to normal .
The researchers went one step further .
Puzzled by the stem cells ’ ability to work even in those cases where most of them died out in the host brain , the scientists went on to discover that the neural stem cells succeed before they die in inducing the host brain itself to produce large number of stem cells which repair the damage .
This discovery , finally settling a major question in stem cell research , evoked great interest and was published earlier this year in one of the leading journals in the field , Molecular Psychiatry .
The scientists are now in the midst of developing procedures for the least invasive method for administering the neural stem cells , which is probably via blood vessels , thus making the therapy practical and clinically feasible .
Normally , stem cells are derived from individuals genetically different from the patient to be transplanted , and therefore the efficacy of the treatment suffers from immunological rejection .
For this reason , another important avenue of the ongoing study , toward the same goals , will be to eliminate the immunological rejection of the transplant , which will become possible by taking cells from the patient ’s own body -- from a place where they are easily obtained -- by manipulating them to return to their stem cell phase of development , and then transplanting them into the patient ’s brain via the blood stream .
One important advantage of this approach will be to eliminate the controversial ethical issues involved in the use of embryo stem cells .
Involved in the project with Prof. Yanai are Prof. Tamir Ben-Hur , head of the Department of Neurology at the Hebrew University - Hadassah Medical School , and his group , as well as Prof .
Ted Slotkin at Duke University in North Carolina , where Prof. Yanai is an adjunct professor .
The research on the project has been supported by the US National Institutes of Health , the US - Israel Binational Science Foundation and the Israel anti-drug authorities .
CANBERRA ( Reuters ) - Lawyers in Australia expect the internet social network site Facebook to become a new way of tracking down defendants after a landmark court ruling .
The Supreme Court in Australia ’s capital Canberra has ruled that Facebook is a sufficient way of serving legal documents to defendants who can not be found .
The case surrounded a couple who defaulted on a loan , but who could n’t be found .
“ We could n’t find the defendants personally after many attempts so we thought we would try and find them on Facebook , ” lawyer Mark McCormack said .
“ We did a public search based on the email address we had and the defendants Facebook page appeared . ”
He said that was enough to convince the court , which found Facebook was a sufficient way of communicating legal papers when it is the plaintiff ’s responsibility to personally deliver documents .

20 months ago I wrote a post ( click here ) to recognize the successful efforts of The Innocence Project in exonerating 200 wrongly convicted ( 14 of which were on death row ) .
In the time between that post and this one , the Innocence Project has helped 25 more wrongfully convicted regain their freedom !
If this trend continues , we could see 275 + wrongfully convicted set free by the organization ’s 20th anniversary in 2012 .
While this is all very good news for these individuals and their families , much more needs to be done to prevent others from being victimized by the state .
Many states offer nothing with regard to compensation for the wrongfully convicted .
Of those which do , the IRS insists on collecting taxes from this compensation ( a complete moral outrage ) .
The Innocence Project is working to correct this injustice .
25 states do not have laws which require forensic evidence to be preserved post conviction .
For those who wish to appeal and challenge their convictions , the chances of proving their innocence are much dimmer .
One of the main reasons these states refuse to preserve biological evidence is the costs associated with storage .*
There are many other reforms which need to be made with regard to the use of informants ( who have an incentive to tell the authorities what they want to hear to shorten their sentences ) , government fraud and misconduct , and unsound science ( among other needed reforms ) .
I would also submit that it is time to revisit the issue of the death penalty .
We now have 225** reasons to demand a national moratorium on the death penalty ; 225 cases where the system failed , convicted the wrong person , and allowed the real perpetrators walk free .
Even one innocent person killed by the state is too many .
In closing , the following is statistical data about the 225 exonerations
In the Innocence Project ’s winter 2008 Newsletter : The Innocence Project in Print .
Innocence by the Numbers : Eyewitness Misidentification Percentage of wrongful convictions cases later overturned through DNA testing that involved eyewitness misidentifications 76 % Percentage of those misidentifications that were cross-racial 51 % Percentage of those cross-racial misidentification cases where a Caucasian witness ’ misidentification led to the wrongful conviction of an African - American or Latino defendant 90 % Percentage where an African - American or Latino witness ’ misidentification led to the wrongful conviction of a Caucasian defendant 1 % Percentage of all the misidentification cases where eyewitness testimony was the central evidence used against the defendant ( without other contributing evidence like false confessions , invalid or improper forensic science , or snitch testimony ) 20 % Percentage where more than one eyewitness misidentified the same innocent defendant 37 %
Highest number of eyewitnesses misidentifying the same innocent defendant 10 States where eyewitness misidentifications have contributed to a wrongful conviction 32 States that have passed reforms to improve eyewitness identification procedures 7 States Legislatures considering eyewitness identification reforms for 2009 12 and the District of Columbia
* If these states are so concerned with costs , why are they not concerned with building the “ storage space ” for inmates ?
** If one organization can prove that 225 individuals were wrongly convicted , there most certainly has to be many times more who remain in prison who will never will have their names cleared and will continue to serve time for crimes they did not commit .
Two weeks ago , I participated in a forum on how Obama should use technology .
It 's a topic loads of people are discussing these days ( including this excellent piece by Evan Ratliff ) .
During the panel , we could only come up with one good example of smart ways that the government had used web technology under Bush : the patent office 's peer - to - patent system , which crowdsources the patent - review process .
Afterwards , one of the conference attendees , sent me this long fascinating list of smart ways different federal agencies started using technology during the last eight years .
It 's not mind - blowing , but it 's not terrible .
More online innovation will likely happen in the first six months of the Obama administration than in the eight years of Bush .
But let 's give credit where credit is due .
Here 's some of the coolest stuff :
The FBI has built a Most - Wanted widget .
The TSA has an employee blog — about security .
The State Department has an internal Diplopedia to help diplomats share information with each other .
The CIA recruits on Facebook .
And , best of all , the Library of Congress now uses Flickr to show off some of its special collections and documents .
Read thewhole list here .

The majority of the corporate media has gleefully seized upon the terror attacks in Mumbai to claim that they are the work of “ Al - Qaeda , ” despite clear and contradictory evidence suggesting otherwise , as a pretext to increase bombing campaigns in Pakistan and beef support for the ailing war on terror in Afghanistan .
The swiftness with which the media blamed “ Al - Qaeda ” was staggering , especially considering the fact that the attacks had not even concluded before the boogeyman was whipped out of the closet once more to act as a poster child for the war on terror and allow the TV networks to show lots of blood , panic and authority figures pointing guns at people .
The only claim of responsibility for the attacks came from the “ Deccan Mujahideen , ” the Deccan Plateau being an area in southern India , but the press , usually breathless to take the first obscure claim of culpability and set it in stone , are now belittling this explanation as a likely hoax in an attempt to pin the blame on the all - mighty mythical Al - Qaeda .
“ Earlier eyewitness reports from the hotels suggested the attackers were singling out British and American passport holders , ” reports the BBC .
( ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW )
“ If the reports are true , our security correspondent Frank Gardner says it implies an Islamist motive – attacks inspired or co-ordinated by al - Qaeda . ”
Really ?
Perhaps the BBC’s “ security correspondent ” should be worried about his job security , because the facts directly contradict previous alleged “ Al - Qaeda ” attacks .
Since when do Al - Qaeda take hostages ?
Since when do they hang around to be caught ?
Since when do Al - Qaeda use grenades rather than bombs or suicide bombs ?
And if the attacks were targeted against British and American citizens then tell me why , out of at least 101 killed , was there only one British victim ?
If the attacks were targeted against British and American citizens then why were the terrorists reported to be firing AK - 47 ’s indiscriminately into crowds of ( mainly Indian ) people ?
Out of 101 victims , only six were foreigners , the rest were Indian .
This was blatantly not a targeted attack against British and American citizens , but it is being spun that way by the media so as to justify a coordinated British and American military response , which will no doubt take the form of more bombing raids inside Pakistan and an increased presence in Afghanistan .
The London Times are already busy proclaiming that yesterday ’s events were the work of Osama bin Goldstein , reporting , “ Targeting Bombay ’s most luxurious hotels and a crowded railway station had all the hallmarks of an al - Qaeda operation . ”
But voices of skepticism have broken through the firewall of fearmongering and propaganda .
“ Chrtistine Fair , senior political scientist and a South Asia expert at the RAND Corporation , was careful to say that the identity of the terrorists could not yet be known .
But she insisted the style of the attacks and the targets in Mumbai suggested that the militants were likely to be Indian Muslims – and not linked to Al Qaeda or the violent South Asian terrorist group Lashkar - e - Taiba , ” reports the International Herald Tribune .
“ There ’s absolutely nothing Al Qaeda - like about it , ” she said of the attack .
“ Did you see any suicide bombers ?
And there are no fingerprints of Lashkar .
They do n’t do hostage taking , and they do n’t do grenades . ”
“ Indians will have a strong incentive to link this to Al Qaeda .
‘ Al Qaeda ’s in your toilet ! ’
But this is a domestic issue .
This is not India ’s 9/11 , ” said Fair .
Terrorism expert Professor Bruce Hoffman agreed that the assault was “ not exactly Al Qaeda ’s modus operandi , which is suicide attacks . ”
“ The very name ( Deccan Mujahideen ) – if it is a real group – suggests a domestic agenda , ” adds the report , highlighting a probable link to the riots in Gujarat State near Mumbai six years ago ( alluded to in the claim of responsibility ) , which killed 2,000 Muslims .
But that ’s not how the media are portraying the event , hyping the situation beyond all proportion with a crazed obsession and linking it to Barack Obama ’s mandate to carry on the endless war on terror started by George W. Bush .
As Mike Rivero over at WhatReallyHappened.com points out , “ FOX News and CNN are now both reporting that the “ terrorists ” who took hostages at the Oberoi hotel were specifically seeking people with US and British passports .
So , regardless of whatever the “ Deccan Muhajedeen ” claims their objective may be , the real agenda is to provoke a British and US response . ”
“ The timing is suspect , occurring just when Bush needs an excuse to kick off one more war of Obama to have to deal with and certainly convenient timing for Israel , which sees Obama as far less likely to engage in more wars for Israel .
And , for the last several ; weeks Israel has been starving Gaza mercilessly , in advance of an obvious military action , and has kept reporters and even the Papel Envoy out of Gaza . ”
How long before the terrorist group is linked with elements of the Pakistani government , giving Obama the perfect pretext to prolong and expand bombing raids inside the country ?
Indeed , the London Guardian reports today , “ What is likely is that the attacks will get blamed on Pakistan and its Inter - Services Intelligence agency ( ISI ) , as have previous Islamist atrocities .
US counter - terrorism officials believe some ISI members played a role in an attack this year on the Indian embassy in Afghanistan . ”
In our first report on the events yesterday , we predicted that a Pakistan link would eventually be claimed as a reason for Barack Obama to increase U.S. aggression inside the country as he promised to do during his election campaign .
Reports are now emerging claiming that the terrorists arrived on speedboats from Karachi in Pakistan .
The claim of responsibility from the Deccan Mujahideen is being sidelined in favor of a more convenient culprit , the Pakistani Lashkar - e - Taiba militant outfit .
“ Hawkish elements in Pakistan stage - managed ( the ) terror attacks , ” claims one report , citing intelligence sources .
India ’s premier said those behind coordinated attacks against Mumbai were based “ outside the country ” and warned “ neighbours ” who provide a haven to anti-India militants .
This is obviously a reference to Pakistan .
The Mossad media front outlet Debka File are already proclaiming that the “ MV Alpha freighter ( is ) suspected of having sailed the terrorists to Mumbai ’s shore from Karachi , Pakistan . ”
The media is also exploiting the attacks to throw more weight behind the annual fearmongering about Al - Qaeda attacks on U.S. transport networks , a tediously regular piece of propaganda that crops up during every holiday season to remind Americans that they must submit to bag searches and other infringements on personal freedom while authority figures shove them around all in the name of keeping them safe from the terrorists .

* Photo : Emily Shur * Rob Roy 's Las Vegas outpost may remind you of a mega - casino :
It 's massive .
It 's full of blinking lights .
And its security guards will get rough if you step out of line .
But you wo n't find dealers shuffling cards here .
Instead , this facility shuffles bits — on an unprecedented scale .
Dubbed SuperNAP , it 's the world 's densest data center .
In the desert , far from any possible power - cutting natural disasters , Roy , CEO of Switch Communications Group ( and no relation to the Scottish vigilante ) , built a server farm the size of 11 football fields .
It eats 1,500 watts per square foot — almost eight times the industry standard — and houses more than 7,000 storage cabinets .
Its secret ?
Rather than placing its blade servers on racks and pumping cold air up through raised floors , Switch packs machines inside containers that draw in cool air and shoot hot exhaust out of the building .
" We invented a whole new world to get here , " Roy says .
Roy 's computer education began at 12 .
His father , paralyzed in a diving accident , was pursuing a degree in computer science , and Roy volunteered to type his papers and turn the pages of his books .
Twenty - seven years later , as more and more petabytes zoom into the data cloud , he sees his facility as home to tech 's most creative projects :
" We want neat , cutting - edge concepts going on in there — video , gaming , voice . "
But Roy tries not to take this stuff too seriously .
Consider the comic book he penned about his staff , Switchblades :
The Dark Ethereals have hacked into Earth 's ionosphere with a plan to destroy the Net !
Luckily , Roy , er , Core and his band of super - employees are here to save the day — and keep the world safe for truth , knowledge , and the entrepreneurial way .

A glut of opium on the world market , fuelled by a record Afghan harvest , threatens a new heroin crisis in Britain , the European Union 's drug agency warned yesterday .
The agency 's annual report also confirms that the UK remains at the top of the European league table of 27 countries for cocaine abuse for the fifth year in a row .
The UK accounts for 820,000 of the 4 million Europeans who have " recently used " cocaine .
But the agency also reports that there are " stronger signals " of the declining popularity of cannabis across Europe , especially among British school students .
Nevertheless the drug experts say that a quarter of all Europeans - 71 million people - have tried cannabis at some time in their lives .
The heroin warning from the European monitoring centre for drugs and drug abuse follows two record opium harvests in Afghanistan of 8,200 tonnes in 2007 and 7,700 tonnes this year .
The harvests represent 90 % of the world 's illicit opium production with Helmand province , the centre of British military operations , accounting for over half of the crop .
" While favourable weather conditions have boosted harvests , the recurrent conflicts , because of the destruction , poverty and general insecurity that they entail , are likely to be an important factor in explaining the increases in opium production , " says an agency study monitoring the supply of heroin into Europe .
The EU agency says that " alternative development " measures to persuade farmers to switch to other crops are having a very limited impact .
It says that in eastern Afghanistan insecurity , lack of water , poor roads and increases in fuel costs have combined with declining prices for legal crops such as onions , which may make it difficult to sustain reductions in poppy cultivation in the future .
In Helmand , where opium poppy continues to grow in abundance , the security situation including the threat of roadside robbery and the proliferation of insurgent checkpoints make it sometimes impossible to get legal crops to urban markets .
" The latest data , while showing an overall reduction in production , point to increasing production in southern Afghanistan , in particular in Helmand province , where around 70 % was produced in 2008 , " the study concludes .
The EU is worried that these record harvests threaten to end the " slowly improving " heroin situation in Britain and across Europe and reverse the decline seen in heroin - related deaths .
Seizures have doubled in Turkey , an important transit country , and are 20 % up in Britain .
The EU drug experts fear that the recent decline in heroin - related deaths in Britain - down from 2,171 in 2001 to 1,979 in 2005 - will be halted and even reversed as a result of a glut of much cheaper and possibly more potent heroin entering Britain .
" Current evidence does not point to an epidemic growth in heroin problems as experienced by most of Europe in the 1990s , " said the EU drugs agency director , Wolfgang Gotz .
" Nonetheless , we cannot ignore the threat posed by the glut of heroin now available on the world market , the concerns raised by indicators of heroin use , or signs that synthetic heroin may be a growing problem .
Vigilance is clearly required . "
Britain 's continuing position at the top of the league table of 27 EU countries for cocaine abuse is based on the fact that 12.7 % of young adults aged 15 to 34 have used the drug .
Typical cocaine users in Britain are now just as likely to be poor working class young men as wealthy City traders .
The latest school surveys show that 5 % of 15 - and 16 - year - olds have tried it .
Cocaine use in Europe is highest in Britain and Spain .
It has stabilised in both countries in recent years but at a level that is approaching American consumption .
The increasing number of Europeans using the drug - 4 million last year , the EU estimates - reflects its recent growth in Italy , Denmark and Ireland .
The growing popularity of cocaine has been matched by declining use of amphetamines .
There is encouraging news about cannabis consumption in Britain .
While the UK consistently had the highest levels of cannabis use among schoolchildren in the early and mid-1990s in this European survey , it has seen the sharpest decline in its popularity of any EU country .
Britain is now fourth in the Euro - league cannabis table amongst 15 - to 24 - year - olds , with 39.5 % saying they have tried it at some time , and 12 % saying they have used it in the last month .

Just kidding .

Really , really loud .
Fantastic !
One of the loudest I remember .
Very pro-Margarito . "
Will they be cheering at the end of the night ?
Stay tuned .
Saturday , 10:20 p.m. ET -- Shades of Hopkins - Trinidad ?
Just when I thought I 'd seen it all .
Check out Dan Rafael 's news brief .
Saturday , 10:10 p.m. ET --
Fight time
Boxing fans , this one 's been a long time coming .
Antonio Margarito vs. Shane Mosley .
Tijuana toughman vs. California cool guy .
Face - first brawler vs. wily veteran .
Joe Dirt mullet vs. clean - cut shape - up .
Let 'd do this !
As for a prediction : Margarito looked shredded at the weigh - in , but something tells me it'll take him a while to get started once he's in the ring .
When he gets rolling though , it 's only a matter of time before the energy - sapping body shots and neck - snapping uppercuts do Mosley in .
I 'll go with Margarito by Round 11 TKO , with Mosley 's corner stopping the fight .
Saturday , 10 p.m. ET --
Home stretch
Heavy - handed Russian Matvey Korobov just bludgeoned Jose Florentino to a first - round defeat , and with that brought down the curtain on the undercard bouts .
Only the main event remains .
The Staples Center crowd is already near to capacity , roaring as it watches every one of Korobov 's heavy blows replayed on the JumboTron .
It 's a nice atmosphere here and I 'm expecting a loud crowd when the main event fighters come out .
Can Shane Mosley turn back the years and the Tornado at the same time ?
Or will Margarito 's relentless aggression prove to match for the Sugar Man ?
Follow the action with Darius Ortiz 's round - by - round right here .
Thanks for sticking with me this week .
It 's been a pleasure , as always .
And with that , I hand you over to Mr. Ortiz .
Darius , take it away , my man .
Saturday , 9 p.m. ET -- Filling up
The Staples Center is still far from full , but it 's filling up rapidly .
There are already far more people here than would be in their seats at the same stage of a typical casino fight card .
A nice healthy buzz is building in anticipation of our main event , now about an hour away .
Saturday , 8:45 p.m. ET --
I 'm afraid of that Ghost
Robert Guerrero did n't display even a hint of ring rust despite his 10 month layoff .
A beautifully placed left uppercut to the liver dropped Edel Ruiz to the canvas for the count after 43 seconds of Round 1 .
Just a couple more bouts until the main event
Saturday , 8:35 p.m. ET --
Flashy
The signs that the ring card girls are holding up between each round are different than usual .
Instead of the usual printed deals , these are electronic LCD doo - hickeys , like they use at soccer matches when the coaches are about to make substitutions .
Sorry , I do n't have any photographs of the ring card girls to illustrate my point .
Saturday , 8:15 p.m. ET --
Broner forced to work for a win
Young Adrien Broner just came through the kind of fight that every young prospect needs .
The flashy lightweight from Cincinnati rocked opponent Jose Lugo with his fast , hard punches in Round 1 , but they make them tough in Los Mochis and Lugo dug in deep .
At times , Broner sensibly contented himself with circling and throwing in stinging punches from the outside , looking for openings when they presented themselves .
But even when he appeared to have Lugo in trouble again , the designated victim refused to topple , instead whacking Broner with some hard shots .
It also looks like Broner hurt his right hand in the final round ; he hardly threw it at all after shaking it following a hard punch .
In the end , though , the skill level was too great .
Taken the distance for the first time , Broner ran his ledger to 6 - 0 with a unanimous six - round decision , which the pro-Lugo crowd jeered .
Saturday , 8 pm. ET -- Viva Mexico
Antonio Margarito fans know how to make their presence felt .

It 's already pretty clear that this is going to be a very pro-Antonio Margarito crowd .
Every Mexican fighter is being cheered loudly , even the ones brought in to get beaten up .
Everyone else is being booed lustily .
Saturday , 7:40 p.m. ET --
And away we go
We are off and running here at Staples Center , with the first undercard bouts underway .
There was a nice crowd milling around outside the venue already as I walked in , and there is already a smattering of fans .
I have n't been to Staples much before , and I must say it 's an impressive venue .
Outside , it is the center of a range of bars , restaurants and other entertainment called LA Live that friends in the city tell me has gone a long way to revitalizing downtown Los Angeles .
Inside the arena , there are a couple of touches I 'm not used to -- luxury boxes specifically , not something you see at the MGM Grand or Mandalay Bay , but of course common with multi-sports facilities such as this one .
And the lower level seats seem nice and close to the action .
Meanwhile , I am settled in to Media Row 4 , Seat 11 , and we 're ready to blog the night away .
Saturday , 4:15 p.m. ET -- Darchinyan
Speaking his mind : Trash - talking Vic Darchinyan had the forum to himself during the news conference to announce his Feb. 7 fight with Jorge Arce .
Chris Cozzone/ Fightwireimages.com
Only one of the participants in Feb.
7 's 115 - pound title fight between Vic Darchinyan and Jorge Arce showed up for their scheduled news conference today .
" I see there is no table set for Jorge Arce , " Darchinyan promoter Gary Shaw said .
" I assume he 's not here , and he 's not going to be here .
I 'm sorry for the lack of respect .
Bob [ Arum ] says boxing 's not dead .
Maybe Arce 's career is dead . "
Darchinyan has rebounded impressively from his 2007 knockout defeat to Nonito Donaire , with a dominating stoppage of Cristian Mijares last time out .
Shaw compared Darchinyan 's defeat to Donaire to Lennox Lewis ' loss to Hasim Rahman , insisting that Darchinyan simply was overconfident and the loss would prove beneficial to his career in the long term .
Darchinyan himself was his usual , confident self .
" I wish Arce can give me a couple of good rounds before I knock him out I 'm going to demolish him badly and knock him out , " he said .
" The last fighter that said he was going to demolish and knock out one of my fighters out was Oscar De La Hoya , " countered Arum , Arce 's promoter .
" And you all saw what happened . "
Saturday , 4 p.m. ET -- TV Azteca
Top Rank and TV Azteca held a news conference at the Wilshire Grand this morning to formally announce their new TV deal .
" Everyone knows when Telefutura pulled the plug on its boxing programming , it left a big hole , " said Top Rank 's Bob Arum , referring to the demise of the popular but now deceased " Solo Boxeo " series .
But the new series , he insists , will be " bigger and better . "
The series does not yet have a name , and Arum said the final time slot and day of the broadcast have yet to be determined .
The likelihood is that the series will air on Saturdays , but will kick off with a show Friday , Feb. 6 , featuring Jesus Soto - Karass against Carson Jones .
The program will air simultaneously in the United States and Mexico .
The action will be called by Adrian Garcia Marquez and former junior middleweight titlist Raul Marquez .
Saturday , 2:30 p.m. ET --
A prediction for Shane
Sweet !
Some boxing pundits believe Sugar Shane Mosley has enough left in the tank to outbox Antonio Margarito .
AP Photo / Reed Saxon
Eric Rosas writes in to offer a prediction that goes against the grain of conventional wisdom :
I believe that the key to the fight for Shane Mosley will be his boxing ability .
Mosley is a far superior athlete and must use his skills in order to come up with a W .
Although he is the smaller man , big men can be beat by utilizing a higher work rate .
The game plan is simple : do what our pound - for - pound king ( Manny Pacquaio ) did to the Golden Boy .
Box him , turn him and pot - shot him and do it often !
Defense is the key against Antonio Margarito .
This seems to be a second coming of the Meldrick Taylor vs. Julio Cesar Chavez fight in my eyes .
I 'll be at the Staples Center and I am extremely excited to watch this fight !
Good luck Shane !
Saturday , 2 p.m. ET --
Ones to watch out for
Fight fans will want to keep an eye on amateur standout Matvey Korobov .
AP Photo / Nam Y .
Huh
I bumped into Dan Birmingham in the lobby of the hotel last night .
He 's best known as the trainer of Winky Wright and , formerly , Jeff Lacy ; tonight he 'll be in the corner of highly touted Russian super middleweight prospect Matvey Korobov .
Korobov is 2 - 0 with 2 KOs as a pro but has an extensive amateur career of over 300 bouts , including victory over fellow prospect Daniel Jacobs .
I 'm also looking forward to catching my third glimpse in the ring of young Adrien Broner , a lightweight from Cincinnati .
He has fast hands in the ring and a charismatic , relaxed way about him outside the ropes .
He is 5 - 0 with 5 KOs .
Saturday , 1:30 p.m. ET --
Let 's get ready to rumble
A capacity crowd of 18,000 is expected for tonight 's welterweight clash between Antonio Margarito and Shane Mosley .
According to Staples officials , tonight will be only the second time the arena has opened its upper seating for boxing .
The first occasion ?
Julio Cesar Chavez against Ivan Robinson in May 2005 .
Friday , 7:30 p.m. ET -- A happier Ghost
Two days before he fights Edel Ruiz in his first bout in 10 months , Robert " The Ghost " Guerrero already has the best result he could hope for , courtesy of his wife , Casey .
Reason to smile :
Things are starting to look up for Robert Guerrero .
Chris Cozzone / FightWireImages
" She got her blood tests yesterday , and the doctor says he can't find no more leukemia cells in her body , " he told me after he weighed in for his fight against Edel Ruiz on Saturday , the chief support bout before the welterweight title fight between Antonio Margarito and Shane Mosley .
" Man , that 's the best news I 've had all year .
All I 've done is I 've just smiled ear to ear since I heard that . "
Although promotional problems have also been involved -- Guerrero left Goossen Tutor and recently signed with Golden Boy -- a large part of the reason the former two - time featherweight belt holder has been out of the ring has been his desire to take care of Casey while she battled cancer .
" The one thing about being out 10 , 11 months , is I got to support my wife , I got to be with her through the treatments , helping her with the kids and being a husband to her .
I think it 's a blessing in disguise .
The only thing that counts is she 's healthy . "
In his previous two contests , Guerrero , then a featherweight titleholder , had knocked out Martin Honorio and Jason Litzau , building up something of a head of steam , but prior to taking time off had already decided to move up to 130 pounds .
" The extra four pounds makes all the difference , " Guerrero said .
" I did n't feel like I had to make weight .
I just stepped on the scales . "
Guerrero weighed in half a pound under the limit for Ruiz .
Should he be victorious on Saturday , Guerrero is already slated to appear on the attractive HBO March 7 tripleheader in San Jose , along with Joel Julio versus James Kirkland and Victor Ortiz versus Mike Arnaoutis .
Golden
Boy plans to line him for up for a title shot in his new division in short order .
Friday , 6:30 p.m. ET --
No cause for concern
Some confusion and controversy at the weigh - in .
Shane Mosley initially appeared to weigh in at 147 pounds , but commission officials ruled the needle had shifted to 147.2 , so he was asked to step off and back on the scale .
He did so , and the official weight was given as 147.2 .
No bones about it : Antonio Margarito had little trouble making the 147 - pound limit .
Chris Farina / Top Rank
Mosley went away to lose those two - tenths of a pound .
Meanwhile , Antonio Margarito weighed in at a surprisingly light 145.8 .
" I always make weight easily .
It 's his job to make weight .
It 's his problem , " said Margarito .
" Two - tenths of a pound does n't win or lose a fight , " protested Mosley 's colleague , Bernard Hopkins .
" That 's taking your underwear off . "
Five minutes later , Mosley returned and made weight .
Friday , 5:30 p.m. ET --
Before the weigh - in
There 's a nice crowd developing at the weigh - in at the Nokia theater across from Staples Center .
Despite the weather , there 's a decent turnout of fans to watch the event before the event .
Undercard fighters weigh in first , and Shane Mosley and Antonio Margarito will be on the scales just after 6 p.m. ET .
Friday , 3:30 p.m. ET --
How do they look ?
Chris Lamb writes in to ask :
Did you see anything at the press conference yesterday that leads you to believe that Shane Mosley is not distracted , and that -- maybe -- Antonio Margarito is a little bit complacent , and not quite as prepared as he should be !?
Honestly , Chris , I 've given up trying to glean information about fighters ' mental states from such things as prefight news conferences and weigh - in staredowns .
I 've found it 's easy to read too much into little things , and who knows what is going through a fighter 's head ?
I will say , though , Margarito looked supremely confident and relaxed .
Overconfident ?
Complacent ?
I do n't know .
He certainly gave Shane Mosley plenty of credit and acknowledgment .
As for Mosley :
He came across as he always does -- friendly , affable , mostly smiling .
As much as it is possible to tell when someone is wearing a suit , he does appear to be in terrific shape .
Then again , he always looks in tremendous shape .
Friday , 2:45 p.m. ET -- Dwelling on Oscar
Although Oscar De La Hoya attended the Wednesday news conference in West Hollywood for Saturday 's Affliction MMA pay - per-view , he was absent at Thursday 's news conference for the welterweight bout between Shane Mosley and Antonio Margarito , leaving Golden Boy duties to Richard Schaefer and Bernard Hopkins .
What could have been :
What if Shane Mosley , left , had n't rallied late against Oscar De La Hoya in their '03 rematch ?
Al Bello / Getty Images
Perhaps he did n't want boxing journalists to bug him about his future , or perhaps he did n't want to be a distraction , especially given the questions about Mosley having taken the drug EPO prior to their 2003 rematch .
That latter point raises an interesting question :
What if Mosley had n't taken EPO ?
Would he still have been able to rally down the stretch and overtake De La Hoya 's lead ?
What if he had n't , and De La Hoya had held on for the win ?
To take that one step further :
What if De La Hoya had been awarded the win almost everyone feels he deserved against Felix Trinidad ?
How different might the Golden Boy 's career look now ?
Of course , if every other fight had been exactly the same ( which it would n't have been ) there would still have been the controversial wins over Pernell Whitaker , Ike Quartey and Felix Sturm .
As good as De La Hoya 's career was , one wonders what more could have been .
Friday , 2:05 p.m. ET -- Random shouts of victory
Antonio Margarito can expect his usual throng of supporters to be cheering him to victory come Saturday .
Ethan Miller / Getty Images
Somewhat out of character , I spent the evening at one of the cooler spots in downtown L.A. last night : on the roof of The Standard hotel .
( You can tell The Standard is cool because its name is upside down on its signage .
If that does n't scream hip , I do n't know what does .
Wait , do people even say " hip " now ?
Am I just exposing my extreme lack of coolness ? )
Anyway , as I walked out of the elevator at the top , one of the folks who was getting into the elevator to head back down turned around , looked at me and shouted , " Margarito 's going to win ! "
I have no idea if he recognized me from my blog or whether it was just a random exclamation of the kind that people sometimes make .
Or perhaps it was my long - lost Uncle Elmer .
Or maybe it was Antonio Margarito .
Friday , 1:30 p.m. ET --
Another day , another weigh - in
It 's lunchtime for folks on the East Coast , morning here on the West .
I 'm sitting here with my daily enormo - coffee , waiting for the media room to open and the day to begin .
As a sign that this is n't quite a mega- event , the media room is relatively small -- just a few round tables with notepads and ( thoughtfully ) breath mints .
Yesterday , it was taken up mostly by Top Rank PR folks , examining a seating plan of the arena floor and going through their usual thankless task of assigning places for writers and photographers .
There was chatter about flights to Manila ; of upcoming fights ; of which media would be going to New York on Feb. 21 ( to watch Miguel Cotto fight Michael Jennings ) and which would be going to Youngstown , Ohio ( to watch Kelly Pavik against Marco Antonio Rubio ) the same day .
Early indications are , not surprisingly , that more people will be at Madison Square Garden than the Chevy Centre .
Yours truly is undecided .
I 'll pop my head in there shortly to see what 's what .
And then , of course , at 6 p.m. ET , we have the weigh - in .
Friday , noon ET -- More e-mail
As smart as Shane is and as much as he knows how to box , I see him squaring up too often in this fight and paying the price I can't see him " boxing " for 12 rounds and circling away from Margarito for 12 rounds Margarito will eventually catch up with him , and I think he stops Shane late in the fight .
Whether it be by the onslaught of body shots he 'll absorb , or that his legs and shoulders run out of gas , Mosely will be stopped around 11 rounds .
A differing opinion from Peter O'Leary of Boston :
Margarito seems to come in with his hands flailing when his opponent backs up .
Mosley needs to time him with some shots to keep him off balance .
I honestly think Shane still has what it takes to stop this guy .
Also , great move by Mosley with hiring Nazim [ Richardson ] ; he has a knack for finding flaws .
I never , ever would 've predicted the destruction of [ Kelly ] Pavlik by B - Hop [ Bernard Hopkins ] .
It goes to show you that if you have the right plan and stick to it , age can be just a number .
Friday , 9:30 a.m. ET -- Some e-mail
Christopher Leonard writes to kieranAKVegas@gmail.com :
What 's up , Kieran ?
Thanks for keeping us updated !
It seems like you 're not liking the atmosphere in Los Angeles compared to a Vegas fight , for the obvious reasons .
In your opinion , do fights seem to be better in places like Los Angeles with L.A. fighters , or in New York with megastar fighters ?
Vegas does n't seem like a good place for the real fight fans to me , but I 've never been there .
Youngstown fans get to see their favorite son , Kelly Pavlik , firsthand in February .
Jed Jacobsohn / Getty Images
Christopher , I enjoy covering fights in Las Vegas because I 'm so used to it -- I must have covered 30 or 40 there over the past five years or so -- and because the folks at the MGM Grand and Mandalay Bay do such a great job .
Plus , everything being on site makes life so much easier .
But I did n't mean to give the impression I 'm not digging the atmosphere here .
Now that the fight is just two days away , the hotel is filling up with fight folks , and it 's like yet another gathering of the boxing family -- a seriously dysfunctional boxing family .
I think it 's great for boxing and for fans to have more fights in places like L.A. and New York and Youngstown and Houston and Pensacola and St. Louis and Little Rock and Memphis , for that matter .
Not every fight has to be in Vegas .
As I mentioned in a recent podcast , I think only the very biggest fights should be in Las Vegas , and fans elsewhere in the country deserve more opportunities to attend big - time fights .
Thursday , 6:45 p.m. ET -- The Officials
The referee for Saturday 's bout will be Raul Caiz Sr. Judges will be James Jen-Kin , Maximo DeLuca and Nelson Vazquez .
And with that , we pause the blogging for the day .
We 'll be back with more tomorrow ; we plan to have an interview with Robert Guerrero , who is in the co-main event , and other news and information from around the fight center .
Until then .
Thursday , 6:30 p.m. ET -- Nazim Richardson's Plea
Nazim Richardson , longtime cornerman and now chief second of Bernard Hopkins , has been training Shane Mosley for his welterweight title tilt with Antonio Margarito on Saturday .
Will boxing pundits still be calling Antonio Margarito a monster if he loses to Shane Mosley ?

" I know my position , " Richardson said .
" My position is not to teach Shane Mosley how to fight .
Jack Mosley did that and did a great job .
My job is to find holes in Antonio Margarito and exploit them . "
Afterward , sitting with Mosley as his fighter talked to journalists , Richardson made this request :
" After this fight , please do n't de-fang , do n't de-claw Margarito .
I do n't want anybody to say he was exposed .
You say he 's a monster ; let him be a monster after the fight also .
After this fight , put Shane back to where he belongs .
Margarito's a beast , nothing less .
So when Shane Mosley beats him , recognize who Shane Mosley is . "
Thursday , 6:10 p.m. ET -- Margarito
Antonio Margarito sure does have the look of a superstar about him these days ; he 's got that ultraconfident swagger of a man who truly believes he can't be beat .
He 'll smile plenty , and he clearly loves the fact that he is getting his due , but he 's all business as well .
" We came here , we did our work , " he said .
" We know Mosley 's a very good fighter , we know he 's a very experienced fighter .
There 's no secrets here ; we know each other very well .
I prepared myself very well and I 'm confident I 'm going to win this fight . "
Thursday , 6:05 p.m. ET -- Mosley
The thing about Shane Mosley is , he always looks like he 's just happy to be here .
You would never imagine he is preparing to go into unarmed combat ; it 's almost like he's at a high school reunion and Antonio Margarito is an old classmate .
That said , it was interesting to see his lawyer Judd Burstein sitting next to him , in case anyone asked questions relating to matters that rhyme with MALCO .
And Mosley was n't afraid to assert , through the smiles , that he will be victorious Saturday .
" I do n't just feel sharp ; I feel special , " Mosley said .
" I feel like I have a cape on .
I feel like I 'm going to fly .
Margarito has power , but I got him a little bit on speed . "
" I think this is going to be a great fight , " he continued .
" I just can't wait to get in the ring .
I think a lot of people are going to be surprised at the result of this fight . "
Thursday , 6 p.m. ET -- The News Conference
In a break with tradition , today 's news conference for Saturday 's Shane Mosley - Antonio Margarito bout was open to the public .
There was n't exactly an avalanche of attendees , but there was a nice sprinkling of folks to cheer on their respective fighters .
It makes for a more lively atmosphere , especially as , frankly , we generally get most of our quotes afterward , when we talk to the fighters individually , so a little bit of shouting and cheering during the newser itself does n't hurt .
As usual , Top Rank president Bob Arum said some words , Golden Boy CEO Richard Schaefer reciprocated , Dean Lohuis of the California commission and Kery Davis of HBO said their thing and Robert Guerrero ( who is fighting in the co-main event ) talked for a little .
Bernard Hopkins , left , knows a thing or two about foiling plans and pulling upsets .
Al Bello / Getty Images
Bernard Hopkins , president of Golden Boy Promotions East , mostly talked about Bernard Hopkins .
He 's still stung by the fact that so many media picked him to lose to Kelly Pavlik .
" All you experts who say certain fighters should quit , well , I think maybe some of you journalists are n't as good as you used to be and should retire , " he smiled .
He advised against writing off Mosley because of his age ( because the same mistake had been made in advance of Hopkins ' fight versus Pavlik ) , and compared Antonio Margarito to Felix Trinidad ( who , said Hopkins , was " knocking out everyone until he met some guy called The Executioner . " )
But he does have a point ; I think there are times when we , as media and as fans , tend to predict a boxer 's next fight based solely on his previous fight .
And it does n't always work that way .
Thursday , 5:50 p.m. ET -- Schaefer 's Not Buying It
Golden Boy Promotions CEO
Richard Schaefer , representing Ricky Hatton 's interests in the proposed fight with Manny Pacquiao , is n't buying Bob Arum 's renewed optimism over the fight 's future .
" I have no reason to believe that I 'm going to get a signed deal on my desk , " he said .
" I think it might be wishful thinking by some people , but I have no indication that Pacquiao 's going to sign .
Arum 's telling me it 's going to happen , but you know Bob 's told me for the last 10 days , every morning , ' Tomorrow morning you 're going to have a signed contract . '
I do n't blame Bob , because Bob was told by the people in the Philippines , and guess what ?
They 're telling him the same thing .
What do you think ? "
As for the suggestion that the difference this time might be that Arum has said he could fly to the Philippines ?
How long can Ricky Hatton wait for Manny Pacquiao to sign on the dotted line ?
Ethan Miller / Getty Images
" He probably wo n't show up , " said Schaefer of Pacquiao .
" Bob has n't been able to talk to him for two weeks .
Freddie Roach has n't been able to talk to him for two weeks .
It 's more games .
It 's what they like to do -- play games .
They have a track record ; I 'm not making this stuff up .
You guys all know it .
The guy likes to play games . "
And if an agreement did show up ?
Would Hatton still be interested ?
" I talked to Ray Hatton [ Ricky 's father ] about that , and he made it quite clear that they want me to go full steam ahead with negotiations for the other potential megafights .
They have conversations with Wembley Stadium for a summer showdown .
Our press tour next week is canceled .
The bottom line is , if I have a signed contract in front of me , I will call Ray Hatton and I do n't know what he will say .
I do n't . "
Schaefer cited Oscar De La Hoya , Floyd Mayweather or the winner of the Feb. 28 bout between Juan Manuel Marquez and Juan Diaz as possible opponents .
And so it goes .
With that , we 'll return to the actual fight that is going ahead Saturday .
Thursday , 5:45 p.m. ET -- Arum Says
It 's Back On
Less than twelve hours after stating that the Manny Pacquiao - Ricky Hatton fight was " dead , " Bob Arum today told journalists it looked like it was back on , and that he planned to fly to the Philippines and talk to Pacquiao directly .
" This has been a cultural experience for me , " he said .
" If there is any fault , part of it is mine because you have to treat different cultures differently .
You can't give a Filipino a deadline , you can't back him against a wall , because you 're threatening his masculinity , " he rationalized .
Arum said the fight would still be held at the MGM Grand on May 2 , as originally planned .
Given that all sides had declared the deal over with yesterday , what happened to change things ?
Did Pacquiao's people reach out ?
" The talks were never dead , baby , " asserted a man who has never been afraid to contradict himself when necessary .
" We 're texting like mad all the time .
Text , text , text .
It 's free now , that 's how you do things now .
Text , text , text . "
Had there been any contact with Floyd Mayweather 's people about Money May stepping in to the breach ?
" The chances of Floyd Mayweather staying retired are very slim , " said Arum , who alluded to the fighter 's alleged financial difficulties .
" But I 'd like him to show some balls and fight [ Antonio ] Margarito . "
Thursday , 4:30 p.m. ET -- A Reminder
Do n't forget to keep those e-mails coming about Saturday 's fight .
Send them
here and I 'll use as many of them as I can .
Thursday , 4 p.m. ET -- Arum on Mosley
Top Rank president Bob Arum says he is looking forward to this Saturday 's blockbuster welterweight title bout between his guy , beltholder Antonio Margarito , and challenger Shane Mosley .
Bob Arum feels Shane Mosley , left , has little hope of defeating Antonio Margarito .

" It 's going to be a great fight , a great event , " he smiled ( inasmuch as Arum smiles ) .
He has little doubt , though , that his fighter will prevail .
" I talked to Richard Schafer [ CEO of Golden Boy Promotions ] , and he says Mosley is in great , great shape .
But based on how he looked in his fight [ a 12 - round knockout of Ricardo Mayorga , during which Mosley struggled at times ] , I think he 's a long shot . "
Thursday , 1:30 p.m. ET -- Oops
Turns out , I was wrong .
Turns out , it does rain in Southern California .
Turns out , it 's raining now .
The venue for today 's news conference has moved indoors as a result ; we 'll have news and updates from that as soon as we can get them to you , probably around 5 p.m. ET or so .
( The newser is scheduled to start around 3 p.m. ET ) .
Thursday , 11:30 a.m. ET -- Arum on Pacquiao
Just when I thought I was going to pass the entire week without seeing or hearing anyone else associated with Saturday 's card , I bumped into Top Rank president Bob Arum outside the hotel .
Although Saturday 's Antonio Margarito - Shane Mosley battle is obviously at the forefront of everyone 's minds , Arum has spent a good deal of the past days and weeks attempting to rescue the putative May 2 clash between Manny Pacquiao and Ricky Hatton .
Up in smoke : Manny Pacquiao's proposed showdown with Ricky Hatton is a dead deal , according to Bob Arum .

Negotiations for the fight finally broke down Wednesday due to an impasse over purse percentages .
Pacquiao wanted a 60 - 40 split in his favor , Hatton wanted 50 - 50 , and although there was some movement on the part of Hatton 's people , it was n't enough to satisfy the PacMan .
" I 've been through it all before , " Arum said , shrugging off the sputtering negotiations .
" That 's why I never spend the money until I have it .
" I 'm really surprised the kid did that , " said Arum , who promotes Pacquiao , referring to the Filipino 's failure to sign an agreement that Arum and others felt was highly beneficial to both parties .
" I thought there was posturing , but that we'd get the fight done . "
I asked Arum if he would keep the May 2 date anyway .
" No , why the hell would I want to keep the date ? " he replied in his inimitable way .
" To match him with some nobody ?
He could maybe fight [ contender Edwin ] Valero , which I think is a dangerous fight , but we can't do that in Nevada . "
( Valero is not licensed to fight in Nevada because of previous brain scan irregularities ) .
What if Pacquiao changed his mind and decided to go ahead after all ?
Could the fight be resuscitated ?
" It 's dead , " said Arum .
" Hatton 's people are going in another direction . "
Thursday , 9:45 a.m. ET -- Ready to Go
Folks are always interested to know what the atmosphere is like leading up to fight night .
When the fight is held in a location separate from the main hotel , as it is here , it 's sometimes difficult to say .
In Las Vegas , fans generally stay in or near the casino that is hosting the fight ; in Los Angeles , the fight is at Staples Center while the principal base for everyone associated with the card is here at the Wilshire Grand .
Visitors could be staying anywhere , though -- and probably wo n't be arriving until later in the week anyway .
Add to that , of course , the fact that there will certainly be a strong contingent of Angelenos in the crowd , and they wo n't be showing up until fight night at Staples .
As for whether there is a buzz in the neighborhood -- well , yes , it 's Los Angeles .
But , particularly because I arrived early , I wondered for a while if I had been the victim of a practical joke , whether everyone else was partying at the Sheraton down the street .
I kept thinking I saw familiar members of the boxing circus in the lobby , only for them to morph into somebody completely different as I approached .
The only person I 've seen regularly is some guy whose room is at the opposite end of the corridor to mine .
I swear , every time I open my door and head for the elevators , he does the same .
It 's freaky .
Either I 'm being tailed by a really bad spy , or I 've somehow woken up in a David Lynch movie .
Wednesday , 5:30 p.m. ET -- More Tomorrow
The pace picks up tomorrow , with the final prefight news conference and the opening of the media center .
We 'll be there blogging , so please send the e-mails .
Wednesday , 4:30 p.m. ET -- More E-mail
Keep those e-mails coming .
We 'll be using them over the next several days .
Brian Hammett writes from Montana :
Mosley has a great chance of winning if he boxes from the outside .
Basically , stick and move for 12 rounds and try not to get caught up in a slugfest with Margarito .
If Mosley tries to slug it out with Margarito , I think he gets punished in about the same fashion that Cotto did .
We must all remember that Margarito has a granite chin and if you 're not conditioned to move for 12 rounds , he 's just gonna walk you down and pound at you until you fold to his iron fists .
Lastly , if Mosley loses , I really think he should hang up the gloves for good .
If he can't beat the second - best welterweight , then he surely does n't stand a chance against Clottey , Williams or even a rematch with Cotto .
I also think Berto might be too quick for him , too .
Mosley has a lot of ring years and he 's getting old .
He can't fight at that elite level anymore , and he needs to call it a day like Oscar and Calzaghe .
Wednesday , 4 p.m. ET -- Your E-mail
Joseph Rodriguez from San Antonio writes in to offer his thoughts on Saturday 's WBA welterweight title bout between titleholder Antonio Margarito and " Sugar " Shane Mosley :
This is my take : I think Margarito has to overcome both the inevitable rust and weight loss .
Rust can be worked off after a few rounds .
The weight loss and six months of inactivity , which I believe is the longest of his career , will be more of a factor .
The outcome of this fight all depends on what type of fight Shane Mosley fights .
No disrespect to Margarito , but he is and has been a one - dimensional fighter .
His greatest asset is that no one fights his type of dimension better than him .
My pick is a Margarito [ split decision ] .
Shane is n't disciplined enough to box and use his foot - and hand - speed advantages and will trade .
However , I do n't think Mosley loses by KO .
Not today and not ever .
Wednesday , 2:30 p.m. ET -- The Steroid Thing
Recent controversy concerning Shane Mosley 's use of performance - enhancing drugs before his rematch with Oscar De La Hoya in 2003 has not , says the former champion , derailed his preparation .
" Actually , I put that stuff aside since 2004 , " he said .
" People want to bring it up , and I do n't even listen .
I do n't listen to it ; I put it all aside .
You know if I have to sign something on that , that 's it but I put that in my shelf , that 's somewhere in another field .
I do n't even actually I do n't even know nothing about what 's going on right now about that , I do n't even listen to it .
My whole thing is Margarito .
I do n't even care . "
Mosley hinted at retirement after his defeat at the hands of Miguel Cotto in November 2007 .
But he now says he can envision fighting for as long as another five years .

Wednesday , 12 p.m. ET -- A Long Road Ahead
Shane Mosley seems serious about his talk of rejuvenation .
Although most observers figure that Mosley , while still a legitimate contender , is clearly in the final year or two of his career , the man himself -- who had earlier hinted that his defeat at the hands of Miguel Cotto in 2007 might be his last bout -- says he plans to keep on keeping on .
" I kind of take it on a fight - by - fight basis , but I can see myself going for another four , maybe five years 2013 , 2014 , something like that , " he said recently .
" [ Until I'm ] around 40 years old , 39 , 40 , somewhere in there . "
Wednesday , 11:30 a.m. ET -- Mosley Changes Trainers
Shane Mosley insists he is fully focused on WBA welterweight title holder Antonio Margarito , whom he meets at Staples Center here in Los Angeles on Saturday night -- and that he will need to be , given Margarito 's ferocity in the ring .
But were Mosley to be in any way distracted , he would certainly have good cause .
For the second time in his career , Mosley has cut professional ties with his father and trainer , Jack .

For one thing , he is reportedly in the midst of marital discord .
In addition , for the second time in his career , Mosley has dumped his father , Jack , from his corner ( the first time was after Winky Wright defeated Mosley in 2004 ) , in favor of Bernard Hopkins ' confidant and trainer Nazim Richardson .
" I just needed a different look , and me and my father were butting heads a little bit .
I just needed a different change of pace and stuff , and I think that has worked out very well , " Mosley told reporters last week .
" You know with Nazim , he trains fighters that are amateurs and professionals .
So he has both backgrounds , and sometimes when we turn pro we start forgetting different things about some of the things that got us to where we were at as the champions , [ we ] start lagging on different things .
" And I think that with his knowledge of training fighters on both sides of the spectrum , he has a broad view of everything .
He sees a lot of different things , he watches a lot of films , watches a lot of fighters fight -- like I said , amateur and professionally .
So I think that kind of rejuvenated me , bringing me back to life . "
Wednesday , 11 a.m. ET -- It Never Rains in Southern California
After several cold weeks in Washington , D.C. , it 's nice to be in the balmy environs of the City of Angels for a few days , and back into the big - fight swing of things .
Not that I necessarily needed to be here quite so early , as it turned out .
Because I have largely covered only pay - per-views over the past couple of years , I 'm used to the final prefight press conference being held on the Wednesday of fight week .
Holding the presser earlier in the week allows for an extra day of media coverage , an extra day to sell the fight .
But this Saturday 's Antonio Margarito - Shane Mosley clash is on HBO World Championship Boxing , so the press conference will be held Thursday , across the street from the Staples Center , where the fight will be held .
The weigh - in will be Friday afternoon , as usual , and Saturday morning will see a pair of news conferences , to formally introduce the Top Rank / TV Azteca television deal and to kick off the final buildup for the Feb .
7 Vic Darchinyan - Jorge
Arce fight .
Given some of Darchinyan 's proclamations so far , the presser should be lively and entertaining -- and of course , we 'll have plenty of updates .
Wednesday , 10:30 a.m. ET -- The Case for Antonio Margarito
• Margarito is a beast .
He is strong and relentless .
Is there any way Mosley can hold him off ?
• Margarito is a tall , strong welterweight .
Mosley has traditionally had problems with taller , stronger fighters .
( See : Wright ; Forrest , Vernon . )
• Although Mosley is a fast , skilled boxer , he is also a fighter .
Especially as he has aged , he has shown a willingness to stand flat - footed and trade .
Will he do that against Margarito , and if he does , will it prove to be a disadvantage ?
• Since 1996 , Margarito is 22 - 1 with one no -contest as a welterweight , and 28 - 2 with one NC overall .
Since 2005 , he has beaten Kermit Cintron ( twice ) , Joshua Clottey and Miguel Cotto .
Mosley 's last world - title win was a close points decision over Oscar De La Hoya in September 2003 , and that win has been tainted by his admitted use of performance - enhancing drugs beforehand .
That means his last legitimate win in a world - title bout came against the overmatched Adrian Stone in July 2001 .
• What about all the external distractions buzzing around Mosley ?
He has separated ( professionally ) from his father for the second time ; there are the questions about steroids .
Has any of this affected his preparation for the fight ?
Wednesday , 10 a.m. ET -- The Case for Shane Mosley
• Mosley has faster hands than Antonio Margarito and Miguel Cotto , whom Margarito just defeated .
• Cotto fought in a way that made him especially vulnerable to Margarito :
Firing off punches , then retreating ; and leaning forward as he retreated , leaving himself especially vulnerable to Margarito 's patented uppercuts .
Mosley does n't -- and wo n't -- fight that way .
• Mosley has a world - class chin .
He buckled under pressure against Cotto , but came back to finish strong when the two men fought at Madison Square Garden in 2007 .
• Mosley has the experience , foot speed and hand speed to trouble Margarito .
He can keep the Mexican turning and prevent him from being able to pound away at him , the way Mosley was able to against Cotto .
• Margarito is basking in the glow of his victory over Cotto .
There have been some rumors that it has been a struggle for him to boil himself down to 147 .
Has he taken his eye off the ball ?
Wednesday , 9:30 a.m. ET -- Margarito Talks to the Press
After Shane Mosley had spoken with the media , Antonio Margarito had some things to say , too :
" I really do n't see that I have any advantages anywhere against him , I just think that my preparation , the way I work , the way I always come prepared for fights , that will carry me over .
I know what I need to do to win fights , and I always come to do that .
They say Mosley is old and all of this I really do n't see it .
I think he 's a great champion , I think he 's a great fighter and I 'm not going to underestimate him .
I know what he 's done and I 'm coming in prepared because I believe this is my moment , this is my time to shine .
With his TKO victory over Cotto in their WBA welterweight title fight in July , Margarito entered a new stratosphere in boxing .
Ethan Miller / Getty Images
" Without a doubt , the Cotto fight was the best win of my career because he was , at the time , probably the best welterweight in the world .
So my beating him obviously was the biggest fight , because now I 'm the best one .
" You know , everywhere I go now it seems like I 'm coming up to people , everybody wants my autograph , everybody wants to take a picture with me .
I think it is more people coming up to me , and I think you can see that reflection on my popularity with the way the tickets are selling .
I think without a doubt I 've taken another step in my career . "
Wednesday , 9 a.m. ET -- Mosley Talks to the Press
Shane Mosley spoke with reporters via conference call late last week .
Some excerpts and highlights :
" If Margarito 's body is open and he 's giving it to me , then I 'm going to take it .
We definitely worked on that , and when you fight guys like Margarito you have to work on everything .
You can't just work on boxing and movement , you have to work on punching as well , and targeting different spots of the body , different parts of the head .
" I 'm not particularly trying to run away from his pressure , I 'm trying to get my shots in , too -- but when I want to get them down , not when he says , ' Oh , you know , we want to fight now . '
Maybe I do n't want to fight in that second , maybe I want to turn the corner and then fight again .
" You know , I probably even feel more confident and comfortable than I did when I fought Oscar the first time .
I feel comfortable and I 'm confident that I 'm going to do my job .
I 'm confident that I 'm going to look spectacular .
I 'm confident that I 'm going to be at my best .
I 'm confident that the fans around the world are going to be surprised and they 'll be shocked .
So I 'm just very confident , and I 'm trying not to be too confident and
trying to keep my level head before I get into the ring . "

December 30th , 2008
I used to think that I could mentally handle any subject matter , no matter how horrible .
What could be worse than what happened to Native Americans ?
The Soviet Union under Stalin and then what the Russians went through during World War II ( estimates of the number of dead vary by millions ) ?
The extermination programs of the Third Reich ?
Rwandan genocide …
On and on .
I was able to put these subjects in a sort of manageable , academic box .
I could write papers about these things , discuss foreign policy failures , etc. blah blah without too much difficulty .
Some might call it clinical detachment .
Objectivity .
Whatever .
Later on , however , as I started to research trauma induced mind control , I also started to stumble over stories related to human trafficking and crimes against children .
You may or may not have noticed that I do n’t post much about human trafficking and crimes against children .
It ’s not that I ’m not aware of these stories ( I am ) .
For the first time , with these topics , I found myself wanting to un-read what I was reading , and I could n’t .
There is palpable , opaque , murmuring evil in the world , and this shit , in my opinion , offers a crystal clear view of it .
So , I ’m warning you , in the strongest possible terms :
If this topic is new to you , and you proceed , know that you run the risk of not being able to go back .
You never know how or when this stuff will haunt you , but it almost certainly will haunt you .
With the long preface / disclaimer / warning out of the way , I have just one question :
Which Texan was going to buy a young girl for three hundred thousand dollars ?
This is what happened to Shauna Newell :

Jennifer Feitz Missing From Norwegian Pearl Cruise Ship
The U.S. Coast Guard has been called in to assist in a search for missing Norwegian Pearl cruise ship passengerwho was previously identified as Jennifer Feitz .
The 36 year old woman was reported missing by her husband at 3:50 a.m.
Friday when he could n't locate her .
After a thorough search of the ship , it is now assumed the guest may have fallen overboard while the ship was at sea near Cancun .
The Norwegian Pearl left Miami on Sunday for a seven day western Caribbean cruise .
The search is centered about 15 miles east of Cancun , off the northeastern coast according to Petty officer 3rd Class Nick Ameen , a Coast Guard spokesman .
The Coast Guard dispatched an HU - 25 Falcon jet crew and a C - 130 fixed wing aircraft crew from Clearwater , Florida .
The Mexican government was also providing aid with the help of a helicopter crew and three water and ground surface crews .
This ship can accommodate 2400 guests with a crew of 1000 .
The cruise itinerary had stops in Roatan and Belize City earlier in the week .
The ship was docked in Cozumel from 8:00 a.m. until 5:00 p.m. on Christmas Day .
The ship was then headed for a day at sea on Friday with last port of call to be Great Stirrup Bay on Saturday before returning to Miami on Sunday .
UPDATE : We received an e-mail from a passenger who disembarked from the Norwegian Pearl when it docked back in Miami this morning .
This passenger said : " Well I was on the ship and it was very hush ... however before getting off the ship this morning , a Miami crime team was on dock prepping to board ..a lot of rumors circulated regarding the husband .
The cabin was taped off , etc .
A dating gameshow that was looping on the tv sets in the cabins that showed the couple participating was taken off the air ... probably protocol for such an event ... anyway ... however this turns out it looks all bad ... all bad !... condolences to the family .

Sorry , guys , but I have sinned and this is my penance .
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
Consumer prices fell in December for the third straight month , with plunging energy costs contributing to the drop , the government said Friday .
The Consumer Price Index , a measure of inflation , declined a seasonally adjusted 0.7 % from the prior month , the Labor Department said .
The CPI edged up 0.1 % for the full year of 2008 , the slightest annual increase since 1954 .
The core CPI , without volatile food and energy prices , was unchanged from the prior month , the government said .
Economists had expected a CPI decline of 1 % for December , and a decline of 0.1 % for core CPI , according to a consensus of expectations provided by Briefing.com .
The decline was narrower than the CPI 's record plunge of 1.7 % in November , which exceeded all other monthly declines since the government began tracking them in 1947 .
The core CPI was unchanged in November .
The December decline was driven by plunging energy prices , which fell 8.3 % , the government said .
Transportation costs also fell by 4.4 % .
The cost of food , beverages and housing was unchanged .
You may recall my championing the greatest soft drink ever created — Coca - Cola — in a previous Taste Test installment .
I stand by that statement , especially when Coke is compared to swill like Red Bull Cola .
That said , I do spend the occasional sultry moment with other sodas from time to time , heading over to Dr Pepper , Diet Coke , and lately some Sprite .
( Caffeine keeps me awake , because I 'm a huge pussy . )
On very rare occasions , when hope is in the air and things are looking bright after a long period of darkness , I will venture into the world of flavored colas .
Cherry Coke passes my lips maybe once a year , usually at Hot Doug 's , from the fountain , crisp and clean .
I 've also tried — as I 'm sure many of you have — varieties like Lime , Vanilla , and Black Cherry Vanilla .

Two things I hoped for but never thought I 'd live to see : orange - flavored cola and a black president .
And now here they are in one well - timed package : Jones Soda 's awkwardly named Orange " You Glad For Change " Cola .
( For those who do n't get the name , it 's a play on the old knock - knock joke that ends , " Orange you glad I did n't say banana ? " )
It 's January 20 , 2009 , the dawn of what most of us ( even you right - wingers ) hope will be a new day in America .
So why not kick - start the economy with some commemorative soft drinks featuring the face of Barack Obama , the so - called " Man Who Will Change Everything , Including The Way We Flavor Cola . "
( Okay , it 's just me who calls him that . )
If you still have a job and can afford to throw away $ 2 for 12 ounces of sugar water delivered in a limited - edition bottle , then Taste Test has the soda for you .

As a proud Hyde Parker and Obama supporter ( I saw the prez leaving his gym on his last day in town ! ) , I am predisposed to like this drink , even though the label explicitly says , " Barack Obama does not endorse Jones Soda and Jones Soda is n't affiliated with the President Elect . "
I understand that it 's a cash - grab , but I appreciate the effort — I 'd rather have a four - pack of Jones than a crappy Franklin Mint Obama coin in my house .
I also very much like orange flavoring in things , though not , strangely , orange soda itself .
Will Orange Cola spend four to eight years exceeding its promises , or will Orange Cola hit the ground running , only to leave America with a bad taste in its mouth and buyer 's remorse in the morning ?
( Jones Soda does not encourage analogies comparing the taste of its new drink to the success of the Obama administration . )
The taste : Not that exciting , to be honest .
They should 've just fucking gone for it , these Jones Soda people .
They obviously know how to go over the top :
Their cream soda is so sweet it actually causes Type - 2 diabetes in the glass bottles that contain it .
But instead , they took the opportunity of a people 's mandate and went pretty safely down the middle of the road .
( Do n't follow , Barack , do n't do it ! )
Many of our testers remarked that they would n't even know that " Orange You Glad " soda was supposed to be orange - flavored if they had n't been told .
( And if you squint , Barack is just really tan . )
It 's a decent cola with a bit of a zing , but hardly a paradigm - shifter .
It 's not as dynamic as our new president .
It does n't even have the charisma of Coca - Cola Classic , the JFK of carbonated beverages .
It does have a good - looking bottle , though .
But nothing can crush this air of optimism .
Nothing !

At the heart of pretty much every " paranormal " phenomenon you find some lonely , attention - seeking soul , or several of them , willing to put a spooky little twist on an otherwise boring story .

It 's also full of bullshit that people just make up to draw attention to themselves .
6 The Dyatlov Pass Incident
Continue Reading Below Advertisement
On February 2nd , 1959 , during the cold winter on Kholat Syakhl ( " Mountain of the Dead " ) in Russia , nine intrepid ski hikers decided to do what they do best , which is ski hike , whatever the hell that is .
On February 26th , the first of their very dead bodies turned up .
Man , who would have thought such a tragedy could strike on " The Mountain of the Dead ? "
Image courtesy of Noah Scalin
It probably did n't look like this , but can you imagine ?
But it was the discovery of the campgrounds that added the icing to the creepy - as - fuck cake .
The ski hikers ' tent was shredded .
The skiers were scattered around the grounds wearing either very sparse clothing or just their underwear .
Three of them were found with crushed ribs and fractured skulls , but no visible defense marks or other signs of a struggle .
Continue Reading Below Advertisement
Oh yeah , and one of the bodies was missing a tongue .
In case you were n't already on the phone with Mulder and Scully , trace levels of radiation were supposedly found on their bodies .
The official statement on what happened was about as vague and ass - covering as possible , saying it was caused by an " unknown compelling force . "
In laymen 's terms this means , " fuck if we know . "
The story has become an internet sensation over the years , with many people blaming aliens , and then ghosts , and then the yeti , or possibly all of them working in tandem .
" So we 're agreed then :
We tear up their tents , take a lady 's tongue , and never tell a soul . "
Continue Reading Below Advertisement
The Obvious Answer :
So there 's six things that freak people out about this one :
1 . The no -tongued woman
2 . A mysterious orange tan on the dead bodies
3 . The ripped tents
4 . The hikers ' lack of clothing
5 . The crushing damage done to three of the hikers
6 . The traces of radioactivity
The big fact that gets lost in the re-telling of this story is that the bodies were n't found until weeks later .
It 's not like somebody turned their back , then five minutes later all their friends were dead and half naked .
That makes the missing tongue a lot easier to explain .
As disturbing as it may be , the first thing a scavenging animal is going to go for is probably the soft tissue of an open mouth , especially if it still smelled like the burrito the hiker just ate .
Laying out in the sun surrounded by white snow for days also accounts for the weird tan .

The trauma and the destroyed tent points to an avalanche .
Their state of undress can be explained by paradoxical undressing , a known behavior of hypothermia victims when their brains start to freeze and malfunction .
In other words , it 's the kind of behavior you 'd expect from a group of injured avalanche victims wandering around in the middle of the night in the freezing cold .
What about the radioactivity ?
Or stranger details that turn up in some accounts , like orange lights in the sky ?
Well , there 's the fact that none of that stuff turns up in the original documents from the incident , and appears to have been added later by people who just can't resist making things spookier than they are .

It 's those later accounts that have stuck in the public memory , because so many of the original reports were destroyed ( this was the Cold War- era Soviet Union , which treated casserole recipes as state secrets ) .

The Department of Homeland Security in Action
04 January 2009
A Thai friend with whom I have traveled in Europe and Asia took time off from her job to meet me in Florida over the holidays .
This was a good time for me , as it was between reporting stints in the war .
My friend , Aew , had volunteered to work with me in Afghanistan or Iraq , but I declined because many people around me get shot or blown up .
So we were looking forward to spending some vacation time together .
She comes from a good family ; and one that is wealthier than most American families .
She did n’t come here for a job .
Well - educated , she has a master 's degree and works as a bank officer in Chiang Mai , Thailand .
Aew was excited about the prospect of visiting America for the first time , though she had traveled to many other countries and had the passport stamps to prove it .
She had no problem getting a U.S. visa , and she was paying her own way to fly .
Problems began when she entered the airport in Bangkok .
Aew had a one - way ticket to America , because we would travel back in the direction of the war before she would go home , but we did not know our exact itinerary , so she had n't bought a round - trip ticket back to Thailand .
Before boarding the flight from Thailand to America , Northwest Airlines required Aew to buy a return ticket for 53,905
Thai bhat , or about $ 1,200 for a return ticket , else they would not let her board the flight .
Aew paid by her credit card and pushed on .
Understandably , it raises suspicions when a foreign national does n't have a round - trip ticket in an age of massive illegal immigration -- even if that person is an educated professional with a home and career , and even though Aew has a ten - year visa to the United States .
Nevertheless ,
Aew paid approximately $ 1,200 for the return ticket , and so now had a return ticket .
That is how it began .
She boarded the jet , eventually landed in Japan and then Minneapolis , before the final leg to Orlando .
While thousands of people have canceled trips to Orlando due to the failing economy , Aew was coming with cash to spend in Florida .
We would go to Disney , Kennedy Space Center and many other places ; she'd be seeing the sights while I was meeting with military and other people in preparation for my upcoming return to Afghanistan for the long year ahead .
I first met Aew in Indonesia during a break from the Iraq war .
I had gone to visit the site of the murder of my friend Beata Pawlak , who , along with about two hundred other people , was killed in a terrorist attack on the island of Bali .
After meeting in Indonesia , Aew and I stayed in touch .
We traveled at different times to Singapore , Great Britain , Thailand and Nepal .
Yet when Aew landed in Minneapolis , she was hustled away by an immigration officer .
After approximately 24 hours of exhausting travel , Aew was detained for about 90 minutes without cause , and as a result , she missed her connecting flight to Orlando .
She was brought into a small room where she saw a camera peering down .
The officer conducting the shakedown wore a name tag : " Knapp . "
Five times she had traveled to China with zero problems , but Knapp grilled Aew with a long series of questions , rifling through her wallet , handling her credit cards and reading them carefully , questioning her piece by piece .
Her passport , thick with extra pages , showed stamps from countries around the world .
It contained the valid U.S. visa , and stamps and visas from countries she had traveled to , such as Great Britain , Japan , China , Nepal , Singapore , Indonesia , Myanmar , South Korea , Hong Kong , Malaysia , Brunei , New Zealand and Cambodia .
She had traveled to some of these countries on multiple occasions , always paying her own way .
She never had problems .
Not even in China .
We had toured Parliament together in London , on a private expedition led by Member of Parliament Adam Holloway .
Aew was very interested to see the Royal Family , and was beside herself when I met Lady Camilla , Duchess of Cornwall , who at that time read this website .
The British , including military officers , had treated her very well and she left with positive memories of Great Britian .
But that was Great Britain .
The American shakedown was just starting .
Her sister , Puk , was sending me SMS messages from Thailand , worried that Aew seemed to have disappeared .
I had bought Puk 's daughters , North and Nurse , who are 8 and 9 , a " talking globe " so they could track the travels of their Aunt Aew .
The last time I saw North and Nurse , we had taken them to the Chiang Mai zoo , and also to an elephant camp where the elephants paint .
Puk 's husband , Bey , is a high - ranking Thai police officer who , as part of his duties , helps organize security for the Thai Royal Family .
While the U.S. Immigration officer named Knapp rifled through all her belongings , Aew sat quietly .
She was afraid of this man , who eventually pushed a keyboard to Aew and coerced her into giving up the password to her e-mail address .
Officer Knapp read through
Aew 's e-mails that were addressed to me , and mine to her .
Aew would tell me later that she sat quietly , but “ Inside I was crying . ”
She had been so excited to finally visit America .
America , the only country ever to coerce her at the border .
This is against everything I know about winning and losing the subtle wars .
This is against everything I love about the United States .
We are not supposed to behave like this .
Aew would tell me later that she thought she would be arrested if she did not give the password .
The Government of the United States was reading the private e-mails of a U.S. citizen ( me ) .
The Department of “ Homeland Security ” was at work , intimidating visitors with legitimate visas .
They had at least 24 hours to check her out before she landed in the United States .
What kind of security is this ?
The Department of Homeland Security was at this moment more like the Department of Intimidation .
Officer Knapp called my phone as I was driving to the Orlando airport .
I was going to be there two hours early to make sure I would be on time , so that she had a warm welcome to my country .
But instead , Knapp was busy detaining Aew in Minneapolis and was on my cell phone asking all types of personal questions that he had no business asking .
Sensing that Aew was in trouble , I answered his questions .
Mr. Knapp was a rude smart aleck .
The call is likely recorded and that recording would bear out my claims .
This officer of the United States government , a grown man , had coerced personal information from a Thai woman who weighs 90 pounds .
I asked Aew later why she gave him the e-mail password , and she answered simply , " I was afraid , " and “ I thought I would be arrested . ”
What could I say to alleviate any of this ?
Could I say , " This is the U.S. , nothing to be afraid of . " ?
The world already sees us as senseless bullies .
Aew might have been detained indefinitely ; even I was concerned that the Department of Homeland Security might detain Aew for no reason .
Essentially , she had no rights .
They had already coerced her e-mail password out of her head through intimidation .
This does not make me feel safe : Our Homeland Security was focusing on a 40 - year - old Thai bank officer while there are real bad guys out there .
Thailand and the United States have had good relations for 175 years , and Thailand is one of the few countries in the world that is proud to say they are friends of the United States .
There are no threats to Americans from Thai people -- who , among other relevant things , are mostly not Muslims .
The King of Thailand was born in Massachusetts and graduated from Harvard .
I have never seen the King with a gun ; only a camera .
His 2009 New Year ’s speech was also a call for peace .
The King and his family helped bring widespread education to Thailand , which created a special problem .
Today there are large numbers of highly educated , successful women looking for highly educated men .
I remember General ( ret. )
McCaffrey , our former drug Czar , telling me a couple of years ago that the King of Thailand was incredibly important in wiping out opium poppies in Thailand .
The King of Thailand is highly respected by the government of the United States .
He is a very good man .
During World War II , when the Japanese encouraged the Thai people to fight us , the Thai government actually declared war on the United States and Great Britain .
But the Thai Ambassador in Washington refused to deliver the declaration of war .
The upshot was that the United States refused to declare war on Thailand , and the Thai people formed a resistance against the Japanese .
Thai people refused to fight Americans .
Instead , they attacked the Japanese .
Has our government had problems recently with 90 - pound , 40 - year - old Thai women ?
Do they blow things up ?
Aew does n’t even know how to light a match .
She does n’t smoke or drink , and is more upright than your average southern Baptist .
She ca n’t even curse and gets upset if she hears me say a bad word about someone .
“ Michael ! ” she says , “ Do n’t say that ! ”
When I discovered that she had missed her flight , after about 24 hours of travel thus far , I called immigration at Minneapolis and asked to speak with Officer Knapp .
Knapp got on the phone , but this time it was me questioning him .
Knapp told me it was legal to read e-mails .
I asked for his first name , but he was afraid to give his first name , which was rather strange for someone working within the confines of an airport where everyone has been searched for weapons .
Where I work , in a war zone , soldiers give their first and last names and face Taliban and al Qaeda heads up , man to man .
I write about al Qaeda , Taliban and other terrorist groups who kill thousands of people .
My name is Michael Yon .
My first name is Michael .
Mr. Knapp hides behind a badge bullying a woman whose only activities are Yoga , reading , travel , and telling me what is healthy and unhealthy to eat .
Knapp is a face of Homeland Security .
How many other officers at Homeland Security bully 90 - pound women , but are afraid to give their own names ?
Knowing that Homeland Security officers are creating animosity and anxiety at our borders does not make me feel safer .
How many truly bad guys slip by while U.S. officers stand in small rooms and pick on little women ?
I have just returned from Afghanistan and Iraq on a trip with U.S. Secretary of Defense Robert Gates , and I can assure you that we can do better .
We do not have to violate human rights and insult our closest allies to maintain our security .
Meanwhile ,
Aew had missed two flights ; standby seats were full on the second flight , and I was considering flying from Florida to Minneapolis to get her myself .
I did not want Aew to have to sleep in the airport overnight .
I had intended to show Aew a bit of my country .
But it 's taking a little while for her to get over her discomfort at being in America .
She was treated better in China .
So was I .
Mexican town runs on ice cream TOCUMBO , Mexico 
Welcome to ice cream heaven , a tiny Mexican town that spawned an empire of frozen treats with unusual flavors such as tequila or avocado .
Storefronts feature huge bags of chocolate sprinkles .
Giant coolers stuffed with buckets of sweet cream open onto the street .
People walk by licking frozen pops .
Tocumbo is the home of " Michoacan " ice cream , named after the state where the town is located .
The frozen treat , known for its distinct texture and flavors , is sold in hundreds of shops bearing the Michoacan name , from Guatemala City to Portland , Ore. Sales in U.S. neighborhoods are rising as Mexican migrants spread to new areas and take the Michoacan brand with them , says Alejandro Andrade , who sells ice cream makers in this town of 1,500 people .
Michoacan ice cream differs from what most Americans eat .
Each shop makes its own , churning the frozen treat into a frothy texture with unique Mexican flavors such as corn , sweet cheese curd , cantaloupe and pine nut .
Paletas , or Mexican - style Popsicles , can have chunks of kiwi , pistachio , orange papaya or homemade peanut butter .
" We 're showing the world what good ice cream is , " says Norma Barragan , who manages one of four ice cream shops near the main plaza .
About 90 % of the families in Tocumbo are part of the ice cream business , says town administrator German Espinoza .
People make ice cream , sell it , provide ingredients or manufacture the machines .
" When you think of how many jobs this town has created , it 's truly impressive , " Espinoza says .
" It 's a simple product , a simple name , but it has ( become ) an international phenomenon . "
The Michoacan brand is not registered in Mexico , and anyone with an ice cream maker and a storefront is free to use it .
The town makes money by selling equipment , ingredients and know - how to small entrepreneurs .
The result is thousands of jobs that keep people in Michoacan , traditionally one of the biggest sources of U.S. migrants , Espinoza says .
Another result is two nearby stores can have the same name .
Barragan , who manages one of two Flower of Tocumbo Ice Cream shops within a block of each other , says imitation is part of the game .
As Barragan scoops out a sample of avocado ice cream , a visitor asks what 's in it .
" Cream , sugar and fresh avocados , " she says .
" What , you were expecting something artificial ?
This is the original stuff here . "
Tocumbo's rise began in the mid-1940s , when brothers Ignacio and Luis Alcazar , along with their cousin Agustin Andrade , headed to Mexico City in search of work , Espinoza says .
The men opened a pair of shops , both called La Michoacana , to sell ice cream and frozen pops .
The treats caught on , and soon others from Tocumbo opened shops .
In Alejandro Andrade 's workshop in the center of Tocumbo , customers can buy an entire ice cream shop for $ 30,000 : machinery , tables , chairs , menus and signs saying " La Michoacana . "
He sells four packages a month ; 12 went to the USA last year .
Another equipment shop has a sign spelling out the town 's ambitions : " Tocumbo is the ice - cream capital of the world and a branch office of heaven . "

The moon ’s “ near side ” always faces Earth , because the moon spins once on its axis in precisely the same amount of time it takes to revolve around the Earth .
But things could have been different billions of years ago .
A computer analysis of the amount of craters on the different hemispheres of the Moon shows that the far side may have once been facing Earth .
A large asteroid impact may have caused the moon to change the way its faces Earth .
One consequence of the Moon being locked in a spin - orbit resonance of synchronous rotation is that more impacts should occur on the Moon ’s western hemisphere than the eastern , as that side would be facing into orbit , making it more likely to be hit by debris .
But Mark Wieczorek and Matthieu Le Feuvre at the Paris Institute of Earth Physics in France compared the relative ages of the craters , using data about the sequence in which ejected material was deposited on the surface , and they found the opposite to be true .
Although the youngest impact basins were concentrated in the western hemisphere , as expected , the older craters were mostly congregated in the east .
This suggests that the eastern face had once been bombarded more than the western face .
This could have happened if a large asteroid impact caused the moon to do an about face .
The researchers estimate after the impact , the moon would have appeared to turn slowly as viewed from Earth , and slowly would have come into its current position .
In looking at several of the largest lunar impact basins , there are several suspects for impacts that could have temporarily unlocked the Moon from synchronous rotation .
“ We show that there is less than a 2 % probability that the oldest lunar impact basins are randomly distributed across the lunar surface , ” the researchers say .
“ Furthermore , these basins are preferentially located near the Moon ’s antapex of motion , and this configuration has less than a 0.3 % probability of occurring by chance . ”
The team studied the relative age and distribution of 46 known craters .
Wieczorek says the Chandrayaan - 1 or Kaguya orbiters could provide information on more craters that would help in further research in this area .
For more information , see the abstract .

When you see Daddy comin '
You 're lickin ' your lips ,
Nails bitten down to the quick ...
He gives you the keys
To a flaming car .
Daddy 's with you wherever you are .
Daddy 's a comfort .
Daddy 's your best friend .
Daddy'll hold your hand right up to the end .
-- U2 , " Daddy 's Gonna Pay for Your Crashed Car "
When I was at the gym on Tuesday , November 4th , all I heard was how impressed people were with how many young people turned out at the polls , how important it was to have ' your voice ' heard , how important this election was .
I agree that for the superficial reasons Americans have always been obsessed with , this election was indeed important in that it forced people of all political persuasions to discuss race and sex in an even more outrageously overextended manner than normal .
The war ?
What 's that ?
But I 'm not going to make this a gripe session , in spite of the fact that I have felt the need to vent ever since .
No , the venting was handled vicariously and quite nicely by Mr. Groves last week , while I was still in the throes of hyperelectionemia .
Instead , let me just add that Bono 's lyrics at the top capture perfectly the state of this " Union . "
The song , after all , opens with one of Lenin 's favorite marches .
Hint , hint .
The progressives have their man in office come January .
Daddy is going to set about fixing our health care system , fixing the economy , fixing the war , and fixing our national image abroad .
Uh - huh .
Sha-la .
From Daddy 's mouth straight to our hearts :
" [ T ] o those who would tear the world down : We will defeat you .
To those who seek peace and security : We support you . "
More war , ladies and gents .
Probably in Clinton 's style instead of W.'s .
" Our union can be perfected . "
Oh , God .
" The road ahead will be long .
Our climb will be steep .
We may not get there in one year or even in one term . "
Is this perhaps an early caveat , a promise that Daddy will be able to fall back on when four years later we 're all using outhouses ?
Please keep in mind that the Obamas , McCains , Bushes , Palins , Bidens , Clintons , Cheneys , Gingriches , Reagans , and Roosevelts of this world will not have a long road ahead ; they all live next door to each other on Easy Street .
They will not have a steep climb ; their servants do that for them .
And they have already gotten there ; screw you if you do n't " get there in one year or even in one term . "
But at least the rhetoric is pleasant - sounding enough .
It reminds me of the exquisitely turned phrases of yet another Daddy , the one I actually missed when he left office all those years ago .
To me , Reagan was like a grandpa , one who was more present in my life than either of my actual grandfathers .
What did he say differently ?
" Government is not a solution to our problem , government is the problem . "
A statement that is thoroughly and entirely correct , and one that resonated with millions .
Except that by the time Papa Reagan left office , the national debt was almost twice as high .
Medicare , Medicaid , defense spending , and Social Security experienced huge increases .
Remind me , Daddy , what was the problem again ?
( Gosh , he 's handsome ! )
Turn on Limbaugh , Hannity , and Coulter , and you 'll hear that Daddy should get tough on crime , put the Bible back in schools , reintroduce Christianity back into " public " life , and fight wars against communists and terrorists , but nobody else .
Turn on Franken , Colmes , and Huffington , and you 'll hear that Daddy should enforce " equality , " regulate gay marriage as well as straight marriage , redistribute the wealth , and fight wars against really , really bad terrorists and poverty , but nobody else .
Most libertarian and old - right minarchists just want Daddy to stop drinking and get himself to AA on a more regular basis .
What they do n't understand is that The Constitution ( Daddy 's pre-nup ) does not provide for a minarchy .
Not anymore , at least .
Just read the text of the Sixteenth Amendment once more .
You do n't even have to read between the lines :
" The Congress shall have power to lay and collect taxes on incomes , from whatever source derived , without apportionment among the several States , and without regard to any census or enumeration . "
Need it translated into modern English ?
Very well :
" Daddy can take as much money as he wants , from whomever he pleases , without regard for decency or fairness .
Uh - huh . Sha-la . "
Do I exaggerate ?
If you think so , then you probably live with an alcoholic parent , for whom you regularly make excuses .
But that 's what the minarchists ' precious Constitution did : it merely gave a driver 's license to a drunkard .
Daddy does not have to pay for the car he crashes .
You do .
But at least the American children , who apparently number in the tens of millions , have elected a good - looking , suave , urbane , well - educated , charming , disarming , and eloquent Daddy .
Those of us who have willfully become political orphans will have to endure Four More Years of Daddy love and Daddy hate .
Daddy'll get drunk , bang on the door to be let in , piss in the shrubs , curse the neighbors , dent the fender , pass out , make excuses , apologize , bring Mommy some flowers , and make empty , vacuous promises .
The media will fall in line on either appropriate , socially acceptable side ( democratic socialist or national socialist ) , dutifully report where Daddy went wrong , and where he 'll make it right when McObamaton or W. McObamaton is elected to Daddy Office next .
No matter who Daddy is next time around , will it sound any different from any other inaugural address , I wonder ?
Can anyone explain the difference between the below quotes from inaugurals past and the below quotes from The Lord of the Rings trilogy ?

Several weeks ago , I saw a picture in my local paper of a new high school that had been built for $ 69 million .
It looked like all the others .
It was square .
It was ugly .
You know exactly what sort of condition it will be in by the end of the second school term .
How is it that Daddy is always such a lousy architect and aesthete when it comes to educating his children ?
And how come , once the kids move in , Daddy can't keep the building in good repair ?
For $ 69 million , you can build and maintain quite a beautiful edifice indeed .
So why does n't he ?
I 'm so glad I do n't listen to Daddy anymore .
It 's always the same apology .
Always the same excuses .
How many $ 69 million schools have been built to fix the same problem that only gets worse ?
Every drink Daddy takes is the last one .
He means it this time .
Clinton meant it .
Bush meant it .
Obama means it .
President # 45 will mean it .
President # 46 will mean it .
President # 47 will mean it , only he really will , not like his predecessors .
President # 48 , however , will only say he means it .
( He really wo n't . )
Limbaugh will tell you which one really means it , and which one does n't .
Huffington will disagree , and will tell you which one really , really means it .
You 've got a head full of traffic .
You 're a siren 's song .
You cry for Mama .
Daddy 's right along .
What 's actually happening is that they 're all aiding and abetting this drunken slob .
Every last one of them .
The children need to be lied to , because according to Alice Miller , the false perception of parental love is a psychological survival tactic of little children .
People lined up at the polls for three hours last week desperately hoping that Daddy has finally come to his senses .
Maybe he 'll really mean it this time .
And look at the car he bought !
Daddy loves us after all !

Alright .
A small , digital book startup thinks it has a solution to the age - old student lament : overpriced textbooks that have little value when the course is over .
The answer ?
Make them open source – and give them away .
Flat World Knowledge is the brainchild of two former textbook industry executives who learned from the inside about the wacky economy of textbooks .
In a nutshell , there is a huge , inelastic demand for college texts , even though textbook prices are high .
Because of this there is a lot of piracy and a robust secondary market for textbooks – but not for long , because they are updated every couple of years , rendering old editions virtually worthless .
Flat World 's business plan aims to exploit the inefficiencies :
Its books are online and free .
Instead of charging for content it aims to make money by wrapping content up in " convenient " downloadable and print wrappers and selling those , along with study aides and related items .
Enhancing the value of the online versions is the open source component .
Students can annotate and comment in the digital margins of Flat World 's texts to share their insights , analysis and conclusions with other students .
Digital versions of popular print textbooks have been widely available for a while now through distribution sites like CourseSmart , which offers around 4,500 titles and more than one - third of the most popular - selling text book titles .
But a study released last week by the Student Public Interest Research Groups ( PIRGs ) noted that subscription - based digital books are just as unaffordable , considering that a used print book can at least be resold for a while .
“ Rather than designing the digital book to fit the [ print business ]
model , publishers should consider redesigning the model to fit digital books , ” the PIRG report says .
“ In theory , this model should work , since students tend to want print books . ”
“ The nice thing about open content is it gives faculty full control , creative control over the content of the book , full control over timing , and it give students a lot more control over how they want to consume it and how much they want to pay , ” says Eric Frank , who along with co-founder Jeff Shelstad , came from a long career in the mainstream textbook industry .
Shelstad spent 13 years at McGraw - Hill and served as editor - in - chief before moving to Prentice Hall , where he was editorial director of Business Publishing .
Frank stepped into the industry at Thompson and also eventually left for Prentice Hall where he worked for seven years as acquisitions editor and director of marketing .
Flat World raised about $ 750,000 in angel funding last fall from investors who included authors and university trustees and is on the verge of closing another angel round at a similar amount .
Additional street cred comes by way of the company 's " Chief Openness Officer – David Wiley , the founder of OpenContent.org , former Director of the Center for Open and Sustainable Learning , and the man often credited for bringing the phrase “ open content ” to its modern usage in the late '90s .
The idea behind open textbooks began with people frustrated with the industry , Frank says .
The movement then led to non-profit aggregation platforms like Connexions at Rice University and the Global Text Project at the University of Georgia .
But he believes they are one of the first to turn this into a commercial venture .
" On the surface they 're ( traditional publishers ) doing OK , but underneath the surface there are lots of problems , " says Frank .
" The internet has caused so much disruption in the distribution that there are so many used books and international books and pirated copies out there that after about two years , publishers have to bring out new editions in order to capture revenue again . "
Frank says the firm is also in the process of releasing a version for Amazon 's Kindle , but is working out several technical hurdles before finalizing anything .
Amazon is thought to be toying with the idea of a Kindle marketed to the college crowd , and wired.com readers have been somewhat vocal about the need for textbook support in the device .
Official launch is not until next January , when the company plans to offer eight textbooks , each written for Flat World by scholars who have also produced texts for some of the major publishing companies .
It will test its business model over the next semester in a private beta with more than 20 U.S. universities .
In keeping with the decorum of pedagogy , there will be no advertising on the site – Frank says that the revenue would n’t be significant enough to
“ justify the distraction from an educational perspective . ”
But he 's not concerned about viability or walking into a " freeconomics " black hole .
“ Our premise is that there will of course be some students who spend nothing , they just consume the free book online , but we believe students are consumers and they will pay for convenience if the price is right , ” he says .

The
Others acknowledge that there is some sort of movement but
My ideal atheist movement would be The atheist movement has been criticized for not being a real movement at all .
The sharpest critics are atheists themselves , and some seem to have a general distaste for any attempts to foster a secular community .
Time and time again , they point out that atheists need not have anything in common except atheism and that atheism itself is ill - suited for bringing people together .
Others acknowledge that there is some sort of movement but reject it for a variety of reasons .
The most common reason , one I 've seen again and again , is the attempts by some atheists to distinguish between " real atheists " and those posing as atheists for some inexplicable reason .
Of course , this almost always ends up being about tactics .
Some are criticized for being too " militant " and others for not being " strong " enough .
As someone who is regular criticized for being both , I 'd have to agree that this sort of thing is not helpful .
My ideal atheist movement would be broader than any definition of atheism and would involve the following components :
Sharp , sustained criticism of religion as irrational and destructive Promotion of a reality - based worldview including reason , science , skepticism , critical thinking , secular education , and secular humanism Defense of atheist rights from a civil rights perspective to end anti-atheist discrimination and reduce anti-atheist bigotry Support for atheists in their escape from religion
If the atheist movement is to flourish and become increasingly organized , there will be different factions emerging .
This is inevitable and must be acknowledged .
If we can do this while recognizing that all factions are beneficial and that each brings something unique to the table , we just might succeed .
If not , the atheist movement could end up doing more harm than good .
In this case , we might consider whether it is better to become more like the bikers , bonded in
Again , I readily acknowledge that such a movement goes beyond the definition of atheism .
Moreover , I recognize that there may be atheists who reject secular humanism , skepticism , or some of the other components I am suggesting .
Perhaps what I am proposing should even be called something other than atheism .
I do not necessarily see this as an insurmountable obstacle .
If the atheist movement is to flourish and become increasingly organized , there will be different factions emerging .
This is inevitable and must be acknowledged .
If we can do this while recognizing that all factions are beneficial and that each brings something unique to the table , we just might succeed .
If not , the atheist movement could end up doing more harm than good .
In this case , we might consider whether it is better to become more like the bikers , bonded in identity but without the ties of community or organization .
Driving down the freeway , I observe two men , both riding Harley - Davidson motorcycles , pass each other while heading in opposite directions .
Both extend the well - known " low wave , " a one - armed salute one often sees among bikers .
There was no reason to suspect that these men knew each other , only that they share a common bond .
They belong to no real community and have no organizational structure .
Their bond is about a shared identity .
And even though they may never meet face - to - face , the connection is palpable .
If it 's true that nature abhors a vacuum , then that rather unnatural state of man known as cable television is positively repulsed by one .
And so , during this lugubrious interregnum in which millions of us are still coming down from the months - long high of checking Nate Silver and Real Clear Politics nine times a day and dying inside because the polls out of Ohio contradict one another , the political class needs something to chatter about .
It has chosen , for more days running than I 'd imagined necessary , the story of the liberal activists who already feel betrayed by Barack Obama .
The Politico weighed in Monday with a piece noting that some liberals ( actually , it did n't even qualify it with " some " ; it just said " liberals " ) " are growing increasingly nervous – and some just flat - out angry – that President - elect Barack Obama seems to be stiffing them on Cabinet jobs and policy choices . "
Well , they did n't call me , and you can place me well outside the magic circle .
I 'm not nervous or flat - out angry or even concerned .
I 'm excited .
And by the way , the vast majority of the people I know are excited , too .
Obama is still seven weeks away from taking office but has already signaled that he 's going to do grand things , huge things – dare I say heretofore unimaginable things .
A half - trillion dollar ( at least ; some suspect it may end up being more like a trillion ) jobs - and - infrastructure program , which he wants to enact as soon as possible after he takes office ?
Liberals have complained for decades – yes , decades , since the 1970s – about the creaky state of America 's bridges and roads and the need for more spending on transit .
Ditto the schools .
We live in a country of which it 's still probably true that most schools were built in the 1920s ( New York City , for example , opened a new school building once every three weeks for that entire decade ) .
Again , we have complained and complained and complained about their condition , and quite rightly so , for decades .
And here comes a president who is about to do something about all this , and do it more grandly than most liberals would have dared to imagine just a few months ago .
And do it immediately .
And he 's not liberal enough ?
Please .
If President Obama were to pass a trillion dollar jobs - and - infrastructure bill and , Heaven forbid , drop dead on his elliptical machine in March , that single act alone would be enough to make him one of the most progressive presidents in the history of the country .
You read that right .
The history of the country .
Remember , Bill Clinton was the master of small - bore progressivism .
Lyndon Johnson had staggering domestic accomplishments , but always there is Vietnam .
Franklin Roosevelt is the ne plus ultra of progressivism in the White House , and for many good reasons , but remember that he interned Japanese - Americans ( and , it is largely forgotten , a smaller number of Italo - Americans ) and made his deal with the racist south .
And while we 're doing FDR comparisons , note Obama 's rhetorical support ( he has no authority to offer any other kind ) of the workers at the Chicago door and window plant staging a sit-in , demanding their severance pay .
Obama said emphatically : they are right .
In 1936 and 1937 , after his re-election , Roosevelt – as the incumbent president who'd just won 46 states ( out of our then 48 ) and 63 % of the vote and was thus in a far more powerful position than Obama is today – could not bring himself to utter a word in support of the sit - down strikers in Flint , Michigan trying to join the auto workers ' union .
It was an improvement on previous practice , to be sure , that Roosevelt said nothing .
His predecessors would have ordered in the troops .
But he could n't offer even a rhetorical pat on the back .
Obama has brought these people national attention and sent the signal that , with respect to treatment of workers and related issues like grotesque executive compensation , on which he has also spoken out forcefully , we are going to be entering a different era .
I 'll send you a gold - embossed copy of Mark Penn 's latest book if you can realistically persuade me that a president - elect Clinton would have said anything like what Obama said .
It 's the nature of politics that activists who represent constituencies should complain – the squeaky wheel gets the grease and all that .
It 's further in the nature of progressives that people are more likely to complain publicly than privately , which is how the right often issued its gentle remonstrances against George Bush .
And people should keep up pressure .
I 'm all for that .
Lord knows ,
Obama will be getting pressure from the larger creatures of the sea , the oil companies and the insurance lobby and the centrist and conservative deficit hawks .
So the smaller fish should make noise too .
Politicians , even good and decent ones , do n't usually do things because they 're nice guys .
They do things because they 're getting pressure .
But there is a vast difference between applying pressure and taking bits of evidence and extrapolating to wild conclusions and crazy rhetoric from them .
And people who can't see that Obama needs to reassure the political establishment by doing things like re-appointing Robert Gates at the Pentagon precisely so he can have the establishment 's good will , which in turn grants him the room to operate and to isolate the political opposition , understand so little about politics that it's not even worth the time it would take to spell out the argument to them .
He will disappoint .
I 've said it here before , and I 've said it to every audience I 've spoken to in recent weeks .
That is inevitable .
Once in office , he will need to prove that he is the boss , and not this or that Cabinet officer , and if there 's any leading around by the nose to be done , he 'll be doing it .
But he 's still weeks away from office and he 's already backing up powerless working people , talking about hundreds of billions in government dollars being committed to building up the country , tackling health care and climate change , reiterating that deficit reduction is a low priority right now , standing by his pledge to draw down in Iraq and apparently planning to go to Cairo ( probably ) to give a speech on America 's new relationship to the world – a move , again , that I can't conceive of any president of my lifetime having the guts to consider making in his first hundred days .
The cable shows have hours to fill , and bloggers know that if they complain they might well be asked to help fill them .
But disappointment …anger ?
If what we 've seen so far be compromise , I say serve me seconds .

LEGO UK today issued a statement saying it is not associated with the toys being sold by BrickArms which have been customised without its knowledge or permission ...
" BrickArms is not licensed by LEGO UK to customise LEGO figures and has no links to the LEGO brand . "
Viriginia Wheeler of London 'sspotlights some controversial new toys : terrorist LEGO ™ products
The toy industry is really going to pieces .
ARROYO GRANDE , Calif. ( MarketWatch ) -- " Charlie and I believe Berkshire should be a fortress of financial strength " wrote Warren Buffett .
That was five years before the subprime - credit meltdown .
" We try to be alert to any sort of mega - catastrophe risk , and that posture may make us unduly appreciative about the burgeoning quantities of long - term derivatives contracts and the massive amount of uncollateralized receivables that are growing alongside .
In our view , however , derivatives are financial weapons of mass destruction , carrying dangers that , while now latent , are potentially lethal . "
That warning was in Buffett 's 2002 letter to Berkshire shareholders .
He saw a future that many others chose to ignore .
The Iraq war build - up was at a fever - pitch .
The imagery of WMDs and a mushroom cloud fresh in his mind .
Also fresh on Buffett 's mind :
His acquisition of General Re four years earlier , about the time the Long - Term Capital Management hedge fund almost killed the global monetary system .
How ?
This is crucial : LTCM nearly killed the system with a relatively small $ 5 billion trading loss .
Peanuts compared with the hundreds of billions of dollars of subprime - credit write - offs now making Wall Street 's big shots look like amateurs .
Buffett tried to sell off Gen Re 's derivatives group .
No buyers .
Unwinding it was costly , but led to his warning that derivatives are a " financial weapon of mass destruction . "
That was 2002 .
Derivatives bubble explodes five times bigger in five years
Wall Street did n't listen to Buffett .
Derivatives grew into a massive bubble , from about $ 100 trillion to $ 516 trillion by 2007 .
The new derivatives bubble was fueled by five key economic and political trends :
Sarbanes - Oxley increased corporate disclosures and government oversight Federal Reserve 's cheap money policies created the subprime - housing boom War budgets burdened the U.S. Treasury and future entitlements programs Trade deficits with China and others destroyed the value of the U.S. dollar Oil and commodity rich nations demanding equity payments rather than debt
In short , despite Buffett 's clear warnings , a massive new derivatives bubble is driving the domestic and global economies , a bubble that continues growing today parallel with the subprime - credit meltdown triggering a bear - recession .
Data on the five - fold growth of derivatives to $ 516 trillion in five years comes from the most recent survey by the Bank of International Settlements , the world 's clearinghouse for central banks in Basel , Switzerland .
The BIS is like the cashier 's window at a racetrack or casino , where you 'd place a bet or cash in chips , except on a massive scale : BIS is where the U.S. settles trade imbalances with Saudi Arabia for all that oil we guzzle and gives China IOUs for the tainted drugs and lead - based toys we buy .
To grasp how significant this five - fold bubble increase is , let 's put that $ 516 trillion in the context of some other domestic and international monetary data :
U.S. annual gross domestic product is about $ 15 trillion
U.S. money supply is also about $ 15 trillion
Current proposed U.S. federal budget is $ 3 trillion
U.S. government 's maximum legal debt is $ 9 trillion
U.S. mutual fund companies manage about $ 12 trillion
World 's GDPs for all nations is approximately $ 50 trillion
Unfunded Social Security and Medicare benefits $ 50 trillion to $ 65 trillion
Total value of the world 's real estate is estimated at about $ 75 trillion
Total value of world 's stock and bond markets is more than $ 100 trillion
BIS valuation of world 's derivatives back in 2002 was about $ 100 trillion
BIS 2007 valuation of the world 's derivatives is now a whopping $ 516 trillion
Moreover , the folks at BIS tell me their estimate of $ 516 trillion only includes " transactions in which a major private dealer ( bank ) is involved on at least one side of the transaction , " but does n't include private deals between two " non-reporting entities . "
They did , however , add that their reporting central banks estimate that the coverage of the survey is around 95 % on average .
Also , keep in mind that while the $ 516 trillion " notional " value ( maximum in case of a meltdown ) of the deals is a good measure of the market 's size , the 2007 BIS study notes that the $ 11 trillion " gross market values provides a more accurate measure of the scale of financial risk transfer taking place in derivatives markets . "
Bubbles , domino effects and the ' bad 2 % '
However , while that may be true as far as the parties to an individual deal , there are broader risks to the world 's economies .
Remember back in 1998 when LTCM 's little $ 5 billion loss nearly brought down the world 's banking system .
That " domino effect " is now repeating many times over , straining the world 's monetary , economic and political system as the subprime housing mess metastasizes , taking the U.S. stock market and the world economy down with it .
This cascading " domino effect " was brilliantly described in " The $ 300 Trillion Time Bomb : If Buffett can't figure out derivatives , can anybody ? " published early last year in Portfolio magazine , a couple months before the subprime meltdown .
Columnist Jesse Eisinger 's $ 300 trillion figure came from an earlier study of the derivatives market as it was growing from $ 100 trillion to $ 516 trillion over five years .
Eisinger concluded :
" There 's nothing intrinsically scary about derivatives , except when the bad 2 % blow up . "
Unfortunately , that " bad 2 % " did blow up a few months afterwards , even as Bernanke and Paulson were assuring America that the subprime mess was " contained . "
Bottom line : Little things leverage a heck of a big wallop .
It only takes a little spark from a " bad 2 % deal " to ignite this $ 516 trillion weapon of mass destruction .
Think of this entire unregulated derivatives market like an unsecured , unpredictable nuclear bomb in a Pakistan stockpile .
It 's only a matter of time .
World 's newest and biggest ' black market '
The fact is , derivatives have become the world 's biggest " black market , " exceeding the illicit traffic in stuff like arms , drugs , alcohol , gambling , cigarettes , stolen art and pirated movies .
Why ?
Because like all black markets , derivatives are a perfect way of getting rich while avoiding taxes and government regulations .
And in today 's slowdown , plus a volatile global market , Wall Street knows derivatives remain a lucrative business .
Recently Pimco's bond fund king Bill Gross said " What we are witnessing is essentially the breakdown of our modern - day banking system , a complex of leveraged lending so hard to understand that Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke required a face - to - face refresher course from hedge fund managers in mid-August . "
In short , not only Warren Buffett , but Bond King Bill Gross , our Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke , the Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson and the rest of America 's leaders can't " figure out " the world 's $ 516 trillion derivatives .
Why ?
Gross says we are creating a new " shadow banking system . "
Derivatives are now not just risk management tools .
As Gross and others see it , the real problem is that derivatives are now a new way of creating money outside the normal central bank liquidity rules .
How ?
Because they 're private contracts between two companies or institutions .
BIS is primarily a records - keeper , a toothless tiger that merely collects data giving a legitimacy and false sense of security to this chaotic " shadow banking system " that has become the world 's biggest " black market . "
That 's crucial , folks .
Why ?
Because central banks require reserves like stock brokers require margins , something backing up the transaction .
Derivatives do n't .
They 're not " real money . "
They 're paper promises closer to " Monopoly " money than real U.S. dollars .
And it takes place outside normal business channels , out there in the " free market . "
That 's the wonderful world of derivatives , and it 's creating a massive bubble that could soon implode .
Comments ?
Yes , we want to hear your thoughts .
Tell us what you think about derivatives : as " financial weapons of mass destruction ; " as a " shadow banking system ; " as a " black market ; " as the next big bubble dangerously exposing us to that unpredictable " bad 2 % . "

Everything these days is harmful to you .
TV , food , booze , drugs , sex , videogames - anything fun .
It ’s like the only thing left to do that wo n’t kill you is sitting in a green pasture and meditating .
And with the ozone quickly disappearing , even that is n’t safe ( not to mention dying from boredom from all of that fucking meditating ) .
But it ’s not just the big vices that are bad for you .
Nowadays the little , everyday things are bad for you , too .
A little while back I saw a report on the news on the dangers of listening to your iPod too much .
They said that it makes you less observant of the world and can make you more anti-social .
What a big bag of horseshit .
The whole point of an Ipod is to get lost in your own world of music .
You use it to sometimes block out the outside world and have a few moments to yourself .
And now your telling me that ’s bad ?
Listening to music to escape your surroundings is bad for you ?
Eat me !
Why can’t I try something once without facing deadly repercussions ?
I really want to drop ecstasy .
It looks like fun , even if I have to wave a glow stick around for nine hours .
But do I really have to run the risk of deadly seizures and fatal heat stroke if I try it ?
Or how about heroin ?
I would love to get really skinny and lie on the couch all day .
But do I have to become instantly addicted if I try it just once ?
Come on !
Cut me some fucking slack here !
Unfortunately , it ’s not only things that are bad for you but people as well .
No one tells you to stay away from the person who plays the cello and works in a soup kitchen .
It ’s always the fun people that your parents tell you to watch out for .
Growing up my mom would warn me to stop hanging around TJ Rathbone because he “ had bad news written all over him . ”
But TJ did all of the fun stuff .
He smoked cigarettes , stole Mickey ’s Big Mouths from his dad and shoplifted on a daily basis .
How could I not hang out with a guy like that ?
Sure , TJ nearly lost his leg after it caught on fire while he was trying to blow up a fish with some lighter fluid and a firecracker , but that ’s besides the point .
Why ca n’t snorting coke off of a hooker ’s ass be considered a “ healthy lifestyle ” ?
Conversely , why ca n’t drinking a wheatgrass shot ( which tastes like a dog ’s ass – trust me , I know ) give you testicular cancer ?
I love eating cookies .
Why ca n’t that be the food that gives me six - pack abs ?
I fucking hate green beans .
Why the shit ca n’t those be bad for me ?
We need to start being less informed and start being more ignorant .
We need to live like they did back in the 50’s and 60’s .
Now there was a time !
Smoking helped with your digestion , drinking and driving was socially acceptable and safe sex meant pumping and praying .
Really all you had to worry about back then was the threat of nuclear annihilation .
Other than that , party on !
If you write your own atheist blog or even visit atheist blogs on a semi- regular basis , you have undoubtedly been exposed to all sorts of ludicrous arguments from Christian trolls who leave comments on those blogs or interact with their authors on social media .
At least , it may seem that way .
But with a little analysis , I believe you 'll discover that most of the arguments bleed together into a fairly small number of common themes .
In this post , I 'll consider some of the most common and share some thoughts on how to handle them .
I intend the following to be a non-exhaustive list of some of the most common absurdities atheists hear from Christians :
You can't prove there 's not a god .
Atheism takes as much faith as Christianity .
Atheism is a religion .
You are n't really an atheist ; you 're just mad at ( my preferred ) god .
Without ( my preferred ) god , people have no reason to be moral .
Proof of Gods
There are many more , but this brief list provides more than enough material to address in one post .
In my experience , statement # 1 above is commonly heard from Christians who have not had the benefit of a college education .
It also happens to be one of the most important if atheists and Christians are ever to have any sort of meaningful dialogue .
There are two critical points which both sides must understand here .
First , the burden of proof always rests with the person asserting the claim .
This is a fundamental principle of philosophical argument .
Encountering a Christian who refuses to concede this point is like discovering someone who stubbornly denies gravity itself .
Other than suggesting some basic educational resources , there is little point in proceeding to discuss anything at all with such an individual .
Second , the theist is the one making the proof claim .
Some Christians will concede our previous point only to argue that the atheist has the burden because he or she is claiming that gods do not exist .
But the atheist is not claiming anything ; the position of the atheist is that the theist has not successfully met his or her burden of proof .
Remember , the burden of proof with regard to gods rests solely with the side claiming their existence .
To their credit , educated Christians tend to know how to think and rarely deny that the burden of proof is theirs .
Unfortunately , many atheists do not have sufficient opportunity for meaningful discussion with educated Christians and instead find themselves fending off trolls and the like .
Faith , Religion , and Atheism
Admittedly , faith and religion are not synonymous .
However , for our purposes , # 2 and # 3 can be considered together .
The smart ass response , " Yeah , and bald is a hair color , " may be fun but probably misses what the Christian is really claiming here .
When phrased to focus on faith , the claim typically centers on a fundamental misunderstanding of the meaning of atheism .
Because they have erroneously convinced themselves that atheism means absolutely certainty that no gods exist , they reason that to be absolutely certain without proof is a form of faith .
But atheism is not about certainty at all ; it is about doubt .
As we saw above , the atheistic position is that the theist has not successfully supported his or her claim .
Intelligent Christians can sometimes be helped to realize this by being encouraged to consider their stance on other gods ( e.g. , Odin ) .
They need not be certain ; they need only to be unconvinced by the Odinists .
When phrased to focus instead on religion , the Christian is generally asserting that atheism is a religion because atheists act like religious people .
They claim that we have our prophets ( e.g. , Darwin , Dawkins , etc. ) and the texts they produce .
They insist that we are not thinking critically either but simply conforming to some sort of atheist identity .
I suppose this could be true of some atheists but such atheists are rather difficult to find .
I 'm not sure I 've even encountered one .
I tend to see this objection mostly as a desperate effort by the Christian to understand us using the only scripts available to them ( i.e. , religious ones ) .
Atheists have no prophets , no doctrine , no dogma , no rituals , and really none of the essential components of any religion .
There Are No Atheists
I was hesitant to even include statement # 4 because it is so silly as to make some think that I am writing this post to mock .
And yet , I have encountered this very claim and close variants of it repeatedly .
I see this as a form of denial ( in the Freudian sense of the term ) through which the Christian resorts to an extremely primitive defense mechanism to shield the conscious mind from painful realities .
I tend to feel pity for the Christian who clings to such a claim .
One element sometimes attached to this claim does deserve consideration , however , and that is the idea that atheists are angry at some sort of god(s ) .
Since an atheist is someone without belief in gods , it is not logically possible for them to hate or to be mad at what they do not believe .
I think that some Christians experience confusion here because it is absolutely true that many atheists despise religion .
Then again , religion exists .
No Morality Without ( My ) God
Statement # 5 is probably the most common atheists can expect to encounter from Christians .
Whenever I hear some variant of this claim , I am tempted to respond with , " I am sorry to hear that you are so morally depraved that the only thing that keeps you from running wild in the streets is your fear that some ghost might punish you . "
That would n't be nice though , and so I usually keep it to myself .
You see , I do n't believe in any sort of gods , heaven , hell , or the like , but I still manage to behave in a civil manner most of the time .
Why ?
In addition to benefiting from a long evolutionary history and entering the world with an excellent head start , I internalized what I was taught about right and wrong just like most of my neighbors .
As a result , I feel guilty when I do something wrong such as hurting someone 's feelings .
But how do I know what is right and what is wrong in any absolute sense ?
How , for example , can I determine that much of the behavior attributed to the Christian god in their bible is immoral ?
As Matt of [ GBG ] Atheist News says , " Morality is just another way of describing behaviour that is conducive with a productive and cohesive society . "
And as Austin Cline reminds us ,
So what 's the point of being moral if God does n't exist ?
It 's the same " point " that people should acknowledge if God does exist : because the happiness and suffering of other human beings matter to us such that we should seek , whenever possible , to increase their happiness and decrease their suffering .
It 's also the " point " that morality is required for human social structures and human communities to survive at all .
Neither the presence nor the absence of any gods can change this , and while religious theists may find that their beliefs impact their moral decisions , they cannot claim that their beliefs are prerequisites for making any moral decisions at all .
What would you do if there were no God ?
Would you commit robbery , rape , and murder , or would you continue being a good and moral person ?
Either way the question is a debate stopper .
If the answer is that you would soon turn to robbery , rape , or murder , then this is a moral indictment of your character , indicating you are not to be trusted because if , for any reason , you were to turn away from your belief in God , your true immoral nature would emerge …
If the answer is that you would continue being good and moral , then apparently you can be good without God. QED .

For those genuinely interested in learning something about this subject and not simply parroting back what someone at their church once told them , here are a few resources to consult :
In closing , I would like to take the lead ofand turn the question of morality around for the Christian to ponder .

The plight of the shark has captured the imagination of Dubai 's residents Pressure is growing on Dubai 's newest and largest hotel resort to free a whale shark from its aquarium .
The Atlantis Hotel , on the iconic Palm Jumeirah island , originally said it had " rescued " the animal , which is recognised as an endangered species .
The hotel is now refusing to say if or when the whale shark will be released .
Environmentalists and Dubai residents are now demanding that the shark - nicknamed Sammy by one paper - should be released into its natural habitat .
The Atlantis hotel , which opened last month , was billed as the biggest and one of the best resorts in Dubai .
But it has already witnessed some major setbacks .
A fire billowed smoke through the lobby three weeks before the opening .
Then , a week after opening , one of its main water valves ruptured , resulting in no water in much of the hotel .
Now the focus is on the 4 m ( 13ft ) whale shark that circles the hotel 's aquarium - a tank built to invoke the ruins of Atlantis , the so - called Lost City .
Mobilisation
The shark , who could grow up to 12 m ( 39 ft ) , was caught off the coast of Dubai six weeks ago .
The management talk of " rescuing " an animal , who was in distress , but former employees have told the local press that capturing a whale shark was always part of the hotel 's plan to provide an added tourist attraction .
An independent survey has shown more than a third of those questioned would be more likely to visit the resort to see it , but there is a growing swell of public opinion that the animal should be released and tagged .
Whale sharks are protected under the Cites convention and the plight of this member of an endangered species has captured the imagination of the public .
One popular newspaper has launched a freedom campaign .
Children are talking about it in school assemblies and local environmentalists are strongly urging its release .

※商品がメーカーごとの個性を失って，どこのメーカーのものでも大差ない状態になること
という言葉をご存じだろうか。原材料を生み出す第一次産業から始まった世の中の経済システムは，19世紀の産業革命を起点として，第二次産業（製造業）を中心としたシステムへと発展した。現在は，金融，運輸，小売りなどといった，サービスの提供によって対価を得る第三次産業が，世界の先進国の中心産業となっているわけだが，そうした状況のなか，最新のマーケティング研究では，さらにその先の……つまり，に焦点を当てた産業が注目されているという。世の中に物やサービスが溢れ，物質的な価値や便利さによる差別化が難しくなっている今，企業は，何を武器に競合他社と戦っていくべきなのか。膨れあがる開発費や世界レベルでの過当な販売競争など，あらゆる企業を悩ませるこれらの命題は，ゲーム産業にとっても，決して無関係ではないだろう。そんななか，2008年9月に一冊の学術書が出版された。「
人はなぜ形のないものを買うの か
」と題したこの本は，オンラインゲームを中心に，なぜ人が形のないサービスにお金を払うのか，お金を払う価値のあるサービスとはなんなのかを，自らの体験と地道な研究をベースに探求したものだ。オンラインゲームビジネスのほか，あらゆる無形のサービスについて深く切り込んだ，非常に興味深い本である。今回4Gamerでは，その著者でもある，成蹊大学の准教授にインタビューを行い，なぜプレイヤーがオンラインゲームやそのほかの無形のサービスにお金を払うのか，その動機，心理について話を聞いてみた。「オンラインゲームは，まさに経験経済の現場」だという野島氏との会話をお届けしたい。まずはじめに，野島先生の研究テーマなどをお聞かせ願えますか。もともとはネットショッピングなど，eコマース系の研究をされていたとのことですが，どういう経緯でオンラインゲームを研究し始めたんでしょう？私が本格的に研究に取り組み始めたのは，だいたい10年くらい前からなのですが，おっしゃるように，当初はネットショップの研究……つまり，ネットショップの成功要因だとか，そういう部分に着目して調査を行っていました。ただ，当時のネットショップというのは，既存のブランドの影響が思いのほか大きくて，「ネットならでは要素」というか，原因というのが非常に分かりにくかったんですよね。結局，既存のブランドの通信販売サイトが成功していたとか，そういう話ですか？ええ。しかし私としては，ネット上で出現した/するであろう新しい経済価値，経済モデルに興味があったんです。ですから，もっとネットに絞った，あるいはネットで完結している別の商材を探すことにしました。それがオンラインゲームだったと。当時は，まだ動画や音楽などといったコンテンツ配信もほとんどありませんでしたし，掲示板やチャットはあったけれど，mixiみたいなSNSもありませんでした。有料で展開されているネット上のサービスって，ほとんどなかったんですよね。それこそ一定以上の売り上げを誇るサービスって視点で見てしまうと，オンラインゲームくらいしかなかったんです。確かに。ただ，研究と言えば聞こえはいいんですけど，いざオンラインゲームを遊んでみたら，私自身が大ハマリしてしまいまして……。一時期は，いわゆる「廃人」レベルで熱中していました。ど，どのくらいですか。そうですね……平日は毎日3〜5時間，週末は一日中って感じでしょうか。私生活に影響が出まくってしまって，ホント大変でした（笑）。一番ハマっていた時期などは，研究室から家に帰る時間がもったいなくて，研究室に寝袋を置いていたくらいです。ゲームメディアの編集者も顔負けですね（笑）。最近は大分落ち着いてきましたけど，あの頃は月に使う金額も5万円くらいだったり……。いわゆるアバターサービスも含めて，いろいろなゲームやサービスを同時に遊んでいたんですよ。ただ，オンラインゲームに大ハマリする一方で，「なんで自分はこんなにお金を払っているんだろう？」「何に対してお金を払っているんだろう？」という疑問を常に抱いていました。アバターの服を買うといっても，物質的な観点から見れば，何も手元に残らないわけじゃないですか。なので，「普通の服を買う」という消費行動とは，明らかに求めている価値が違う。そうですね。私自身の実体験としての知識と，そしてそれをより深く研究したならば，これは一冊の本にできるのではないか。そう考えて取り組んだ成果が，今回出版させていただいた「人はなぜ形のないものを買うのか」なんです。研究に集中するために，ゲームもちょっと控えめにしましたよ（笑）。早速拝読しました。本著におけるオンラインゲームの価値分析では，というのが一つのキーワードになっていますよねそうです。オンラインゲームの価値を考える……つまり，「なぜオンラインゲームにお金を払うのか」を説明するには，先ほどもお話したように，物質的な面では決して語れませんよね。繰り返しになりますけど，なにしろ「物がない」わけですから。ええ。そこで私が注目したのが，「経験経済」という新しいマーケティングコンセプトでした。経験経済というのは，マーケティングの世界で有名なB・J・パインII氏＆J・H・ギルモア氏，およびバーンド・H.
シュミット教授が提唱した新しい経済価値で，“ 製品の質や便利さを超えた価値 ” …… つまり ， “ 顧客の経 験 ” に焦点を当てた価値を求めるべきだという理論です。具体的にはどんなものが相当しますか？例えば，ドトールコーヒーやマクドナルドで売られているコーヒーが200円以下であるのに対して，なぜスターバックスのコーヒーが4〜5割も割高な，場合によっては500円近くでも売れるのか，という話ですね。そこには，物質的な価値……つまり，味だとかコーヒー豆の品質だとか，そういうもの以外の価値。スターバックスでコーヒーを飲むことの心地よさやお店の雰囲気だとか，顧客の経験/体験を含めたトータル的な価値があるからだという指摘です。“経験”という無形の価値を商材に付加させることによって，より強い競争力を得ることができる。価格や品質とは違う面で勝負ができ，結果として，企業に高い収益性をもたらすというわけです。なるほど。よく分かります。私が見るに，オンラインゲームというのは，まさにこの経験経済をベースをにした新しい産業分野なのではないかと思うんですよね。物質的な側面がなにもないという意味でも，これは非常に“顕著な例”なのではないかと。それを踏まえて，オンラインゲームの経験価値を一言で表すと「居場所」になるということでしょうか。オンラインゲームの魅力というと，ゲームとしての面白さ，目新しさなどのほかに，コミュニュティ性という点が良く指摘されますよね。私が「プレイヤーがなぜオンラインゲームを遊び続けるのか」を調査したときに，もっとも収益性と高い相関を示したのが，まさにコミュニティ性でした。新奇性やゲーム性といった部分は，ゲームに対する熱中度を高めてくれるのですが，にも関わらず，この熱中度と収益性には相関が見られませんでした。ちょっと意外ですよね。のめり込んだらお金を払いそうにも思えますが。まぁオンラインゲームにお金を払う理由は様々でしょうし，あくまで「今回の分析では」という話なので，決め付けて考えてしまうのも危険です。ただオンラインゲームのほかにも，YouTube，ニコニコ動画，Yahoo!動画，GyaOといった動画サイトの価値分析も行ってみたのですが，そこでも，やはりコミュニティと収益性の間に相関が見られたんですよね。つまり，質の高い動画があるから，とか便利な機能があるからなどでお金を払っているのではなく，ゲーム/動画を介した他人とのやり取りが楽しいからお金を払っているというのが，今回の分析結果だったんです。ニコニコ動画のプレミアムサービスや，経験値アップ，ステータスアップなどのゲーム内アイテムだとかは，「便利さを売り物にしている」わけではないんですか？売っているものそれだけを見れば，確かに便利さを売っていると言えるかもしれません。しかし，一歩踏み込んで考えてみた場合，「なぜ便利に使いたいのか」「なぜレベルを上げたいのか」と言えば，やはりその先に，友達と一緒に遊ぶとか，コミュニティの輪に入っていきたいとか，みんなの中で一番高いレベルになりたいだとか，そういう要因があるのではないでしょうか。便利さそのものが本質的な価値（お金を払っている理由）ではないと思うんですよね。なるほど，分かる気はします。コミュニティの中での自分を強く見せたい，格好良く見せたい，あるいはそこで快適に過ごしたい……など，そういう「コミュニティの中での経験」に，オンラインゲームのプレイヤーは価値を見い出しているのではないでしょうか。ちょっと話が経験経済から離れるんですけど，オンラインゲームの課金形式についてどう思われますか？正直に言わせていただきますと，もっと改善の余地がある部分だと思います。「人はなぜ形のないものを買うのか」では，オンラインゲーム（サービス）の課金タイミングを一つのテーマとして取り扱ったのですが，高すぎず安すぎず，顧客の満足度に沿った「より適切な課金モデル」の模索というのは，今後さらに重要となるでしょう。あえてプレイヤーの立場を捨てて考えて見ると，オンラインゲームの課金モデル/金額については，「これは本当に適切なんだろうか」と昔から疑問でした。プレイヤーは数十時間，数百時間という単位で遊ぶのに，月額課金のサービスモデルだと，どうあがいても月に1500円程度しか売り上げが上がりません。プレイヤーから見たら「割安の娯楽」で片付けられてしまうかもしれないけれど，お客さんを数百時間満足させた結果が1500円というのは，ビジネス活動として見た場合にどうなんだろうか，と。最近は，アイテム課金制のタイトルも増えてきて，のめり込んでいる人に沢山お金を支払ってもらうスタイルも増えてきましたよね。まぁあまりにアイテム前提のバランスにしてしまうと，顧客の満足度が下がってしまうので諸刃の剣ですが，手法の一つとして，今後こういうやり方が洗練されていくのは間違いないとは思います。……とはいえ，ユーザー単価のみを安易に求め，それが高騰するようなアイテム課金のやり方も長持ちしません。顧客の満足度に見合った課金を念頭に置きながら，より広い視野で様々な課金方法を模索すべきでしょう。オンラインゲームだと，最初に無料で遊ばせて，その後に課金をするというモデルが多いですよね。理想論で言えば，ゲームに対する満足度が高い「初期」に課金を行うほうが，あり方としては正しいんじゃないかと思います。ただオンラインゲームの場合ですと，まだそれほど認知度が高くないこともあり，とにかく遊んでもらわないとその楽しさが分かってもらえないとか，いろいろな要因がありますから，最初に無料で遊ばせること自体が一概に悪いとは言えないでしょうね。オンラインゲームだと，活気が人を呼ぶ，ゲーム自体の面白さに影響するという側面もありますしね。ただ例えば，パッケージゲームなどでは，「遊ぶ前に」お金を払わせるやり方がちゃんと成り立っていたわけですよね。それがオンラインゲームでは成り立ちにくい。その差はなんでしょうか。まず，何をもって，あるいは何がキッカケでオンラインゲームを「楽しいと感じるか」というのがあると思います。以前，私が「オンラインゲームにはまる理由」について調査をしたとき，「友達ができた」ときにゲームにはまったと答えた人が，40％近くにものぼりました。つまり，友達ができてコミュニティの輪が広がっていくことで，徐々に面白さないし満足度が高まっていくというのが，オンラインゲームの特性としてあると思います。裏を返せば「ひとりでは面白さを味わえない」ということですね。次にビジネスモデルの違い，というのも大きいでしょう。従来型のパッケージ商品（売り切り型）というのは，満足度が高いからお金を払う……というものではありませんよね。パッケージ商品というのは，実際に使用する前……要するに前払いのビジネスモデルですから，買う前にその商品が良いかどうかは分かりません。じゃあ，何をもってその商品を買うのかといえば，「満足度の予想」がキーになっています。つまり，これを買えばこのくらい満足できそうだ……という予測値が高い場合に，顧客はお金を前もって支払い，その商品を購入する。映画やゲームに続編が多いのも，そうした「予想の満足度」が高まりやすいからなんですね。ええ。続編であれば，前作の感動ないし面白さが“予測値に上乗せ”されますから，購入に結びつきやすいんですね。テレビCMなどで，ことさら期待を煽るような売り文句が多いのも，基本的には，この予想の満足度を高めるという点に集約されているからだと考えられます。なるほど。一方，オンラインゲームというのは，長い間遊び続けてもらうことで収益性が高まる，サービス業的なビジネスモデルですよね。ですから，事前に煽るだけ煽ればいいかというと，そういうワケにもいきません。広告展開にしても営業活動にしても，自然と力の入れどころが変わってくるのではないでしょうか。より適切な課金モデルの模索が必要だとして，そこで重要になる要素とはなんだと思いますか？そこは繰り返しになりますけど，やはり「居場所」であり，またそれを演出する施策なのではないかと思います。では改めて，その「居場所」とは，具体的にはどういう意味なのでしょうか。そうですね。これは大枠の話からになってしまうのですが，私としては，今後のコミュニティについては，「情報」から「活動」にポイントがシフトしていくのではないかと考えているんです。と言いますと？これまでのコミュニティ論というと，どちらかといえば，コミュニケーションの対象となる「情報」が注目されていましたよね。Amazonの書評，アットコスメのクチコミ，オークションサイトの網羅性など，コミュニケーションするからには，何かしら有益な情報があり，有益な情報があるからこそ人が集まるのだという理屈です。そうですね。しかし，ここ最近出てきたネットワークサービス，例えば，mixiだとかニコニコ動画，Twitterなどを見ていると，決して有益な情報ばかりではないと思うんですよね。むしろ，他愛のないおしゃべり，どうでも良いような情報が，ネット上には溢れている。以前より言われていますし，確かに感じますね。ええ。つまり，話の内容（情報）自体に価値があるのではなく，会話という行為，コミュニティでの活動自体に価値があるのではないかと思うんですよね。私の言う「居場所」というのは，そうした問題意識から生まれたキーワードなのです。なるほど。そういう視点でオンラインゲームというものを捉えてみると，オンラインゲームにおけるゲームプレイというのは，先ほども話したような「情報」ではなく，「 一緒に冒険をした 」「 一緒に戦った」という， “ 体験 ” であ り “ 活 動 ” ですよね。単なる情報交換から，体験や行動を伴ったより奥深い，リアリティのあるものになっている。オンラインゲームは，ネットビジネスでは数少ない有料化が成功している例だと思いますが，なぜ有料でも人が遊び続けるのかといえば，そうした経験価値を提供できているためではないでしょうか。確かに便利さや情報は，代替可能な場合が多いですからね。Web界隈のマネタイズの難しさは，私もよく考えるところです。一体なにが「お金を払う」というモチベーションにつながるのかなど。また「居場所」というキーワードに注目した場合，コミュニティでのアイデンティティ，もっと言えば「バーチャル・アイデンティティ」が，より重要なポイントとなると思います。アイデンティティが強固に形成されれば，それだけそのサービスに高い価値を感じ，支払ってもよいという金額が増えていきますから。アイテム課金で販売されている服や強い装備などというのは，プレイヤーのアイデンティティを醸造/演出するための小道具なわけで，だからこそ高いニーズがあるのだと思います。よく「アバターの服なんかにお金を払うのが理解できない」なんて話が聞かれますが，要は，ゲームを遊んでない人は，ゲーム内（コミュニティ）の経験価値が分かってないということなんですかね。物質的な面での価値で判断しているから，価値がないと感じる。一方，そのゲームを遊んでいる，コミュニティに参加している人にとっては，体験や活動という心理的な価値を見いだしているので，それに対してお金を払っているんだという。そうですね。経験経済の話でいえば，例えば，ディズニーランドが高い収益性を誇るのも，そうした心理的価値の演出にあると言われています。先の[新訳]経験経済にある言葉を借りれば，「親が子供をディズニーランドに連れていくのは，そこで行われているイベントそのもののためではなく，そこで共有する経験を，何か月後，あるいは何年か後の家族の会話として残しておきたいからだ」という。観光地やデートスポットになるような場所での売りものの価格の高さも，そうした心理的な演出による効果だということですね。ええ。そして，この心理的価値を収益性に結びつけるというのは，ネットビジネス，ひいては今後来るであろう仮想世界社会において，重要な要素になり得るのではないかと思います。分かりました。本日はありがとうございました。オンラインゲームの話を中心に，「経験経済」についていろいろな話が聞けた野島氏へのインタビュー。オンラインゲームに限らず，ネットビジネス，あるいはあらゆるサービス全般に応用が利く話だったように思う。「経験経済」という切り口でゲーム業界を考えて見れば，近年，ゲームでもっともコモディティ化（※）が進んでいる要素の一つに，「グラフィックス」や「ハードウェアのスペック」といった要素が挙げられるかもしれない。ハードウェアが進歩し，急激にグラフィックス品質が高まっていく一方で，「もうこれ以上綺麗になっても」「ゲーム部分が面白ければいい」という言葉は，定期的に耳に入ってくるフレーズではある。グラフィックスの進化がまだまだ途上であり，またグラフィックスの凄さが面白さを演出することも少なくないとは思うが，ニンテンドーDSをはじめとした携帯ゲーム機のグラフィックスでも，面白いゲームは十分に面白いのも，また確かだ。現在のゲーム市場は，ご存じのように任天堂の一人勝ちの様相を呈しているが，WiiやニンテンドーDSがなぜここまでの成功が出来たのか。スペック競争という物質的な（あるいはコモディティ化した）価値で勝負せず，リモコン型デバイスやタッチペンを使った，を演出して見せたから……というのは，この結果の一つの説明にはなるのかもしれない。今後は，PCオンラインゲーム，家庭用ゲーム機を問わず，ネットワークサービスを絡めたより広い範囲で，このゲームの体験を高める競争が行われていくことと思うが，一プレイヤーとしては，あっと驚くような
“ 体験 ” の出現を期待したいところだ。
Yes more anecdotal evidence of a colder winter in the northern hemisphere .
This is the second time in 5 years .
A USATODAY story says it was “ the first time ever ” in 2004 .
Even the BBC reported it .
There seems to be some confusion on the precendence between news organizations .
In the 2004 stories , USATODAY says “ first time ever ” while BBC says “ every 20 to 30 years ” .
I would tend to believe the Abu Dhabi local newspaper ( over the BBC ) who now says “ second time in recorded history ” in their story below .

This is the frozen north … of the UAE
by Anna Zacharias of The National , in Abu Dhabi
Snow settles on the Jebel Jais mountain in Ras al Khaimah yesterday .

RAS AL KHAIMAH //
Snow covered the Jebel Jais area for only the second time in recorded history yesterday .
So rare was the event that one lifelong resident said the local dialect had no word for it .
According to the RAK Government , temperatures on Jebel Jais dropped to - 3 °C on Friday night .
On Saturday , the area had reached 1°C .
Major Saeed Rashid al Yamahi , a helicopter pilot and the manager of the Air Wing of RAK Police , said the snow covered an area of five kilometres and was 10 cm deep .
“ The sight up there this morning was totally unbelievable , with the snow - capped mountain and the entire area covered with fresh , dazzling white snow , ” Major al Yamahi said .
“ The snowfall started at 3 pm Friday , and heavy snowing began at 8 pm and continued till midnight , covering the entire area in a thick blanket of snow .
Much of the snow was still there even when we flew back from the mountain this afternoon .
It is still freezing cold up there and there are chances that it might snow again tonight . ”
Aisha al Hebsy , a woman in her 50s who has lived in the mountains near Jebel Jais all her life , said snowfall in the area was so unheard of the local dialect does not even have a word for it .
Hail is known as bared , which literally translates as cold .
“ Twenty years ago we had lots of hail , ” said Ms al Hebsy .
“ Last night was like this .
At four in the morning we came out and the ground was white . ”
Jebel Jais was dusted in snow on Dec 28 , 2004 , the first snowfall in living memory for Ras al Khaimah residents .
“ I had flown there in 2004 when it snowed , but this time it was much bigger and the snowing lasted longer as well , ” said Major al Yamahi .
At the base of the mountains , residents also reported severe hail on Friday night .
“ We had hail .
Last night was very cold , but there can only be snow on Jebel Jais because it ’s the tallest , ” said Fatima al Ali , 30 , a resident of a village beneath the mountains .
In Ras al Khaimah City , 25 km from Jebel Jais , sheet lightning and thunder shook houses .
Main roads from Qusaidat to Nakheel were still badly flooded on Saturday , while temperatures at the RAK International Airport fluctuated between 10 and 22°C .
M Varghese , an observer at the RAK Airport Meteorological Office , told of the storms that hit the emirate on Friday night .
“ We had thunderstorms with rain for more than 12 hours and we had around 18 mm rain , ” Mr Varghese said .
“ The rain , along with the cold easterly winds and low - lying clouds , could have bought the temperatures further down on the mountains . ”
Giorgio Alessio , a meteorologist at the Dubai meteorology office , said : “ In thunderstorms , the rain comes down very rapidly from higher levels , and the rain that usually forms can reach the ground in some places as snow .
In the next few days the weather regime is completely different and will return to normal for the season , with a maximum temperature of 23 °C or 24°C .
“ The night might cool down in the desert below 10°C .
There is variability in the weather from year to year but it has n’t shown a trend in getting colder or getting warmer . ”
The RAK Government plans to transform the 1,740 m Jebel Jais into the UAE ’s first outdoor ski resort , using Australian technology that will allow tourists to ski in temperatures up to 35°C .
Abu Dhabi and Dubai also had heavy rain on Friday night .

Its a debate that will rage on for as long as the car still exists .
What are the best cars of all time ?
Youve read all the other lists , now read ours .
This is Carrentals ' version of the best cars of all time and it shuns the norm , because weve got 16 cars on our list .
Sixteen : Nissan Skyline
Ever watched The Fast and The Furious ?
Nope .
Well , in it theres the wonderful Nissan Skyline , loved by engineers and chavs the world over .
Never officially imported into the UK , this machine , created nearly 20 years ago was light years ahead of its time in terms of technology .
Featuring all wheel drive and , with the later models , 600 bhp , and not costing too much , this is a fanboy 's dream .
Just look at it - it reeks of Chav !
But , what a car ....
Fifteen : Jaguar XJ220
A famous beast , but flawed in so many , many ways .
This yacht of supercars was at one stage , the fastest production car on earth , capable of 220 mph .
But it was flawed from the start , with a hefty V12 engine replaced with a V6 and the much touted 4WD scrapped .
People who bought it tried to sue Jaguar .
Oh yes , thats a success .
It was expensive as well , and sounded like a Nova with a big bore exhaust .
On the list because of its speed , but it couldve been oh so better .
Flawed but brilliant .
Sort of like Kerry Katona
Fourteen : Ford GT40
Named so because its overall height was just 40 inches ( Id like to see it get down Owlsmoor Road with all its speed humps then ) , this car completely turned racing on its head in the mid 1960s and won Le Mans four times in a row .
This car also spawned the road going Ford GT , which is also a mighty fine car , for that legacy , we salute you .
The most desirable Ford of all time , the GT40
Thirteen : Ferrari Enzo
A car so good , it was named after the companys founder .
This shows you how good they thought the cars are .
Probably one of the most striking cars ever built , just 399 were made .
It has an estimated top speed of 230 mph and any schoolboy ( young or old ) could spot it out from a car park of Testarossas .
The Enzo . Enough said .
Twelve : Toyota Prius
A hybrid car that everyone knows about .
For that sentence alone , it should be in the list .
Cheap ( sort of ) , economical ( despite what Top Gear says ) and reliable ( kinda ) the Prius is the king of the Hybrids , showing everyone that alternative fuels are not just the reserve of freaky hippies and movie stars .
Looks like a geography teacher though , does n't it ?
Eleven : Model T Ford
This is what started it all .
First produced exactly 100 years ago , this was the first car that any Tom , Dick or Harry could buy .
And they did .
It wasnt that good , but it started the worlds love affair with cars that even after all this time , hasnt finished .
It also inspired a Japanese engineer , Soichiro Honda to start building bikes and carsthats good enough in my mind anyway .
Loathed by environmentalists for starting it all .
This could n't be more important
Ten : TVR Tuscan
Yes , we know it has dubious reliability , and we know that the company seems to always be in crisis .
But , it has up to 400 bhp , and is probably one of the most beautiful cars ever made .
On that merit only , it makes our top ten .
TVR : always failing , always making me drool .
Nine : AC Cobra
A proper muscle car .
British built in the 1960s , this beast is powered by a massive V8 engine and took on Le Mans .
You can still get the car as well , and put a Jaguar engine in it , which , if you can afford it , is definitely the way to go !
A car that looks like it can kick my ass
Eight : Jaguar E- Type
Is there anything more British than a Jaguar E - Type ?
Possible the car next on our list , but the Jaguar E - Type is timeless .
When this car was released , Enzo Ferrari said it was the most beautiful car ever made .
With The Big E amongst its fans , it couldnt fail .
And it didnt .
A rich motorsport history and a legend about the M1 , this is surely one of the greatest ever cars .
Mr Ferrari said it was the most beautiful car ever made ...
Seven : Aston Martin DB9
Hands up who wants to be James Bond ?
Anyone not get their hand up ?
Yes , James Bonds car and its a beauty .
With a design that makes men want to sell their houses and wives to buy the car ( I dont mind !
Ill sleep in it ! )
Its such a lovely machine that it was classed by Jeremy Clarkson as motoring perfection .
Thats the only reason its not higher in our list .
DB9 .
Motoring perfection
Six : Bugatti Veyron
Only at number 6 ??!
What are we playing at ?
Well , it may be faster than an FIA fine against Lewis Hamilton , but its too new to be classed as one of the greatest ever .
Surely the greatest piece of automotive engineering that is and probably ever will be ; it needs to be around for another 10 years to become a true legend .
How much to insure ?
The W16 will certainly need a lot of spark plugs !
Five : Ferrari 250 GTO
What top 10 list would not be complete without a Ferrari ?
And were talking about one of the absolute best .
A V12 , 3 Litre engine and when it was released in the early 1960s , the applicants had to be approved personally by Enzo Ferrari himself .
Designed for racing , this machine grew more and more valuable as the years passed .
The highest price a GTO has been sold at an auction was $ 13.3 M in 1989 .
It is , also , a beautiful car .
Why are those people looking the other way !??!?
Four : Subaru Impreza
A rice burner ahead of the GTO and Bugatti Veyron have we gone mad ?
Perhaps .
But there are few cars that have changed the landscape like the Subrau Impreza .
Immortalised by the late , great Colin McRae in the UK , everyone wanted a blue Impreza .
The people who were lucky enough to own one or drive one then realised that they never wanted anything else .
With 4WD and a turbo - charged engine , it was a dream and some of the tuned machines hit 170 mph +
What more did people want ?
Check it out - what 's there not to like ?
Three : McLaren F1
Hands up who doesnt know the top speed of the McLaren F1 ?
Of course you all do .
When it was released , it stood out amongst all the other supercars like a M5 at a Robin Reliant convention .
Designed by 1980s F1 god Gordon Murray and powered by a BMW engine it was an instant hit and holds the honour of being the only car to win Le Mans on its debut .
I really , really want one .
Now we 're getting into the realms of fantasy .
Not even Lewis Hamilton has one of these .
Two : Lancia Stratos
Another complete legend .
Imagine 560 bhp with no traction control or driving aides .
Got that in your head ?
Good .
Now imagine it on dirt , snow or gravel .
Then youre talking about the absolutely amazing reputation this had .
But it was quick enough to take three world championship wins in the World Rally Championship in the mid seventies .
Only 492 were ever made .
Its rarity and its legendary status puts it in at number 2 .
A Ferrari rally car .
Awesome .
And number 1 ??
Well , thats up to you to decide .
Comment on the below and we will decide in a week whats the best car the debate is raging here at Carrentals what do you all think ?

The financial meltdown that hit Wall Street and the global financial markets was due to the lack of regulations — that is , a lack of regulations on government .
It does n't take the most competent forensic expert to put the crime scene squarely at the doorstep of the quasi - government banking institutes Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac .
These two Government Sponsored Enterprises ( GSEs ) , one of which was founded back during FDR's New Deal , are at the epicenter of the runaway financial meltdown that has enveloped the globe .
Without a doubt , they have wielded too much financial political muscle with too little Congressional oversight .
Some political leaders in 2003 , mostly Republicans , attempted to rein in Fannie and Freddie , which handle a majority of the $ 12 trillion mortgage market .
The New York Times called these reforms " the most significant regulatory overhaul in the housing finance industry since the savings and loan crisis a decade ago . "
But the Democrats , especially Rep. Barney Frank , blocked the bill , fearing that it would inhibit loans to low - income households .
Calling Fannie and Freddie financially sound just a few years ago , many of the Congressmen opposed to stronger financial regulation were on the receiving end of political contributions by these two state corporations .
In fact , both of these taxpayer - backed corporations together spent nearly $ 200 million to lobby Congress and financial political action organizations .
Much of the money went to affordable housing advocates , political groups , lobbyists , politicians , and anyone who opposed Fannie and Freddie 's excesses .
Running wild , these institutions were given all sorts of political and financial preferential treatments .
For instance , banks are required to retain 10 percent of their capital , but Fannie and Freddie needed to keep only 2.5 percent of their capital , giving them a competitive advantage and the ability to buy even more questionable mortgages .
Both corporations are even exempt from SEC filing requirements .
So when did this all start ?
It appears that the trail of bread crumbs leads back to when President Jimmy Carter helped pass the Community Reinvestment Act in 1977 , requiring banks to provide loans to low - income areas , regardless of borrowers ' credit worthiness or job history .
In short order , banks were successfully sued over charges of racism and redlining when they hesitated to lend to people considered incapable of paying back the loans .
Ironically , when banks were reluctant to lend to high - risk borrowers , they were often condemned as racists , yet when they were finally cowed into making loans to unqualified borrowers , many mortgage lenders , including Countrywide , were sued for " predatory lending practices . "
Under the lobbying pressure of Fannie and Freddie , Congress was persuaded to mandate these two government - chartered corporations to open up the subprime home loan floodgates by the mid-1990s .
Subprime loans were now available to anyone with a pulse , regardless of bad credit history and low income .
Next , Fannie and Freddie leveraged their advantages , bundling the loans into mortgage - backed securities and selling them around the world .
Soon other banks followed suit , determined to remain competitive with the GSEs .
Underwriting standards became almost nonexistent in a rush to sell loans to a huge segment of society that could never before qualify for a home loan .
Moreover , another quasi-public agency , Federal Reserve System , had a heavy hand in taking the economy for a harrowing rollercoaster ride .
From the outset , the Fed did what it has done so well in the past , especially prior to the Great Depression ; it flooded the market with massive amounts of money .
In this case , their reckless money machine generated a housing bubble that eventually burst across financial markets and Main Street .
The Fed 's easy - credit policies had again primed the economic pump with fiat money , which encouraged large and small speculators to get involved in questionable loans and over - priced real estate .
But lowering underwriting standards , disregarding credit history , and promoting " no doc " loans with no down payment were only part of the problem .
Another piece of the puzzle involved " moral hazard " — a situation in which people engage in risky behavior because they feel protected .
As government - subsidized corporations , Fannie and Freddie would not be permitted to fail .
The federal government would always come to their rescue , by cranking up the money - printing press , or by increasing taxes .
These two government - chartered corporations would never have to bear the full consequences of their actions , since the federal government was always there to bail them out .
With such unlimited guarantees , Fannie and Freddie threw open the doors to bad , high - risk loans by privatizing rewards and socializing risk , the essential feature of a mixed economy .
Although some pundits have tried to pin the blame for this mess on laissez faire markets and libertarian ideology , we got into this situation because quasi - government corporations had little fear of financial failure or of greater congressional restraints .
Fannie and Freddie got special political treatment and ran recklessly across the political and economic landscape .
In essence , the current financial crisis is the result of an unfettered fusion of big business with big government — once known as mercantilism .
And when that happens , the out - of - control actions of the corporate state often threaten to sink the ship of state as well as everyone still clinging to the lifeboats .
The 2008 financial meltdown could not have occurred without the interjection of politics into the mortgage industry .
A truly free market would have no need of a bailout , nor would it have expected one .

$ 20 and more .
I started playing tennis when I was 8 and it took me 5 years to break my first string .
Once I started high school and began hitting the ball harder and with more topspin , the strings started to pop frequently .
My high school racket was a Pro Kennex that cost $ 49.99 in 1990 .
The cost of stringing the racket with 16 gauge synthetic gut was $ 35 .
The true cost of the synthetic gut was actually closer to $ 3 or $ 4 and the rest was labor .
In 1990 I was not fortunate to have the internet or tools to research tennis string machines .
The local pro shop at the country club was my only alternative for our high school team .
In prior years , they had a student who would string rackets and offer a substantial savings for the team .
Here ’s where the business idea started .
I subscribed to Tennis magazine and saw ads for several expensive string machines that would cost in excess of $ 1,000 .
At 14 years old , I was not about to have the $ 1,000 needed for a state of the art pro shop quality machine like a gamma stringer or prince stringer .
I did see an ad for a Klippermate that cost less than $ 200 and was advertised as an easy to use , drop weight machine .
A few days later I opened my package from Klipper and got to work stringing rackets for our high school team .
In 1990 I was not able to utilize YouTube videos teaching tennis stringing techniques , so I had to rely on the manual that came with the Klippermate .
It took me 2 hours to string my first racket , as I had to learn about the string pattern and knot tie off points , tension , and the art of tying a knot .
Tying knots is really not difficult , it just appears to be a little intimidating at first .
My second racket took 45 minutes , and my fastest time is around 25 minutes using the Klippermate .
I used to travel with my stringer in my car and take it down to the tennis courts to work on my friends rackets .
What did I charge them ?
I was a nice guy , and covered my expense for the string and some of my time and charged $ 5 .
I know , the local pro shop charged $ 35 , but these were my buddies .
Today I still have a Klippermate and love it .
Tennis stringers like the Klippermate can be easy to use , does n’t require a stand , it ’s portable , inexpensive , and fun .
It ’s a blast saving money , and you can actually make a business out of your tennis stringer .
I currently still string for friends and only charge for the string .
Current rates for stringing are still $ 20 + at your local pro shop or retail store , so the opportunity to build a tennis stringing business is huge .
Where would I advertise if I wanted to create alternative income from stringing tennis rackets ?
1. Craigslist
You can advertise for your local area or if you commute to work , like San Francisco , you can offer to pickup rackets .
2. Business cards Create a business card and hand it out next time you play tennis .
Leave some at you local park tennis courts or even Starbucks .
Vista Print is a great resource for inexpensive business cards .
Be creative and add some graphics to make your business stand out .
3 . Word of mouth
Offer to string some rackets at your local high school for free .
This could be a great community outreach opportunity and gain some business from parents .
Offer each student a free tennis stringing and show off your new talent .
Stringing tennis rackets might sound interesting , but are you still unsure of your ability ?
Do n’t worry , it ’s not rocket science .
I have friends that come over and look at me stringing tennis rackets like I ’m undergoing brain surgery .
Yes , you do have a few parts like clamps , stringer awl , and pliers , but they are really easy to use .
The hardest part about stringing tennis rackets can be reading the directions .
You get so excited that you want to dive in and start stringing right away .
Just take a few minutes to read the directions and you will save a lot of time .
Stringing tennis rackets can be a wonderful alternative income for yourself and your family .
You can make $ 20 + an hour and your income potential is unlimited .
If you attend college , you could string rackets in your dorm room for extra income .
High school students can bring the stringer to the tennis courts and string after school for money .
My favorite multitasking tip for tennis stringers is to watch tv and string at the same time .
You can watch your favorite tv program and make money stringing tennis rackets .
Lot ’s of people are looking for the perfect work at home business and this could certainly allow you to start one for very little money .
My total cost for the Klippermate and string was under $ 200 .
Add some business cards from Vista Print and a listing on Craigslist and you ’re set .
Remember to hand out those cards the next time you play singles or doubles tennis .
If you currently string rackets , I would love to hear what your fastest time is and how much you charge your customers ?
Do you have a tennis business or stringing business already ?

Raising Freethinkers : A Practical Guide for Parenting Beyond Belief ( by Dale McGowan )
This book , by the author of Parenting Beyond Belief , takes secular parenting to a new level .
It deals with issues such as moral development without religion , death , and dealing with religious people ( including extended family members ) .
Also included is a list of over 100 activities non-religious parents can do with their children ( the activities are specific to secular parents , I presume ) .
…
Everything You Know About God Is Wrong : The Disinformation Guide to Religion ( edited by Russ Kick )
This is an easy - to - read collection of writings about atheism and the problems with religion ( contributors include Richard Dawkins and Neil Gaiman ) .
The pieces are quick and snappy ; perfect for toilet reading .
…
Godless : How an Evangelical Preacher Became One of America ’s Leading Atheists ( by Dan Barker )
This is about the journey from fundamental Christianity to hardcore atheism , as written by the co-president of the Freedom From Religion Foundation .
He describes his former self as the type of Christian you “ would n’t want to sit next to on a bus ” so it ’s amazing to read how he became non-religious coming from that world .
Even more touching is the chapter on how he explained that decision to friends and family members who could n’t believe what he was doing .
…
Forbidden Fruit : The Ethics of Secularism ( by Paul Kurtz )
Kurtz is the founder / chairman of the Council for Secular Humanism and the Center for Inquiry .
In this book , he explains why God is not necessary to explain secular morality .
The topics covered include animal rights and sexual / reproductive freedom .
It ’s heavier reading than other books on this list , but you ’ll finish it feeling optimistic and appreciative of being a Humanist .
…
Disbelief 101 : A Young Person ’s Guide to Atheism ( by S.C. Hitchcock )
This one wo n’t be available for a while , but I ’m looking forward to it .
It ’s essentially The God Delusion - lite — More humorous , however , and with several illustrations .
( On a side note , I ’m curious who designed the cover image .
While it might appeal to teenagers , it not - so - subtlely perpetuates the notion that atheists are vandals .
That ’s not the intention , of course .
Still , it ’s not a very positive image … )

The Portable Atheist : Essential Readings for the Nonbeliever ( selected by Christopher Hitchens )
This book is a collection of some of the best writing by atheists throughout history — from David Hume and Bertrand Russell to Penn Jillette and Ayaan Hirsi Ali .
In case you do n’t want the entire book , you can read many of those essays ( at least the ones that are in the public domain ) online .
…
Christian No More : On Leaving Christianity , Debunking Christianity , and Embracing Atheism and Freethinking ( by Jeffrey Mark )
Another strong book about a Christian who became an atheist .
This one discusses specific church doctrine and Christians beliefs as well as the misconceptions many Christians have about science and the scientific method .
…
Atheism Advanced : Further Thoughts of a Freethinker ( by David Eller )
This book is for those of us who ’ve already read all the “ atheist primer ” books .
We know the basic arguments in favor of atheism .
Now we want more .
Questions raised and answered in this book include : “ Why must Atheists stop ‘ speaking Christian ? ' ” and “ How are gods created , and are they being manufactured today ? ”
…
The Secular Conscience : Why Belief Belongs in Public Life ( by Austin Dacey )
This is a manual on how and why non-religious people should pursue a progressive agenda .
Obviously , one would expect atheists to stand up for reason and science and chuch / state separation .
But Dacey also explains why we ought to support “ freedom of belief , personal autonomy , equality , toleration , and self - criticism . ”
Religion is n’t the only framework for those morals and we need a resurgence in secular morality , he argues .
…
Living Without God : New Directions for Atheists , Agnostics , Secularists , and the Undecided ( by Ronald Aronson )
This book is n’t about being an anti-theist .
It ’s focused on positive atheism .
Aronson talks about the inequalities in our world and why they are there , what we can hope for with a secular worldview , and what we ought to be doing to make this world better .

1981 : Citing their socially destructive effects , Philippines President Ferdinand Marcos bans videogames in his country .
Filipinos are given two weeks to hand over or destroy their game consoles .
Marcos was no stranger to imposing draconian solutions .
The Philippines lived under martial law throughout the 1970s , Marcos ' way of dealing with the increasingly radical elements – a restive university population and a resurgent Communist movement , mainly – that grew in opposition to his corrupt regime .
In this case , though , he was responding to pressure from parents and educators , who claimed that games such as Space Invaders and Asteroids were a " destructive social enemy , the electrical bandit " that was weakening the moral fiber of the young and turning them into a generation of obsessives .
While ample evidence exists – including testimonials from game players themselves – to support the argument that excessive videogaming can be both highly addictive and behavior altering , it 's probably safe to characterize Marcos ' reaction as a tad heavy - handed .
It was not without its supporters , however , nor was the Philippines the only country to impose restrictions on videogames .
Marcos ' outright ban on all videogames , though , was unique at the time , at least in the so - called free world .
Just this year , Afghanistan 's Islamic government proposed an absolute ban on videogames , while also considering the outlawing of dog - and bird - fighting , and billiards .
In the West , the violent content that is the central feature of so many games continues to prompt various restrictions .
In the United States , for example , individual states have imposed sales restrictions on games deemed too violent or sexually explicit for younger gamers .
The videogame industry has been encouraged to be self - policing , and a ratings system exists , similar to what the movie industry uses .
But enforcement is difficult , and the industry 's policing efforts – in the face of such enormous profitability – have been half - hearted at best .

Lori Drew was accused of posing as a boy on MySpace
An American woman , accused of driving a teenage girl to suicide by bullying her on MySpace , has been cleared of one of the most serious charges against her .
Lori Drew , 49 , was found not guilty of accessing a computer without authorisation to inflict emotional distress .
The jury failed to reach a verdict on another conspiracy charge .
She was convicted on three minor counts of violating the website 's terms and conditions .
Drew , from Missouri , was accused of posing as a boy on MySpace to befriend 13 - year - old Megan Meier , who hanged herself after their virtual relationship ended .
The court in Los Angeles heard that Lori Drew was aware Megan suffered from depression and was emotionally fragile .
Drew was charged with violating MySpace 's terms of use , which ban users from assuming false identities and harassing other members .
The case is the first in the US relating to cyber - bullying .
Lori Drew could receive up to three years in prison when she is sentenced .
She would have faced a maximum 20 years if convicted of the more serious felony charges .
A prof supplies data showing exposure to violent video games has " no significant relationship " to mass shootings .
In other news , exposure to " Dancing with the Stars " has no significant relationship to train robberies .

Before you go all " No shit , professor , I could have told you that , " realize the guy is trying to answer the question credibly and completely and with empirical data , which is a hell of a lot more intellectually honest than people who immediately connect those dots on talking head shows in the news .
Anyway , Christopher Ferguson of Texas A&M International University , published in the latest Investigative Psychology and Offender Profiling , says despite more than a decade 's worth of information there is no link between violent crimes and violent games , even though every time a perp 's game habit is brought up it 's taken for granted .

Instead , Ferguson looks at the conditions that create a moral panic and often drag video games in for the ritual beating .
And he implies that this outrage is more than a little goosed by researchers seeking that next grant check .
" It has been observed that a small group of researchers have been most vocal in promoting the anti-game message , oftentimes ignoring research from other researchers , or failing to disclose problems with their own research .
As some researchers have staked their professional reputation on anti-game activism , it may be difficult for these researchers to maintain scientific objectivity regarding the subject of their study .
Similarly , it may be argued that granting agencies are more likely to provide grant money when a potential problem is identified , rather than for studying a topic with the possibility that the outcome may reveal that there is nothing to worry about . "

MTV : Just Ignore That Nice New Video Site We Rolled Out Yesterday
I ’ve just heard back from the folks at MTV.com , who ’ve explained what they ’re up to with MTV Music , the nifty video archive site they quietly rolled out yesterday .
The answer :
They really have n’t rolled out the site .
And , in fact , they do n’t ever really plan to do so–it ’s not really supposed to be something that regular Web surfers are meant to use .
Confused ?
So am I : After all , MTV Music has a nice , clean design , lots and lots of easy - to - access archival clips ( MediaMemo just lost 30 minutes digging through the De La Soul collection ) .
So why build that unless you wanted everyone to see it ?
MTV.com spokesman Tom Biro tried to explain , and if I understand him correctly , the site is supposed to be used as a sort of white - label archive that can be used both by MTV Networks , owned by Viacom ( VIA ) , to build other video sites , as well as outsiders , both professionals and amateurs .
MediaMemo , for instance , might want to build its own De La Soul fan site , and could grab all the clips needed from the MTV site .
That also explains why the site has such a nice clean , look :
There are n’t any ads there , because MTV is n’t selling it as a destination site .
Presumably , though , MTV will one day find a way to insert advertising into the clips , so visitors to my De La Soul site will generate some revenue for the network .
In the meantime , you can see this golden oldie , which I remember from , um , high school , without having to view a single ad .

Benedict 's rationale :

Unbelievable .
But if you really grasp how reactionary Benedict is , not terribly shocking .
The Times ' Ruth Gledhill :
Could the clock really be turned back this far on Nostra Aetate and the teachings of Vatican II ?
Yes , they can .
Here 's the bigot himself :
I am truly , deeply ashamed of my church for this action and hope this provokes such an outcry it is reversed .
These are not the words of Christ .
They are the words of evil .

A estimated two million uninsured motorists face having their vehicles confiscated and crushed even if they are not caught driving them , under government plans announced today .
The proposals would strengthen the law so that it would be an offence to keep an uninsured car -- at present it is only illegal to drive without insurance .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
The government says uninsured and untraced drivers kill 160 people every year and injure 23,000 others .
As well as the human cost , uninsured driving adds an extra 30 pounds a year to every motorist 's insurance , adding up to 400 million pounds of additional premiums .
The Driver Vehicle Licensing Agency ( DVLA ) would work with insurance companies to identify uninsured cars .
Letters will be sent to owners found without insurance , threatening them a 100 pound penalty notice , rising to as much as 1,000 pounds if they are taken to court .
They would also face the seizure of their car , which would be sold , or destroyed if of low value .
" These tough new measures will leave uninsured drivers with nowhere to hide , " said Road Safety Minister Jim Fitzpatrick .
Consultation on the proposals , which will require secondary legislation in parliament , begins on Tuesday and will end in mid-April .
The Department for Transport estimates that around 6.5 percent of motorists -- around 2 million -- drive while uninsured .

Police removed 150,000 uninsured vehicles in 2007 , around 400 a day , under powers introduced in the Serious Organised Crime and Police Act 2005 .
January 12 , 2009
Haidar Eid is a professor , an activist for Palestinian national rights and a resident of Gaza City who has been speaking with SocialistWorker.org throughout the attack .
On Friday , he talked again with Eric Ruder to describe the living nightmare that Gaza has become .
The 30 known dead from the Samouni family are part of a death toll that is nearing 1,000 as the Israeli attack reached the two - week mark .
Israeli casualties number around a dozen .
For example , in an eastern section of Gaza City , one extended family named the Samounis , whose members lived near one another in several homes , were herded by Israeli forces into a single building -- which was then repeatedly shelled .
The dead lay together with those left alive , but the Israelis prevented ambulances from coming to their aid for days on end .
AS ISRAELI forces began what officials called " phase three " of their onslaught on Gaza - - moving into the cities -- stories of atrocities are emerging that confirm the inhuman barbarism of the attack so far .
CAN YOU talk about what things are like in Gaza since we last talked ?
That was before Israel 's ground invasion .
THINGS ARE getting worse -- really much , much worse .
We can't find food .
We 're surviving on canned food .
We have a serious water crisis .
We still have n't seen any electricity .
And we do n't know what to do .
A friend of mine -- a comrade actually , who is a one - state activist -- told me earlier that his wife 's brother was shot dead five days ago .
And his body is still in the apartment in the Jabaliya refugee camp .
It was an execution .
They entered the house and shot him in the heart , in front of his wife and his children .
And we have n't been able to retrieve the body .
You ask the Red Cross , and they tell you that Israel will shoot at them if they go in .
You ask the United Nations , and they say they 're not allowed in .
We 've called the human rights organizations -- I myself talked to Human Rights Watch in Tel Aviv .
My friend talked to an Arab member of the Israeli Knesset .
To give you an idea , yesterday , some ambulances went to the Zeitoun neighborhood in eastern Gaza City , where the Samouni family lived in several buildings .
When the Israelis entered the area , they forced the family members out of the buildings and then into a single building .
They kept them there for 24 hours , and then they shelled the building .

So far , 30 of them are known to have died , and there are still corpses under the rubble .
That happened five days ago .
Yesterday , when some of the ambulances were finally allowed to go in there , they found children still alive , next to their mothers ' dead bodies .
One of these children , who 's about 10 years old , told Palestinian TV , " My brother was extremely hungry .
He was starving , and he asked me for a tomato .
I went , and I brought him a tomato .
He ate it , and he stopped talking . "
Which means he died .
That 's what he said .
Honestly , I do n't know whether this is Auschwitz , or what the right analogy is .
I really do n't know .
I 'm a writer , but I have n't been able to write anything .
I can't find the right words .
I find myself speechless .
Today , I refused to give interviews because I have n't been able to think .
I 'm just talking to you because I feel that you 're a friend , and we 're just talking .
But today , I did n't give a single interview .
Usually , I give 15 , sometimes 20 , sometimes 25 interviews to mainstream and alternative media .
But today , I decided not to do it , because today , I became speechless .
What you can do Protests against Israel 's assault on Gaza have already taken place in cities around the country , with more planned for the coming days .
Contact local organizers for details where you live .
For updates on the current situation , plus commentary and analysis on the background to the war , read the Electronic Intifada Web site .
Electronic Intifada Executive Director Ali Abunimah's " Gaza massacres must spur us to action " is a good starting point for further reading .
You can also find updated coverage on conditions in Gaza and the efforts of activists to stand up to the Israeli war at the Free Gaza Web site .
Between the Lines : Readings on Israel , the Palestinians and the U.S. " War on Terror , " by Tikva Honig - Parnass and Toufic Haddad , documents the apartheid - like conditions that Palestinians live under today .
For background on Israel 's war and the Palestinian struggle for freedom , read The Struggle for Palestine , a collection of essays edited by Lance Selfa on the history of the occupation and Palestinian resistance .
More than 40 percent of those who have been killed are children and women .
The figures I have here , which are tentative from the Ministry of Health , say that the number of dead as of now is 825 , including 235 children and more than 100 women .
And that is n't to say that the rest of the dead are freedom fighters or members of the militant organizations .
They are ordinary men , young and old .
AND ISRAEL'S attack keeps up around the clock , right ?
WE CAN'T walk on the street .
Right now , for example , there 's not a single person out .
It 's 6:20 in the evening .
Usually , you see people , you see cars .
But right now , not a single one .
And , of course , it 's pitch black , because there 's no electricity .
This afternoon , they gave us a temporary cease - fire -- quote , unquote - - from 1 to 3 , to walk and get food .
But the supermarkets are empty .
The Israelis say they allowed some trucks through with humanitarian aid .
But on ordinary days , Gaza needs dozens and dozens of trucks a day with food and medicine and so on .
For propaganda reasons , they said that they opened the borders , and they allowed us to walk on the streets between 1 and 3 .
But of course , we can do absolutely nothing .
I do n't think that we 've seen worse days than these days since 1948 and the Nakba .
I usually go up and have lunch with my brother , and he has three daughters and one son-- the son is six years old , and the eldest daughter is 15 .
And you can see the trauma in their eyes .
We can't sleep because of the shelling from the Apaches and F - 16s .
And the drones , 24 hours a day .
And now the mortar shells , because they have tanks around the city now .
We can't sleep , and you can it in the eyes of the children .
It 's really horrific .
THERE'S BEEN speculation by commentators here that the Israelis want to wrap up their operations before Barack Obama takes office here , which is in nine days .
YES , NINE days away , which is like nine centuries here .
I agree that they want to wrap up operations before he takes office .
But the thing is that they have nine days , and they say that they 're entering the third phase now .
The first phase , for the first eight or nine days , was intensive air strikes , targeting schools , hospitals , universities , police stations , prisons , the legislative council - - all of these things .
Then they started the ground invasion that split the Gaza Strip into three slices -- the northern slice , including Beit Lahyia , the Jabaliya refugee camp and Gaza City ; the second slice in the middle ; and then the south .
In the third phase , they want to enter the cities .
That 's what they 've been reluctant to do , because that means clashes with the resistance , from many different organizations -- not only Hamas , but the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine , the Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine and others .
According to the Israeli media , there are differences within the Israeli Cabinet itself .
There are those who think that what they 've achieved so far is enough , and that means the creation of facts on the ground .
All they have to do is reoccupy the area around the border between Rafah and Egypt , so they can control the supposed smuggling of arms and so on .
But there are others who think they should try to reoccupy some major parts of the Gaza Strip .
Today , they dropped a leaflet -- I read one of them , and it said that the third phase started last night .
And last night , they dropped -- I do n't know -- strange bombs .
I saw them with my own eyes -- they did n't give off the dark smoke that we 're used to .
It was a bright white smoke .
One of the doctors who 's volunteering at the Shifa Hospital said it was a phosphorus bomb .
And the smell was horrendous .
It was all over , coming from the north and even in Gaza City .
But the warnings and the messages they have been sending are clear .
They are saying that they 're going to kill civilians .
I live in a high - rise building .
There 's another tower building nearby , and this week , a rocket hit the roof .
The day before yesterday , one block from where I live , a rocket hit an apartment at the level of the 11th floor .
It killed a journalist who works for Palestine TV , his mother and his wife .
So they are targeting apartments and houses .
Five days ago , they targeted a three - floor home in another refugee camp .
The man , his wife and six children were killed on the spot .
He 's a teacher .
They 're wiping out entire families .
So the message is very clear for us .
It 's civilians that they 're after , because they can't find fighters .
If you remember two - and - a - half years ago in Lebanon , it was the same thing .
We talked about the analogy in our last phone call .
They started targeting civilians in Lebanon , and that led to the killing of 1,200 people .
But Lebanon is a large country .
Here , we are talking about the Gaza Strip , 360 square kilometers , with a population of 1.5 million , which makes it one of the most densely populated places on earth .
It 's a genocide .
That 's what is happening .
WE WANTED you to know that there are protests happening all the time here in the U.S. , with larger numbers of people coming out than ever before .
I know that you 've been organizing around a call for people internationally to take up the call for boycotts , divestment and sanctions -- BDS for short -- along the lines of the international campaign against apartheid South Africa .
Can you talk about that ?
I STRONGLY believe the United Nations , the European Union , the Arab League -- really , the international community at large -- have failed the Palestinian people .
I think the example of the United Nations Security Council resolution issued yesterday , that called for a durable and respected cease - fire , is a good example .
It treats the whole issue as if there are two sides -- as if you have two equal armies at war .
Israel has killed more than 830 people and injured more than 3,000 people so far .
Israel is a colonizing power .
It is based on deep - rooted racism , and it has reoccupied parts of the Gaza Strip .
And the Security Council acts as if there are two equal parties that have to declare a cease - fire .
That is why I strongly believe we can't count on the international community any longer .
I think the UN Security Council and the international community in general reflect the balance of power , and that balance of power is still in favor of the U.S. and Israel .
I can't separate the United States and American imperialism from Israel and Zionism .
And that 's why I see the war conducted against us now as part of the Bush Doctrine .
This is part of what Condoleezza Rice called " the birth pangs of a Middle East " out of what she called " creative destruction . "
I think that 's exactly what is happening right now .
That 's why I think we have to rely on civil society organizations .
You just mentioned the demonstrations that have been going on in America .
I just got a message from South Africa about another huge demonstration in one of the townships .
They told me about a demonstration yesterday in front of the Egyptian embassy in Pretoria , and four days ago , there was a demonstration in front of the Israeli consulate in Johannesburg .
Yesterday , there was a huge demonstration in Amman , Jordan .
Before that , there was a demonstration of 1 million protesters in Morocco , and 1 million protesters in Istanbul .
And Hugo Chávez kicked out the Israeli ambassador -- I think that 's a fantastic model .
I think we can call on civil society organizations for their words of support to be translated into action .
Because of the imbalance of power between Palestinians and Israel , we think that 's the only way .
Israel has the fourth - strongest army in the world .
It has the strongest army in the Middle East .
So Israel is the superpower of the region -- and second , it 's the strategic ally of the U.S. empire in the Middle East .
Therefore , the only way forward for us and for our struggle is international .
We need an international intervention -- and that international intervention can't come from official bodies .
This is exactly what happened after the Sharpeville Massacre in 1960 , when 69 Blacks were killed by the white racist regime of apartheid South Africa .
This massacre gave rise to the BDS campaign against apartheid South Africa , which ultimately led to the release of Nelson Mandela in 1990 and his election as the first Black president of multicultural , multiracial , secular , democratic South Africa as we know it now .
Gaza could be the spark that could initiate a different " new Middle East " than what Condoleezza Rice talked about in 2006 .
She meant a " new Middle East " characterized by American and Israeli hegemony .
What I 'm saying now is that I can see the birth pangs of a new Middle East characterized by the end of despotic , dictatorial pro-American regimes .
In order to reach that stage , we need to support the call that more than 177 civil society organizations of Palestine issued in 2005 asking people internationally to support them by boycotting , divesting and imposing sanctions on Israel .
I 'm saying to let Gaza 2009 be like Sharpeville of 1960 , which led to the end of apartheid .
Let Gaza 2009 be the beginning of a new , more democratic Middle East , with a secular , democratic state of Palestine that treats all its citizens equally , regardless of religion , race , sect , gender and so on .
That 's the only way .
The question is :
What more do people who love freedom need to see to translate their words of support into action ?
What more than the dead bodies of hundreds of Palestinian children ?
No child , whether Jewish , Hindu , Muslim or Christian , should see what Palestinian children are seeing right now .
I think this is an ethical responsibility of every single person who believes in freedom for all .
It is their responsibility to make sure that this never happens again .
It happened in the Second World War to the Jewish people .
It happened to Black Africans in South Africa , and we freedom - loving people said " Never Again . "
But we are allowing it , unfortunately .
This is why we say now that the boycott , divestment and sanctions campaign is the responsibility not only of civil society organizations , but of every single individual .
This is what we can do .
We can boycott Israeli goods and Israeli foods .
We can divest from Israel and demand sanctions .
And only then will Israel start to reconsider what it has done to the Palestinians of Gaza .
If your selected Lenovo ThinkPad is stolen , you will be able to disable it by sending it a text message .
Lenovo is working with Phoenix on a BIOS that will let you disable a ThinkPad notebook PC by sending it an SMS text message .
The feature should be available early next year , reports TG Daily .
The story says :
The lockdown will happen immediately if a notebook is turned on or , when it is turned off , the next time the system signs on to a cellular network .
To reactivate the disabled PC , a user needs to enter a pre-set passcode created during notebook startup .
Since not many people have notebooks with built in Sims , it would be more useful if you could disable a notebook over the internet .
Maybe you can … .
It would also be more useful if every notebook PC had this sort of feature , as it would tend to discourage notebook theft .
However , bear in mind that it does n't protect your data , because someone can always remove the hard drive and read it with a different PC -- unless the data is encrypted .
The article also does n't say whether the SMS simply triggers a BIOS password .
There are ways around those ....
DAKAR , Senegal  Government security forces were implicated in the deaths of at least 90 of the hundreds of people killed in religious violence in the central Nigerian city of Jos last month , Human Rights Watch said Saturday .
At least 400 people died when fighting broke out between Muslim and Christian gangs in the city on Nov. 28 and 29 after a dispute about local elections .
Each side accused the other of rigging the vote .
Muslims and Christians mingle uneasily in the so - called middle belt region of Nigeria , and tension frequently flares along religious , ethnic and political fault lines .
Initial accounts of the killing in Jos indicated that the gangs had set upon each other ’s neighborhoods , burning churches , homes , businesses and mosques .

OpenCity - 0.0.6.2 is known to run smoothly under Windows 7 Ultimate 64 Bit. Concerning the Sharp Plus Framework , we integrated only a tiny part of it in the OpenCity source so far because the framework does n't have enough useful features yet .
But we 've achieved a milestone in the development of the framework : it now offers a bare unit testing framework for future development .
See old news ...
What is OpenCity ?
Once upon the time , I was travelling over the Internet , and I found a city simulator under linux called FreeReign at SourceForge .
But it is n't maintained any more .
I decided to push the game up so I had a look at the FreeReign sources .
However , its codes were not obvious to me , and in addition the game design did n't fit my programming style .
Finally , I decided to write my own free 3D city simulator , based on the original ideas of the FreeReign project .
Few months later , OpenCity was born .
OpenCity is a full 3D city simulator game project .
It is written in standard C++ with OpenGL and SDL from scratch .
It is not intended to be a clone of any famous city simulator from Max*s .
So , if you are looking to download a free SimCity 4 like , please forget OpenCity .
I work on it at my spare time , and I really meant it " my spare time " !
OpenCity is also an OpenGL / SDL / C++ game programming tutorial .
In the resources section , you can find the micro simulators ' algorithm , design document , UML diagram and information about other issues .
The UML diagram is edited with Umbrello , the free UML diagram editor for KDE .
Project 's status
The 0.0.6 stable is now availabe for download .
If you desire the latest snapshot , try to check out from the SVN .
However , all of works from the development source tree are not for end users , so do not try them if you are looking for a full working program or just interested in playing games .
Please keep in mind that I do n't have time to support source codes compiling issues .
If you are not a programmer , do not try to compile the development codes because they are evils .
Even if you are a brave guy , and you are not afraid of evils , please read the warning here before doing something wrong .
At the meaning time , you can build roads , electric lines , electric plant , trees and the three standard RCI zones .
Many other features will be implemented in the future .
Be patient ;)
Our goal is reusing few SimCity 2000 concepts even if SimCity is an old game concept .
But we love that old city simulation game concept .
Can I participate to this project ?
Yes , of course .
Have a look at the project Source Forge summary page .
Put your bug report , feature or support request there or in the f@rum .
You can also reach the main contact by mail .
If you are a programmer , you can also help us by compiling and testing the lastest SVN version from time to time .
And last but not least , thank you guys who send me a feedback about this project ;)
By the way , if you like those sophisticated features from SimCity 5++ , or the way SimCity Societies works , please do not ask us to implement them in OpenCity .
Please order that game from your favorite online store .

I 've been at this blog for nearly 3 years now and have never asked for something like this — I hope I 've earned enough trust to be able to ask something back from you .
Above is a picture of Daniela and her family .
Brandon , age 6 , Daniela , age 9 and little Evelyn age 4 .
Daniela is divorcing her spouse after years of abuse .
In recent years her mortgage went unpaid and she 's lost her house .
As of this moment , Daniela 's family is staying at our house and we are trying to help her find a one bedroom apartment for her family to live in .
With Evelyn , her youngest having Down 's Syndrome and Daniela herself being a Romanian immigrant with very little family support she literally has no one to turn to .
Except us ( all of us ) .
Daniela cleans houses when she can leave her family .
I 'm not even going to tell you what she gets paid — it 's obscene .
Right now her options are pretty limited , aside from an apartment , there is only a group shelter .
Not very pretty .
Here 's what we are asking .
Right now , Belinda and I are opening our home , but it 's tight as we have no basement .
We 've committed to giving as much as we can spare , diverting funds from other places .
I 'm asking if you could think about doing the same .
Or at the very least , helping get the word out about this .
We are looking to raise 5 k for Daniela and her family .
Enough so that she does n't have to worry about a deposit or rent for a while .
I know this is the worst possible time to ask for anything .
But would you consider the following :
1. Giving whatever you can ( " Chip in " uses Pay Pal and it's very easy to donate and it's secure )
2. Spread the word .
Please , please blog this , tweet this , re-tweet this .
3 . Help find a donor ( maybe a generous company or individual )
I do n't have anything to offer back .
Not an ego list or top donators directory .
I can only hope that this thing we call " community " puts its money or heart where its mouth is .
Please do whatever you can .
Respectfully , David and family
PS , if you do n't feel comfortable using Pay Pal , please e-mail us here and we 'll figure it out .
And thank you .
As you ’ve seen , I ’ve become increasingly interested in this question of whether or not the president can withdraw a pardon , as President Bush has attempted to do in the case of Isaac Toussie .
I ’ve consulted a few experts and reviewed various cases .
And I ’m increasingly convinced that the president did not have the power to do this , notwithstanding the fact that few press reports seem to have taken this possibility very seriously .
Let ’s break this down piece by piece .
No one disagrees that a presidential pardon cannot be revoked or taken back .
The only question here is whether the Toussie pardon had in some sense not yet become official .
And there are two arguments floating around about why this pardon was n’t set in stone yet before the president decided to take it back .
First is the argument put forward by the White House itself , that the president had sent requests for pardons to the Pardon Attorney but that the Pardon Attorney had yet to “ execute and deliver grants of clemency to the named individuals . ”
According to the White House press release from Wednesday , the president got to him before he ’d done that and “ directed the Pardon Attorney not to execute and deliver a Grant of Clemency to Mr. Toussie . ”
But from what I can tell , the Pardon Attorney does n’t ‘ execute ’ anything .
The current system of having the Pardon Attorney create certificates of pardon only goes back to the Eisenhower administration , and was then apparently only done to relieve the president of the chore of signing so many pardons and commutations .
I spoke to former Pardon Attorney Margaret Colgate Love ( 1990 - 1997 ) who told me that “ receiving the president ’s warrant and sending notifications to the petitioners is purely ‘ a ministerial act of notification . ' ”
In layman ’s terms , at this end of the transaction , the Pardon Attorney ’s role is really just a matter of paperwork .
“ When we received the Master Warrant from the president , ” said Love , “ what our job was was to notify them , by telephone , and eventually by written notification .
The document evidenced the president ’s action .
We never assumed that that document had any necessary legal significance . ”
So just as a factual matter , the idea that the Pardon Attorney needs to ‘ execute ’ the pardons seems to be bogus .
End of story .
The second argument has to do with notification .
The idea here is that even though the president is the actor , his pardon only takes effect when the petitioner is notified .
This reasoning depends on the Du Puy case from 1869 , in which the Court ruled that President Grant could take back two pardons earlier issued by President Johnson because the petitioners had not yet been notified of their pardons .
But the Du Puy case comes from a technological universe in which the US Marshal ’s notification would have been the first the petitioner heard about it .
But clearly that ’s not the case anymore .
There ’s little doubt that Toussie heard about his pardon in the news prior to the president ’s decision to rescind it .
More to the point , from talking to people familiar with the process , I understand that it is standard procedure for the petitioners or their counsel to be notified of their pardon either before or simultaneous with the public announcement .
So there ’s every reason to be believe that Toussie or his attorneys were specifically notified of his pardon , despite not getting the framable document that does not appear to have any legal significance .
Needless to say , I ’m not an attorney or a constitutional expert .
But I ’ve seen few if any press write - ups with quotes from people with relevant expertise who say the president is actually able to do this .
And my discussions with people with relevant expertise give me the strong impression that the president ’s action is highly dubious in constitutional terms , even if no Court case has specifically addressed this combination of facts .
In any case , I feel sure we wo n’t have to wonder forever .
If nothing else Toussie has a solid case to bring .
So I feel confident the Court will eventually decide if this passes muster .

With world eyes on Gaza , the horrific carnage on the ground , innocent civilians being slaughtered , Israel 's grievous crimes of war and against humanity , and its slow - motion genocide gaining speed , it 's easy to forget America 's war at home on Islam and its growing number of victims .
This article highlights five recent ones - innocent young Muslim men called the " Fort Dix Five . "
On December 22 , The New York Times headlined : " 5 Are Convicted of Conspiring to Attack Fort Dix " in reporting that a federal jury " convicted five men of conspiring to kill American soldiers at ( the base ) last year , but acquitted them of attempted murder . "
After an eight - week trial , jurors deliberated for six days before returning a verdict .
" The men , all Muslim immigrants ( from ) South Jersey or Philadelphia , face a maximum term of life in prison . "
Sentencing is scheduled for April 22 for three defendants and April 23 for the others .
Even
The New York Times admitted that the " five defendants seemed ( more like ) South Jersey than seething jihadists " - based on their backgrounds , employment , normal activities , and trial evidence showing nothing out of the ordinary .
It 's the latest example of post - 9/11 witch - hunt justice against innocent Muslim victims - targeted for their faith , ethnicity , activism , prominence , benevolent charity , or whatever other motives the administration concocts for political advantage .
As a result , growing numbers fill federal prisons for being Muslim at the wrong time in America .
The " war on terror " is a jihad against them .
Muslims everywhere are at risk .
So are we all , and that wo n't change under Obama .
Charges Against the " Fort Dix Five "
On May 7 , 2007 , the FBI arrested the five on charges of plotting to kill US soldiers at Fort Dix , New Jersey .
A June 5 DOJ press release stated :
" The five defendants are charged with conspiracy and other charges related to their plans to kill as many soldiers at the Army base as possible .
A sixth man was indicted for aiding and abetting the illegal possession of firearms by three members of the group . "
The original Complaint was unsealed on May 8 .
" One count against two of the defendants charges them with unlawful possession of machine guns - the AK - 47s and M - 16s they purchased and took possession of just before they were arrested by Special Agents of the FBI . "
Prosecutors called the men " radical Islamists , " and according to US Attorney Christopher J. Christie , " We intend to continue a vigorous prosecution of these defendants .
Anyone who would plan such an attack should expect no less . "
The six and charges against them are as follows :
Mohamad Ibrahim Shnewer ( an ethnic Jordanian ) on " conspiracy to murder members of the uniformed services ( maximum statutory penalty of up to life in federal prison ) ; "
Dritan Duka ( an ethnic Albanian like his two brothers below ) on " conspiracy to murder members of the uniformed services ; unlawful possession of machine guns ( maximum statutory penalty of 10 years in prison ) , two counts of being an illegal alien in possession of firearms ( maximum statutory penalty of 10 years in prison ) ; "
-- Shain Duka on " conspiracy to murder members of the uniformed services ; unlawful possession of machine guns , two counts of being an illegal alien in possession of firearms ; "
Eljvir Duka on " conspiracy to murder members of the uniformed services , one count of being an illegal alien in possession of firearms ; "
Serdar Tatar ( an ethnic Turk ) on " conspiracy to murder members of the uniformed services ; " and
Agron Abdullahu ( an ethnic Kosovar ) on " aiding and abetting the Duka brothers ' illegal possession of weapons ( maximum statutory penalty of 10 years in prison ) . "
Abdullahu confessed and was sentenced to 20 months in prison for supplying the guns and ammunition in question .
He 'd already served 11 months and was released in October , according to his lawyer , Richard Coughlin .
The weapons transaction was " at a residence in Cherry Hill , " New Jersey .
" After the purchase from a cooperating witness , " arrests were made .
In October 2007 , Abdullahu pled guilty to weapons possession .
A superceding January 15 , 2008 indictment charged the other five men with the attempted murder of military personnel and weapons possession .
According to US Attorney Christie at the time , " there is abundant evidence that the defendants fully subscribed to al Qaeda 's jihadist ideology ( and ) were ready for martyrdom .
We had a group that was forming a platoon to take on an army .
They identified their target , they did their reconnaissance .
They had maps .
And they were in the process of buying weapons .
This is a new brand of ( homegrown ) terrorism where a small cell of people can bring enormous devastation .... They wanted to be jihadists . "
The DOJ , Dominant Media , and Islamophobes Respond to the Convictions
A December 22 DOJ press release stated : " Five Radical Islamists ( were ) Convicted of Conspiring to Kill Soldiers at Fort Dix .... announced Patrick Rowan , Assistant Attorney General for National Security , and Acting US Attorney Ralph J. Marra , Jr.... These men planned , trained and ceaselessly talked unambiguously about their intention to ambush and kill US soldiers . "
Other " would - be terrorists of the homegrown variety ( be alerted that we 'll spend millions of taxpayer dollars to ) find you , infiltrate your group , prosecute you and send you to federal prison for a very long time " - whether or not you 're guilty .
The Washington Post highlighted the conviction of " five foreign - born Muslim men conspiring to kill US soldiers at Fort Dix and other military installations ( never mentioned in the indictment ) as part of what prosecutors charged was a plot to launch an Islamic " holy war " against the United States .
Writer William Branigin emphasized their " plot " to use " automatic weapons ( and ) rocket - propelled grenades ( also not mentioned ) to kill as many US soldiers as possible .
Other comments included saying the " plot " began in January 2006 , Osama bin Laden 's " terrorist network " inspired it , the " cell " viewed " terrorist training videos glorifying the Sept. 11 , 2001 attacks and depicting the beheading of American military personnel ... "
When arrested in May 2007 , " they were in the final stages of preparations .... in addition to targeting Fort Dix , the cell discussed attacking other military installations , including Fort Monmouth , Lakehurst Naval Air Station , McGuire Air Force Base in New Jersey , the US Coast Guard building in Philadelphia , and Dover Air Force Base in Delaware .
Another potential target was the annual Army - Navy football game in Philadelphia .... "
Branigin never questioned the legitimacy of clearly bogus charges on their face - that five young men with hand weapons ( automatic or otherwise ) would declare war on the US Army at any or perhaps all of the above locations .
Instead he accepted the official explanation and reported it like in a straight press handout .
David Horowitz is a right wing ideologue , an opponent of the progressive left , and a prominent anti-Muslim hatemonger " spread ( ing ) fear , bigotry and misinformation , " about Islam according to the media watchdog group Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting ( FAIR ) .
It calls him " the Islamophobia movement 's premier promoter ....( as editor ) via his website , FrontPage Magazine " and activities like his October 22 - 26 , 2007 " Islamo - Fascism Awareness Week " that held " protests , teach -ins and sit-ins on more than 100 college campuses ( to highlight ) the threat posed by the Islamic crusade against the West . "
On December 23 , Front Page writer and Jihad Watch director Robert Spencer wrote about the Fort Dix Five , referred to the men as " jihad plotters , " and said " They wanted to burst into Fort Dix and murder as many American soldiers as they could .... "
He commented on how Muslim community leaders " hurl ( ed ) reckless charges of entrapment ( and should instead take ) hard steps necessary to clean their own house . "
" While Muslim and non-Muslim spokesmen have spilled oceans of ink since 9/11 asserting that Islam condemns ' terrorism ' and the killing of ' innocents , ' without defining what is meant by either term , no one has ever produced any examples of authoritative and orthodox Islamic religious scholars rejecting , on Islamic grounds , jihad violence against non-Muslims . "
It 's about time they " institute ( d ) comprehensive and inspectable programs teaching against the jihad ideology and Islamic supremacism . "
On December 23 , Spencer 's Jihad Watch ( with no byline ) mocked the kangaroo justice victims in its headline : " Muslims on Fort Dix jihadists - They wuz framed ....
It was all a joke .... Oh Shnewer ( one of the five about his explanation ) , you kidder !
It then added various demeaning comments to clearly show disrespect for Islam .
Pat Robertson preaches hate and intolerance and his CBNnews.com leaves no doubt where it stands in a December 22 article by its " Terrorism Analyst , " Erick Stakelbeck - titled " Fort Dix Jihadis Convicted . "
He called the convictions " A nice ' stockade stuffer ' for the US government , just in time for the holidays , " then added Islamophobic comments like this :
" .... it does n't take a brain surgeon to walk into a shopping mall , yell ' Allahu Akhbar , ' and start firing a rifle at shoppers .
Granted , it obviously helps to have a larger force behind you ( for funding , guidance and training ) if you are scheming to carry out an attack like the one planned on Fort Dix .
But deadly intent , a gun and some explosives can get a motivated , committed jihadist a long way as well . "
Obviously for Stakelbeck , they 're guilty , case closed .
The Anti-Defamation League ( ADL ) was founded " to stop the defamation of the Jewish people and to secure justice and fair treatment to all .
( It ) fights anti-Semitism and all forms of bigotry , defends democratic ideals and protects civil rights for all " - or so it says .
How does it act under its national director , Abraham Foxman .
Using anti-Semitism and a high moral agenda for cover , Waxman backs racial discrimination and nationalism .
While preaching universal equality , he 's for Jewish supremacy , the right of Israeli Jews to dominate Arabs , and to maintain a separate and unequal society .
On December 23 , ADL " applauded the verdict convicting five would - be terrorists who conspired to kill American soldiers at New Jersey 's Fort Dix last summer . "
ADL 's national chair , Glen Lewy and Foxman issued this statement :
" The successful prosecution of the five terrorists for conspiring to kill American soldiers .... is a testament to the dedication and hard work of teams of FBI investigators and Justice Department prosecutors who devoted enormous time , energy and passion to making our nation safer ....
In this case , justice has been served and our national security protected . "
Imagine their comments if five Israeli Jews had been convicted on the same charges instead of Muslims .
No Plot , No Crime , So the FBI Invents Guilt with An Entrapment Sting Operation - Its Usual Modus Operandi to Ensnare the Innocent
At a Cherry Hill , NJ Circuit City store in January 2006 , Mohamad Shnewer innocently wanted a home video transfered to DVD .
It showed men shooting weapons at a Pocono Mountains firing range , playing paintball ( an innocent game in which opposing teams try to eliminate opponents by marking them with water - soluble dye shot in capsules from air guns ) , and repeating Arabic phrases like Allah Akbar ( meaning God is Greatest ) .
The store clerk called the police .
They notified the FBI .
They began investigating and recruited two dubious informants to help .
Each knew nothing about the other .
One was Besnik Bakalli , an ethnic Albanian , who falsely told defendants he was a Kosovo Liberation Army ( KLA ) veteran - the US / Germany supported terrorist group recruited to destabilize Kosovo / Serbia in the 1990s .
At trial , however , he testified that he fought for no group and knew nothing about Islam or extremists calling for jihad .
Mahmoud Omar was the other informant , an Egyptian - born used car salesman / mechanic on probation for bank fraud .
He and Bakalli entered the US illegally and faced likely deportation or worse .
They were easily recruited , so cooperated , and were well compensated for their efforts - thousands of dollars a month , and according to defense lawyers , Omar ( from when recruited in March 2006 ) will have earned $ 238,000 for his efforts .
NewJersey.com believes more - over $ 240,000 plus rent and other expenses , and , of course , leniency in handling their charges .
Bakalli was used for a shorter period and reportedly was paid about $ 150,000 .
The FBI also relocated his parents to America as an added incentive to cooperate .
Its sting was to have both men befriend the defendants , wear a wire , egg them on with tough talk about their commitment to Islam , elicit negative views about the US military and war in Iraq and Afghanistan , incite a need for holy war in response , and suggest how to get weapons to " do something . "
Hundreds of conversations were recorded and selectively played back at the eight week trial .
In addition , Shnewer 's house and car were bugged and rigged with hidden cameras for additional videotape accounts .
One conversation with defendant Tatar has Omar saying : " I want this country to pay the price for something they did to me " and then asked Tatar for help to get information about Fort Dix .
He had no idea what he meant , yet Omar persisted and wanted Tatar to get him a map of Fort Dix .
At one point , Tatar called the Philadelphia police about being pressured and voiced concern about something terror related .
Omar also organized so - called Fort Dix " reconnaissance missions " around the base 's perimeter .
In addition , he got two of the Duka brothers to buy firearms but not to commit terrorism or attack the Army base .
At that point , they were arrested in Omar 's apartment while buying inoperable rifles the FBI supplied for the sting .
What 's clear from trial evidence is that no plot existed , no conspiracy , no intended crime , explicit rejections of violence , and without informant provocation no planned weapons purchase for any purpose .
All five are innocent , unfairly targeted , entrapped , prosecuted , convicted , and the latest administration " war on terror " trophies from its scheme to incite fear .
The only trial evidence was their freely expressed hostile views about America 's wars against Iraq and Afghanistan , sympathies for Islamic causes , and anger over how immigrants are treated in the US .
None of this is illegal or incriminating , yet the defendants were convicted and face long incarcerations after sentencing , possibly for life .
Attorney Sam Schmidt represented one of the defendants accused in the 1998 US African embassy bombings .
He explained how " The government ( goes to extraordinary means ) to find people ( with ) an antipathy to US policies ( in the Middle East ) and see which ones can get motivated , or angry enough ( to be entrapped by the entreaties of an informant ) .
Many of these cases appear to be the informant who is either working off a case to avoid going to jail or be deported or is seeking remuneration .... "
They 're used to entrap defendants , get them angry , and create the impression that they 're willing to commit terrorism .
To prove conspiracy , the government need only show that defendants appeared willing to commit a crime and did one thing ( usually quite innocent ) to use against them and convince a jury .
No crime need be committed nor any detailed plans for one .
In the Fort Dix case , prosecutors did n't have to prove a planned attack - only that defendants appeared willing or approved of US soldiers being attacked somewhere at some time .
With informants taping hundreds of conversations and training them to egg on targets , prosecutors can selectively use comments to make their case and intimidate juries to convict .
In closing arguments , Shnewer 's lawyer , Rocco Cipparone , said : " Omar led and led and pushed and pushed Mohamad as far as he could .
But at the end of the day , all Mohamad did was talk and talk and talk .
His actions - and inactions - speak more volumes than his words . "
Transcripts also revealed that conversations included a mixture of English , Arabic , and Albanian , were filled with miscommunications , bravado , ambiguity and at times nonsense .
At some points , the defendants seemed too scared to do anything .
Clearly their intentions were non-violent .
For example , when they were supposedly shopping for weapons , one defendant worried that if someone is caught with a machine gun , he 'll " be in deep s..t . "
And if anyone gets killed , " As Muslims , if we get caught , we all get sent away to f... ing Guantanamo Bay for 10 years with no court date .... they can come to you in the f...ing morning when you are sleeping .
And they do n't f...ing play . "
Despite their convictions , the government 's indictment was vague on any intention to commit terrorism or that defendants ' comments meant they planned it .
The informants did the pushing while they just talked and nothing else .
However , under US conspiracy law , if prosecutors can convince juries that defendants words implied actions they can get convictions .
According to former federal prosecutor and now executive director of the Center on the Administration of Criminal Law at New York University School of Law , Anthony Barkow : " A person is entrapped when he has no previous intention to violate the law and is persuaded to commit the crime by government agents .
But if he 's already willing to commit the crime ( not applicable to the defendants ) , it 's not entrapment if government agents convince him to do it . "
Roger Williams University law professor Peter Margulies explains further that : " A virtue of American conspiracy law is it allows you to show conspiracy with relatively thin evidence .
In Britain recently , they could n't convict people in an airport bombing plot because they had to show that action was imminent .
American law is more expansive than most other democracies in that respect . "
Supreme Court Justice Robert Jackson was the chief US prosecutor at the Nuremberg Nazi war criminal trials .
In a subsequent 1949 case , he expressed concern that US conspiracy law " constitutes a serious threat to fairness in our administration of justice . "
It lets prosecutors " target the people it does n't like , " according to Margulies , do it as deviously as they wish , and unjustly convict the innocent .
That 's Jim Sues ' view , executive director of the New Jersey Chapter of Council on American - Islamic Relations , on the Fort Dix Five case .
" Many people in the Muslim community see this as ( another ) case of entrapment .
The evidence showed no real honest - to - God planning for an attack on Fort Dix ( or anywhere else ) .
The defendants were never ( even ) all in a room at one time with a map of the ( base ) , plotting what they were going to do . "
They had no violent plans whatever .
Nor did other unjustly convicted Muslim victims - persecuted to incite fear and justify America 's foreign aggression against Iraq , Afghanistan and all Islam .
Since 9/11 , around 150 defendants were convicted through 2007 and many more this year .
It should n't surprise that perhaps all were innocent , unfairly targeted , unjustly convicted and sentenced to long punitive incarcerations in federal prisons .
In some cases , ( for the so - called " worst of the worst " ) to harsh confinement in Supermax ones that crush the human spirit , mind and body through isolation , cruelty , and physical abuse for years or even life .
It 's the wrong time to be Muslim in America .
Expect little change under the new administration .
Foreign wars will continue .
So will the " war on terror . "
Innocent Muslims will be targeted .
Others as well , so today we 're all as vulnerable as the " Fort Dix Five . "

To change the value of an atom , you can use swap ! .
A lower - level compare - and - set ! is also provided .
Changes to atoms are always free of race conditions .
As with all reference types , the intended use of atom is to hold one of Clojure ’s immutable data structures .
And , similar to ref ’s alter and agent ’s send , you change the value by applying a function to the old value .
This is done in an atomic manner by swap !
Internally , swap !
reads the current value , applies the function to it , and attempts to compare - and - set ! it in .
Since another thread may have changed the value in the intervening time , it may have to retry , and does so in a spin loop .
The net effect is that the value will always be the result of the application of the supplied function to a current value , atomically .
However , because the function might be called multiple times , it must be free of side effects .
Question : Emily ( 15 - 17 ) asks about masturbation :
This sounds really BAD but I found one of my mom ’s vibrators , and tried it out , ( it felt really good ) is this wrong ?
am i too young ?
Answer :
If you ’ve read the “ Guys Page ” on masturbation , you ’ll realize that it ’s not necessarily “ bad ” or “ wrong ” to masturbate .
If it ’s not an obsession ( that is , you do n’t do it constantly ) , then it ’s basically harmless as long as you feel okay about it in your head .
It ’s not something to feel guilty about , although some people are .
Many girls your age have experimented with it , and some even together .
Now , about using your mom ’s vibrator , I do n’t think it ’s a great idea .
I know it ’s your mom and everything , but it ’s still possible to spread disease that way .
And besides , what would your mom say to you if she found out ?
Question : … and so does Sally ( 12 - 14 ) :
When I was watching t.v. a few nights ago I realized I get a nude channel .
So I was watching thinking this is sooo funny .
Well I got really horny and I started masturbating .
This is the first time I ’ve ever tried to masturbate .
It was o.k. but I did n’t feel comfortable .
Is this o.k. and normal ?
Answer :
As I wrote above , it ’s “ okay ” if you ’re comfortable with it .
It ’s not something you would do if you ’re uncomfortable .
I also do not recommend someone your age watching adult television .
Question : .. and so does Hanna ( 12 - 14 ) :
I heard my sisters talking about a vibrator .
I am wondering if I am too young to use one .
Answer : I think so …
It ’s considered an “ adult toy ” that you wo n’t typically find at K - Mart .
It ’s also possible that you may hurt yourself with it as they ’re rather large and sometimes can scratch .
You may want to experiment with other , softer objects if you choose to .
Question : A concerned father asks :
My 8 year old daughter has started masturbating since we got her to stop sucking her thumb .
She seems to be doing it many times a day .
She even will spend long periods of time in our swimming pool against the return where the water jets out .
Do you have any advice ?
Answer :
My first piece of advice is not to call attention to it .
If she discovers that “ it ’s bad ” to masturbate , that she surely will continue just to spite you !
Also , it may cause some mental conflicts in her teen and adult years , or cause her to be confused or especially guilty over it .
As you probably know , masturbation should be a private , guilt - free activity done in moderation for those who chose to masturbate .
What you want to do when you see your daughter masturbating , is to draw her attention elsewhere .
If she ’s in the pool hanging out by the returns , go over to her “ excitedly ” with a ball and encourage her to play catch with you .
Do n’t bring up what she ’s doing , and do n’t say “ do n’t do that ” — just distract her with something more appropriate .
This will especially be important if you have company over , or if you ’re in public .
Just do n’t make her feel guilty about it for “ being bad ” .

Chemical Engineers Build World 's Smallest Fuel Cell
January 23rd , 2009 by Ariel Schwartz
US chemical engineers have built the world ’s smallest fuel cell , clocking in at only 9 cubic millimeters .
While the hydrogen - fueled cell is currently a prototype , it could one day replace batteries in portable electronics .
Engineers at the University of Illinois at Urbana - Champaign created the cell using 4 components : a water reservoir , a chamber containing metal - hydride , a thin membrane separating the two , and an assembly of electrodes .
The device ’s water flow is conducted by surface tension — so it will work even if moved and rotated .
Small holes in the membrane let the water molecules reach the chamber as vapor .
The vapor then reacts with the metal hydride to form hydrogen , which fills the chamber , pushes the membrane up , and blocks the flow of water .
As the hydrogen is depleted , more water enters the chamber to keep the reaction going .
The bite - sized cell currently generates 0.7 volts and a current of 0.1 milliamps for 30 hours before fuel runs out .
That ’s only enough power for microrobots and simple electronic systems , but future versions may be able to power cell phones .

Perhaps it was only to have been expected that Robin van Persie would make himself so at home on Arsenal 's first visit to Hull for a league match since the 1914 - 15 season , when there was a more serious conflict raging on the European front than the Second Division fixture between the Tigers and the Gunners at Anlaby Road .
Kingston upon
Hull happens to be twinned with Rotterdam , Van Persie 's home town .
The son of an artist and a sculptor , the 25 - year - old Dutchman was in masterful form , producing the creative brush strokes on the canvas of an Arsenal victory that was achieved with an irresistible late flourish .
Arsène Wenger 's latest team may well be an Henry , a Vieira and another genius or four short of the champion class Gunners of old ( and without the wounded Cesc Fabregas in recent weeks ) but in Van Persie they have a Netherlander who is proving to be as outstanding an attacking orchestrator as the brilliant Dennis Bergkamp .
As it happened , Dennis was on Arsenal TV just last week , talking about how his touch and intuition in the pivotal withdrawn attacking position made him such a menace to Premier League defences and a sheer delight to the faithful of Highbury .
At the KC Stadium on Saturday evening , Van Persie conducted a masterclass in the same role , prompting all three Arsenal goals and rattling the Hull crossbar for good measure .

It took the deftest of finger - tip saves to keep the former Feyenoord man off the score - sheet , Boaz Myhill brushing Van Persie 's curling 25 - yard free - kick on to the frame of his goal in the 28th minute .
Hull 's California - born keeper could do nothing though to keep out a header from Emmanuel Adebayor two minutes later – thanks to a right - wing corner executed with supreme precision by Arsenal 's No 11 .
In fairness , Wenger 's introduction of Nicklas Bendtner with 20 minutes remaining was also vital as the Gunners rode the blow of Daniel Cousin 's 65th - minute equaliser , a stooping header from six yards , and finished off a tigerish Hull side with an old one - two .
The Dane 's pace and movement restored attacking momentum just when Arsenal needed it , stretching the home guard and sparking Van Persie 's fuse .
It was from a Bendtner pass that Van Persie fashioned the goal that regained the lead eight minutes from time , twisting free on the edge of the area and playing a killer pass out left for Samir Nasri to beat Myhill with an angled finish .
Four minutes later Van Persie teed up Bendtner for Arsenal 's third with a delightful return pass , albeit from a marginally offside position .
All of which has left Arsenal three points behind Aston Villa in fifth place in the table and unbeaten in eight Premier League games now – and Hull pointless for a fifth game and in serious danger of being dragged into the relegation dogfight .
" He was outstanding , " Wenger said afterwards when asked about the Dutch man of the match – at £ 2.75 m , an absolute steal from Feyenoord five years ago .
Goals : Adebayor ( 30 ) 0 - 1 ; Cousin ( 65 ) 1 - 1 ; Nasri ( 82 ) 1 - 2 ; Bendtner ( 86 ) 1 - 3 .

" We grow tired of anything that is repeated too often – an anecdote , a joke , a mannerism – and the same seems to happen with some language , " he said .
KOKOMO , Ind . --
Last month , in this once - sturdy auto town of 60,000 , two white women sounded off at a union hall when talk turned to politics .
" I feel like a white female or a white male has fewer opportunities than the black man or the black woman because of all the special treatment and special programs they have gotten , " said Marla Hightower .
" If Obama is elected , what 's going to happen ? "
" That is just stupid , " Ginny McMillin , the head of her local , shot back .
" People are saying ' we do n't want a black man . '
Shame on America for thinking that ! "
The exchange was emblematic of the sharp divide among white , working - class female voters -- a key voting bloc that has largely rejected Barack Obama as a presidential candidate .
But four weeks and a $ 700 billion financial - bailout package later , some attitudes are shifting .
Sen .
Obama is now picking up support from some of the very women who until recently disdained him .
As U.S. economic concerns intensify , ranks of blue - collar females are reconsidering everything from Sen .
Obama 's policies to their comfort level with his race .
Working - class women , generally defined as those in blue - collar and service jobs earning less than $ 50,000 a year -- comprise almost a quarter of American voters .
Sen. Obama trailed Sen. John McCain by 12 points among these women just two weeks ago , but has since closed the gap .
According to a Wall Street Journal poll conducted the weekend of Oct. 4 , the two senators are now running even , with 45 % of such voters giving each candidate the nod .
The reversal is one of the main reasons Sen .
Obama is gaining ground in swing states like Michigan , Ohio , Pennsylvania , North Carolina and Indiana -- all of which have large rural and blue - collar populations .
After President Obama denounced Wall Street bonuses as " shameful " on Thursday , the way was clear for the rest of the political class to pour gasoline on the bonfire being prepared for the offending bankers .
Senator Chris Dodd , former " friend " of mortgage banker Angelo Mozilo , ranted that the Treasury should somehow confiscate the bonuses .
Senator Claire McCaskill rolled out legislation to put a compensation cap of $ 400,000 on executives whose firms receive bailout money .
She also proposes creating a court to restrain their ...
Franken up by 4 votes after hand count , campaign says Nick Juliano
Published : Friday December 5 , 2008
Print This Email This Al Franken 's campaign says the Democratic senate challenger is up by four votes after completion of a hand recount in Minnesota .
All precincts in the state had completed their recount except for one Minneapolis polling place where 133 ballots have gone missing since Election Day .
Franken campaign attorney Marc Elias said he was optimistic that the ballots would be found .
The ballots are believed to have been in an envelope marked " 1/5 " on Election Night , and local officials are searching for that envelope .
Elections officials turned up four other envelopes -- marked 2/5 , 3/5 , 4/5 , and 5/5 -- and 133 more people signed in on Election Day than there were ballots during the recount .
The hand recount in that precinct is still technically ongoing while the search for those ballots continues .
Elias scoffed at claims from Republican incumbent Norm Coleman 's campaign that the ballots might not be missing at all .
" I 'm pretty sure there 's no one here now who genuinely believes these ballots are not missing , " he said during a press briefing Friday afternoon .
The four - vote margin Elias claims Franken is ahead by assumes the ballots will eventually be found in the Democratic precinct .
With the hand - count of ballots complete ( aside from those 133 ) , state election officials will move on to considering some 6,000 - plus challenged ballots .
Elias predicted Franken would pick up votes once a canvassing decides on the challenges , beginning Dec. 15 .
But the campaign 's margin assumes none of the challenges by either candidate will be upheld .
Other estimates continue to show Coleman in the lead .
Talking Points Memo reported Friday that the Secretary of State 's office could restore the missing votes even if the envelope is never found by reverting the count in that precinct to the numbers recorded on Election Night , when the ballots were first counted .
Elias also said the campaign hopes to have up to 1,000 absentee ballots it believes were improperly rejected included in the final count .
A full Moon rises over the Cascade Mountains in this image taken in the US state of Washington in 2005 .
On 12 December , the full Moon will be just 356,567 km from Earth .
On average , it lies 384,400 km away ( Image copyright 2005 David Haworth )
The difference in the full Moon ’s size at its farthest ( apogee ) and closest ( perigee ) points from Earth is hard to distinguish by eye , but it is noticeable in these side - by - side images taken in 2004 ( Image : Anthony Ayiomamitis )
The full Moon will loom larger in the sky on Friday than it has since 1993 , as it will be nearly as close as it ever comes to Earth in its orbit .
The Moon does not orbit Earth in a perfect circle .
Instead , it follows an elliptical path that brings it 50,000 kilometres closer to our planet on one side of its orbit ( called perigee ) than the other ( apogee ) .

On 12 December , the Moon will enter its full phase , when its disc appears completely illuminated by the Sun , just four hours after reaching its closest point to Earth .
This will make it 14 % bigger and 30 % brighter than other full Moons in 2008 , though the difference will be hard to distinguish by eye ( see the difference in the full Moon ’s size in 2004 ) .
It will be eight years before the Moon appears so big again .
“ This evening ’s Moon is not only the largest for 2008 but also during the period 1993 - 2016 , ” says Anthony Ayiomamitis , who lives in Greece .
For observers in the northern hemisphere , tonight ’s full Moon will also appear higher in the sky than any other this year .
Around midnight , it will shine down from nearly overhead .
WSRT observations reveal a radio jet ( white contours ) emanating from the centre of the nearby galaxy IC 2497 , headed straight in the direction of Hanny 's Voorwerp ( green ) .
The observations also reveal a huge reservoir of hydrogen gas ( colored orange ) that probably arose from a previous encounter between IC2497 and another galaxy .
The presence of strong neutral hydrogen absorption ( top right plot ) argues that the central regions of IC2497 are highly obscured .
An eerie green cloud lurking arounda nearby galaxy has puzzled scientists since it was discovered last year .
Newobservations reveal that the cloud 's ghoulish appearance may have to do withradiation streaming from a black hole inside the galaxy .
The cloud was first discovered byDutch schoolteacher Hanny van Arkel , who volunteered to sift throughastronomical data as part of the Galaxy Zoo project .
Van Arkel came across animage of a huge , irregular - shaped greenish - yellowish cloud near the spiralgalaxy IC2497 .
The unusual object became known as " Hanny 's Voorwerp , " Dutch for " Hanny 's thing . "
The cloud itself is devoid of stars , so astronomers were unsure what was generating the green glow .
Some suggestedthat radiation from amassive black hole in the center of the galaxy ( called a quasar ) could bethe culprit , but until now no such black hole radiation had been visible .
" People had looked with X - raytelescopes and had not detected any quasar or black hole activity , " saidresearcher Tom Oosterloo , an astronomer at the Netherlands Institute for RadioAstronomy .
" But our new observations , in very high resolution , show thatthere is some activity .
It 's not spectacularly strong , but there is an activeblack hole . "
Oosterloo and colleagues , led byMike Garrett of the Netherlands Institute for Radio Astronomy and including vanArkel , used the Westerbork Synthesis Radio Telescope in the Netherlands and an array in the European Very Long Baseline Interferometry Network toobserve Hanny 's Voorwerp and IC2497 .
The team found that a jet of highlyenergetic particles was indeed emanating from the galaxy , pointing directly atthe Voorwerp .
Because the jet was not directed toward Earth , it was difficultto detect .
The researchers think particles inthis jet clear a path through the dense gas and dust around the galaxy , allowing radiation from the black hole to pour into a gas cloud partiallyencircling the galaxy .
The optical and ultraviolet emission from the black holeexcites particles in the gas cloud , which is mostly made of hydrogen with someoxygen and other elements .
The heated - up gas emits the greenish light we see .
" In a way it 's a cosmicaccident , " Oosterloo told SPACE.com .
" This black hole activityhappens a lot , and many galaxies havethis cloud , but it happens very rarely that the black hole jet hits thecloud .
It 's not the only such object known , but it 's quite an interestingcase . "
The gas cloud around the spiralgalaxy likely came to be when a smaller galaxy flew by IC2497 .
The largergalaxy 's gravitation pull would have tugged off some of the other 's gas , keeping a blanket of material near it long after the smaller galaxy had movedaway .
Van Arkel said she was happy to havegained new understanding of her voorwerp .
" I 'm happy we are makingprogress , " she said .
" Apparently the more we learn about the Voorwerp , the more intriguing it becomes . "

CONAKRY , Dec 23 ( Reuters ) - Guinea announced on Tuesday the death of its long - serving president , Lansana Conte , and hours later a military officer made a broadcast on state radio saying the constitution and government were suspended .
In the radio broadcast , Captain Moussa David Camara said a self - styled National Council for Democracy was taking over .
The broadcast created confusion in the seaside capital Conakry after government leaders said earlier Conte had died following nearly a quarter century of rule over the West African state , the world 's leading exporter of bauxite aluminium ore .
Soldiers and police guarded the presidential palace and the central bank , witnesses said .
Journalists at state radio headquarters contacted by Reuters said a group of soldiers had entered the building and forced staff to broadcast the communique .
The statement read on the air by Capt .
Camara said the constitution was suspended and the government dissolved .
A transitional council of military and civilian members would be created in the coming days which would reflect " ethnic balance " .
The broadcast cited what it called widespread corruption , impunity and anarchy and a " catastrophic economic situation " to justify the dissolving of the government .
" The members of the current government are in large part responsible for this unprecedented economic and social crisis , " it said .
The death of Conte , a diabetic , chain - smoking general , left a potential power vacuum .
Guinea has experienced anti-government riots and strikes and bloody military mutinies in recent years , aggravated by rising prices of food and fuel .
Most of the population are poor , despite the nation 's huge mineral riches .
When government leaders gathered to announce Conte 's death on state television in the early hours , Armed Forces chief General Diarra Camara ordered troops to protect strategic locations and the borders of the former French colony .
National Assembly President Aboubacar Sompare , accompanied during the broadcast by Prime Minister Ahmed Tidiane Souare , Camara and other officials , said Conte had died on Monday night .
Conte was believed to be 74 .
Sompare asked the country 's Supreme Court to name him president in line with the constitution .
Article 34 of Guinea 's constitution foresees the national assembly president taking over in the event of the death of the head of state and organising presidential elections in 60 days .
Legislative elections were already planned for 2009 .
" I have the heavy and difficult task to inform you with great sadness of the death of General Lansana Conte , President of the Republic of Guinea , " Sompare said in the television broadcast .
ROLE OF MILITARY
As the television played Guinean music , Sompare declared 40 days of national mourning in the world 's number one exporter of bauxite , the ore from which aluminium is made .
Although rumours that Conte was seriously ill had circulated in the dilapidated seaside capital Conakry for days , the government chose the early hours , when most people were sleeping , to announce his death .
The streets were calm .
Conte , who said he was born around 1934 , had governed Guinea since 1984 when he seized power after the country 's first president , Sekou Toure , died in a U.S. hospital .
But he never groomed a clear successor .
" I arrived as a soldier , and I will finish as a soldier ...
God gives and takes life -- end of story , " Conte once said .
Analysts said the way in which the military , a key pillar of support for Conte 's rule , reacted to the news of his death would be crucial to the future stability of the country , where major international mining companies have operations .
" The military obeyed Conte ... and now he 's not there , " one veteran local journalist told Reuters on condition of anonymity .
The armed forces are known to be split by generational and ethnic divisions .
Conte , who became reclusive in his later years of rule , had suffered health problems for years , including sometimes collapsing in public .
He often travelled abroad for medical treatment in Morocco , Cuba and Switzerland .
Veteran opposition leader Jean Marie Dore of the Union for the Progress of Guinea party , a fierce critic of Conte , said he was saddened by the death of a man he called a " compatriot " .
" The most important is what is to come :
It is essential that the institutions function correctly and that the provisions of the constitution be respected , " said Dore .
Last year , a general strike triggered anti-government riots in which more than 180 people were killed , most of them shot by Conte 's forces , according to witnesses and human rights groups .
Units of the army and police staged violent mutinies this year to demand payment of back pay and other benefits .
Foreign companies with operations in Guinea include Alcoa , Rio Tinto Alcan and Russia 's RUSAL .
Prosecutors and police officers say they still have fundamental questions about how to enforce the new law that takes effect Jan. 2 decriminalizing possession of small amounts of marijuana .
Many law enforcement officials strongly opposed the intensely debated Nov. 4 state ballot question that will turn possession of an ounce or less of marijuana into an offense on par with a traffic violation .
Police and prosecutors say they are in the dark about many aspects of the law .
A high - ranking state judge sought to clarify some matters in a memorandum issued yesterday .
But police and prosecutors said questions still abound , including what they should do with people caught with several joints who refuse to identify themselves , who will develop and fund a drug - awareness program required for violators under 18 , and whether state - run laboratories that test drugs seized in criminal cases will continue to do so for small quantities of marijuana .
" I think there are a lot more questions than answers right now , " Lawrence Police Chief John J. Romero said of the law .
" I do n't think anybody knows how this is going to play out . "
Berkshire District Attorney David F. Capeless , president of the Massachusetts District Attorneys Association , said state officials have yet to address other unexpected questions , including whether police chiefs can discipline officers who light up a joint after work .
" I 'm not suggesting that officers are doing it , " he said .
" But what you 're doing , whether it 's officers or other public employees - transportation workers , bus drivers , teachers - you 're removing a disincentive by saying : ' We wo n't be able to do anything to you .
You wo n't get disciplined for this .
It wo n't mean your job .
It may mean a $ 100 fine . ' "
In a letter last month on behalf of the district attorneys , Capeless urged Governor Deval Patrick to ask the Legislature to delay the effective date of the new law .
But a spokesman for the state 's Executive Office of Public Safety and Security said yesterday that Patrick will not do that , even though the governor opposed the ballot question .
Terrel Harris - a spokesman for the Office of Public Safety , which is responsible for setting up the new system of civil penalties - acknowledged that time is running out until the law goes into effect and said the office will issue its own guidelines for law enforcement officials next week .
" We are looking at this issue from every conceivable angle , " he said .
" We realize that the deadline is rapidly approaching , but we want to get it right . "
Thomas W. Nolan , an assistant professor of criminal justice at Boston University and a former Boston police lieutenant who was featured in a television ad supporting Question 2 , characterized the complaints of law enforcement officials as inflexibility .

Rechargeable lithium ion batteries provide portable devices that require a lot of energy , such as mobile telephones , digital cameras , and notebook computers , with power .
However , their capacity , and thus the running time of the devices , remain somewhat limited .
A notebook computer thus usually runs only about two hours .
The reason for this is the relatively small capacity of the graphite anode in these batteries to absorb lithium ions .
A team led by Jaephil Cho at Hanyang University in Korea has now developed a new material for anodes , which could clear a path for a new generation of rechargeable batteries .
As reported in the journal Angewandte Chemie , their new material involves three - dimensional , highly porous silicon structures .
Lithium ion accumulator batteries produce current by moving lithium ions .
The battery usually contains a cathode ( positive electrode ) made of a mixed metal oxide , such as lithium cobalt oxide , and an anode ( negative electrode ) made of graphite .
While the battery is being charged , lithium ions migrate into the anode , where they are stored between the graphite layers .
When the battery is being discharged , these ions migrate back to the cathode .
It would be nice to have an anodic material that could store more lithium ions than graphite .
Silicon presents an interesting alternative .
The problem : silicon expands a great deal while absorbing lithium ions ( charging ) and shrinks when giving them up ( discharging ) .
After several cycles the required thin silicon layers are pulverized and can no longer be charged .
Cho 's team has now developed a new method for the production of a porous silicon anode that can withstand this strain .
They annealed silicon dioxide nanoparticles with silicon particles whose outermost silicon atoms have short hydrocarbon chains attached to them at 900 °C under an argon atmosphere .
The silicon dioxide particles were removed from the resulting mass by etching .
What remained were carbon - coated silicon crystals in a continuous , three - dimensional , highly porous structure .
Anodes made of this highly porous silicon have a high charge capacity for lithium ions .
In addition , the lithium ions are rapidly transported and stored , making rapid charging and discharging possible .
A high specific capacity is also attained with high current .
The changes in volume that occur upon charging and discharging cause only a small degree of swelling and shrinking of the pore walls , which have a thickness of less than 70 nm .
In addition , the first charging cycle results in an amorphous ( noncrystalline ) silicon mass around residual nanocrystals in the pore walls .
Consequently , even after 100 cycles , the stress in the pore wall is not noticeable in the material .

Before a ceasefire took hold Sunday in Gaza , the tragedy of Dr. Izzeldin Abuelaish 's three dead daughters unfolded live on Israeli television .
Gaza physician Ezzeldeen
Abu al - Aish visits one of his surviving daughters in a Tel Aviv hospital after Israeli shellfire killed three of his girls and a niece .
( ( CBC ) )
The doctor , a Palestinian in Gaza , acted as a Hebrew - speaking witness to the suffering there in nightly interviews with Israel 's Channel 10 .
Speaking via cellphone Friday night , he told correspondent Shlomi Eldar that two shells had just torn into his house .
" My daughters ! " he screamed .
" Oh , God , my daughters ! "
Three of his daughters and a niece were killed .
Abuelaish had been planning to take his family and start fresh in Canada , but no one in crowded Gaza or nearby Israeli towns was immune to shells or rockets during the conflict , which left more than 1,200 Palestinians and 13 Israelis dead .
Less than 24 hours before Israel announced its ceasefire in its assault on Hamas , his daughters and niece were killed by Israeli fire .
Gazan officials identified his dead daughters as 22 - year - old Bisan , 15 - year - old Mayer and 14 - year - old Aya , and the niece as 14 - year - old Nour Abuelaish , the Associated Press reported .
Eighteen members of his extended family were in the house at the time , and at least two of his five surviving children were wounded in the shelling , AP said .
Israeli television correspondent Shlomi Eldar choked up as the doctor 's wails were broadcast across the nation .
( ( CBC ) )
On television , the Israeli correspondent , Eldar , choked up as the doctor 's wails were broadcast across the nation .
The cameras then followed Eldar as he appealed to the Israeli army to get an ambulance to the scene , at least to help the others who were wounded .
Abuelaish was able to arrange the transfer of his two injured daughters to Israeli hospitals , something that has been extremely rare during this conflict , AP said .
The Israeli army for the first time allowed a Palestinian ambulance to go straight to the Erez border crossing , where the injured were transferred to Israeli ambulances .
From there , they were taken by helicopter to Tel Hashomer hospital in Tel Aviv .
But much of Abuelaish 's world has been shattered .
Although his wife died six months ago , there were high hopes for the future of the rest of the family .
" I was sitting there with them , planning , because I got an offer in Canada , at the University of Toronto , " he told CBC News .
In the midst of tragedy , however , he has somehow found hope .
" If I remain stuck with my sadness , my anger , can I return the life to them ?
No .
But I have other children ; I have hope . "
Even as he said that , an Israeli man visiting the hospital began yelling at him .
Militants shot from the house , the Israeli said , repeating media reports that the home was shelled after someone fired at troops from nearby .
Abuelaish said no one was there but his family , and that he would have personally thrown out any militants .

Even in his grief , Abuelaish remains convinced that people must talk to each other across the Israeli - Palestinian divide , he said .
" From our pain we can learn , " he said .
" We may disagree , but we should learn from that .
Let us express the pain , let it out .
It 's beneficial to us all . "
Over the past three weeks , Israelis have remained largely unmoved by the scope of death and destruction in Gaza , but Abuelaish 's story is being followed closely by every Israeli news agency and has struck a national chord :
A man who has lost almost everything still has hope that Israelis and Palestinians can live in peace .
" Maybe the blood of my daughters was the price , " he said , " and if it was , I am happy about it .
The cost of ceasefire to save lives to be my daughters ' and my niece 's blood — honestly , I am proud of it .
I am fully proud of it . "
The 55 - year - old gynecologist is a known peace activist involved in promoting joint Israeli - Palestinian projects and an academic who studied the effects of war on Gazan and Israeli children , AP reported .
He works at Gaza 's main Shifa Hospital .
During the call - ins , he often spoke of his fears for his eight children as Israeli shells punished not only the Hamas militants they were targeting in Gaza but civilians who live in the tightly packed enclave , unable to leave .
UPDATE : Skype 2.8 Beta for Mac OS
X is now available for download .
UPDATE # 2 : The 2.8 Beta also includes some experimental support for linking Skype mood messages to Twitter .
Tonight out at the " ShowStoppers " event at MacWorld in San Francisco , Skype announced the new 2.8 Beta for Mac OS X .
The new version will apparently be available for download tomorrow , January 6 , 2009 , from Skype 's website .
[ NOTE : I will update this post with the download link when it becomes available . ]
Continuing Skype 's rather fragmented product strategy , they have rolled out some new features in this 2.8 beta release that will at least stop us Mac users from whining about Windows users always getting the good stuff first .
Here 's the quick list of what Skype notes is in this release :
Skype Access
Screen Sharing
Improved chat management : ability to sort chats in the drawer and set priorities to chats
Quick Add : much easier to add people to chats
Mood message chat : mood message updates from your friends as chat messages
Large avatars : 256x256 pixels
Hidden avatars in incoming contact requests
Ability to add your own notes to contacts
Courtesy of Skype 's PR team , I 've had a chance to play with the 2.8 beta for a couple of weeks and have these thoughts below ...
SKYPE ACCESS
Probably the largest " new " feature is " Skype Access " , a service that lets you go to any of the 100,000 Boingo WiFi hotspots and - using Skype - connect to the Boingo hotspot .
When you connect , you pay on a per-minute basis and the fee ( roughly 20 cents per minute ) is deducted from your Skype Credit .
You do not have to pay the Boingo monthly fee .
You do not have to pay any hourly or daily fees .
Judging from the news release and pre-release info , Skype is immensely proud of this feature but I will be honest and say it does little for me .
I just do n't use WiFi hotspots as much while traveling ( especially now that I 'm paying for a wireless broadband adapter ) .
However , I can see how this could be of value .
If all you wanted to do was crack open your Mac and send some email , this gives you a great way to do that on a per-minute basis .
If I were a heavy user of WiFi hotspots , I 'd want to do the math to figure out if it would just be cheaper to buy a monthly Boingo access .
Regardless , it 's an interesting move for Skype to get into the business of connecting you to Internet access .
SCREEN SHARING
The coolest feature of the 2.8 beta is a " screensharing " feature where you can share either your entire screen or just a portion of your screen with the Skype user on the other end .
Now , this works with all other versions of Skype because it replaces your video stream with the screen sharing .
So a Mac Skype user can share their screen with Windows and Linux users .... which is pretty cool .
It 's hard to show in a blog post , but if you watch my screencast about the 2.8 beta , you can see it in action :
You can share either your entire desktop or just a section of your screen .
You can also resize the section you are sharing while you are in the middle of sharing .
When you stop sharing , you just flip back to showing your video .
CHAT PRIORITIZATION
By far the most useful feature I 've found in the 2.8 beta is the ability to set the " priority " of a chat session - and then sort your chat sessions by priority in the Mac's " drawer " way of displaying chat sessions .
I can just control - click a chat ( either a private or public chat ) and then go down to the " Set Priority " menu choice :
You can then sort the chats based on their priority using the drop - down menu at the top of the " drawer " :
You can also sort based on title or date .
Personally I 've found the Sort by Priority to be very useful when you have , as I do , a zillion chats open at any one time .
( And yes , I report to RJ , our CTO , so his chat gets the highest priority ! ;-) )
MOOD MESSAGE CHAT - AND FOLLOWING ( like Twitter )
Perhaps the most intriguing aspect of the 2.8 beta is the new " Mood Messages " pseudo - chat that you can enable in the Advanced part of the Skype Preferences :
Once you enable the " Mood Message Chat " , you get a new chat window that opens up that shows you the mood messages of all of your contacts :
It also very nicely lets you set your mood message simply by typing in the window as you would to any other chat window .
This is quite nice for someone like me who almost never changes my mood message in the regular window .
This actually makes Skype mood messages useful to me .
However , because of that other option that says " Show iTunes song in my mood message " , you rapidly wind up seeing that a whole lot of people have that option checked and your Mood Message Chat rapidly fills with updates of music people listen to .
What if you do n't want to see their updates ?
Well , Skype has made it so that you can " follow " updates from your contacts through a simple menu choice :
The down side here is that if you enable the Mood Message Chat , you are following all your contacts by default and have to go through and " unfollow " ( i.e. uncheck the menu choice ) people you do n't want to follow .
It would be great if Skype had a " follow by default " or a " stop following all contacts " choice ... something along those lines to let you control who you are following .
The intriguing aspect here is that this enables you to turn Skype mood messages into the kind of status updates that you typically have in Twitter , Facebook , or any of the other zillion services offering status updates .
The great thing here is that it is simply another Skype chat window like all your other chats .
( Of course , you can get a Skype chat for Twitter using " twitter4skype " , but this is now with Skype mood messages . )
I think , though , for it to reach any kind of real usage , you need more people to enable this feature ( it is off by default ) and actually start using it - and for that it also needs to be on more platforms .
[ As a tease , I 'll mention that there is a way to integrate this mood message chat with Twitter , so anything I type there also shows up in my Twitter stream ... but I 'll write about that in a separate blog post as it's not directly tied to the 2.8 beta release .
Soon ...]
QUICK ADD
Another nice feature is the ability to quickly add someone to a chat through a button at the top of the chat window .
You click on the window and start typing in a contact 's name :
Before you could always drag - and - drop a contact from your main Skype window into a chat , but now you can use this quick add button .
It is particularly useful if you have a large number of Skype contacts .
NOTES ON CONTACTS
Another useful feature is the ability to add private notes to each of your Contacts .
So you could store information about how you know the person ... their interests ... basically anything you want as it is a free - form text field :
What 's not yet clear to me is where these notes are stored .
Are they accessible through multiple Skype clients if you were logged in on multiple machines ?
Or are they tied to the machine where you create the Notes ?
I 'm guessing that they are stored with the local client like chat histories are .... but I 'd need to have multiple installations of the 2.8 beta to really know this .
OTHER FEATURES
Skype also added a few other features :
New set of icons
Large avatars :
You can now have images up to 256x256 pixels in size .
Hidden avatars in incoming contact requests - so you are n't exposed to images that might be offensive .
There are undoubtedly other features that we 'll find as we work with it more .
CONCLUSION
So with this 2.8 Beta for Mac OS X , Skype provides some interesting new capabilities .
I can see the screen sharing being quite useful to show people what 's on my screen .
The chat prioritization is great for heavy chat users like me .
The possibilities of actually making the Mood Messages useful intrigue me .
Frequent WiFi hotspot users may find the Skype Access feature useful and economical .
All in all , it 's a great evolution of the Skype client for Mac OS X .
I do wish , though , as I 've discussed before , that Skype 's product strategy were n't so fragmented .
Sure , as a Mac user , it 's fun for a few minutes to have some features that Windows users do n't have ... but that fun rapidly fades when I can share my desktop with a Windows user but they can't share their's .
And they almost never use the Mood Messages because it 's not convenient to do so .
Perhaps most annoyingly , I am currently in a position where I am helping some Windows users get started with Skype and so I 'm trying to help them with their Skype client ... when mine is markedly different .
It 's a frustrating experience .
I do hope Skype 's new management can help converge the product streams so that the user experience ( and technical support experience ) is closer between platforms ( while , yes , acknowledging that platforms have UI / behavior differences ) .
We 'll see .
In the meantime , I 'm going to enjoy using this new beta on my Mac and seeing what else might be inside the release .
Again , Skype indicates that the 2.8 beta will be available tomorrow , January 6 , 2009 , for download for Mac OS X users .
I 'll look forward to reading what you all think ...

Two Beaumont men accused of trying to pass off tortillas as crack indicted for aggravated robbery
Two Beaumont men accused of trying to pass off flour tortillas as crack cocaine , then refusing to give refunds , were indicted on charges of aggravated robbery Thursday .
On Jan. 12 , an informant working with the Jefferson County Narcotics Unit agreed to purchase " cookies " of crack cocaine in the Beaumont Home Depot parking lot from a man known as " Fats , " according to court documents .
After entering the vehicle , which police accuse 20 - year - old Dennis Payne Cleaver of driving , the informant pointed out that the narcotics were in actuality flour tortillas .
" Defendant pointed a gun at him and rather politely suggested he get out of the car , declining to refund him the $ 2,000 , " court documents state .
As the vehicle attempted to drive away , law enforcement officers pursued it in their vehicles , according to court documents .
The driver hit a police vehicle , then drove down Pinkston Street , hitting the same police vehicle several more times before stopping at the Village shopping center .
Cleaver , whom police claim is " Fats , " faces up to life in prison on the aggravated robbery charge and up to two years on a charge of evading arrest .
A passenger in the vehicle , 17 - year - old Terrance Jamal Jones , also was also indicted on an aggravated robbery charge .
Also this week , a Port Arthur man was indicted on a charge of intoxication manslaughter .
Jeffery Paul Schroeder , 46 , is accused of striking Darylene Joseph Lewis , 54 , while he was standing on the side of the road near the 1200 block of Jefferson Drive in Port Arthur .
Schroeder faces up to 20 years in prison if convicted .
An economic crisis changes the way you think about gadgets .
Is a $ 400 game console bundle really what you want to be spending your hard - earned money on , considering that you could be out of a job in six months ?
Maybe not — though we 're sympathetic to the idea that the recently unemployed might need to blow off steam with a few rounds of Wii Boxing .
If you 're spending your gadget dollars cautiously , you 'll pick gadgets that :
do n't cost a huge amount ,
have lasting utility ,
are n't likely to break or wear out quickly , and
will continue to be useful even when the infrastructure around them is crumbling .
With that in mind , here 's our list of gadgets that will be handy in case the economic recession becomes a full - blown depression and turns iPhone lines into bread lines .
The guidelines we used in assembling this list :
These are tools that will be useful in the event of a major economic slump that puts a lot of people out of work and affects basic services — like road maintenance or the reliability of the electric power grid — without plunging the country into total civil chaos .
If it 's the latter you 're planning for , check out our gallery of crazy survival gear for some inspiration , or read up on some more - practical survival skills and survival kits .
Also , we 've limited ourselves to gadgets that have a substantially legal use ( skipping , for instance , the Slim Jim for breaking into cars ) .
We also have n't recommended guns , since frankly we do n't know much about them , and there are plenty of other blogs where you can read about firearms .
Having never actually lived through a major economic depression , this list is our best guess at what will work .
Got better ideas ?
Let us know in the comments .
__Multi-Tool ( $ 50 ) __
If times get tough , you 're going to have to get used to fixing things on your own .
A full set of tools is your best bet if you 've got to do heavy construction or car maintenance , but for basic fix - it tasks , an ordinary multi-tool is a seriously handy gadget .
It also comes in handy for opening cans and bottles , cutting things , prying open packages and a variety of other tasks .
While Leatherman pioneered this type of tool , Victorinox makes multi-tools that are sturdier and longer - lasting ; the Victorinox SwissTool is available for about $ 55 on Amazon .
Self - Powered Radio ( $ 35 )
If something happens to the electrical grid , you might have to go without power for several days .
If things really get bad , you might see power rationing , where electric power is only available for certain hours of the day .
A solar - and crank - powered radio is the best way to stay informed about what 's going on in that kind of situation .
And if nothing 's going on , you 'll at least be able to tune in some radio shows to keep you entertained while you sit in the dark .
Our pick : the $ 35 Freeplay Companion , which doubles as a flashlight and a cellphone charger and can be charged up by hand crank , solar power or standard USB cable .
OLPC XO ( $ 400 )
It 's lightweight , durable , runs for nearly a full day on a single charge , and can be recharged with a solar panel — the XO is the perfect laptop for the developing world , and might be an excellent choice in a developed world that 's fallen on hard times , too .
Whether you 're sending out resumes from the public library 's free Wi -Fi network or setting up an ad hoc electronic bulletin board in a refugee camp , the XO has you covered .
Currently the only way to get one is through One Laptop per Child 's " Give One , Get One " program .
GSM - Based Cellphone ( prices vary )
Cellphones are not built for the ages .
My first iPhone went on the fritz after just one year , and I 've had just one phone that remained continuously operational for more than two years ( a Nokia 3595 ) .
When your phone dies , the easiest and cheapest way to replace it – without signing up for another 2 - year contract – is to buy a second - hand phone , then pop in the SIM card from your busted handset .
That kind of identity transplant is only possible with GSM phones ; phones for use on Verizon or Sprint / Nextel's
CDMA networks require a trip to the store before you can start using them .
Oh , and that Nokia 3595 ?
You can get one for less than $ 10 on eBay .
CORRECTION 12/30 : Verizon customers can activate second - hand phones , assuming they meet Verizon 's criteria , without visiting the store , by using Verizon 's website : Activate Your Phone Online .
HDTV Antenna ( $ 20 - $ 50 )
Cut the cable service : plenty of high - definition TV is available for free , over the air .
Any TV antenna will do , but one optimized for pulling in HDTV signals should help you get the appropriate frequencies better .
Do n't have an HDTV ?
Buy a digital TV converter box before
February 2009 , when TV signals go all - digital , and do n't forget to take advantage of the U.S. government 's DTV coupon subsidy , which will cover up to $ 40 of the cost for you for up to two converter boxes .
Thanks , Uncle Sam !
Voltaic Backpack ( $ 250 )
If you 're on the road , off the grid or just trying to power up your PSP when the power 's off , the Voltaic Backpack 's embedded solar panels are your friend .
They 'll generate up to 4 watts of power in direct sunlight , and the pack includes almost a dozen adapters to accommodate a variety of electronic devices .
USB Thumb Drive ( $ 10 and up )
A tiny USB thumb drive is probably the most practical infotech gadget you can own .
It can help you download your contacts on the afternoon you get laid off , store your resume in between internet cafes , or even hold an entire mini-operating system so you can have your own desktop and applications on any borrowed computer you can lay your hands on .
A larger external hard drive will store more data , but spinning - disk media is more vulnerable to damage from shock and vibration than flash memory is , so it 's not the best choice if your future includes traveling with a bindlestiff on your shoulder and a boxcar for your bed .
__Pocket Camcorder ( $ 180 )
__
A video camera might not be any longer - lasting than the typical cellphone , but at least you 'll have something left when the camera goes kaput :
Namely , all the videos you shot with it .
And once the hard times are past , you 'll be looking with ever - rosier glasses back on these times , so it 'll be good to have some videos to remind you of how things really looked .
Our pick : The Kodak Zi6 , which is a bit clunkier and bigger than the more popular Flip Mino , but takes better video and costs less .
Multi-Fuel Camp Stove ( $ 150 )
If the gas and electricity get shut off , you 'll still need some way to cook the rice and beans you 've hoarded , right ?
The best bet is a camp stove that accepts a variety of fuels , from kerosene to white gas .
That way you 'll be cooking no matter what kind of flammable liquid you can lay your hands on .
A good pick is the MSR XGK EX ( $ 150 ) , which can even burn unleaded gasoline .
__Water Filter Bottle ( $ 12 - $ 35 )
__
Finding clean water to drink can become a major problem in the event of a natural disaster — or a breakdown of the public water - processing system .
A simple water filter can get rid of most of the nasty microbes — but not toxic chemicals that may be dissolved in the water .
Bottles with built - in filters , like the Katadyn Micro Bottle , are the most convenient option .
__Bicycle ( prices vary )
__
There 's no better way than a bicycle for getting around without much money .
Add a trailer or an Xtracycle conversion , and your bike can even transport furniture .
Get a bike that 's sturdy , with fat tires ( better for pothole - strewn roadways ) and learn how to do basic maintenance on it .
Although fancy bikes can cost $ 3,000 or more , you 'll do just fine with a $ 400 model from your local bike shop — or a used , $ 25 bike from your local thrift store .
__Portable Musical Instrument ( prices vary )
__
After your entertainment budget dries up and blows away , you 're going to be spending a lot more time at home .
Do n't blow your savings by downloading tunes for $ 1 apiece on iTunes : Learn to make your own music .
It 's cheap entertainment , and it'll work even if the lights go off and stay off .* *

The UK has recently introduced a national Internet censorship scheme , a national ID card and is about to spend 12 billion pounds pushing the British population 's web - searches , emails , sms messages and telephone callings records through a central database run by its spy agency , GCHQ .
This month saw a secret UK court hearing , with secret participants , produce a secret order to secretly gag the population , the terms of which are secret and the revelation of which is punishable by up to 15 years of imprisonment .
How many of these orders exist is unknowable -- we glimpse at the severity of the problem only when the orders are violated .

Secret_gag_orders_undermine_core_Western_values
Wed Dec 24 19:19:54 GMT
2008 " UK undermines core Western values " British courts continue to disgrace Enlightenment values .
This month saw a secret UK court hearing , with secret participants , produce a secret order to secretly gag the population , the terms of which are secret and the revelation of which is punishable by up to 15 years of imprisonment .
How many of these orders exist is unknowable -- we glimpse at the severity of the problem only when the orders are violated .
Secret gag actions are usually associated with the likes of Saudi - Arabia , China or North Korea .
Closed - door justice for the wealthy emasculates the UK population and grants succor to repressive regimes across the globe who can look to the UK for validation .
It is time these orders were treated with the contempt they deserve .
Wikileaks previously released the gag order for the Northern Rock bank collapse , now we release the secret gag order made by High Court Justice Tugendhat on Dec 15 , 2008 , aimed at covering up an email leak from the British establishment .
The secret order was first targeted at UK newspapers , but our copy was destined for the UK Parliamentary blogger ' Guido Fawkes ' , editor of ' order-order.com ' .
The summary states : 1 . The identities of the Applicants / Claimants must remain confidential .
2 . The fact of the existence of the Orders must remain confidential .
3 . The terms of the Orders must remain confidential .
The order concerns emails from Zac Goldsmith , a noted 2005 Conservative party recruit , and social climber sibling Jemima Khan .
Both are hairs to the late billionaire financier Sir James Goldsmith .
Needless to say there are no teachers , small business owners or technicians being granted secret media gag orders in the UK .
The order states that anyone who knows of the order must obey it , so plaintiff lawyers Carter Ruck have served the order on media outlets across the British Isles .
Britain is an increasingly dangerous Western disgrace , but you wo n't hear about it in the British press .
The examples needed to elucidate just how the country is failing can not be mentioned , accelerating its decline .
In the last five years Britain has become the world 's largest arms exporter , the preferred home of Russian and middle - eastern oligarchs , the world center for " libel tourism " and , as far as we can tell , the Western capital of secret gag orders .
Only a week ago , on December 17 , the High Court of London gave the go ahead for a libel tourism action against the New York Times .
The same day the Hon. Denis MacShane ( Labour ) with two MPs from other parties , told Westminster that UK courts had become a " Soviet - style organ of censorship " .
The UK has recently introduced a national Internet censorship scheme , a national ID card and is about to spend 12 billion pounds pushing the British population 's web - searches , emails , sms messages and telephone callings records through a central database run by its spy agency , GCHQ .
This month also saw British police go into Parliament , without a warrant , and rifle through the files of a senior member of the opposition , the Hon.
Damian Green MP , who was alleged to have leaked trivial details about immigration policy to the press .
What 's left ?
The Gulag ?
THEY ARE GOING TO TRY AND GAG YOU EXPECT IT
It ’s Time Your Porn Habits Go Public
This week ’s news that Google is being forced to hand over complete YouTube user histories to Viacom got me thinking — about porn .
Let me get you up to speed : Viacom ’s been arguing that too much of its copyrighted content has been submitted to YouTube , and — even though the videos have been taken down when requested —
Google owes it a billion dollars for not preventing the uploads altogether .
Now , a judge has ruled Google must hand over every registered user name and IP address , along with a complete list of every video that person has ever watched , so Viacom can look it all over .
That ’s where we get to the porn .
If this kind of legal argument works , I ’d like to suggest someone demand the same data from Xtube — the YouTube of adult entertainment , if you will .
That site has all sorts of copyrighted content on it — at least , uh , that ’s what I ’ve heard .
So why not get all the user names , IP addresses , and corresponding videos watched there ?
Apparently , that ’s not a privacy violation , if you apply the logic of Google ’s judge .
And let ’s face it :
That kind of data would be way more interesting to review .
Just imagine it :
You could walk into work Monday morning with a knowing smirk on your face .
“ Dan , what ’s up , buddy ?
Good weekend ?
Nice barbeque ?
Four facial videos and one anal ? ' ”
All I ’m saying is that if privacy ’s no longer unequivocally protected — which , one might surmise from this , it ’s not — let ’s take this thing all the way .
Do n’t stop with CBS sitcoms .
I want to hear respected corporate lawyers reading lists of which “ Backdoor Action ” videos were illegally seen by whom and how many unpaid viewings of “ Ram - Bo Four ” happened in the wee hours of the night .
By the way , the Electronic Frontier Foundation is already calling the judge ’s decision a violation of federal privacy laws — but so far , the ruling stands .
Barely legal , indeed .
" Dear Lord , bless this carrot , and its sweet , sweet orangey goodness , that thou hast seen fit to deliver unto us this day ; and bless also my dear wife Mabel and our fourteen children , most of whom look like me ; and my sister Enid , even though she moved to the colony in the nicer part of town and wo n't talk to us anymore ; and ... "
From a million in - boxes to yours , courtesy new sender - inner Betsy B .
And so its done .
President Obama has been sworn in , and Bush and Cheney consigned to the dustbin of history .
And so a village in Texas gets its idiot back .
Could n't they have reclaimed him sooner ?
As for the speech , I 'm struck by the sheer weirdness of American political rhetoric .
It reads like something from the nineteenth century or Battlestar Galactica - all Bible quotes and historic mission and shaping our destiny and tested by god .
It 's difficult to imagine any New Zealand politician saying anything like this with a straight face - or a New Zealand audience not simply gawping at its purple pomposity .
But then , we see our country as a place we live in , not some great historical project .
We know our unimportance , so we are not obsessed with its " greatness " and whether it will wax or wane .
And whether it " continues " or not we see as a decision for outside forces , or ( on a sufficiently long time scale ) geology - not the politician d'jour .
Basically , we do n't care about leaving a mark on history .
New Zealanders are n't the sort of people to build pyramids ( though we have built a henge ) .
Americans are .
And that 's what their political rhetoric is best seen as : rhetorical pyramids .
Do n't they understand we have Google now ?
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
The housing crisis still has a choke hold on America :
In September , 81,312 homes were lost to foreclosure , according to a report released Thursday .
RealtyTrac , an online marketer of foreclosed properties , said that 851,000 homes have been repossessed by lenders since August 2007 .
In September , 265,968 troubled borrowers received foreclosure filings - such as default notices , auction sale notices and bank repossessions .
That 's a decline of 12 % from the record high number of filings in August , but 21 % more than in September 2007 .
All told 765,558 foreclosure filings were made on U.S. properties in the third quarter of this year - up 3 % from the second quarter and 71 % from the same period last year .
" We have never seen a foreclosure cycle like this one before , " said Rick Sharga , Realty Trac senior vice president .
Other periods of elevated foreclosure rates have been preceded by signs of economic weakness .
However , " in this cycle , we have foreclosure problems that have caused an economic downturn . "
States step up
The most recent monthly dip in foreclosure filings was caused largely by decisions by several states to relax housing laws .
" Much of the 12 % decrease in September can be attributed to changes in state laws that have at least temporarily slowed down the pace at which lenders are moving forward with foreclosures , " Realty Trac CEO James Saccacio said in a statement .
For instance , California - one of the states hardest - hit states in the housing crisis - has a new law that requires banks to contact struggling homeowners at least 30 days before delivering a notice of default .
That 's helped to drastically slow the number of foreclosure filings in the state .
" In September , we saw California [ defaults ] drop 51 % from the previous month , " said Saccacio .
" That had a big impact on the national numbers since California accounts for a third of the nation 's foreclosure activity . "
North Carolina passed a similar law , and notices of default there fell by 66 % in September .
Unfortunately , even these extensions are n't saving most troubled borrowers .
" The intention is very worthwhile , but I think the net result in most cases is simply delaying the inevitable , " said Sharga .
" If a few homeowners are able to stay in their homes as a result of the legislation , then it had a positive effect , " said Sharga .
However , " the longer you are in foreclosure , the harder it becomes to pay the debt you owe to get out of foreclosure , " he added .
Circumstances in Massachusetts illustrate his point .
That state enacted a law back in May requiring lenders to give troubled homeowners 90 days notice before initiating foreclosure , which pushed the number of foreclosure filings it reported way down for several months .
But in September , when the law expired , filings spiked .
" Initial foreclosure filings in Massachusetts jumped 465 % from August to September after being much lower than normal in June , July and August , " said Saccacio .
Nevada once again had the nation 's highest foreclosure rate , with one out of ever 82 homes in foreclosure .
Florida had the second highest rate in September , with one in every 178 homes in default .
California came in third , with one in every 189 homes there receiving foreclosure filling last month .
Waiting to see what 's next
As foreclosures continue to wreck havoc across the nation 's housing market , the U.S. government has announced unprecedented efforts to absorb toxic debt and shore up investor confidence .
The " Hope for Homeowners " rescue bill went into effect Oct. 1 and will allow some troubled borrowers to refinance into mortgages backed by the Federal Housing Authority .
And more recently , a massive financial rescue plan calls for Treasury to buy up troubled assets , mostly backed by bad loans , to stabilize the financial system .
However , as home buyers and lenders wait to see the effects of the plans , " there is a lot of uncertainty in the market right now , " said Sharga .
Still , he thinks that the market could be nearing a bottom , even as uncertainty remains high .
" If everything goes right , we will be done with almost all the subprime loans by sometime in the first quarter of 2009 , " said Sharga .
" The market could start to stabilize at that point . "
The bad news :
The housing market will be flooded with bank - owned homes .
" We are estimating that by the end of this year , between one quarter and one third of all homes for sale will be bank owned properties , " he said .
That could push down prices even more , perpetuating a vicious cycle , but it might also start to attract bargain hunters who may absorb some of the massive housing inventory .
NEW YORK , Nov. 5 ( UPI ) -- Job cuts in the United States reached a five - year high in October , a private research group said Wednesday .
Downsizing has eliminated 875,974 jobs for the year , 14 percent higher than the total announced job cuts for 2007 , Challenger , Gray & Christmas , a Chicago - headquartered outplacement consultancy , said .

In October , job cuts reached 112,884 , a 19 percent increase over September and 79 percent higher than October 2007 .
In layoff announcements , the financial sector topped the list with 17,949 , followed by the automobile industry , which announced 15,692 .
In 2008 , these sectors have announced a total of 239,760 layoffs , 27 percent of all layoff announcements , the report said .
However , " a year ago , job cuts were concentrated in the financial sector and home - building industries , " Chief Executive Officer John Challenger said .
" Job cuts are now rising across the board , " he said .
" In fact , October represented the biggest job - cut month of the year for several industries , including industrial goods manufacturing , consumer products , pharmaceutical , food and electronics . "
A group of Britain 's most prominent Jews has called on Israel to cease its military operations in Gaza immediately , warning that its actions , far from improving the country 's security , will " strengthen extremism , destabilise the region , and exacerbate tensions inside Israel " .
Describing themselves , as " profound and passionate supporters " of Israel - and supporting its right to defend itself against the " war crime " of Hamas rocket attacks - they added that the current tactics threatened to undermine international support for Israel .
The intervention , in a letter published in today 's Observer , came as fears grew that Israel was to launch a " new phase " of its military offensive inside the Gaza strip .
Yesterday warplanes dropped leaflets warning Gazans " not to be close to terrorists , weapons warehouses and the places where the terrorists operate " .
The two - week - old campaign has already killed more than 800 Palestinians , while 13 Israelis have died , three of them civilians killed by Hamas rockets .
Although individual Jewish writers and religious figures have expressed their opposition to the conduct of Operation Cast Lead , the letter represents the most significant break with Israel 's tactics from a group of UK Jews .
Prominent rabbis , academics and political figures are among the signatories , including Rabbi Dr Tony Bayfield , head of the Movement for Reform Judaism ; Sir Jeremy Beecham , former chair of the Labour party ; Professor Shalom Lappin of the University of London ; Baroness Julia Neuberger ; Rabbi Danny Rich , chief executive of Liberal Judaism ; Rabbi Professor Marc Saperstein , principal of Leo Baeck rabbinical training college ; and lawyer Michael Mitzman , who set up Holocaust Memorial Day Trust for the Home Office .
Their demand comes amid increasing pressure on Israel from the diplomatic community to halt its operations , and rising criticism of the humanitarian impact on Palestinian civilians , including allegations of potentially serious breaches of international humanitarian law .
Demonstrations around the world yesterday called for a ceasefire .
" We look upon the increasing loss of life on both sides of the Gaza conflict with horror , " reads the letter .
" We have no doubt that rocket attacks into southern Israel , by Hamas and other militant Palestinian groups , are war crimes against Israel .
No sovereign state should , or would , tolerate continued attacks and the deliberate targeting of civilians .
Israel had a right to respond and we support the Israeli government 's decision to make stopping the rocket attacks an urgent priority .
" However , we believe that now only negotiations can secure long - term security for Israel and the region . "
The letter was written before the escalation of ground fighting in Gaza City itself signalled by Israel yesterday .
" There can be no alternative to a negotiated solution , " said Beecham .
" Israel should be demonstrating , along with the Palestinian Authority , that there are economic and political benefits to be gained from peaceful engagement rather than violent confrontation . "
His sentiments were echoed by Lappin : " Relying on overwhelming military force to respond to terrorist provocations invariably imposes horrendous suffering on innocent Palestinian civilians while entrenching the agents of terror in their midst .
We have no alternative but to pursue rational , long term political options that promote moderation and marginalise extremists . "
In London violent clashes broke out near the Israeli embassy as tens of thousands marched in protest .
Helmeted riot police with batons and shields charged a group of demonstrators who hurled sticks , shoes and traffic cones back at them while chanting " Free Palestine ! "
Protesters tried to force entry to the north gate of Kensington Palace Gardens and six climbed an adjoining wall , setting fire to an American flag .
The windows of a Starbucks opposite the embassy were smashed .
The police charges created waves of panic .
Protester Ahmed Mohammad , 23 , claimed he saw women and children get hurt : " It was a peaceful protest until the riot police came .
I 've seen a mother and little girl pushed to the ground . "
Some protesters attempted to throw barriers and other missiles at police .
The Stop the War Coalition , which organised the event , claimed that " at least " 100,000 people had made it " the biggest demonstration of solidarity with the Palestinian people in the history of this country " .
The Metropolitan Police estimated the total at 12,000 .
Earlier , Speakers ' Corner at Hyde Park was turned into a sea of Palestinian flags and banners condemning Israel .
Speakers included human rights advocate Bianca Jagger , singer Annie Lennox and the Rev Garth Hewitt , canon at St George 's Cathedral in Jerusalem .
Who , back then , could have imagined what would follow ?
On the glacially cold morning of 10 February 2007 , I stood shivering in the crowd outside the Old State House in Springfield , Illinois , as Barack Obama formally declared himself a candidate to be the 44th President of the United States .
The very thought that , for the first time , an African - American and a relative political newcomer to boot , had a small but realistic chance of entering the Oval Office made the moment fascinating enough .
There was also a small personal conceit .
Back in October 1991 , I had travelled to Little Rock to watch a young governor of Arkansas make a similar announcement .
Bill Clinton went all the way .
So , would lightning strike twice – might I have stumbled on another winner ?
Three days before the end of this remarkable campaign of 2008 , it looks that way .
Just as Clinton caught the mood of the country 16 years ago , Obama has done so now .
Having been present at the creation , I watched him this week as this political fairy tale for the ages moved towards its climax .
Obama was addressing an overflowing audience of 10,000 or more on the campus of James Madison University at Harrisonburg , in Virginia 's Shenandoah valley , the weather was as inhospitable as in Springfield almost 21 months before .
Though it was n't even November , and the trees were still resplendent in the scarlet , rust and orange of autumn , snow showers were forecast that night .

During what has been the most gruelling election campaign ever , the candidate has aged .
His frame is as lean and athletic as when it all began , but flecks of grey are now to be seen in Obama 's cropped black hair .
The message , however , has n't changed .
The " closing argument " he delivered in Harrisonburg is the same as that opening salvo from the steps of the Old State House : unity , hope and , most important of all , change .
Rural and spiritually of the south , the Shenandoah valley is John McCain country , in a state which has voted Republican in every election since 1964 .
The very fact that Obama was there during the endgame merely underlined his status as front - runner , conducting the battle on his opponent 's turf .
" A few weeks ago , I was supporting McCain , " a woman told me as we left , her eight - year - old daughter in tow .
" But now I 'm leaning to Obama , and he sounded really good today . "
Multiply that sentiment by thousands , maybe millions , and you have the story of this last six weeks of the campaign .
Whoever wins , the 2008 election is one for the history books .
The beauty of American politics is that it can throw up the inconceivable as nowhere else .
Obama 's presence long ago meant the campaign would be unusual .
That its climax has coincided with a financial crisis that is shaking US capitalism to its core , reducing the candidates on occasion to mere bit players , has only made it more so .
At times , you 'd hardly guess so .
Listen to the candidates , even as Wall Street took another stomach - churning plunge , and you were sometimes pressed to imagine anything truly serious was amiss .
Joe the Plumber became a national celebrity , as byzantine arguments swirled about the impact of competing tax plans and the mechanics of healthcare reform – even as ordinary Americans worried about their jobs , their savings and whether they could meet their next mortgage payments .
But the financial and economic meltdown has transformed everything .
Until mid-September the candidates were neck and neck , and some polls even put McCain ahead .
Then came Lehman Brothers .
The demise of a giant investment bank and the turmoil that ensued suddenly brought home how an old order , economic but also political , was dying as well .
Love it or loathe it , for better or worse , the US will remain the most powerful and influential country in the world , however this crisis unfolds .
Only the US will be capable of projecting overwhelming military power to every corner of the globe .
Perhaps it is no longer capable ( if it ever was ) of imposing a world order , but it remains the essential anchor of world order .
And America is also the only country where a breakdown in an obscure corner of its mortgage market could trigger what might yet be a new Great Depression .
But this is a transformational moment in American politics .
Watersheds in politics , unlike those in topography , only become clear in retrospect .
No one , for instance , could have known in 1980 that Ronald Reagan would be the dominant figure in US politics for a generation .
Few foresaw the breathtaking rise of China , and who 25 years ago would have predicted the current economic turmoil ?

Now everything is in flux , starting with politics .
If John McCain defies the odds and wins on Tuesday , it will be despite his being a Republican .
Reaganite conservatism has run its course .
The party will have to be re-invented if it is to become relevant again to the centre where elections , here as everywhere , are decided .
Barack Obama 's good fortune has been to be his party 's candidate at a moment of pent - up desire for change , like Britain in 1997 when the exhausted and broken Tory order fell to New Labour .
Had Hillary Clinton or another leading Democrat won the nomination , she or he would surely be as far ahead in the polls today as Obama – perhaps further , given the uncertainty whether his race may be a handicap .
The changing geopolitical order , too , is weighing on Election 2008 .
Foreign policy is where an American president has his greatest power .
In this campaign , it has inevitably been overshadowed by the country 's economic woes , but voters are perfectly aware of the colossal human and financial cost of the war in Iraq , and the damage it has done to America 's good name and moral authority , far outweighing any possible benefit of the conflict .
Here too Obama is the beneficiary .
Perhaps unfairly but inevitably , John McCain is identified with the old .
Obama embodies change .
And now the economic crisis , entwined with the crisis of the Republican Party and the damaged international standing of the US , yet far transcending them in its impact on the ordinary citizen .
You can measure it in the statistical indicators , such as this week 's plunge in the consumer confidence index to its lowest level since they started to measure such things in the mid-Sixties – remember that consumer spending accounts for 70 per cent of the entire economy .
And never before has 90 per cent of the population said the country is heading in the wrong direction : the real mystery is that 10 per cent of Americans still think everything is fine .
Or you can see it in the eerily quiet shopping malls ( what a dreadful Christmas retail season this promises to be ) and the empty homes with their changed locks and foreclosure sale notice in the front yard – nowhere more than in those new new exurban developments carved out of farmland and woods , that were supposed to be the new frontier of the American Dream .
Now the dream has gone sour .
Yes , the rooted belief in American exceptionalism is still more or less intact .
No Obama or McCain speech is complete without a reference to how the country is the most democratic / hardworking / productive / inventive society yet conceived by man , and how it is somehow different ( better ? ) from any other .
That is how Americans see themselves and why the US remains the most optimistic country on earth .
But in this election , optimism is tempered by foreboding .
Even before the crisis broke , the old 20th - century certainty that in America children would automatically be better off than their parents had been swept away by a decade of stagnation , even decline , in living standards for all but the very wealthy .
It is no coincidence that the gap between rich and poor in the US is now wider than at any time since the market crash of 1929 .
The assumption that prosperity is an eternal entitlement is no more .
People are worried : not just about their jobs , their mortgages and the outstanding balances on their credit cards , but also about educational standards , the decrepit state of much of the country 's infrastructure , the chronic failure to provide health care for all , and whether the money is there to pay for social security and other welfare benefits in 15 or 20 years ' time .
This week , a former General Motors employee undergoing job retraining in St Louis was interviewed on National Public Radio .
According to Nadine Newberry , a 55 - year - old black woman , this election is " the most important that I probably or anyone else would witness in a lifetime .
This has always been the richest country on earth , yet something has gone terribly wrong " .
A friend who is a senior aide for a Democratic senator on Capitol Hill made a similar point – how " some of our problems are now almost insoluble now , and that this is a last chance to act " .
Republicans might differ on the remedies but not on the diagnosis .
Given the mountain of problems that await , many of which cannot be solved even in two presidential terms , and the painful , deeply unpopular measures needed to confront them , the wonder is that Obama , McCain or anyone else wants to be president at all .
I have covered four past US elections , but there is a seriousness about this one I 've never seen before .
With the Cold War safely won and Saddam driven from Kuwait , economic angst ( with a little help from the third - party candidacy of Ross Perot ) propelled Bill Clinton to victory over the elder George Bush in 1992 .
After 12 years of Republicans in the White House , why not take a chance on a clever , charismatic if rather flighty young governor from Arkansas ?
The 1996 election was a sleepwalk for Clinton and most of us reporters , as he proclaimed himself " A Bridge to the 21st Century " and rolled over the hapless Bob Dole to win a second term .
The 21st century then duly arrived , with the tedious contest between Al Gore and Bush the son , in which the post-election dramas in Florida were infinitely more exciting than the campaign itself .
Hanging chads and butterfly ballots decided the outcome , and ushered in – though no one suspected so at the time – the most inept and disastrous presidency of the modern era .
Then 2004 did provide an election to raise passions , as the Iraq war foundered and Bush Jnr generated almost irrational hatred among Democrats .
Both sides mobilised their bases as never before , and turnover was the highest since 1960 .
The Republicans , however , mobilised slightly better , while Bush retained just enough of his dwindling political capital to haul him over the finish line ( had the vote come even three months later , I 'm convinced he would have lost ) .
But in 2004 , the stock market was fine and house prices were rocketing .
There was no sense of impending calamity ; that bedrock notions of prosperity were at risk .
Not so in the extraordinary campaign of 2008 , and the extraordinary choice that faces voters .
Americans tend to elect presidents who in character are the opposite of their predecessors .
Care - burdened Jimmy Carter was followed by sunny Ronald Reagan .
The seemingly out - of - touch G H W Bush was succeeded by the clued - up and super - empathetic Bill Clinton .
Having narrowly survived impeachment , " Slick Willie " was replaced by a younger Bush who promised to restore the honour and dignity of the country 's highest office .
And now ?
One option is a war hero who suffered unimaginably as a prisoner of North Vietnam , a foreign policy specialist who has been one of the most engaging and interesting senators of his era .
But unless all the polls are wrong , the US seems set to elect , at this most difficult moment in its modern history , the least experienced president in its modern history .
Obama 's resumé , Hillary Clinton sneered during one of the primary debates , amounted to a single speech .
She was being a bit unfair .
Not one , but two speeches helped launch his candidacy : the speech he made as an Illinois state senator in late 2002 , opposing the then looming Iraq war , and his breathtaking " one nation " keynote address to the Democratic convention two years later , that turned him into an overnight national sensation .
And oratory is a vital part of the presidential arsenal .
If ever Americans needed a politician with the power to uplift them , it is now .
At 47 , Obama would not in fact be the youngest president ; Teddy Roosevelt was a mere 42 in September 1901 , and Kennedy and Clinton himself were both younger when they entered the White House .
But all three were much better known ; Roosevelt was vice - president when he took over , Kennedy had been a congressman and then a senator for eight years , while Clinton had served 12 years as governor of Arkansas .
More even than his race , Obama 's lack of experience – especially in McCain 's strongest suit of foreign affairs – was a problem for many voters .
But the debates removed those doubts .
Franklin Roosevelt , who in 1933 also took over at a desperate economic hour , was famously said to have had a second - class intellect but a first - class temperament .
In three presidential debates , Obama proved he was top class in both departments .
Not only was he master of every subject , he was also also cool , smiling and unflappable , never rising to the bait of some vicious jibes from McCain .
He did n't grandstand , he did n't produce slick one - liners and – miracle – you could see him actually thinking before he answered a question .
If Americans were looking for the opposite of Bush , they had found their man .
McCain , it must be said , did not help his cause .
The old John McCain had a temper , certainly , but also a refreshing irreverence and a great sense of humour .
In the debates , however , he came across as a grumpy old man , rude , condescending and scornful of his opponent .
Americans did n't like it when Al Gore got condescending with George W Bush in 2000 , and they did n't like it now .
Polls found Obama the victor in all three debates and , over and over again , people have told me : " I used to really like John McCain , but not any more , he just does n't seem very nice . "
In US election campaigns , where a candidate 's likeability is at least as important as his policies , there are few more damning judgements .
They also did n't much care for it when McCain , who in past campaigns made a point of taking the high road , took the low one against Obama .
Normally , going negative works wonders ( just ask Bush father and son ) but not this year .
The veiled racial attacks on Obama , Sarah Palin 's charge that he once " palled around with terrorists " , the insinuations that he was not a patriotic American but a Muslims , all turned people off .
As has been pointed out above , in 2008 voters are serious .
The choice of Palin , at first a seeming masterstroke , has also backfired .
The base adores her but many conservative commentators , centrist Republicans and all - important independents were appalled .
Her selection , after a bare minimum of vetting , added to the image of the 72 - year - old McCain as a reckless gambler .
McCain the patriot seemed this time to be putting his career ahead of his country .
In truth of course , nothing can prepare a person for the presidency .
That indeed is one of the best arguments for the numbing length of campaigns .
They are huge enterprises in their own right .
At the very least , voters can get a sense of how the candidate performs under pressure , for the very highest of political stakes .
By common consent , Obama has run the best campaign in memory .
He has made remarkably few blunders .
He has had cringe - making moments – who would n't in a 21 - month political marathon ?
In one primary debate , he unsmilingly told Hillary Clinton she was " likeable enough " , and he was caught on tape at a high - end San Francisco fund - raiser talking patronisingly of how poor whites in places like Pennsylvania " clung to " guns and God because life was so tough for them .
Not surprisingly , these voters went overwhelmingly for Hillary in the primaries .
But now those sins seem to have been forgiven .
The Clinton supporters who once vowed to vote for McCain rather than Obama are now mostly back in the fold ( driven by Sarah Palin ) .
McCain has tried to brand Obama as a traditional tax - and - spend liberal , a charge that usually works in a country where self - described conservatives outnumber avowed liberals almost two to one and a third of voters call themselves independents .
But it resonates less right now , when the hallowed free market has delivered a disaster , and when scared citizens want more government , not less , to see them through the tempest .
With Democrats set to make big gains in both the Senate and House which they already control , McCain warns of the perils of placing every lever of power in Washington in the hands of one party .
But in times of peril , Americans are apt to do exactly that – as they did in 1932 , a watershed election if ever there was one , and whose grim economic backdrop has uncanny similarities with today .
This time , Americans seem to be saying , divided government is not the answer .
The real wonder is that , despite everything – his age , his daunting financial disadvantage , the ideological bankruptcy of his party , the record unpopularity of an incumbent Republican president , the meltdown of the economy and the tarnished image of the US abroad – John McCain is still in the game at all .
But the ancient warrior is making a fight of it .
Though Obama is well ahead in several of the swing states that will decide the election , his lead is shrinking at a national level .
Democrats are petrified that once again their opponents will find some means , fair or foul , to deny them .
Ultimately , we are left with the questions that hung in the icy air of Springfield 21 months ago .
Despite his fine showing in the debates , will the country really place its trust in a comparative novice , even one as gifted and charismatic as Barack Obama ?
And then there is the mystery that no poll yet has convincingly resolved .
Is the US ready to send an African - American to the White House ?
The answer , I think , is yes – but even now I 'm not certain .

A man walks into a restaurant with a full - grown ostrich behind him .
The waitress asks them for their orders .
The man says , ' A hamburger , fries and a coke , ' and turns to the ostrich , ' What 's yours ? '
' I 'll have the same , ' says the ostrich .
A short time later the waitress returns with the order ' That will be $ 9.40 please , ' and the man reaches into his pocket and pulls out the exact change for payment .
The next day , the man and the ostrich come again and the man says , ' A hamburger , fries and a coke '
The ostrich says , ' I 'll have the same . '
Again the man reaches into his pocket and pays with exact change .
This becomes routine until the two enter again .
' The usual ? ' asks the waitress .
' No , this is Friday night , so I will have a steak , baked potato and a salad , ' says the man .
' Same , ' says the ostrich .
Shortly the waitress brings the order and says , ' That will be $ 32.62 . '
Once again the man pulls the exact change out of his pocket and places it on the table .
The waitress cannot hold back her curiosity any longer .
' Excuse me , sir .
How do you manage to always come up with the exact change in your pocket every time ?
' Well , ' says the man , ' several years ago I was cleaning the attic and found an old lamp .
When I rubbed it , a Genie apeared and offered me two wishes .
My first wish was that if I ever had to pay for anything , I would just put my hand in my pocket and the right amount of money would always be there . '
' That 's brilliant ! ' says the waitress .
Most people would ask for a million dollars or something , but you 'll always be as rich as you want for as long as you live .
It 's brilliant !'
' That 's right .
Whether it's a gallon of milk or a Rolls Royce , the exact amount of money is always there , ' says the man .
The waitress asks , ' What 's with the ostrich ? '
The man sighs , pauses and answers , ' My second wish was for a tall chick with a big butt and long legs who agrees with everything I say . '

( Newser ) – The ranks of the unemployed reached their highest levels since 1982 last week , and about 30 states are running out of money to fund them , the New York Times reports .
Some states , including Indiana and Michigan , are already borrowing heavily from the federal government to keep up with jobless benefits , and some are alarmed .
“ You do n’t expect the loans to happen this early in a jobs slump , ” says one advocate for low - wage workers .
“ You would expect that states should have savings . ”
But many do n’t , particularly those that cut unemployment taxes in good times , and now fear raising them .
“ Frankly , they created the perfect storm , ” said an Indiana unemployment official .
California , New York , Ohio , and Rhode Island are among the other states that are inching toward insolvency , says the Times .
Burning through $ 11 million a week , South Carolina recently requested a $ 15 million loan .
“ We have never experienced anything like this , ” says one official .

LONDON -- The New England Patriots will play the Tampa Bay Buccaneers next season at Wembley Stadium , the third straight year the NFL will stage a regular - season game in the British capital .
The game will be played Oct. 25 .
The Bucs will be listed as the home team , giving up a game in Tampa .
" Over the past two years , we have seen first - hand the excitement that exists for our sport in the UK , " NFL commissioner Roger Goodell said Monday in a statement .
" The games have helped us to deepen our connection with our UK fans as well as create new ones .
We are looking forward to another outstanding game in 2009 . "
Five weeks ago , the New Orleans Saints beat the San Diego Chargers 37 - 32 before 83,000 fans at Wembley .
Last season , the New York Giants defeated the Miami Dolphins 13 - 10 .
Both games were sold out .
The NFL is also expected to play a regular - season game in London in 2010 .
The Buccaneers are owned by the Glazer family , the same group that runs defending Premier League champion Manchester United .
" The Tampa Bay Buccaneers organization is extremely excited and honored to be chosen to participate in the NFL international series , " Buccaneers executive vice president Joel Glazer said .
" We look forward to being part of the NFL 's global outreach and playing our great game in front of Buccaneers fans overseas . "
The Patriots and Buccaneers have combined to win four of the past seven Super Bowls , although New England lost to the Giants in last season 's title game .
The Patriots won the Super Bowl following the 2001 , '03 and ' 04 seasons , while the Bucs won the championship after the ' 02 season .
" We have had a lot of memorable moments in recent years , " Patriots chairman Robert Kraft said .
" I think it is fitting that New England 's first game to be played outside of North America will be in England .
I know that the UK is home to some of our most passionate Patriots fans and we look forward to the experience . "
The New York Times Company said Monday it had reached an agreement with the Mexican billionaire Carlos Slim Helú for a $ 250 million loan intended to help the newspaper company finance its businesses .
Under the terms of the deal , Mr. Slim , who already owns 6.9 percent of the Times Company , would invest $ 250 million in the form of six - year notes with warrants that are convertible into common shares , the company said in a statement .
The notes also carry a 14 percent interest rate , with 11 percent paid in cash and 3 percent in additional bonds .
The deal comes as the Times Company looks to raise money amid flagging advertising sales and approaching deadlines to pay back $ 1.1 billion in debt in the next few years .
The company will use the proceeds from the transaction to refinance its existing debt .
One of its two $ 400 million revolving credit lines is set to expire in May .
The $ 250 million investment should help free some of the company ’s borrowing capacity .
Overall 158 tests have been submitted as part of TestFest 2008 since the launch of the TestFest submission site by 30 different people from people all over the world .
Actually this is not counting the various submissions by existing core developers , who also took this opportunity to add some more tests .
This has actually increased total test coverage for ext / reflection , ext / dom and ext / exif by about 10 % each .
While the organization of the TestFest was a bit adhoc , there were numerous TestFest events in local user groups .
So the number of people exposed to the PHP test framework is much greater .
Hopefully this will lead to more people submitting bug reports with an accompanying phpt test file !
Our top submitter Felix De Vliegher has actually committed his last submissions himself since , based on the high quality of his submissions , he has been granted commit rights to the PHP repository .
We have not heard back from all participants , but we encourage everybody to blog about their experience and provide us with feedback on how to improve future events .
Now better late than never , here are the 10 winners of the promised elePHPant raffle sponsored by Nexen .
Note that Felix asked me not to include him in the raffle , since he is already herding quite a number of elePHPants at home .
Eric Stewart
Håvard Eide
Marc Veldman
Michelangelo van Dam

We will provide Nexen with the email addresses of the winners , so that they can arrange to get the elePHPants shipped .
Also for those people wondering , you can continue to submit tests on the TestFest submission site .
A bit thank you to all participants and TestFest organizers !
Without the countless people that helped organize local events , implement the infrastructure and submissions reviewers , the TestFest would have obviously not worked out as well as it has .
We will surely do similar events in the future based on the big success of TestFest 2008 .
More than 25,000 elderly die of cold as fuel poverty hits one in four pensioner households
The Government is failing to tackle winter deaths which result from fuel poverty , Help the Aged has said
Last winter 's cold weather claimed more than 25,000 lives - the highest for four years , a report revealed yesterday .
The deaths , which came amid soaring fuel costs , were up 7 per cent on the previous year and are the highest in Europe .
The vast majority - 22,400 - were among pensioners , millions of whom are in fuel poverty , having to choose between heating and eating .
Charities said the deaths were a ' national scandal ' and warned that this winter , which is forecast to be colder , would see even more deaths .
Gas costs have surged by 50 per cent in a year and electricity by a third , adding around £ 400 to annual bills .
A survey by Age Concern found two - thirds of pensioners are cutting back on the amount of gas and electricity they are using .
On Monday , Chancellor Alistair Darling announced an extra £ 60 at Christmas to help with winter fuel payments for pensioners – but campaigners said it was not enough .
Gordon Lishman , of Age Concern , said : ' Pensioners are clearly more worried about staying warm and well this year .
Yet , the impact of increased energy bills is causing thousands to risk their health by cutting back on heating .'
The figures , from the Office for National Statistics , show that between December and March , there were 25,300 more deaths in England and Wales when compared with the rest of the year .
Winter deaths are often as a result of heart attacks , strokes , bronchial and other conditions and may occur several days after exposure to the cold .
The UN says Israeli shells struck three hospitals on Thursday , including al - Quds
By Heather Sharp
BBC News , Jerusalem
Dr Waleed Abu Ramadan sighs down the phone .
The medical director of al - Quds hospital has not wept since he helped evacuate several hundred people from the blazing Palestinian Red Crescent ( PRC ) compound on Thursday night , but he says : " My heart is crying . "
He says he is standing next to the smouldering remains of a pharmacy filled with bandages , medicines and other medical supplies , describing the chaos as intensive care patients and premature babies were wheeled onto the street .
The compound was hit twice during heavy fighting between Israeli forces and Hamas militants in the Tel al - Hawa district in the west of Gaza City .
Patients were seen struggling to get out of their hospital beds
In the first incident , in the morning , the administrative building next to the hospital was hit and burst into flames .
Patients were evacuated " in panic " to the ground floor , the PRC said .
At about 2200 ( 2000 GMT ) , a second building housing offices and a lecture theatre was hit .
Fire spread to the roof of the hospital itself , the PRC said .
' Utter panic '
The decision was taken to evacuate dozens of patients , together with medical staff and several hundred people from the surrounding area who had taken shelter in the compound .
An AFP photographer on location described scenes of " utter panic " as wounded people tried to struggle from their hospital beds .
" It was complete darkness in the street , " says Dr Ramadan .
" Our medical staff were pulling beds and running .
It was difficult , very scary .
There was some shooting .
It was cold , very cold , " he adds .
We are in the streets , the hospital is not working .
How do you think we feel ?
Dr Ramadan " Maybe 15 beds we pulled out - and there were people on foot with terrible injuries , " he says .
It was 30 minutes before even the most vulnerable patients , including three premature babies , were picked up in ambulances and transferred to Gaza 's Shifa hospital .
" Four patients were in intensive care , connected to the machines - the staff were doing manual ventilation with oxygen bags .
The patients would die if they did n't do this , " he says .
" The premature babies , we took them with the incubators , " he adds .
" It was a risk for everybody to go on the street like this , " he says , but none of the patients suffered complications , " thank God " .
Staff from the hospital say they do not know exactly what hit the building , but the UN has said Israeli tank shells struck three hospitals , including al - Quds , in Thursday 's fighting .
A medic holds the remains of an Israeli shell after it hit the al - Quds hospital A UN compound and a building housing journalists were also hit .
" It was really a disaster , it was scary and frightening , " said Dr Ramadan .
" There is a lot of damage , we can't use the hospital at all .
I do n't know how much time it will take before we can start using it again .
" This is our job .
Now we are in the streets , the hospital is not working .
How do you think we feel ?
We are really depressed . "
The Israeli military has not yet responded to this particular incident , but it says it seeks to minimise civilian casualties and blames Hamas for using civilians as human shields .

It 's amazing how many layers you can actually build .
It always starts with a good intention - building a sustainable and maintainable architecture .
Nothing wrong with that , but the question is how the requirement for sustainability is actually realized .
Many J2EE architectures tried to encapsulate every possible technological and functional aspect and variation .
Just read the origin DAO - problem statement .
A DAO was even intended to encapsulate different data stores like LDAP , flat files , or object oriented databases .
But how likely is it , that your project will switch from a relational database to flat file ?
Rather unlikely for a corporate project , a little bit more likely for a product .
The attempt to encapsulate such technology did n't worked very well in the past .
Its harder , than you might think to provide a good abstraction .
E.g. a DAO worked with detached ( " Value Objects " ) Data Transfer Objects .
Every change to these objects , even in the same transaction context , had to be merged back .
This is no more necessary in JPA - world .
The problem here : often not only the implementation , but the whole paradigm changes .
Then your hardly crafted abstraction becomes superfluous .
The same can happen with separation of infrastructure / plumbing code , and domain logic .
It was the driving force of many EJB 2.1 applications .
EJB 2.X were " polluted " with the infrastructural code , so that you had to build Business Delegates , POJO Facades etc .
With the advent of EJB 3 ( highly influenced by Hibernate , Ruby On Rails and Spring ) , all the infrastructural code became hidden behind the framework .
Not only the dependency are inverted right now , but especially the patterns and best practices as well .
You are basically coding against POJOs , so there is nothing more left to encapsulate ...
It is hardly possible , actually impossible , to abstract from paradigms .
Another sample is the command pattern .
You could implement a command using java.lang .
Runnable implementing the run ( ) method , or in distributed environment with javax.jms .
MessageListener or MessageDrivenBeans in particular .
The problem is : a distributed system hardly behaves like a local one ( see : Note On Distributed Computing ) .
So JMS throws a lot of exceptions , is transactional and you have to deal with poisoned messages .
So it will be hard to provide a good abstraction for JMS and Threads with the same interface / contract .
Such an abstraction will be always leaky .
Actually there is a theory about Leaky Abstractions , even with some philosophical sense .
It basically says : " All non-trivial abstractions , to some degree , are leaky . "
Knowing that , you have only two choices for building suistainable architectures :
If you have a lot of experience in technology and domain logic : build good , tight abstractions and encapsulations upfront .
Try to build as lean as possible architecture and get rid of as many superfluous artifacts ( patterns , layers whatever ) as only possible .
But if you notice , that you are duplicating code , or you are going to be dependent on a specific implementation , provide a good encapsulation and test it .
So start with essential things and best practices and let your architecture evolve .
It 's just common sense ...
Both strategies are perfectly valid and can be extremely productive .
But if you are not entirely sure about your skills , go with 2 :-) .
I do n't think that , The Premature Optimization Is The Root Of All Evil in Java EE projects is the real problem , rather than too many superfluous layers , tiers , indirections and distributions .
[ See also " Real World Java EE Patterns , Rethinking Best Practices " book , Page 253 , for more in - depth discussion ]
Do you have a cat who loves to jump on your kitchen counter and eat your plant ?
If so , you have a couple of solutions .
You could do something mild , like putting double - sided tape on the counters to deter it .
Or , if you 're more adventurous , you could set up a motion detector that 's set to turn on a strobe light and a blender when your cat makes the jump , scaring the crap out of it until it learns its lesson .
Guess which one we have videos of after the jump ?
Yes , this guy actually did that , at a cost of $ 214 to himself .
However , I think the videos are obviously worth the expense and effort .
I only wish they had sound .
He 's still running the thing , and he says he 'll keep posting videos as he makes them until the cat either learns its lesson or has a heart attack and dies .
[ Blender Defender ]
The camera itself is one of the cheapest network cameras out there , the DCS - 900 .
It can be picked up for about $ 120 or so .
There are a couple network cameras that are a little cheaper , but the D - Link one is pretty rugged and makes it easy to get into the raw feeds , something that cant be said for many other cameras .
As you can see from the videos above , the blender and the strobe light are both controlled by an X10 unit .
The unit is sent an on or off command from the computer running upstairs by means of an X10 Firecracker .
The Firecracker is just a wireless X10 transmitter that plugs into your serial port .
I wont get into explaining it much here , but one thing to note is that is happily co-exists with my CM11A unit .
The computer upstairs is running the ' motion ' library for linux .
As soon as it detects something moving on camera , it starts recording frames .
While it is saving frames , it also initiates another Perl script I wrote that sends an X10 command to turn on the blender and strobe , wait 3 seconds , then turn them off .
After the script is done detecting motion , it then splices all the JPG frames together using ffmpeg and saves the resulting movie as a SWF file , which you can see above .
Finally , after it saves the movie , I have it set up to email me a link to the movie so I can see the results from where ever I 'm at ( remotely by using my phone ) .
The Defenders of Wildlife , critical of Alaska Governor Sarah Palin ’s record on the aerial killing of wolves , has expanded the viewing audience of its newest television ad .
The ad , first released for certain markets in Florida , Michigan and Ohio , will now be airing in Colorado , Virginia and Wisconsin .
The AP reports that the wildlife group is also expanding the reach of the provocative ad so that it will air in Missouri in time for Thursday ’s vice presidential debate in St. Louis .

Anheuser - Busch InBev , the brewery behind Budweiser , is to cut 1,400 jobs in the US - 6 % of its American workforce - to help it save $ 1.5 bn ( £ 1 bn ) a year .
Three - quarters of the cuts will be made at Anheuser 's headquarters in St Louis , and will go beyond plans that the company announced this summer to streamline costs before it agreed to a takeover by Belgium - based brewer InBev .
The firm said the job losses will help it cope with a " challenging economy . "
Most of the cuts will happen by the end of the year .
Anheuser - Busch provides half of the beer drunk in the US , but the company has not managed to expand globally as fast as the Belgian - Brazilian hybrid InBev , which owns hundreds of local brands but few big names .
Beer sales in both the US and Europe are slowly declining .
InBev wrapped up its $ 52bn takeover of Anheuser - Busch last month .
Anheuser had 8,600 salaried workers this summer , and had planned to reduce that by 10 - 15 % , mostly by offering 1,000 employees voluntary early retirement .
That plan was meant to save the brewer $ 1bn a year .
The latest cuts mean the brewer will lose a quarter of the workers it had at the start of 2008 .
More than 250 unfilled jobs will be cut , along with 415 contractor positions .
Around a quarter of job cuts will be in field and brewery locations , it said .
" To keep the business strong and competitive , this is a necessary but difficult move for the company , " said Anheuser - Busch president David A Peacock .
Workers who form part of a trade union at the company 's 12 North American breweries will not be affected .
In Bev pledged not to close any of the breweries as long as it was not forced to pay any extra taxes .
The redundancies will cost the company $ 197 m , mostly in severance payments and pension benefits .
InBev is known for tight cost control since its formation in a 2004 merger between Brazil 's AmBev and Belgium 's Interbrew .
The Brazilian management team who headed the company had a sharp focus on costs which was said to have come as a shock to the European business
Editor ’s note :
In light of the recent fighting in Gaza , Truthdig asked Chris Hedges , who covered the Mideast for The New York Times for seven years , to update a previous column on Gaza .
Can anyone who is following the Israeli air attacks on Gaza — the buildings blown to rubble , the children killed on their way to school , the long rows of mutilated corpses , the wailing mothers and wives , the crowds of terrified Palestinians not knowing where to flee , the hospitals so overburdened and out of supplies they cannot treat the wounded , and our studied , callous indifference to this widespread human suffering — wonder why we are hated ?
Our self - righteous celebration of ourselves and our supposed virtue is as false as that of Israel .
We have become monsters , militarized bullies , heartless and savage .
We are a party to human slaughter , a flagrant war crime , and do nothing .
We forget that the innocents who suffer and die in Gaza are a reflection of ourselves , of how we might have been should fate and time and geography have made the circumstances of our birth different .
We forget that we are all absurd and vulnerable creatures .
We all have the capacity to fear and hate and love .
“ Expose thyself to what wretches feel , ” King Lear said , entering the mud and straw hovel of Poor Tom , “ and show the heavens more just . ”
Privilege and power , especially military power , is a dangerous narcotic .
Violence destroys those who bear the brunt of its force , but also those who try to use it to become gods .
Over 350 Palestinians have been killed , many of them civilians , and over 1,000 have been wounded since the air attacks began on Saturday .
Ehud Barak , Israel ’s defense minister , said Israel is engaged in a “ war to the bitter end ” against Hamas in Gaza .
A war ?
Israel uses sophisticated attack jets and naval vessels to bomb densely crowded refugee camps and slums , to attack a population that has no air force , no air defense , no navy , no heavy weapons , no artillery units , no mechanized armor , no command and control , no army , and calls it a war .
It is not a war .
It is murder .
The U.N. special rapporteur for human rights in the occupied Palestinian territory , former Princeton University law professor Richard Falk , has labeled what Israel is doing to the 1.5 million Palestinians in Gaza “ a crime against humanity . ”
Falk , who is Jewish , has condemned the collective punishment of the Palestinians in Gaza as “ a flagrant and massive violation of international humanitarian law as laid down in Article 33 of the Fourth Geneva Convention . ”
He has asked for “ the International Criminal Court to investigate the situation , and determine whether the Israeli civilian leaders and military commanders responsible for the Gaza siege should be indicted and prosecuted for violations of international criminal law . ”
Falk ’s unflinching honesty has enraged Israel .
He was banned from entering the country on Dec. 14 during his attempt to visit Gaza and the West Bank .
“ After being denied entry I was put in a holding room with about 20 others experiencing entry problems , ” he said .
“ At this point I was treated not as a U.N. representative , but as some sort of security threat , subjected to an inch - by - inch body search , and the most meticulous luggage inspection I have ever witnessed .
I was separated from my two U.N. companions , who were allowed to enter Israel .
At this point I was taken to the airport detention facility a mile or so away , required to put all my bags and cell phone in a room , taken to a locked , tiny room that had five other detainees , smelled of urine and filth , and was an unwelcome invitation to claustrophobia .
I spent the next 15 hours so confined , which amounted to a cram course on the miseries of prison life , including dirty sheets , inedible food , and either lights that were too bright or darkness controlled from the guard office . ”
The foreign press has been , like Falk , barred by Israel from entering Gaza to report on the destruction .
Israel ’s stated aim of halting homemade rockets fired from Gaza into Israel remains unfulfilled .
Gaza militants have fired more than 100 rockets and mortars into Israel , killing four people and wounding nearly two dozen more , since Israel unleashed its air assault .
Israel has threatened to launch a ground assault and has called up 6,500 army reservists .
It has massed tanks on the Gaza border and declared the area a closed military zone .
The rocket attacks by Hamas are , as Falk points out , also criminal violations of international law .
But as Falk notes , “… such Palestinian behavior does not legalize Israel ’s imposition of a collective punishment of a life - and health - threatening character on the people of Gaza , and should not distract the U.N. or international society from discharging their fundamental moral and legal duty to render protection to the Palestinian people . ”
“ It is an unfolding humanitarian catastrophe that each day poses the entire 1.5 million Gazans to an unspeakable ordeal , to a struggle to survive in terms of their health , ” Falk has said of the ongoing Israeli blockade of Gaza .
“ This is an increasingly precarious condition .
A recent study reports that 46 percent of all Gazan children suffer from acute anemia .
There are reports that the sonic booms associated with Israeli overflights have caused widespread deafness , especially among children .
Gazan children need thousands of hearing aids .
Malnutrition is extremely high in a number of different dimensions and affects 75 percent of Gazans .
There are widespread mental disorders , especially among young people without the will to live .
Over 50 percent of Gazan children under the age of 12 have been found to have no will to live . ”
Before the air assaults , Gaza spent 12 hours a day without power , which can be a death sentence to the severely ill in hospitals .
Most of Gaza is now without power .
There are few drugs and little medicine , including no cancer or cystic fibrosis medication .
Hospitals have generators but often lack fuel .
Medical equipment , including one of Gaza ’s three CT scanners , has been destroyed by power surges and fluctuations .
Medical staff cannot control the temperature of incubators for newborns .
And Israel has revoked most exit visas , meaning some of those who need specialized care , including cancer patients and those in need of kidney dialysis , have died .
Of the 230 Gazans estimated to have died last year because they were denied proper medical care , several spent their final hours at Israeli crossing points where they were refused entry into Israel .
The statistics gathered on children — half of Gaza ’s population is under the age of 17 — are increasingly grim .
About 45 percent of children in Gaza have iron deficiency from a lack of fruit and vegetables , and 18 percent have stunted growth .
“ It is macabre , ” Falk said of the blockade .
“ I do n’t know of anything that exactly fits this situation .
People have been referring to the Warsaw ghetto as the nearest analog in modern times . ”
“ There is no structure of an occupation that endured for decades and involved this kind of oppressive circumstances , ” the rapporteur added .
“ The magnitude , the deliberateness , the violations of international humanitarian law , the impact on the health , lives and survival and the overall conditions warrant the characterization of a crime against humanity .
This occupation is the direct intention by the Israeli military and civilian authorities .
They are responsible and should be held accountable . ”
The point of the Israeli attack , ostensibly , is to break Hamas , the radical Islamic group that was elected to power in 2007 .
But Hamas has repeatedly proposed long - term truces with Israel and offered to negotiate a permanent truce .
During the last cease - fire , established through Egyptian intermediaries in July , Hamas upheld the truce although Israel refused to ease the blockade .
It was Israel that , on Nov. 4 , initiated an armed attack that violated the truce and killed six Palestinians .
It was only then that Hamas resumed firing rockets at Israel .
“ This is a crime of survival , ” Falk said of the rocket attacks by Palestinians .
“ Israel has put the Gazans in a set of circumstances where they either have to accept whatever is imposed on them or resist in any way available to them .
That is a horrible dilemma to impose upon a people .
This does not alleviate the Palestinians , and Gazans in particular , for accountability for doing these acts involving rocket fire , but it also imposes some responsibility on Israel for creating these circumstances . ”
Israel seeks to break the will of the Palestinians to resist .
The Israeli government has demonstrated little interest in diplomacy or a peaceful solution .
The rapid expansion of Jewish settlements on the West Bank is an effort to thwart the possibility of a two - state solution by gobbling up vast tracts of Palestinian real estate .
Israel also appears to want to thrust the impoverished Gaza Strip onto Egypt .
Dozens of tunnels had been the principal means for food and goods , connecting Gaza to Egypt .
Israel had permitted the tunnels to operate , most likely as part of an effort to further cut Gaza off from Israel .
This ended , however , on Sunday when Israeli fighter jets bombed over 40 tunnels along Gaza ’s border with Egypt .
The Israeli military said that the tunnels , on the Gaza side of the border , were used for smuggling weapons , explosives and fugitives .
Egypt has sealed its border and refused to let distraught Palestinians enter its territory .
“ Israel , all along , has not been prepared to enter into diplomatic process that gives the Palestinians a viable state , ” Falk said .
“ They [ the Israelis ] feel time is on their side .
They feel they can create enough facts on the ground so people will come to the conclusion a viable state cannot emerge . ”
The use of terror and hunger to break a hostile population is one of the oldest forms of warfare .
I watched the Bosnian Serbs employ the same tactic in Sarajevo .
Those who orchestrate such sieges do not grasp the terrible rage born of long humiliation , indiscriminate violence and abuse .
A father or a mother whose child dies because of a lack of vaccines or proper medical care does not forget .
A boy whose ill grandmother dies while detained at an Israel checkpoint does not forget .
A family that loses a child in an airstrike does not forget .
All who endure humiliation , abuse and the murder of family members do not forget .
This rage becomes a virus within those who , eventually , stumble out into the daylight .
Is it any wonder that 71 percent of children interviewed at a school in Gaza recently said they wanted to be a “ martyr ” ?
The Israelis in Gaza , like the American forces in Iraq and Afghanistan , are foolishly breeding the next generation of militants and Islamic radicals .
Jihadists , enraged by the injustices done by Israel and the United States , seek to carry out reciprocal acts of savagery , even at the cost of their own lives .
The violence unleashed on Palestinian children will , one day , be the violence unleashed on Israeli children .
This is the tragedy of Gaza .
This is the tragedy of Israel .
September 1 , 2020 , The Guardian : Khoja Zada found his son around noon ; his body was under layers of rubble and mud .
The rain had stopped and the sun was shining again when the 70 - year - old dug him out .
At midnight , he buried him again .
Less than a week after flash floods killed at least 116 people – including Zada ’s 35 - year - old son – and injured 120 more in Charikar , the capital of Afghanistan ’s Parwan province , Zada ’s house lies destroyed , each room filled almost to the ceiling with what is now dry mud .
The tragedy over the melamine tainted milk scandal in China continues .
Not only have six young Chinese children died from kidney stones and more than 290,000 made ill from melamine - contaminated milk formula , but now a Chinese court has issued death sentences for two men involved in the contaminated milk scandal .
The two men are executives from Sanlu Group , a Chinese firm that hid reports of deaths and sicknesses caused by formula that contained melamine .
Tian Wenhua , the former general manager of Sanlu Group , has plead guilty to charges of “ producing and selling fake or substandard products ” .
She has been sentenced to life in prison .
China is responding to the melamine crisis with strict sentences , as well as production controls .
According to Reuters , the Chinese government hopes to reduce the number of melamine producers :
The Ministry of Industry and Information Technology has circulated for comment draft production permit rules aiming to stem a melamine production glut and stop it from tainting food , the China Chemical Industry News reported .
Melamine is used to maker fertilizers , plastics and other industrial goods but gained notoriety as a cheap additive for milk and other foods .
Rich in nitrogen , melamine can be used to fool tests for protein .
[ social_buttons ]
I do not support the death penalty .
As a parent , I may feel differently if my child had died from melamine formula ; however , on principle I feel such sentences will not deter other corporations from putting children ’s health at risk in the name of profit .
Many product recalls in the United States do result in deaths , such as the recent peanut butter recall , but these executives are not sentenced to death .
Granted , the Chinese Sanlu executives are charged with hiding the deaths , thus causing more children to be sick from the melamine formula , but is the death penalty justified ?
Is China issuing capital punishment sentences just to demonstrate to the world they take food contamination serious ?
Capital punishment does not deter crime :
Scientific studies have consistently failed to demonstrate that executions deter people from committing crime anymore than long prison sentences .
Moreover , states without the death penalty have much lower murder rates .
The South accounts for 80 % of U.S. executions and has the highest regional murder rate .
Meanwhile , the deaths from melamine have not ended in China .
On Sunday , a two - month - old boy died after being fed with milk formula made by a Guangdong milk company in eastern Zhejiang province .
It seems the issue of tainted food causing deaths in children will not end as a result of this harsh sentencing .

We 've all been there :
You 're tracking down some evil bug , and you have the sudden chilling realization that you 're going to have to refactor an enormous chunk of code to fix it .
You break out in a cold sweat as you run a quick grep over the source base : hundreds of lines of code to change !
And the change is too complex to do with a script because it depends on the calling context , or requires adding a new variable to every caller .
This happened to me last month when I was adding support for 64 - bit file systems to e2fsprogs .
I thought I was nearly finished when I discovered I needed to write ( yet another ) new interface and convert ( yet another ) several hundred lines of code to it .
The changes were complex enough that I could n't use a script , and simple enough that I wanted to claw my eyes out with the soul - killing boredom of doing it by hand .
That 's when the maintainer , Theodore Ts'o , suggested I look at Coccinelle ( a.k.a. , spatch ) .
Coccinelle

struct inode_operations
Coccinelle is a tool to automatically analyze and rewrite C code .
Coccinelle ( pronounced cock ' - see - nel ) means " ladybug " in French , a name chosen because ladybugs eat other bugs .
Coccinelle is not just another scripting language ; it is aware of the structure of the C language and can make much more complex changes than are possible with pure string processing .
For example , Coccinelle can make a particular change only in functions which are assigned to a function pointer in a particular type of array — say , themember of
The input to the tool is the file (s ) to be changed and a " semantic patch , " written in SmPL ( Semantic Patch Language ) .
SmPL looks a like a unified diff ( a patch ) with some C - like declarations mixed in .
Here 's an example :
@@ expression E ; identifier fld ; @@ - !E && !E -> fld + !E || !E->fld
--- a/drivers/pci/hotplug/cpqphp_ctrl.c
+++ b/drivers/pci/hotplug/cpqphp_ctrl.c @@ - 1139,7 +1139,7 @@ static u8 set_controller_speed ( struct controller * ctrl , u8 adapter_speed , u8 hp_ for ( slot = ctrl -> slot ; slot ; slot = slot -> next ) { if ( slot - > device == ( hp_slot + ctrl->slot_device_offset ) ) continue ; - if ( ! slot->hotplug_slot && !slot->hotplug_slot->info ) + if (! slot->hotplug_slot || ! slot->hotplug_slot -> info ) continue ; if ( slot->hotplug_slot ->info->adapter_status == 0 ) continue ;
This semantic patch fixes the bug in which the pointer is tested for NULL — and then dereferenced if the pointer is NULL .
An example of a bug this semantic patch found in the Linux kernel ( and automatically generated the fix for ) : ( More on the semantic patch format later . )
Coccinelle is designed , written , and maintained by Julia Lawall at the Department of Computer Science at University of Copenhagen , Gilles Muller and Yoann Padioleau at the Ecole des Mines de Nantes , and René Rydhof Hansen at the Department of Computer Science of Aalborg University .
Coccinelle is licensed under the GPL , however , it is written in OCaml , so the potential developer base is somewhat limited .
The original goal of Coccinelle was to automate as much as possible the task of keeping device drivers up to date with the latest kernel interfaces .
But the end result can do far more than that , including finding and fixing bugs and coding style irregularities .
Over 180 patches created using Coccinelle have been accepted into the Linux kernel to date .
Coccinelle quickstart
Like many languages , SmPL is best learned through example .
We 'll run through one simple example here just to get started .
After that , the Coccinelle web page has some documentation and a plethora of examples
First , download Coccinelle and install it .
I used the source version rather than any of the precompiled options .
The Coccinelle binary is called spatch .
As our example , say we have program with a lot of calls to alloca ( ) that we would like to replace with malloc ( ) . alloca ( ) allocates space on the stack and can be more efficient and convenient than malloc ( ) , but it is also compiler - dependent , non-standard , easy to use incorrectly , and has undefined behavior on failure .
( Replacing alloca ( ) with malloc ( ) is n't enough , we also have to check the return value — but that will come later . )
Here is the C file we are working on :
#include < alloca .h > int main ( int argc , char * argv [ ] ) { unsigned int bytes = 1024 * 1024 ; char * buf ; /* allocate memory */ buf = alloca ( bytes ) ; return 0 ; }
sed
$ sed - i 's /alloca/ malloc / g ' test.c
--- test .c +++ /tmp/test.c @@ - 1,4 +1,4 @@ -#include < alloca.h > +#include < malloc.h > int main ( int argc , char * argv[ ] ) @@ - 6,8 +6,8 @@ unsigned int bytes = 1024 * 1024 ; char * buf ; - /* allocate memory */ - buf = alloca ( bytes ) ; + /* mallocte memory */ + buf = malloc ( bytes ) ; return 0 ; }
$ sed - i 's /alloca( / malloc ( / g ' test.c
sed
We could make the replacement using a scripting language likeBut this will replace the string " alloca " anywhere it appears .
The resulting diff : We can tweak our script to handle 90 % of the cases :
But this script does n't handle the case where a second function name has the first as a suffix , it depends on a particular coding style in which no white space comes between the function name and the open parenthesis , etc. , etc .
By now our simplescript is a hundred - character monster .
It can be done , but it 's a pain .
In Coccinelle , we 'd use the following semantic patch :
@@ expression E ; @@ - alloca( E ) +malloc(E )
test.c
test.cocci
$ spatch - sp_file test.cocci test.c
--- test .c +++ /tmp/cocci-output-17416-b5450d-test.c @@ - 7,7 +7,7 @@ main ( int argc , char * argv[ ] ) char * buf ; /* allocate memory */ - buf = alloca ( bytes ) ; + buf = malloc ( bytes ) ; return 0 ; }

Put the C file inand the above semantic patch inand run it like so :
It should produce the following diff : Let 's look at the semantic patch line by line .
This declares the " metavariable " E as a variable that can match any expression — e.g. , .
When spatch processes the input , it sets the value of E to the argument to .
The " " syntax is chosen to resemble the line in a unified diff describing the lines to be patched .
I do n't find the resemblance particularly helpful , but the intention is well - taken .
This line says to remove any call to the function , and to save its argument in the metavariable E for later use .
And this line says to replace the call towith a call toand use the value of metavariable E as its argument .
Now , we also want to check the return value of malloc ( ) and return an error if it failed .
We can do that too :
@@ expression E ; identifier ptr ; @@ - ptr = alloca ( E ) ; +ptr = malloc( E ) ; +if ( ptr == NULL ) + return 1 ;
--- test .c +++ /tmp/cocci-output-17494-22a573-test.c @@ - 7,7 +7,8 @@ main ( int argc , char * argv[ ] ) char * buf ; /* allocate memory */ - buf = alloca ( bytes ) ; + buf = malloc ( bytes ) ; + if ( buf == NULL ) + return 1 ; return 0 ; }
Scsi_Host
proc_info
The resulting diff : Semantic patches can be far more complex .
One of my favorite examples is the move of reference counting of thestructure out of drivers .
Changing this required adding an argument to the function signature and removing a declaration and several other lines from each SCSI driver 'sfunction .
The semantic patch , explained in detail in their OLS 2007 slides [ PPT ] [ ODP ] , does all of this automatically .
I recommend reading and re-reading this example until it sinks in .
Experience
My first experience with Coccinelle was mixed .
In theory , Coccinelle does exactly what I want — automate complex changes to code — but in practice the implementation is beta quality .
I successfully used Coccinelle to make hundreds of lines of changes with less than a hundred lines of semantic patches , but only after working directly with the developers to get bug fixes and help figuring out SmPL features .
Coccinelle is one of those schizophrenic projects situated on the boundary between academic research and practical software development .
One of the first hurdles I had to overcome was teaching Coccinelle about the macros in my code .
Coccinelle has to do all its own parsing and pre-processing — you can't just run the input C code through cpp because then you 'd have to map the post - processor output back to the original code .
Macros will sometimes confuse it enough that it gives up parsing a function until it reaches the next safe grammatical starting point ( e.g. , the next function ) — which may mean that it does n't process most of the file .
To get around this , you can create a list of macros and feed them to spatch with the - macro_file option .
( Yes , that 's one dash — one of my pet peeves about Coccinelle is the non-standard command - line option style . )
For example , here are a few lines from the macro file I used for e2fsprogs :
# define EXT2FS_ATTR(a ) # define _INLINE_ inline # define ATTR ( a )
- parse_c
spatch - parse_c
You can build the list of macros by hand , but spatch has a feature that helps find them automatically .
Theoption makes spatch list the top ten parsing errors , which will include the macro name .
For example , some of the output from runningon e2fsprogs :
EXT2FS_ATTR : present in 85 parsing errors example : static int check_and_change_inodes ( ext2_ino_t dir , int entry EXT2FS_ATTR ( ( unused ) ) , struct ext2_dir_entry * dirent , int offset , int blocksize EXT2FS_ATTR ( ( unused ) ) ,
Coccinelle has improved significantly in the past few weeks .
The 0.1.2 release had a number of bugs that made spatch unusable for me .
The next release , 0.1.3 , fixed those bugs and with it I was able to make practical , real - world patches .
The 0.1.4 release will be out shortly .
The developers wrote and released more documentation , including a description of all the command - line options [ PDF ] and a grammar for SmPL .
Many more example spatch scripts are available now .
The best reference for learning Coccinelle continues to be the slides from their 2007 OLS tutorial and the associated paper [ PDF ] .
White space handling is improving ; originally Coccinelle did n't care much about white space and frequently mangled transformations involving it , which is a problem if you want to take the hand out of hand - editing .
One of my semantic patches left a dangling semi-colon in the middle ; the developers sent me a patch to fix it within a few days .
One thing I am absolutely certain of : learning Coccinelle and writing semantic patches was way more fun than making the changes by hand or using regular expressions .
I also had much greater confidence that my changes were correct ; it is remarkably pleasant to make several hundred lines of changes and have the result compile cleanly and pass the regression tests the first time .
Related work
If you really want to , you can do everything Coccinelle can do by writing your own scripts — after all , code is code .
But you have to deal with all the little corner cases — e.g. , to C , white space is all the same , generally speaking , but regular expressions care intensely about the difference between a space , a newline , and a tab .
Use the right tool for the job — if you 're just replacing a variable name and your first script works , great .
If you 're changing a calling convention or moving the allocation and freeing of an object to another context , give a tool like Coccinelle a try .
In terms of power and flexibility , Coccinelle is similar to the Stanford compiler checker [ PDF ] ( commercialized by Coverity ) .
While the compiler checker is far more mature and has better flow analysis and parsing , Coccinelle can generate code to fix the bugs it finds .
Most importantly , Coccinelle is open source , so developers can find and fix bugs themselves .
Some IDEs include tools to automatically refactor code , which is one aspect of what Coccinelle does .
I have never personally used one of these IDE refactoring tools and can't compare it with Coccinelle , but my friends who have report that their stability leaves something to be desired .
Xrefactory is a refactoring tool available on * NIX platforms which is fully integrated with Emacs and XEmacs .
It is not open source and requires the purchase of a license , although one version is available for use free of charge .
Conclusion
Coccinelle is an open source tool that can analyze and transform C code according to specified rules , or semantic patches .
Semantic patches are much more powerful than patches or regular expressions .
The tool is beta quality right now but usable for practical tasks and the developers are very responsive .
It 's worth learning for any developer making a non-trivial interface change .
Federal Reserve Characteristics of a Crime Syndicate Faces Lawsuits
The principal missing piece in the grand American mosaic of banking destruction , corrupt collusion , fraudulent bonds , Wall Street control , suppressed regulators , compromised ratings agencies is JUSTICE .
Foreign entities are aghast as the lack of prosecution , remedy , and removal from positions of power , as policy continues to be set by the participants responsible for the structural failure and prevalent fraud .
Their actions are reaching climax levels .
The climax of the Wall Street strangehold is the confiscation of the TARP funds to date .
However , whatever has not been nationalized is subject to lawsuits .
The pattern of human behavior indicates that lawsuits can spawn additional lawsuits , and quickly control is lost .
It is open season on Citigroup , Bank of America , and perhaps other lesser players .
Two major lawsuits have the potential to change the landscape .
Curiously , neither receives much publicity .
Then again , the press seems somewhere between subservient and compromised anyway .
They have failed to shine many lights on much of any developments until after the damage is done .
Odd court cases , missing people , factional politics , and border patrols seem more important on their agendas .
Much of the US media & press seem a graduation of National Inquirer to television .
The USFed might be vulnerable .
Could it be that the US Federal Reserve will face a growing expanding escalating lawsuit that finally is heard before the US Supreme Court ?
Give it a 50 - 50 chance , but this really needs a Vegas line .
They are behaving and reacting much like a crime syndicate .
Stonewall tactics by the USFed on disclosed disbursement of TARP funds continues , despite court challenges .
The USFed has begun to take on some curious similarities to a crime syndicate central clearinghouse .
It refuses to disclose which banks received bond swaps , and refuses to reveal what assets it accepted as collateral .
Before long , RICO
Laws against racketeering might be invoked .
The word has been mentioned in the press by one particular Congressman .
Recall .
The Racketeer Influenced & Corrupt Organizations
Act of 1970 has been a powerful legal weapon to confiscate crime syndicate assets .
The RICO Laws have been properly used much more than abused .
FEDERAL RESERVE CHALLENGED IN LAWSUIT
Bloomberg filed a lawsuit under the Freedom of Information Act on November 7 , requesting details from the USFed on Congressional TARP fund confiscation .
The Freedom of Information Act obliges federal agencies to make government documents available to the press and public .
The USFed operates as a contractor agency , but possibly with as much scrutiny permitted as Halliburton on basic fraud .
The Bloomberg lawsuit is Bloomberg LP vs Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System , 08 - CV-9595 , US District Court , Southern District of New York ( Manhattan ) .
Incredibly , with shock to many , the USFed will continue to withhold internal memos as well as information about trade secrets and commercial information .
Are you kidding me ?
TRADE SECRETS BY AN AGENCY HIRED TO MANAGE THE DOLLAR AND TREASURYS ???
That is quantum levels more preposterous than defying the USCongress when it pursued accounting of the gold status owned by the nation .
Anger has erupted within the USCongress .
The USFed appears to be hiding information so as to shield its own corruption , as its public response cites ‘ substantial multiple harms ' being avoided .
Harm to whom ?
Is this Nixon all over again citing ‘ Executive Privilege ' to conceal crimes and misdemeanors ?
The USFed is scared and on the defensive .
The Board usually does not go into such detail about its position .
Lee Levine is from the law firm Levine Sullivan Koch & Schulz .
He said , “ This is uncharted territory .
The Freedom of Information Act was not built to anticipate this situation .
That is evident from the way the Fed tried to shoehorn their argument into the trade secrets exemption . ”
This case is worth watching , but strangely receives very little attention .
It could be a landmark case that holds together the nation 's financial purse strings .
My conjecture is that the USFed is intent on hiding numerous transactions that hide the tracks of deep Wall Street corruption in bond redemption , with powerful motive to avert international lawsuits , and a pervasive desire to prevent grassroots solutions since mortgage bond securities have very little legal standing in legitimacy .
WE ARE WATCHING THE DENOUEMENT OF THE BIGGEST BOND FRAUD IN MODERN HISTORY .
USFed Chairman Ben Bernanke and Treasury Secy Henry Paulson said in September they would meet demands for transparency in a $ 700 billion bailout of the banking system .
They lied .
Both the antagonists and the USFed might soon realize that a battle has been waged , one against a crime syndicate .
Can you say Supreme Court ?
Could a test come of the national sovereignty versus crime syndicates ?
If the case reaches the highest court , it will likely be stuck on its front steps .
IMPLICATIONS TO STABILITY AND SECURITY OF MONEY ITSELF INVITES A HUGE HIDDEN GOLD MOTIVE .
A CANCER IS GROWING UNDER THE USDOLLAR AND USTREASURY BONDS , WHOSE ALTERNATIVE IS CLEARLY GOLD .
GOLDMAN SACHS : THE NEW CORLEONE FAMILY
Anyone who has missed that the profound influence by Goldman Sachs leadership at the Dept Treasury has contributed to the destruction of both the USEconomy and US banking system is simply asleep since 1992 .
JPMorgan is the other principal player .
Neither will likely ever be prosecuted , since they ARE the USGovt on all matters and dealings financial .
The entire Enron sequence of lawsuits proved JPMorgan will never be pinned down and prosecuted or successfully sued .
Accounts of the third World Trade Center building on 11 Sept 2001 , where Enron records were kept in JPMorgan offices , read like a bad James Bond movie with a Warren Commission cloak .
Treasury Secy Paulson has pulled off a successful Coup d'Etat to usurp power , by means of assumed prestige , claimed expertise , naked intimidation , and clever contract language .
His defiant yet slippery Kashkari has been pointman for the stonewall effort .
Permit a sidetrack here .
USFed Chairman Bernanke has been so busy playing with his alphabet soup , that he forgot to drop any helicopter money at all to the Main Streets of America .
We were told that was his main job description .
At least that was his sales pitch to obtain the job .
Instead , he drains funds from the private mainstream banking system in order to pour those funds into Wall Street firms .
The press networks constantly repeat that Bernanke is flooding the system with liquidity .
Yet he is only flooding Wall Street balance sheets and enabling executive bailouts .
Back to Goldman .
Sorry , one more thing .
Is it necessary to be a Goldman Sachs veteran to obtain a US Administration Cabinet post , or to be head of a Canadian central bank ?
One must wonder .
Has anything gone right in the USEconomy or US financial system at the conclusion of a presidential term with Goldman Sachs men in cabinet posts ?
RECENT HISTORY SAYS NO .
Shut up and quit digressing !
Assistant Treasury Secy Neel Kashkari seems to me no different from Sonny Corleone in the Godfather family , but mine is a suspicious eye .
Does anybody notice that the name Kashkari is close to Kash & Karry ?
His testimony last week as Asst Treasury Secy resembled a slippery snake oil salesman .
He actually had the audacity to claim that the lack of US financial market collapse was proof that they wisely administered the funds .
THEY WENT 85 % TO EXECUTIVE BONUSES TO FED RESERVE BANKERS !!!
In fact , the lack of market collapse is proof that the $ 125 billion was NOT desperately needed for banks to avert a disaster .
Kashkari is careful in his words .
For instance , he claimed that his office has no contractual agreements with big banks to limit lending and horde cash .
All pressures have been stated verbally only !
Hank Paulson is treated with kid gloves by the media networks .
He is really the wrong messenger for the entire Wall Street mortgage related bailout .
Paulson was one of the five executives who went to the Securities & Exchange Commission in 2004 to plead for permission to lever upward the Wall Street firm businesses even more , like to 30:1 or 40:1 ratios .
Without any question , he was an architect in the crisis .
AS PRESTIGE WEARS OFF ON GOLDMAN SACHS , GOLD WILL FILL A VACUUM .
There are reasons why the Goldman Sachs gold short position in Tokyo has dwindled to nearly zero in the last two years .
Goldman is secretly going long gold , in my view , just like they went short the mortgage bonds just a couple years ago .
THE WALL STREET ELITE MIGHT SOON TURN ON A DIME AND GO LONG GOLD , WHEN THEY PULL THE SWITCH AND IGNITE REFLATION IN ORDER TO PREVENT A SYSTEMIC COLLAPSE .
CITIGROUP LAWSUIT
Citigroup is in hot water in three key ways : general urgent need for bailout , revealed motive for timing of bailout , and a potentially damaging lawsuit .
The legend of Robert Rubin is being shattered and ruined .
This man has no basis for any claim of elite or icon status .
His career as a legendary currency trader was followed by a ministry post that saw a path of vanished gold during a failed Strong Dollar Policy and a tech telecom stock bust , then followed by a ruined Citigroup from risk gone wild after pursued deregulation .
It seems unbridled competition without regulation breeds destruction among the kids without babysitters .
The broad strokes of the big hastily crafted $ 322 billion bailout deal for Citigroup has many components , most steeped in corporate failure , deep insolvency , and unabashed desperation .
The entire rescue package seems a drop in the bucket , compared to the $ 2300 billion in assets on the Citigroup balance sheets , much of which are soured .
Friedman Billings Ramsey estimated independently that Citi needed $ 160B in fresh capital to turn solvent .
This deal is patchwork , hastily cobbled and arbitrarily applied , that leaves them still insolvent .
This is pure life support .
Future rescue will obviously be needed .
The secret motive for protecting the credit markets from a Citigroup total bust and liquidation was their heavy involvement in credit derivatives .
They are the second biggest player .
Explosions in credit derivatives would result in a sequence of Hiroshima bombs , one triggering another , all much bigger than Lehman Brothers , probably extending to the basement chambers of JPMorgan and Bank of America .
In a sense , an argument can be made that Citigroup blackmailed the USGovt and Dept Treasury with its passively placed bombs under CDS labels .
JUST WHY WASN'T CITIGROUP LED TO THE SLAUGHTERHOUSE OF BANKRUPTCY AND THE VATS OF LIQUIDATION ?
First , some truly wealthy insider Wall Street superstars would possibly face ruin or deep embarrassment .
Second , their mortgage bond and related leveraged security portfolio would cause a problem 10 x bigger than Lehman Brothers .
Third , their credit derivatives book would set off several Hiroshima bombs , with uncertain outcome of spread darkness .
Fourth , their failure would very likely ignite fires , explosions , meltdowns , bank failures , and ripple effects that could possibly bring down the entire banking system in the United States .
Fifth , a Citigroup bankruptcy would likely pull back the curtains and reveal the deep corruption and massive fraud endemic to US banking .
Enough on why , and back to the story leading to an important lawsuit .
A federal lawsuit has been filed against Citigroup for an alleged complex cover - up of toxic securities that resulted in huge losses , and thus severe shareholder losses .
THIS CASE SEEMS TO HAVE TEETH AT A TIME WHEN THE PUBLIC WANTS BLOOD , WHICH MIGHT LEAD TO SEVERAL OTHER MAJOR LAWSUITS AGAINST WALL STREET FIRMS .
Named in the lawsuit were Director Rubin , ex-CEO Chuck Prince , Vice Chairman Lewis Kaden , along with the current and previous CFOs .
In all , over $ 120 billion in shareholder value was wiped out .
Rubin himself cleared $ 30.6 million , Prince $ 26.5 million , in stock sales .
A Ponzi scheme is claimed , wherein Citi purchased repackaged unmarketable leveraged mortgage securities known as Collateralized Debt Obligations , but hid their toxic exposure off the balance sheet in shell corporations .
Rubin and other named executives sold $ 150 million of personal shares at a time when they allegedly benefited from undisclosed inside information .
THIS LAWSUIT HAS THE POTENTIAL TO ATTACK THE LEGITIMACY OF HIDDEN BALANCE SHEETS .
Such hidden assets falsify the corporate valuation itself , a gigantic affront to any claim of a fair market , let alone a free market .
Off balance sheets have become executive playgrounds at best , and the scene of the fraud crime at worst .
An investigation filed by law firm Kirby McInerney cleared the path for the lawsuit , which has taken the new form of a blanket investor lawsuit .
Look for a mushroom effect of lawsuits soon to occur , encouraged by successful ground breaking ones .
Wall Street firms are extremely vulnerable to lawsuits , damages , and remedy , like restitution repurchase of fraud - ridden bonds .
Look for the system to be flooded with class action lawsuits in 2009 .
Wall Street firms , what is left of them , might be forced to buyback much of their toxic bond waste .
This could become a motive for nationalization of mortgages !!!
IF WALL STREET FIRMS COME UNDER SEIGE , THEY MIGHT LOSE THEIR GRIP ON THE GOLD SUPPRESSION AT A TIME WHEN THE COMEX GOLD IS ALREADY UNDER SEIGE .
MADOFF LAWSUITS NEXT ?
The largest Ponzi Scheme fraud case ever to be prosecuted in the United States has just been announced and prosecuted .
Bernard Madoff Investor Securities is charged in a $ 50 billion fraud case by the Securities & Exchange Commission .
He is the former chairman of the Nasdaq stock market , which enabled him to attract huge investment funds and to fend off wide scrutiny on his methods .
His BMIS firm had partners with Goldman Sachs and Merrill Lynch .
Watch that duo go Scott - free !
He faces up to 20 years in a federal prison , and up to a trifling $ 5 million fine , 10 thousand times less than his fraud .
The Ponzi Scheme snared numerous influential well - heeled groups , both charity organizations and foreign investors , including some extremely wealthy people .
It appears that at least $ 15 billion of wealth , most concentrated in southern Florida and New York City , has vanished .
Complications come from the fact that much income tax was paid by investors when the gains were total illusions .
Numerous complaints had been filed against Madoff in the past , but the SEC took no action .
Madoff apparently conducted his own trades , managed his own books , and permitted no independent audits .
Renewed criticism has come to the SEC , for once more being asleep at the desk .
Is n't that what the elite pay the SEC to do ?
Recall that when a mid-level SEC officer a couple years ago attempted to run an investigation against John Mack of Morgan Stanley , he was fired almost immediately by the SEC .
The SEC has forgotten its investigation role , ever since ex-Wall Street heads have been in control of the commission .
That is like hiring ex-Mafia dons to run a police force .
The Madoff case pushes the door open even wider for more lawsuits against the elite corners of Wall Street .
The floodgates are not far from being pushed open .
GOLD SHOULD BENEFIT FROM BOTH TARNISHED IMAGE OF THE US$ KNIGHTS OF THE SQUARE TABLE , AND GRADUAL LOST FOREIGN SUPPORT FOR A CRIMINAL CULTURE IN THE US FINANCIAL DISTRICT .
In time , numerous sacrificial lambs will be offered up , some of surprising identity and lofty status .
BLOOD TRANSFUSIONS TO A FINANCIAL CADAVER
For a concise disturbing insightful interview , see the iTulip article entitled “ Major US Banks Worse Than Japan 's Zombies ” ( CLICK HERE ) as the anonymous industry insider Dr Banker is interviewed .
The guest claims the massive blood infusions have failed to revive the defunct banking system .
“ The transfusions usually take two to six months , and typically six months or so after the crisis is over , are gradually withdrawn over a period of several months to return total money in the system to pre-crisis levels .
My theory is , and I admit not everyone will agree with it , is this : the patient is dead …
They can keep the intravenous tube hooked up to a pint bottle or a 100 - gallon drum of blood , but it does not matter if the blood is not circulating through the patient , so he can take it in …
Note that many smaller banks that do not operate as part of the Fed system are working just fine …
The reason : Credit Default Swaps .
It is now well understood that CDS are at the root of today 's financial crisis ...
CDSwaps certainly killed [ the patient ] but removing them is no cure . ”
Dr Banker went on to explain how in the last ten years , Credit Default Swaps alone have sustained the US banking system .
Their liquidation would require the writedown losses of between $ 5 and $ 10 trillion .
See the transfusions in the chart below .
Bank loans are not forthcoming .
The banking system is defunct .
So hundreds of billion $ have been pumped into major US banks , yet they remain comatose .
Is their condition dictated by the Paulson gang or victimized by mortal wounds ?
The entire AIG takeover by the Dept Treasury with USFed loans was intended to place the acidic AIG losses from Credit Default Swap contracts under the watchful guidance and management of JPMorgan .
They wanted CDSwaps out of public view .
The AIG blowups now do their damage under the USGovt roof , at federal expense , with much reduced publicity , thus preserving this incredibly queer USDollar rally .
AIG has to date received $ 205 billion in three tranches , without any enforceable demand to cut waste and luxury for executives , who ruined the company .
Expect about 40 to 50 more tranches , and at least $ 2 trillion more in seemingly endless AIG bailout backstops in the next few years .
Maybe AIG will face some lawsuits soon .
HERE IS THE KEY QUESTION , ASKED AND ANSWERED MANY TIMES BY ROB KIRBY .
If AIG blew up , why did n't JPMorgan ?
If Citigroup blew up , why did n't JPMorgan ?
They had tremendous overlap in book of business .
Whatever happened to Citi 's mortgage book and CDSwap book would have happened to JPMorgan 3 x bigger , louder , and more damaging .
The answer is that JPMorgan is a crime syndicate bank , a toxic chemical factory , free from the obstacles and nuisance of accounting .
They are the USFed alter ego .
They manage the ‘ Garbage Can ' and engage in special project amusements like Enron with total impunity .
THE PLIGHT OF STATES
The whole is made from the sum of its parts .
The states suffering the worst economic and fiscal damage seem to be California , Michigan , Ohio , Florida , and Nevada .
On a percentage basis , New York and Arizona face the worst fiscal deficit gaps , over 20 % of budget , but California 's is the largest in size .
The National Conference of State Legislatures estimates that the 50 states face $ 97 billion in shortfalls over the next 18 to 24 months .
They cannot expect little from the USGovt , which has been negligent so far .
MAYBE SOME STATES CAN INITIATE SOME LAWSUITS AGAINST THE USGOVT FOR NEGLIGENCE AND PREOCCUPATION WITH WAR !!!
My eye is trained on California , which has motive to attempt to print money .
They stand in gray area with IOUs issued for the second time .
They once were usable as legal tender on a limited basis .
A WIDER MOVE TO PRINT GOLDEN STATE DOLLARS COULD PLACE THE USDOLLAR OVER A PSYCHOLOGICAL SINKHOLE .
DOLLAR DEATH RALLY COMES TO END
The USDollar has rallied for three months , based upon a massive liquidation of trades that have as their basis a short in USTreasury Bonds , and based upon massive payouts to Credit Default Swaps for failed corporate and mortgage bonds .
Talk about a bizarre platform .
The top of the USDollar rally was called in my November Hat Trick Letter .
Other foreign currencies are sure to take wicked blows and endure downward spirals , but the USDollar rally is largely done .
The next blows will come from the march toward 0 % in the Fed Funds rate .
This is the badge of shame for USFed Chairman Bernanke to wear .
He has had 16 months to work his magic , to lower interest rates , to flood the system with phony money .
All he has done has been to flood Wall Street firms with money , and starve Main Street and its many resident banks .
He has secretly run the agenda of his masters , TO ENABLE THE CONSOLIDATION OF FEDERAL RESERVE BANKS .
They are brimming with reserves , lending next to nothing , and are preparing grand acquisitions of assets intentionally pulled down in price .
NEXT IS THE DISINTEGRATION OF THE USECONOMY , a process already begun .
The financial sector was never supposed to lead any economy , but rather serve it toward capital formation and functional lubrication .
The complete and total thunderous crash of the financial engineering monstrosity and risk pricing models has set the USDollar up for collapse .
The only thing that would breath new Frankenstein life into it would be another major failure of a New York financial firm .
The current rally this autumn was a fakeout .
The fundamentals of the USDollar are mired in failure .
The banking system is insolvent .
The households in America with mortgages are 18 % insolvent .
The jobs wagon just rolled over a cliff , as one million monthly job losses are likely by summertime .
The car industry is in ruins , and the retail chains face major shutdowns .
The eradication of the United Auto Workers union is the agenda , which if not permitted , will result in untold job losses throughout the biggest vertically integrated factory and financial network in the nation .
Newspapers and websites are seeing their ad revenues slowly vanish , sure to lead to job cuts .
Major universities and colleges are forced to find a way to continue without the benefit of rising endowments , thereby forcing job cuts and construction pullbacks .
The hidden risk is the gigantic sinkhole of insurance firms , which endure liquidation , thus exposing thousands of companies to shutdowns .

The Roman philosopher Cicero postulated , “ Gratitude is not only the greatest of virtues , but the parent of all the others . ”
With Thanksgiving behind us , Americans were compelled to list all the things for which we were thankful .
But , what makes some people grateful only one Thursday each fall , and others enjoy an attitude of gratefulness throughout the entire year ?
Many studies have found that having a grateful disposition increases overall well - being .
People who are self - rated , as well as rated by observers , as having a grateful disposition also experience a positive affect , exhibit pro-social behaviors such as giving , comforting , rescuing , and helping others , and regularly practice spirituality or religion .
Gratitude also is negatively associated with traits such as envy and materialism .
Psychology researchers have characterized gratitude as a moral affect , similar to emotions such as empathy and guilt .
Gratitude , under this definition , has 3 functions : a moral barometer that helps recipients perceive and respond to another person ’s beneficial actions , a moral motive that motivates recipients to engage in pro-social behaviors toward others , and a moral reinforcer that encourages benefactors of pro-social behaviors to engage in the same behaviors in the future .
Gratitude , in these cases , is related to an individual ’s cognition and behavior in a moral domain .
A recent study outlined individual differences in levels of gratitude that influenced the amount of gratitude experienced after receiving aid .
People with higher levels of so - called trait gratitude reported higher levels of “ state gratitude ” after receiving aid or reading stories of people receiving aid .
The individuals with higher trait gratitude saw the help received as more valuable , more costly to provide , and more altruistic .
The positive descriptions of aid also influenced future pro-social behavior and state gratitude .
A leading professor of psychology , Robert Emmons , published a book last year outlining 10 tips for increasing feelings of gratitude .
He found , through years of research , that people who regularly practiced gratitude exercised regularly , complained of fewer illnesses , and reported better overall well - being and quality of life .
His research is consistent across all populations , including age groups , health conditions , and socioeconomic status .
Emmons ’s most important suggestion is maintaining a daily gratitude journal .
People who record what they are grateful for are able to look back at their life and reaffirm their good fortune .
He also advises remembering the bad times .
If people do not remember what it was like to be sick or unemployed , they may not appreciate their good health or secure job when they have it .
Emmons also suggests people ask themselves daily what they have done — good and bad — for another person .
He recommends appreciating the senses , using visual reminders , and learning prayers of gratitude to cultivate feelings of thankfulness .
People must also make a promise to practice gratitude daily , Emmons claims .
An attitude of thanksgiving is difficult to maintain , and must be a daily routine .
Speaking positively and behaving in a grateful manner can also encourage feelings of thankfulness .
Last , Emmons suggests always looking for new situations and opportunities to show your gratitude .
Feelings of gratitude and thanksgiving should not exist only one day each year .
Actively seeking out occasions to practice gratitude on a daily basis may lead to countless improvements in quality of life and overall well - being .

Jan. 26 , 2009  --
Continuing efforts to overturn more of the last administration 's policies , President Obama signed a presidential memorandum today requesting the EPA consider approving a waiver that will allow 14 states to set their own stricter automobile emissions and fuel efficiency standards .
In 2007 , then - Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Stephen Johnson denied California and Arizona , Connecticut , Maine , Maryland , Massachusetts , New Mexico , New York , Oregon , Pennsylvania , Rhode Island , Vermont , Washington and New Jersey -- the right to set their own clean air standards , despite staff scientists ' recommendation to do so .
" California has shown bold and bipartisan leadership through its effort to forge 21st - century standards , and over a dozen states have followed its lead .
But instead of serving as a partner , Washington stood in their way , " Obama said .
Obama also signed a memorandum directing the Department of Transportation to expedite finalization of more fuel - efficient standards for the auto industry to cover 2011 model - year cars .
Last May , the Bush administration informally proposed increasing the standard to an average of 27.8 miles per gallon on average fuel economy standards for passenger cars and light trucks for models 2011 through 2015 , and Obama will likely increase that .
Flanked by Transportation Secretary Ray Lahood and EPA administrator Lisa Jackson , Obama described U.S. dependence on oil as " one of the most serious threats that our nation has faced , " comparing it to the dangers of dictators and terrorists .
" For the sake of our security , our economy and our planet , we must have the courage and commitment to change , " Obama said at the event held in the East Room of the White House .
" We need more than the same old empty promises . "
The final EPA decision could take several months , but it 's a step toward allowing states more freedom in guiding their path to environment standards .
The president also pushed his American Recovery and Reinvestment Plan , saying that it would " save taxpayers $ 2 billion a year by making 75 percent of federal buildings more efficient . "
Both of Obama 's memoranda are written with cautious legalese and assiduous attention to process .
But however soft they may seem , they are expected to lead to dramatic changes in environmental policy from the Bush administration .
In 2007 , Congress passed the Energy Independence and Security Act , designed to create more energy independence and security in the United States , ramp up production of clean renewable fuels and improve energy efficiency .
But environmentalists criticized the Bush administration for not doing enough to follow through on these goals .
Reaction to Obama's Moves
Obama 's move today paves the way for states to eventually impose much stricter fuel emissions standards and for the federal government to require that U.S. automakers produce far more fuel - efficient cars and trucks much quicker than Bush would have required them to do so .
Given that these states -- especially California -- command a large market share , allowing states to set their own standards is likely to have a significant impact on the U.S. economy .
The reversal received a mixed reaction .
As expected , environmental groups hailed the announcement as a " thrilling moment , " and one that will leave " behind our failed fossil fuel policies . "
Florida Gov. Charlie Crist , a moderate Republican , applauded Obama 's request to Jackson , even though Florida is not one of the states in line to get a waiver , but he added that " The waiver is a critical aspect for California , Florida and 17 other states which have adopted , or are in the process of adopting , automobile emissions standards . "
California Republican Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger also praised the move , saying in a written statement that , " With this announcement from President Obama less than a week into his administration , it is clear that California and the environment now have a strong ally in the White House .
Allowing California and other states to aggressively reduce their own harmful vehicle tailpipe emissions would be a historic win for clean air and for millions of Americans who want more fuel - efficient , environmentally friendly cars . "
California sought to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from passenger vehicles by 30 percent by 2016 , but its request for a waiver was rejected by the former Republican administration .
Other Republicans were not so happy .
House Minority Leader John Boehner , R - Ohio , said the decision could hurt American jobs , given Detroit 's struggles .
" The president 's action today is disappointing , " Boehner said .
" The effect of this policy will be to destroy American jobs at the very time government leaders should be working together to protect and create them .
Millions of American jobs will be placed in further jeopardy if automakers are forced to spend billions to comply with potentially dozens of different emissions standards in dozens of different states . "
The U.S. Chamber of Commerce also criticized Obama 's memoranda .
" At a time when we need to jump start our economy , regulating CO2 in this manner would stop most of President Obama 's stimulus proposal cold in its tracks and create a regulatory train wreck , " William Kovacs a vice president at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce , said in a statement .
" In addition , such a move would put the EPA one step closer to making carbon dioxide ' subject to regulation ' under the Act .
This would ... have the unintended consequence of creating costly and burdensome permitting requirements on millions of construction projects , including hospitals , schools , and office buildings . "
Obama 's memoranda today bear few surprises .
The president has reiterated that energy and environment issues will be a top priority in his administration , and today 's actions affirm he will invest some of his time and political capital into this issue .
" He feels the need to get moving in some areas where he thinks things can be done relatively soon , " said Michael A. Levi , senior fellow for energy and environment at the Council of Foreign Relations .
This may be a welcome move to many Americans .
In an ABC News / Washington Post poll , 41 percent of Americans said clean power should be the " highest priority " item in stimulus spending .
But Obama 's push to create more fuel - efficient cars domestically and boost the economy through his stimulus package comes at a time when automakers continue to struggle to keep their operations and layoffs continue to deter the financial climate .
In Detroit , the hub of U.S. auto manufacturers , the reaction was mixed , with some saying that auto companies need to make this happen and others arguing that manufacturers would be forced to pass down the costs of meeting these regulations to consumers .
Just two months after the Big 3 automakers came to Washington , D.C. , requesting a bailout and promising more fuel - efficient vehicles , the state of automakers remains weak .
General Motors said today that it will cut 2,000 jobs at plants in Michigan and Ohio because of slow sales .
Changing its strategy so it falls in line with the government may not be as easy as in a better financial climate .
Job cut announcements -- some of which Obama addressed -- also flowed in today .
Home Depot Inc. said it plans to eliminate 7,000 jobs while closing four dozen of its smaller home improvement stores .
Sprint Nextel Corp. said it is eliminating about 8,000 positions as it seeks to cut annual costs by $ 1.2 billion .
Changing Directions
Obama has swiftly moved to reverse several other Bush - era policies .
Last week , he signed an executive order to shut down the controversial detainee center at Guantanamo Bay within a year 's time .
He also overturned the " Mexico City policy " and opened the way for federal funding to flow to international organizations that provide abortion - related services , a Reagan - era law that was overturned by President Clinton and then reimposed by Bush .
Obama , who is also in the process of pushing his stimulus plan , met with Republican leaders last week to discuss the economic package .
But despite the bipartisan approach , Obama showed there were clear limits .
And Monday , in another symbolic turn from the Bush administration , Obama appointed as his special envoy for climate change Todd Stern , the U.S. negotiator on the Kyoto Protocol agreement that the Bush administration withdrew from in 2001 .
In a subtle criticism of presidents past , Obama stated in his remarks today that alarms about energy dependency have been sounded , but that no concrete measures have been taken .
" Year after year , decade after decade , we 've chosen delay over decisive action .
Rigid ideology has overruled sound science .
Special interests have overshadowed common sense .
Rhetoric has not led to the hard work needed to achieve results , " he said .
" Our leaders raise their voices each time there is a spike in gas prices , only to grow quiet when the price falls at the pump . "
But despite his early steps , going beyond rhetoric may be a challenge for the new administration as well .
" I 'll be looking to see whether the president can use his ability to communicate in order to build the political support that 's necessary to do what we 've known for long that are important , " Levi said .
" Ultimately , big steps to change the way we use energy are going to require tough decisions from congressmen , and those are not going to happen without presidential leadership . "
With a myriad of issues -- from the economy to two wars abroad -- facing the newly minted president , it remains to be seen how Obama 's energy and environmental agenda will unfold in the coming years .

Questions without Notice : Take Note of Answers
Internet Filtering
3:31 pm
Lyn Allison ( Australian Democrats ) | Hansard source
I move :
That the Senate take note of the answer given by the President to a question without notice asked by Senator Allison today relating to the parliamentary computer network and Internet filtering .
This may seem like a small thing , but it seems to me to be a form of censorship which has absolutely no purpose .
I object to the fact that someone else is deciding what is and what is not a morally appropriate website for me to observe .
We are not clear on the rules here .
We do not know what sorts of sites are going to be banned .
We know pornographic sites are one of them .
I was looking up information on the web on the debate a couple of weeks ago about clean coal and the split in conservation groups on this issue , and the Herald Sun report on this matter was denied me because it was ‘ malicious ’ .
So , apart from the fact that the filter is unlikely to filter out those things which are truly dangerous and offensive to us , I think this is the thin end of the wedge in terms of determining what senators and their staff can and cannot see .
As we know , there is an exemption for the library .
Why ?
Because they do research .
What do we do on the web ?
Research .
Instead of that , we have this lame excuse by the Appropriations and Staffing Committee that the department has this filter and so should we — what is fair for one is fair for all .
Well , it does not seem to me to be self - evident .
There need to be cogent reasons why we have this filter .
The President says : ‘ Look , it ’s all all right .
If you find you ’ve been blocked on a site and you really need to get to it , ring up 2020 . ’
I do not know about you , Mr Deputy President , but I am often looking up websites at 11 o’clock at night , and certainly on the weekends , and , if you have tried ringing 2020 at that time , you will know that there is no response .
I do not object to illegal sites being banned .
I think it is perfectly appropriate that , if someone is doing something illegal on a website , in the same way as on the road or anywhere else , they should be properly penalised for it .
There is the capacity to interrogate the website access actions of senators and their staff .
My question to the President was : where is the problem ?
Show us .
Are there people around this chamber who are accessing pornography which is not related to their parliamentary duties ?
I do not think so .
Are there members and senators who are looking up illicit drugs for the purposes of trading in drugs or using drugs themselves ?
I do not know .
Is it a big problem ?
Let ’s find out .
Instead of that , we have a filter imposed on our access to websites which affects us all .
Since I have raised this issue a number of senators have come to me and told me stories about the sorts of harmless , morally sound information that they have been searching for on the web and has been filtered out .
So I think this is a ridiculous concept .
With the health portfolio , I look up many sites to do with sexual and reproductive health .
It is pretty obvious that a lot of those will fall foul of this filter .
Illegal arms is apparently one of the categories which will also trigger the filter .
Will it also mean North Korea and its nuclear weapons ?
Will it also mean the small arms trade , the illegal transfer of guns to developing countries ?
These are things I am interested in , and I do not want somebody else telling me : ‘ That ’s not your job .
You ’re not to do that . ’
I do not mind if there is a filter on things which are not for use in our parliamentary activities .
Let ’s put the filter on footy tipping ; let ’s put the filter on booking theatre tickets .
That is fine by me .
But what we have is a controlling act of censorship which is about morals .
We know that Senator Fielding was the one that raised this with the committee .
We know that he , the moral protector of all of us in this place , went to them .
I do not need that moral protection .
I have been in the parliament for 12 years .
We are elected to make laws and decisions for this country that affect the lives of humans in this country , but apparently we are not entitled to make decisions for ourselves about what we can and cannot see on the web .
We are being treated like children .
We are adults , we are fully human , and it is not up to somebody else to say this is or is not appropriate .
( Time expired )
Question agreed to .

Why Using require ‘ rubygems ’ Is Wrong
By Peter Cooper
Ryan Tomayko , currently known as one of the lead developers of Sinatra , was definitely not mincing his words yesterday when he posted Why " require ' rubygems ' "
In Your Library / App / Tests Is Wrong :
You should never do this in a source file included with your library , app , or tests : require ' rubygems '
The system I use to manage my $ LOAD_PATH is not your library / app / tests concern .
Whether rubygems is used or not is an environment issue .
Your library or app should have no say in the matter .
Explicitly requiring rubygems is either not necessary or misguided .
But .. why ?
When I use your library , deploy your app , or run your tests I may not want to use rubygems .
When you " require ' rubygems ' " in your code , you remove my ability to make that decision .
I cannot unrequire rubygems , but you can not require it in the first place .
I had n't thought of it this way before , but Ryan makes a lot of sense .
The choice of library management system should be down to the environment and not enforced by a library or a single portion of a larger application .
Check out Ryan 's post for the deeper rationale and see what you think .
He 's definitely got me thinking twice about using require ' rubygems ' in my own scripts , although as the slow migration over to Ruby 1.9 begins , perhaps it will become a non-issue , since RubyGems is included with Ruby 1.9 and loaded by default .

AT&T Starts Metered Billing Trial
In Reno 20 - 150 GB cap depending on tier , $ 1 per gigabyte overage fee Earlier this year , AT&T began laying the political and public relations groundwork for a shift toward metered billing , throwing comments to the press about how such a shift was " inevitable , " while company lobbyists began dropping vague hints that a billing shift was coming .
Last summer , executives at the company announced that the telco would be conducting a metered billing trial this fall .
The time for that trial has arrived , and Broadband Reports has learned that Reno , Nevada will be the lucky first market .
Last Friday , AT&T filed this ( pdf ) notice with the FCC that confirms the nation 's largest ISP will be conducting a metered billing trial in Reno .
This local market trial underscores our commitment to bring bigger , faster and smarter broadband networks to more and more communities at affordable rates .
-AT&T Memo Existing flat - rate profits were n't to AT&T CTO John Donovan 's liking , the exec complaining last summer that " traffic on our backbone is growing 60 percent per year , but our revenue is not . "
Earlier this year I quote : Consistent with AT&T ’s belief that consumers should have clear information about the capabilities of their broadband Internet access services and any meaningful limitations on those service , AT&T will be providing written notice to customers involved in the trial explaining that their broadband service will be subject to a certain monthly usage tier for the total amount of data they may send and receive , as well as a per gigabyte charge in the event they exceed the usage tier .
New customers in Reno this month are finding that their shiny new DSL tier comes with caps ranging from 20 to 150 gigabytes per month , depending on which service speed tier a customer signs up for ( AT&T offers DSL tiers ranging from 768 kbps to 6 Mbps ) .
The filing says that later this year , existing customers in Reno will become a part of this trial should their monthly usage exceed 150 GB in one month .
Existing flat - rate profits were n't to AT&T CTO John Donovan 's liking , the exec complaining last summer that " traffic on our backbone is growing 60 percent per year , but our revenue is not . "
Earlier this year I floated the idea that the FCC 's investigation of Comcast benefited AT&T in more ways than one , and the FCC 's supposed love of transparency was in part aimed at opening the door to metered billing .
AT&T 's filing with the FCC is clear to highlight how much this new metered move is about AT&T's love of " transparency , " not protecting U - Verse TV revenues from Internet video , or ramping up already impressive profits :
New customers in Reno this month are finding that their shiny new DSL tier comes with caps ranging from 20 to 150 gigabytes per month , depending on which service speed tier a customer signs up for ( AT&T offers DSL tiers ranging from 768 kbps to 6 Mbps ) .
The filing says that later this year , customers in Reno will become a part of this trial should their monthly usage exceed 150 GB in one month .
Should customers in Reno exceed the 150GB usage limit , AT&T is currently considering charging them an additional $ 1 per gigabyte .
That 's in line with Time Warner Cable 's current metered usage trial , news of which we first broke earlier this year .
Unlike Comcast , who also has implemented caps of 250 GB per month , AT&T will be offering up a usage tool to impacted customers .
The company will also provide some kind of automated alert ( perhaps banner injection technology ? ) once a customer hits 80 % of their monthly allotted capacity .
From the AT&T FCC filing : quote :
In addition , the first time a customer exceeds the applicable monthly usage tier , AT&T will send a written notice reminding the customer again about the usage tier , but we will not impose any additional charges at that time .
Only after the second time the customer exceeds the applicable monthly usage tier will the customer be subject to additional per-gigabyte charges .
Finally , in the event a new or existing customer does not want to participate in the trial , we will permit the customer to cancel their broadband Internet access service without an early termination penalty .
Well are n't you a sweetheart , AT&T .
Combined with your planned
Well are n't you a sweetheart , AT&T .
Combined with your planned piracy filters and wholesale funneling of customer data to the NSA ( pdf ) , you 're becoming a real charmer .
Despite denying to us earlier this year that you were making subtle flirtations with metered billing , it 's now pretty clear this is an idea you 've lusted after for a while .
According to documents , AT&T may extend the trial into additional markets later this year , so Reno customers wo n't be the only lucky netizens to experience AT&T 's new broadband profit vision .
According to AT&T , it 's for your own good .
" This local market trial underscores our commitment to bring bigger , faster and smarter broadband networks to more and more communities at affordable rates , " an announcement is expected to read .
Update : AT&T Spokesman Seth Bloom contacts me to add : " One minor point I ’d make - we may extend the trial to ONE other market by the end of the year ... not markets plural ... "
Update 2 : After speaking with a handful of major technology news websites , I 've learned that a certain very large cable company was very interested in seeing this story pushed yesterday in the media .
Numerous outlets were approached by said company to make sure they saw AT&T 's filing . :

It does n't matter how big a cap is , the fact that a cap exists will give users pause when they decide what they do on the Internet .
That 's bad for innovative new applications .
Even if 99 % of customers are nowhere near whatever cap is selected , 100 % of them will be THINKING about the cap and changing their behavior as a result .
That 's bad for the Internet .

Last Thanksgiving my sister was coming out to Arizona to visit my new home for the first time .
I was looking forward to showing off our homemade hot water heating system and treating Caroline to a refreshing solar shower .
Well , about a day before she was due to arrive we had a sudden and early overnight freeze .
We woke to discover that the collector had been disabled by a burst pipe .
In practical terms , that meant no hot water .
Our week long Thanksgiving vacation would now be devoted to building a newer and more efficient hot water system that would better withstand cold temperatures .
Caroline worked with us all week , but sad to say , we did not finish before she departed and she has not yet enjoyed the pleasures of a solar shower .
This diagram shows what we set out to build .
Click here to see the illustration full size .
Getting Started
Our first step was to get a used hot water heater .
So Caroline and I emptied out the back of the station wagon and headed over to Porfie 's Thrift .
Porfie had about 10 tanks to choose from .
They were all outside and kind of beat up looking , but he swore that they all worked and that none of them had any leaks .
We spent about $ 20 on a smaller tank , loaded it up and took it home to see if it would work .
Preparing the Tank
Once home , we stripped off the outer enclosure and insulation and revealed the metal tank .
Next , all of the old pipe fittings had to be removed .
This task was actually pretty tricky because many of the pipe threads were stuck after years of rusting while exposed the elements .
Another challenge we encountered using an old tank was a build up of sediment in the tank 's bottom .
The sediment dried and solidified in the bottom of the tank and was difficult to remove , though it was done successfully by rolling and rocking the tank back and forth .
Then we filled the tank to rinse it , and happily it was leak - free !
Once stripped and cleaned , the tank was thoroughly sanded and then spray painted black .
We put several coats of spray paint on to give it maximum coverage .
The spray paint was necessary to protect the metal tank from exposure to moisture and to increase the tank 's absorption of heat .
The appropriate fittings were then secured and extra holes plugged .
There are 2 hose fittings , a pressure release valve , and a drain spigot .
Constructing and Insulating the Collector Box
After working on the tank , we built the collector box .
Our measurements were calculated to accommodate the size of the glass , the size of our tank , and our desire for optimum solar exposure .
Based on the sun 's path we determined that the best angle for the glass to sit was 20 ˚ .
Once the frame was built , we affixed plywood paneling to the interior of the structure .
Then all the interior seems were caulked and we primed and painted the wood .
Next , recycled Styrofoam pieces were cut and wedged into the frame structure to serve as insulation .
We also added an additional layer of cardboard beyond the Styrofoam to increase insulation even more .
We save Styrofoam , packing peanuts , and bubble wrap to recycle as insulation - we love materials that you do n't have to buy !
We 've also learned that insulation is key to maintaining heat .
After insulating , we painted the outer paneling and affixed it to the outside of the frame .
The collector box is essentially a plywood box within a larger plywood box with a layer of Styrofoam as insulation in between .
Tank Supports and Glazing
Before installing the tank we cut 2x4s to match the tank 's curve and firmly fastened them into the collector box .
These supports were designed to hold the tank and to bear a considerable amount of weight .
We used a recycled sliding glass door for the collector 's glazing .
Our glazing is single pane , however double paned glass is preferred for its superior insulating properties .
Installing the Tank
After the box was built and mostly painted we put the ready tank into place .
Then the water supply and return lines were attached from the house into the collector 's storage tank .
Cold water flows into the tank from the trailer 's water system .
Sun strikes the water storage tank and heats the water .
The hot water floats to the top and the coldest water remains at the bottom of the tank .
A hose leading from the top of the tank carries the hottest water into the house .
Later an overflow hose was attached to the TPR valve to carry excess pressure out of the collector .
We lined the interior with reflectix insulation to direct maximum light towards the tank , and to further insulate the box .
Because reflectix is reflective the sun is directed to strike the bottom and back of the tank , which would normally be in shadow .
We also lined the top edge of the box with foam insulating tape before putting the glass in place .
With all the parts in place and Caroline long gone , we put the collector to the test .
Our first full day of sunlight produced hot water and we were back in business .
This very batch collector served us all winter and is still in operation .
At night we took to covering the collector with a sleeping back to reduce heat loss , even so hot water was rare on winter mornings .
With the majority of the pipes inside the collector , we had no more frozen or burst pipes .
In the spring we encountered new and different challenges .
With longer and more intense sun exposure our homemade hot water heater has become almost too efficient .
Water is at scalding temperatures at the height of the day , and the CPVC hoses used for water intake and outlet have burst from heat and pressure !
We have come to the conclusion that metal pipes will be necessary , as well as an anti-scald system .
All in all we are happy with the performance of this collector .
I think it cost a little more than the first one , but it is much more efficient .
I would recommend it as an excellent source of hot water , or as a supplement to conventional water heating systems .
That 's not to say that hot water experiments do n't have their challenges !
Our homemade collector is under constant repair and revision .

Homemade Solar Shower
After our batch water heater was complete we built an outdoor solar shower right next to the collector .
We 've posted a series of construction photos that show how we built our solar shower .
Solar Hot Water Batch Collector Upgrade
Since the initial construction of our solar hot water heating system we 've made several adjustments to improve its functionality .
Our greatest challenge has been designing the collector to work in the extreme temperatures of the desert climate .

Tankless Water Heaters for Solar Hot Water Systems
Tankless water heaters are excellent for supplementing solar hot water systems and ensure hot water even on cloudy days .
When hooked into a homemade solar water heating system , a tankless water heater will boost water ( when necessary ) to the ideal temperature before it 's delivered to the faucet .
Tankless water heaters use propane or natural gas to instantly heat water , but only do so when the hot water has been turned on in the house and only heat water that is about to be used .
If the sun has sufficiently heated the solar water heater in a supplemented system , then the tankless water heater has no need to even turn on .
Even if you are not using a solar water heating system , a tankless water heater can help you to reduce your carbon footprint and take a stance against global warming .
The smallest tankless water heater can be bought for $ 400 to $ 500 , a modest investment when one considers the high environmental cost incurred by wasteful living .
The Alternative Energy Store offers both propane and natural gas tankless water heaters in a variety of sizes .

I ’m going to make a bold prediction .
Long after you and I are gone , HTML will still be around .
Not just in billions of archived pages from our era , but as a living , breathing entity .
Too much effort , energy , and investment has gone into developing the web ’s tools , protocols , and platforms for it to be abandoned lightly , if indeed at all .
Article Continues Below
Let ’s stop to consider our responsibility .
By an accident of history , we are associated with the development of an important tool our civilization will use to communicate for decades to come .
So , when we turn our minds , idly or in earnest , to improving HTML , we must understand just how far - reaching the ramifications of today ’s decisions may be .
HTML 5 , the W3C ’s recently redoubled effort to shape the next generation of HTML , has , over the last year or so , taken on considerable momentum .
It is an enormous project , covering not simply the structure of HTML , but also parsing models , error - handling models , the DOM , algorithms for resource fetching , media content , 2D drawing , data templating , security models , page loading models , client - side data storage , and more .
There are also revisions to the structure , syntax , and semantics of HTML , some of which Lachlan Hunt covered in “ A Preview of HTML 5 . ”
But for this article , let ’s turn solely to the semantics of HTML .
It ’s something I ’ve been interested in for many years , and something which I believe is fundamentally important to the future of HTML .
The BBC recently announced that they would drop the hCalendar microformat from their program listings , due to accessibility and usability concerns with the abbr design pattern .
This demonstrates that we have , beyond any doubt , pushed the semantic capability of HTML far past what was ever intended , and indeed , what is reasonably possible with the language .
We have simply run out of HTML elements and attributes with which to mark up more richly semantic documents .
If we continue to be clever with the existing constructs of HTML , more problems such as this will arise .
But HTML suffers from a fundamental defect as a semantic markup language — its semantics are fixed , not extensible .
This is not simply a theoretical problem .
Hundreds of thousands of developers use the class and id attributes of HTML to create more richly semantic markup .
( They also use them as “ hooks ” for CSS styling , but that ’s another matter . )
Almost invariably , those developers use ad hoc vocabularies — that is , values they have made up , rather than values taken from existing schemas .
It ’s pseudo semantic markup at best .
Many pages around the web use microformats to add more structured semantics than available in HTML ’s impoverished set of elements and attributes .
In this case , the values used for the class attribute come from agreed - upon vocabularies , sometimes adopted from other standards , such as vCard , sometimes from newly minted vocabularies where no solid pre-existing standard exists ( as is the case for hReview ) .
Extensible semantics #section2
There is a very real problem that needs to be solved here .
We need mechanisms in HTML that clearly and unambiguously enable developers to add richer , more meaningful semantics — not pseudo semantics — to their markup .
This is perhaps the single most pressing goal for the HTML 5 project .
But it ’s not as simple as coming up with a mechanism to create richer semantics in HTML content : there are significant constraints on any solution .
Perhaps the biggest one is backward compatibility .
The solution ca n’t break the hundreds of millions of browsing devices in use today , which will continue to be used for years to come .
Any solution that is n’t backward compatible wo n’t be widely adopted by developers for fear of excluding readers .
It will quickly wither on the vine .
The solution must be forward compatible as well .
Not in the sense that it must work in future browsers — that ’s the responsibility of browser developers — but it must be extensible .
We ca n’t expect any single solution we develop right now to solve all imaginable and unimaginable future semantic needs .
We can develop a solution that can be extended to help meet future needs as they arise .
These two constraints in tandem , present a huge challenge .
But in the context of a language whose major iterations arrive a decade apart , and whose importance as a global platform for communication is paramount , this is a challenge that must be solved .
So , how is HTML 5 addressing this issue ?
HTML 5 introduces a number of new elements .
Some of these are what I ’ve termed “ structural ” — section , nav , aside , header , and footer .
The dialog element is a kind of content element , akin to blockquote .
There are also a number of data elements , such as meter , which “ represents a scalar measurement within a known range , or a fractional value ; for example disk usage , ” and the time element , which represents a date and / or a time .
While these elements might be useful , and seem to have generated some interest , do they really solve the problem we ’ve identified , particularly within the twin constraints of forward and backward compatibility ?
Let ’s consider each constraint .
Backward compatibility #section3
How do current browsers handle these new elements , such as section ?
Well , the most recent versions of Safari , Opera , Mozilla , and even IE7 will all render a page as follows .
< h1 > Top Level Heading </ h1 > < section > < h1 > Second Level Heading </h1 > < p > this is text in a section element </ p> < section > < h1 > Third Level Heading </h1 > </ section > </section >
It looks like an excellent start .
But when we try styling , for example , section elements with CSS that looks like this :
section {color : red}
… most of the above - mentioned browsers manage to style the element , but IE7 ( and so presumably 6 ) do not .
So we have a serious backward compatibility issue with 75 % of browsers currently in use .
Given the half - life of Internet Explorer , we can predict that most users will be using IE6 or IE7 even several years from now .
If HTML 5 introduces these new elements , what is the likelihood they ’ll be implemented by the vast majority of developers — given the knowledge that they ’re essentially incompatible with the majority of browsers in use ?
Unfortunately , if you are looking for alternative solutions to the CSS problem , putting class attributes on your section elements and then trying to style them using the class value wo n’t work in IE .
Perhaps there is some kind of workaround out there , but unless there is , that looks like a deal breaker right there .
Let ’s turn to forward compatibility , the second constraint .
Forward compatibility #section4
We ’ll start by posing the question : “ why are we inventing these new elements ? ”
A reasonable answer would be : “ because HTML lacks semantic richness , and by adding these elements , we increase the semantic richness of HTML — that ca n’t be bad , can it ? ”
By adding these elements , we are addressing the need for greater semantic capability in HTML , but only within a narrow scope .
No matter how many elements we bolt on , we will always think of more semantic goodness to add to HTML .
And so , having added as many new elements as we like , we still wo n’t have solved the problem .
We do n’t need to add specific terms to the vocabulary of HTML , we need to add a mechanism that allows semantic richness to be added to a document as required .
In technical terms , we need to make HTML extensible .
HTML 5 proposes no mechanism for extensibility .
HTML 5 , therefore , implements a feature that breaks a sizable percentage of current browsers , and does n’t really allow us to add richer semantics to the language at all .
Several questions remain about the new elements .
Where have these new element names come from ?
How was it decided that there should be a navigation element , and that it should be called “ nav ” ?
Why should the same term apply to page - level , site - level , and meta - site - level navigation ?
Why not adopt an existing vocabulary , such as Docbook ?
Its document structure vocabulary is far richer and it ’s been developed by publishing experts over many years .
This is not an argument in favor of Docbook , specifically : the point is that the extremely important task of providing a mechanism for semantic richness in HTML is being approached in an ad hoc way , paying apparently little attention to best practices in related work going back 30 years or more .
( The original work on GML began in the early 1970s . )
Some thoughts on a solution #section5
So , having been critical of current efforts , do I have any practical suggestions on how to solve this problem ?
Well , I have the start of one .
If adding elements to HTML is out of the question , at least within the parameters of this discussion , attributes are the other logical area of HTML to concentrate on .
After all , for nearly a decade , we ’ve been using class and id attributes as mechanisms to extend the semantics of HTML .
A great many developers are familiar and comfortable with this .
The microformats project demonstrated that the existing attributes of HTML are not sufficient , as a generalized mechanism , to extend the semantics of HTML .
So , if we are to use attributes to help solve this problem , we need to come up with one or more new attributes .
Before we get into the mechanics of how that might work , it ’s only fair to subject this suggestion to the same requirements we have for the new elements of HTML 5 .
Most importantly , is introducing new attributes to HTML backward compatible ?
And if so , does it provide a workable mechanism for semantic extensibility in HTML ?
Let ’s invent a new attribute .
I ’ll call it “ structure , ” but the particular name is n’t important .
We can use it like this :
< div structure = “ header ” >
Let ’s see how our browsers fare with this .
Of course , all our browsers will style this element with CSS .
div {color : red}
But how about this ?
div[ structure ] { font - weight : bold}
In fact , almost all browsers , including IE7 , style the div with an attribute of structure , even if there is no such thing as the structure attribute !
Sadly , our luck runs out there , as IE6 does not .
But we can use the attribute in HTML and have all existing browsers recognize it .
We can even use CSS to style our HTML using the attribute in all modern browsers .
And , if we want a workaround for older browsers , we can add a class value to the element for styling .
Compare this with the HTML 5 solution , which adds new elements that cannot be styled in Internet Explorer 6 or 7 and you ’ll see that this is definitely a more backward - compatible solution .
Extensibility through attributes #section6
Instead of new elements , HTML 5 should adopt a number of new attributes .
Each of these attributes would relate to a category or type of semantics .
For example , as I ’ve detailed in another article , HTML includes structural semantics , rhetorical semantics , role semantics ( adopted from XHTML ) , and other classes or categories of semantics .
These new attributes could then be used much as the class attribute is used : to attach to an element semantics that describe the nature of the element , or to add metadata about the element .
This is not dissimilar to the role attribute of XHTML , but rather than having a single attribute “ bucket ” for all element semantics , we should identify the different types of semantics for an element , and separate them out .
For example , the XHTML role attribute works like this :
< ul role =" navigation sitemap " > < li href = " downloads " >
Downloads </li > < li href = " docs " > Documentation < / li > < li href = " news " >
News</li></ul>
The values of the role attribute are a space - separated list of words from the default vocabulary , or from a defined vocabulary .
Why not simply adopt the role attribute as - is ?
Well , there are other kinds of semantics for which the term role does n’t apply .
For example :
< p rhetoric= " irony " >
He ’s a fantastic person .
</ p>
This demonstrates a theoretical type of semantics — “ rhetoric , ” which could be used to markup the rhetorical nature of a document .
This element clearly does n’t play the role of irony in the document .
Rather , the contents of the element are ironic .
Here is another example .
It ’s increasingly obvious that HTML lacks a way to attach a machine readable version of a humanly readable value , e.g. , a date .
This is at the heart of the problem the BBC has with the hCalendar microformat that we referred to earlier .
While < span role =
“ 2009-05-01 ” >
May
Day next year really does n’t make sense , something along the lines of < span equivalent =
“ 2009-05-01 ” >
May Day next year would .
Again , whether we use the specific term “ equivalent ” or some other term for this kind of semantic attribute is not the issue .
What ’s important to note is that it ’s not as simple as using either the class attribute or the role attribute as a one - size - fits - all bucket to hold semantic information .
For a properly extensible solution that provides backward compatibility and sufficient flexibility , a solution along these lines looks worth investigating .
I titled this section “ some thoughts on a solution ” because a significant amount of work needs to be done to really develop a workable solution .
Open questions include the following .
How many distinct semantic attributes should there be ?
Should these categories be extensible , and if so , how ?
How are vocabularies determined ?
Do we simply invent the terms we want , in much the same way that developers have been using class values , or should the possible values all be determined by a standardized specification ?
Or should there be a mechanism for inventing ( and hopefully sharing ) vocabularies , using some kind of profile ?
values , or should the possible values all be determined by a standardized specification ?
Or should there be a mechanism for inventing ( and hopefully sharing ) vocabularies , using some kind of profile ?
If we have a conflict between two vocabularies , such that two identical terms are defined by two different vocabularies , how is this resolved ?
Do we need a form of name spacing , or does some other mechanism exist ?
Rather than rushing to answer these questions , I ’m posing them to highlight the issues that need to be addressed , and to start a dialog .
The ramifications and reach of decisions made in HTML 5 are too great for decisions to be made in the absence of at least some input from those highly knowledgeable about linguistics , semantics , semiotics , and related fields .
Hopefully , if nothing else , then it ’s clear that simply “ making up new elements ” is n’t a solution to how to increase the semantic capacity of HTML .
Let ’s not rush into these decisions lightly — after all , with climate change we ’ve saddled our grandkids with enough trouble as it is .
Let ’s at least leave them the best possible HTML we can .
Plans by three television companies to launch a joint " video on demand " scheme would restrict competition in the UK , a Government watchdog said today .
The Competition Commission published provisional findings into its examination of " Project Kangaroo " - a venture by BBC Worldwide ( BBCW ) , ITV and Channel 4 ( C4C ) .
It found the scheme would result in a " substantial lessening " of competition in video on demand ( VOD ) services in the UK .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
But the project would not have a negative effect on online advertising or content acquisition , the Commission found .
UKVOD would create a " one- stop shop " for programmes on demand , giving viewers the chance to view recently - aired material as well as archive broadcasts .
The same " catch - up " services would remain in place via the individual broadcasters ' websites , so a key new element will be viewing archived programmes .
Competition Commission chairman Peter Freeman said : " Video on Demand is a relatively new and rapidly - expanding medium and UKVOD clearly has much to offer .
" However , we are concerned that a loss of rivalry between BBCW , ITV and C4C , who are normally regarded as close competitors , could restrict existing and future competition for VOD .
Whatever benefits viewers would gain from this rivalry would clearly be lost . "
The Commission said there could also be issues when the three broadcasters , which own most of the archived content in the UK , came to grant licences to use the material to third parties .
It is now inviting comments on how the loss of competition could be overcome .
New Year 's Eve — the most important drinking night of the year — is almost upon us !
What kind of party are you going to ?
Only five types exist , which I will detail for you after the jump .
Party Type 1 : Oh , This Is Nice
You usually end up at this party after Tanya can't come into town after all and cancels or you were just too darn busy to make good plans , real plans , ahead of time .
So you put on a sweater you got for Christmas or the cocktail dress you bought for Debbie 's engagement party that you never wore again , and drag some poor unwitting sap of a friend to the party where you do n't really know anyone .
It 's super awkward at first and you just stand by the cheese and crackers , nodding your head to the music , furtively gulping room - temperature chardonnay and furiously wishing for midnight .
That way you can hug and kiss the host — she 's Tom 's friend from work — on the cheek and be on your merry way .
What you forget , of course , is that everyone at this party is awkward , and everyone is furtively gulping booze so round about 11:15 er'body 's crunk and having deep , sloshy meaningful conversations with each other and your friend is making out with some dude in the hallway and it's sort of the best - slash - worst party you 've ever been to .
See , the key is to not expect much from New Year 's eve .
Then it has potential to be great fun .
Until you wake up the next morning and you vaguely remember telling that cute guy with the glasses about the time you peed your pants on the R train and you might have cried at one point and oh god you can never , ever see any of those people ever again .
Party Type 2 : There 's a Place Just a Few Blocks Up
Another product of poor planning .
You 've cobbled together a group of friends , some are visiting from out of town ! , and you 're psyched and ready to go except no one made dinner reservations and oh fuck are n't you supposed to like pay a hundred bucks to get inside a bar and stay there all night or something ?
No worries .
There 's this Italian place on 7th that 's always empty and maybe that bar we went to that time wo n't be so full .
What you end up doing is eating a hasty , bad , too - expensive meal then trudging from bar to bar to bar because everything is too crowded .
You 're blessed with one friend who keeps complaining that you guys are walking too fast and her shoes are killing her and another who is suspiciously shitfaced .
( The culprit is later revealed to be a well - hidden flask ) .
Then everyone gets mad and starts snapping at each other and someone finally yells " I just want to be somewhere , anywhere inside , at midnight .
Not wandering around on the street . "
So you go to the worst , first bar you can find and have a couple beers and hug meekly at twelve then drink some more , and then the secret ninja drunk is trying to coax a stranger at the bar to do untoward things so it 's time to take them home and who 's going where and let 's split cabs maybe ?
No ?
OK , fine .
Good night .
Let 's actually make a plan next year , and ugh .
You hate New Year's .
It 's never what you want it to be .
Party Type 3 : At the Clurrrrrb
You paid $ 150 for an unlimited fount ( if you can ever actually get to the bar ) of watered - down well vodka and sodas !
There are swirling lights and meaty guys with shimmer - shirts fist pumping and yelling " you my boy ! " or " Ima wreck you , son ! " and zomg , Kim Kardashian or someone is hosting !
These are the worst kind of New Year 's Eve parties , in my opinion , because you 're trapped in a terrible place with terrible people but you spent all this money and what else would you be doing anyway ?
( see above )
The celebrity - hosted ones ( though they may be in short supply this year ) are the worst because they 're getting paid a ton to be there and act like they 're having fun , while you are paying a ton to be there and act like you 're having fun .
Will you be enjoying New Year 's Eve this year at Marquee in New York City ?
The celebrity emcee is none other than Dancing With the Stars runner - up and Wedding in Las Vegas megastar Mario Lopez .
Your straight boyfriend will just love that , wo n't he .
Disco dancin ' while some half - a- fag Carebear stares his dimples at all the ladays .
Enjoy it .
Party Type 4 : Oh , We Went to Bed at 11
This is mostly your parents .
Or it was mostly your parents and , shriek ! , now it 's you .
You are tired and who wants to spend the money anyway .
You put the bottle of champagne that someone brought over for a party months ago into the freezer and sit on the couch watching Father of the Bride : Part II , flicking back occasionally to the Dick Clark / Ryan Seacrest annual Times Square is a Miserable Shithole Rockin '
Eve and vow to stay up and watch the ball drop and call your friends ( or kids ) who are out enjoying themselves .
Maybe you 're with one other person , I dunno .
What ends up happening is that you fall asleep on the couch , snore through midnight , wake up with a start at 1:15 , turn off the TV ( which is now showing a M * A * S * H rerun ) , and shuffle off to bed .
The next day you 'll spend some time cleaning the broken champagne bottle glass out of the freezer then walking around the corner to get a bagel .
It 'll be like the opening in Shaun of the Dead when he does n't realize everyone else is zombies .
An empty , slightly destroyed cityscape and just you alone , strolling along .
Because you did n't go out last night .
And you 're not sure if you 're sad about it .
Party Type 5 : Auld Lang Syne
And then sometimes it just works out .
Your house party is awesome and everyone comes and has a great time .
Or it was just the perfect bar .
Or the couch was just fine and you ( and , if you 're lucky , someone special ) curled up and enjoyed being home .
And then at midnight everyone around you felt very close by , and those who could n't make it felt very far away , and you smiled and hugged and maybe sang and just gushed about how wonderful New Year 's is , really how wonderful .
When else throughout the year , throughout life , do we ever all gather to celebrate the passing of time , rather than mourn it ?
It 's a good , ancient thing .
And something we should do more often .
Or maybe you 're just drunk and it 's just another nice night .
And that 's enough to be happy for .
The Ubuntu Linux distribution has attracted a broad audience of Linux enthusiasts , and it 's beginning to gain traction among mainstream computer users .
Although Ubuntu is relatively new , it builds on the rich history and deep roots of the venerable Debian project , one of the oldest and most influential Linux distributions .
The fate of the two popular flavors of Linux is as inextricably bound as their respective histories .
Although Debian is an extremely important part of Ubuntu 's past and future , many new Ubuntu users know little about Ubuntu 's roots and the nature of the relationship between the two distributions .
In response to the numerous e-mails that I 've received from inquisitive readers who are new to Linux and Ubuntu , this overview offers my own perspective on the importance of Debian and the role that Ubuntu plays in the Debian ecosystem .
Welcome to history class .
Debian : a strong foundation , a few cracks
Debian , which was founded by Ian Murdock in 1993 , offers several important advantages over competitors .
It has an extremely powerful package management system and a rich selection of available software .
Recent counts show that the latest stable version has over 20,000 packages in the main repository and the latest unstable development version has almost 30,000 .
Another key factor that differentiates Debian from many other distributions is its strong philosophical commitment and community - oriented development model , which are codified in the Debian Social Contract and Debian Free Software Guidelines .
Debian is vendor - neutral and has high standards for transparency and democratic oversight .
Although Debian offers valuable advantages , the distribution has serious weaknesses , especially on the desktop .
Its lengthy development cycles — with releases every two or three years — make it a poor choice for users who want the latest software .
Debian is offered in three different flavors : stable , testing , and unstable .
Stable is used widely on servers , but many desktop users favor the testing or unstable versions because those provide more current packages .
Unfortunately , there is no guarantee that testing or unstable versions will be fully functional at any given time , and users must occasionally contend with serious unexpected breakage .
Debian 's ideological underpinnings are also occasionally an impediment rather than an asset .
The project 's commitment to democracy and intentional lack of strong centralized leadership sometimes cripples the decision - making process and contributes to an overall lack of direction .
Development efforts can be impaired or derailed by endless non-technical disputes over specific ideological issues .
In the past , some of the dysfunctional aspects of Debian 's governance model have alienated participants and compelled high - level contributors to abandon the project .
Other distributions are n't immune to problems of this nature , but the pervasiveness of strong ideological convictions within the Debian community make it especially vulnerable .
Ubuntu : building mountains by filling in the holes
The Ubuntu Linux distribution originally emerged in 2004 as a Debian derivative under the strong leadership of South African entrepreneur Mark Shuttleworth .
The raison d'etre of the Ubuntu project , which is developed through a collaborative effort between Shuttleworth 's company Canonical and volunteer community developers , is to deliver a modern Linux distribution that is truly competitive on the desktop and suitable for mainstream non-technical audiences .
Ubuntu places a strong emphasis on ease of use and adheres to a consistent time - based release cycle .
A new version is released like clockwork every six months on a schedule that is predictable and predefined .
This ensures that the project will never stagnate or leave users with outdated software .
The schedule is structured so it closely follows that of the GNOME project , the desktop environment that makes up the core of the Ubuntu software experience .
Ubuntu is typically released one month after a new version of GNOME .
Ubuntu 's birth was not a one - time fork of Debian .
The two distributions are still closely tied , and a significant portion of Ubuntu 's packages still come directly from upstream Debian .
During the earliest stage of every Ubuntu development cycle , new and updated packages are automatically imported into Ubuntu from Debian 's unstable branch .
The import process occurs in a steady stream until the import freeze date , which generally aligns with an Ubuntu alpha release .
After the import freeze , the packages in Ubuntu are hardened and tested extensively to ensure a higher level of reliability and robustness before the final release .
Viewed through the lens of its association with Debian , Ubuntu can be thought of as a series of Debian unstable snapshots that have been polished for general use .
On top of that Debian - derived foundation , the Ubuntu developers simplify installation and make the distribution easier to use on desktop computers .
Ubuntu has a user - friendly Live CD installer that provides a complete environment out of the box and does n't require the user to select individual packages or make any other choices .
Ubuntu also includes tools that make it easy to automatically install and configure proprietary hardware drivers , codecs , and other components that many users require .
These additions make Ubuntu a fully - functional desktop platform right out of the box with very little need for additional tweaking or manual configuration in most environments .
Ubuntu is an improvement in many ways , but Debian still offers certain advantages .
One of the downsides of Ubuntu 's time - based release management strategy is that sometimes useful updated packages do n't make the cut - off .
The rolling update model of Debian unstable ensures that it always provides the latest packages , albeit without any stability guarantees .
Another huge advantage of Debian is that it supports a multitude of architectures , whereas Ubuntu only officially supports standard desktop computers and ARM .
Friction
Ubuntu still depends heavily on upstream Debian in many ways , but the relationship between the two distributions has n't always been positive .
Ubuntu 's early successes put some strain on its ties with Debian and led to accusations of parasitism and inadequate reciprocation .
The Ubuntu community has taken important steps over the years to ease tensions and address the conflict .
When the controversy first began to emerge in 2005 , Debian founder Ian Murdock commented that the mutual success of Debian and Ubuntu would depend on the ability to ensure ongoing compatibility and collaboration between the distributions .
" If Ubuntu is part of the Debian family , then we all win if Ubuntu is a success .
However , we all win if and only if Ubuntu remains a good son .
My concern is that it 's already starting to show signs of becoming the wayward variety , flush with confidence from early successes and starting to wonder if it no longer needs its parent , " he wrote .
" If Debian is to benefit from Ubuntu , the lineage has to be preserved , and it has to be stronger than 'we started with your pile of packages ' . "
Shuttleworth shared this view to a great extent and emphatically agreed that collaboration was and is the only way forward .
" I'm of the opinion that Ubuntu could not exist without Debian .
So it 's absolutely my intention to see that Ubuntu is a constructive part of the broader Debian landscape , " Shuttleworth wrote several years ago .
" It 's vital that Ubuntu help to sustain and grow Debian , because it's the breadth and strength of Debian which make up the ' shoulders of greatness ' on which we in the Ubuntu community stand when we reach for the stars . "
The two disagreed on several key technical issues , however , as illustrated by their different opinions about the way to address interoperability issues .
Murdock took the lead role in the DCC Alliance , an organization that was founded jointly by Debian and several derivatives with the aim of establishing an interoperable LSB - compliant common core for Debian distributions .
Murdock hoped that this would guarantee compatibility between all Debian - based distributions and prevent the imminent balkanization that he feared .
This plan was misguided on several different levels and its technical failings finally led to its collapse .
Shuttleworth correctly predicted many of those problems and participated on the fringe without committing to adhere to the DCC standards .
There have also been several initiatives in both communities to increase collaboration , but these have n't been particularly successful .
On the Debian side , the Utnubu project ( " Ubuntu " backwards ) was established to help bring Ubuntu packages into Debian .
On the Ubuntu side , the Debian Collaboration Team ( DCT ) had similar goals .
Neither of these gained much momentum , but they demonstrate the willingness on both sides to make collaboration work better .
Building closer ties
What finally helped improve relations was a change in culture within the Ubuntu community .
A higher emphasis was placed on contributing to Debian and some individual Ubuntu teams began working with upstream Debian developers on specific projects .
Ubuntu developers actively encourage contributors to file bug reports upstream where applicable and to participate directly in Debian development .
There is also increasingly healthy collaboration in certain areas , such as with Python packaging .
A joint packaging effort between the two distros was also recently announced for the transition to Mono 2.0 .
Canonical 's broader upstream contributions are also helping to ease tension in some ways .
The proprietary status of the Launchpad development platform that is used extensively by Ubuntu was one particularly thorny issue .
This problem was addressed earlier this year when Shuttleworth revealed that the entire Launchpad stack will be open source within the next year .
Canonical is also working with other members of the upstream community on some specific usability enhancement projects , such as a new notification system .
Although Ubuntu and Debian have largely reconciled their differences , the relationship between the two distributions is n't perfect and both Canonical and the Ubuntu community likely still have some work to do before they can completely transcend the perception that Ubuntu is n't giving enough back .
Ubuntu was made possible by the powerful legacy of Debian , and it continues to rely on the strength of Debian 's diverse community to fuel its own advancement .
Ubuntu 's popularity has helped to increase the visibility of Debian , and the Ubuntu developers have gradually been aiding Debian more directly through collaborative technical efforts .
Understanding Debian and its goals , values , and strengths will help to illuminate where Ubuntu came from and where it is going .
KABUL ( Reuters ) - The United States is aiming to send 20,000 to 30,000 extra troops to Afghanistan by the beginning of next summer , the chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff said on Saturday .

Washington is already sending some 3,000 extra troops in January and another 2,800 by spring , but officials previously have said the number would be made up to 20,000 in the next 12 to 18 months , once approved by the U.S. administration .
“ Some 20 to 30,000 is the window of overall increase from where we are right now .
I do n’t have an exact number , ” Admiral Mike Mullen told reporters in Kabul .
“ We ’ve agreed on the requirement and so it ’s really clear to me we ’re going to fill that requirement so it ’s not a matter of if , but when , ” he said .
“ We ’re looking to get them here in the spring , but certainly by the beginning of summer at the latest . ”
U.S. Army General David McKiernan , the commander of international forces in Afghanistan , has asked for the extra troops to combat a growing Taliban insurgency in the east and south of Afghanistan .
U.S. President - elect Barack Obama has pledged a renewed focus on Afghanistan , where U.S. - led forces toppled the Taliban government in late 2001 after the September 11 attacks .
The United States now has some 31,000 troops in Afghanistan .
After the January deployment , most of the reinforcements are to be sent to southern Afghanistan to bolster mainly British , Canadian and Dutch troops who have suffered heavy casualties in the last two years fighting in the Taliban heartland .
“ That ’s where the toughest fight is , ” Mullen said .
“ When we get additional troops here , I think the violence level is going to go up .
The fight will be tougher . ”
He said beefing up U.S. forces in Afghanistan was linked to winding down in Iraq .
“ Available forces are directly tied to forces in Iraq .
As we look to the possibility of reducing forces in Iraq over the course of the next year , the availability of forces to come here in Afghanistan will increase , ” Mullen said .
INDIA -PAKISTAN
Mullen said the attacks by Islamist militants in Mumbai last month showed the need to reduce Indian tensions with Pakistan and that would help bring stability to Afghanistan .
“ That ’s another big piece of the strategy , what I would call regional focus to include Pakistan , Afghanistan and India ... leadership in all three of those countries to figure out a way to decrease tensions , not increase tensions , ” Mullen said .
He said the late arrival of winter this year had meant there were still significant flows of militants from the tribal belt along the Pakistani side of the border , but better cooperation with the Pakistani military was nevertheless helping .
“ We ’re not there , we still have a long way to go but we ’ve actually made a lot of progress , ” Mullen said .
Mullen said the Afghan government was not as strong as he had anticipated and engaging with tribal areas in remote parts of Afghanistan could be central to future operations .
“ We may have overstated the focus on the ability of the central government to have the kind of impact that we wanted given the history here in Afghanistan , ” Mullen said .
Mullen also said at the same time , more must be done to boost economic development in Afghanistan , one of the world ’s poorest countries , and to make the Afghan government more effective .
“ No amount of troops , no amount of time will provide a solution here without development , ” he said .
So there he was , minding his own business , doing his job at a Jacksonville , Fla .
Sam's Club , when Shane Rhiles was asked to take his shirt off .
Why ?
Because a customer found the shirt – with President Barack Obama 's face on it – offensive .
A story on Jacksonville 's Channel 4 says that Rhiles was told by a supervisor that a customer did n't like the shirt , so he needed to go home and change .
" I was like , ' Is it that serious ? ' "
Rhies told Channel 4 .
" She was like , ' Yes , because we do n't need any problems . '
I was like , ' Well he 's the 44th president of the United States of America . "
Overuse of " like " notwithstanding , it 's out of line when a customer can claim to be offended by a t - shirt of our president .
Especially when the shirt does n't say anything offensive , depict anything offensive , or have anything offensive on it at all .
" He 's our president – the first black president .
This is an accomplishment for many people , so I did n't want to take the shift off and I was n't going to take the shirt off , " said Rhiles .
So instead , submitting to Wal - Mart / Sam's Club fascism and oppression of his First Amendment rights ( see Correction below ) , Rhiles bought another shirt ( I hope he got the employee discount ) , and wore it over the anarchic , chaos - inducing Obama t- shirt .
Then he looked up Sam's Club dress code .
As far as t- shirts go , " associates may wear solid color T - shirts and denim shirts with logos as long as they do not contain messages that are offensive , crude or otherwise inappropriate . "
So , either some bigot or die - hard Republican was offended by the face of our new president ?
Did someone not like the shirt , because it reminded them that their guy did n't win ?
" Porn is for everyone , " says author Pamela Paul , whose new book , " Pornified , " details how the widespread use of pornography is changing American culture and relationships .
Paul expected to find pornography use mainly in the realm of " losers who could n't get a date " when she started researching the book .
Instead , she found that it was mainstream , bridging religious , ethnic , educational , and socio-economic barriers .
She was even more surprised , however , by how often pornography use ruins relationships , increases sexual dysfunction , and changes what men expect from women .
Paul spoke with Beliefnet recently about pornography addiction , how the internet has changed porn consumption , and what secular culture can learn from the way religious groups confront pornography use .
Paul will also lead a three - week dialogue group to answer questions and discuss with readers how pornography has transformed their own lives .
Honestly , I did n't think pornography was that huge an issue before I wrote this book .
I started writing this book before the Janet Jackson fiasco , before the Paris Hilton tapes .
I knew there was a lot of pornography out there , but I did n't think it was anything that affected my life or the lives of anyone I knew .
The question I wanted to ask was , " With all this pornography out there , does it have any effect ? "
I was absolutely shocked by what I found .
I talked to people whose lives were really destroyed by pornography .
Even the people who did n't bottom out -- total porn addiction , marriages breaking up , people losing their jobs , which did happen -- even the people who did n't go to that extreme were profoundly affected by porn .
Sometimes they realized they were , but often they did n't realize the effects pornography had on them .
Can you share an example ?
There was one woman who said to me , " I 'm totally fine with porn .
I think it 's fun , I look at it , my boyfriend looks at it . "
Half an hour into our phone conversation , she tells me that her boyfriend and she do not have good sex , that this is the first time she 's had a bad sexual relationship , that he looks at porn all the time , and that now she 's considering getting breast implants .
This is someone who seemed very bright and cheery about pornography , but if you scratch beneath the surface , you find out that 's not at all the case .
To answer your original question , given that everything was shocking to me -- and I do n't consider myself a naïve person -- I was shocked by the fact that so many men and women say that porn can help people sexually , that it helps them open up , that it 's fun and harmless , but at the same time men who were fans of pornography were reporting that their sex lives were damaged .
They had trouble maintaining erections , they were having trouble having intercourse with their wives , they simply could n't enjoy real human sexuality any more .
These men had programmed themselves to only sexually cue to computerized , commercialized pornography .
You mentioned that not everyone takes pornography to the extreme , but your book catalogs the stories of many people who do .
How do people go from being a casual consumer of an occasional pornographic magazine to someone who is addicted ?
I wrote a chapter about how pornography affects men and I went through the steps for how it affects casual users : it desensitizes them , then it escalates into more extreme and excessive interest .
And then I did a chapter on men who had completely bottomed out and were addicted to pornography .
And I went through the same steps .
It 's scary -- the casual user was showing the same effects , just to a lesser degree than the addict was .
I expected pornography fans to be very defensive about their use of pornography , and to a certain extent they were , but they were often happy about it and proud of it .
But when I asked them , " Do you think you could ever become addicted to porn ? " two - thirds of the men who did n't think they were addicted said , " Yeah , I could see that happening . "
Before the internet , I do n't think we would have had this problem .
So the internet has really changed things ?
There 's a chicken - and - egg conundrum of asking if the internet created this problem or if porn helped spread use of the internet .
It 's probably a combination .
We have internet pornography and satellite television pornography and DVD pornography , and it's all over the place and always available .
Fifteen years ago , someone might have picked up Playboy now and then , might have rented a videocassette -- these people have now become daily users .
The casual user has gone from someone who looks at a magazine on occasion or rents a video when he travels for business to someone who now spends half an hour or 45 minutes online a day .
There is n't , and that 's what is scary , too .
It was naïve on my part , but I thought , " It 's no one that I know , it 's no one who 's really well - educated or self - aware or who has been in a serious relationship .
Porn is for losers who can't get a date . "
And I thought porn was for kids -- a phase that all teenagers go through .
In fact , porn is for everyone ; everyone is using pornography .
I talked to people who were Ivy League - educated , people who were engaged , people who were married , people who were divorced , people who were parents of young children .
It went across all socio- economic , all racial , all ethnic , and all religious lines .
I spoke with men who consider themselves to be devout church - goers and one man who taught at a Jewish seminary .
I talked to a monk .
I talked to people of all kinds of backgrounds and beliefs , and they all used pornography .
Let 's look at religious people who use pornography .
Your statistic about the number of evangelical men who use pornography is surprisingly large .
What is going on there ?
I think they 're a lot more honest about it .
There was a 2000 survey that Focus on the Family did that found that 18 % of people who call themselves born - again Christians admit to looking at porn sites .
A chaplain named Henry Rogers who studies pornography estimates that 40 to 70 % of evangelical men say they struggle with pornography .
That might not mean that they look at it , but it might mean that they struggle to avoid looking at it .
By and large , religious people , particularly Christian people , are aware that this is an issue .
They 've addressed it much more than secular culture has .
That 's something that should change .
The truth is it does n't matter if you 're religious or if you 're secular -- the chances that you 'll look at porn are probably equal .
What can secular culture learn from the way the religious culture deals with pornography ?
The secular world can learn from religious groups that it needs to be discussed .
Everyone talks about how there 's so much porn out there , but do we talk about it being a problem ?
Do we talk about how it affects people ?
That 's something that in many ways , religious communities have been more proactive about .
I was surprised by how many of the women in your book seem to just accept pornography as part of their relationships .
I think a lot of women feel cowed by the attitude of a lot of men who use pornography -- that it 's a " guy thing " that they would n't understand .
There 's also the idea that being open and cool about porn is seen as sexy and hip .
Those messages are powerful and pervasive .
What does it take for someone to realize that they 're addicted to pornography ?
I spoke with probably two - dozen people who were addicted to pornography .
They talk about the denial going on for years .
I spoke to men who said they were n't addicted but who spent hours online , staying up till one or two o'clock in the morning looking at porn .
It 's like alcoholism in a lot of ways -- sometimes it takes a disaster to realize it , other times something triggers a reaction akin to shame or guilt .
With addicts , often , pornography crosses over to their real lives .
They may start going to prostitutes , hanging out in strip clubs , meeting women from sex chat rooms .
There were quite a few who found that their interest in adult pornography trickled down to an interest in looking at teens , and soon they found they were looking at child pornography .
For several of the men I talked to , that was a trigger for recovery .
What are some of the recovery methods that people go through ?
Is there anything like Pornography Anonymous ?
Yes .
There are a number of 12 - step groups , like Sexual Addicts Anonymous .
They 're not for pornography specifically , but they all essentially deal with pornography , or what comes afterward , since pornography will often trickle into real life .
And there are a number of religious organizations .
There 's Pure Life Ministries , and other churches that have created facilities for treatment for pornography addiction .
You point out that porn has become a free - speech issue , and liberals do n't focus on the issues involving degradation of women .
If pornography involved blacks or Jews or any other minority or group , I think that liberals would respond with outrage .
But it 's women and there 's been no response .
This may be because the anti-pornography argument has been adopted by groups that come across as reactionary or unrealistic .
Traditionally , there were two groups that were anti-pornography .
One was the religious right , who also said they were anti-sex education and anti-homosexuality , so liberals did n't want to associate with them .
On the other hand , feminists who were anti-pornography took a legal approach , and an approach that many other women thought was anti-men .
When those two groups aligned to fight pornography in the 1980s , a lot of liberals were turned off .
At the same time , the pro-pornography movement had a very strong argument that appealed to liberals .
It was about the First Amendment , civil rights , human rights .
It 's ironic , because they may be championing the rights of people to look at pornography , but they 're not championing the rights of women who are in pornography or the rights of people who do n't want pornography shoved in their face everywhere they turn .
Something like the movie " The People vs. Larry Flynt " would encourage any liberal to side with Larry Flynt .
It hugely distorts the issue .
We have spent so much time protecting the rights of people to look at pornography .
But we have spent no time protecting the right of people to speak out against pornography .
This is big business .
They have lawyers , they have advertising , they have lobbyists .
Pornography is a product , and there are billions of dollars at stake , and they have done an effective job at creating a message that says , " If you are open - minded , if you 're a patriot , if you believe in the Constitution and the Bill of Rights , then you 've got to defend pornography whether you like it or not . "
You write about how pornography does n't have the same restrictions that much of other media have , such as FCC regulations .
Why have n't more restrictions been put into place ?
First of all , it 's very important to remember that pornography is a kind of media and it's also a product -- and both of those things are regulated .
Media are regulated all the time -- the FCC regulates media , there are certain things that can't be shown to children , certain movies that can only be shown at certain times .
The only media that 's not regulated is pornography .
Pornography is also a product , like cigarettes are a product , alcohol is a product , aspirin is a product .
All of these things have zoning regulations , laws about how you can sell it , who you can sell it to .
But when it comes to pornography , we say , " No , no , no , you 've got to have unregulated pornography , otherwise you 're interfering . "
The idea that pornography should n't be regulated is ludicrous .
There have been a lot of convoluted decisions on pornography by the Supreme Court .
Some of the [ 1972 case ]
Miller vs. California definitions of porn still stand -- they define pornography as something that has no cultural or aesthetic or social value , and say that kind of material should be regulated by a local community .
But what is a local community in the age of the internet ?
It becomes very difficult to enforce .
But to be honest , I do n't think we 've made a big effort .
Do you hope your book will bring pornography more into public discussion ?
People need to know that pornography is not harmless entertainment .
They need to hear that from the people who know it best -- the people who use pornography .
Cigarettes were once extolled by doctors and glamorized in the movies .
Cigarette smoking was something to aspire to .
We 've gotten to that point with pornography .
But once people know that cigarette smoking is n't very good for you , the consumption started to decline .
My hope would be that that would happen with pornography .
LOS ANGELES ( AP ) 
A homeless man has been sentenced to nearly four years in prison and ordered to pay more than $ 101 million for starting two fires , including one that burned more than 163,000 acres in California two years ago .
Fifty - year - old Steven Emory Butcher was convicted in February of starting blazes in the Los Padres National Forest in 2002 and 2006 .
The 2006 fire raged for more than a month and cost more than $ 78 million to suppress .
It injured 18 people , destroyed 11 structures and was the fifth - largest fire in California history , according to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection .
The 2002 blaze burned 70 acres .

Two new studies suggest that male circumcision may assist in the prevention of human papillomavirus ( HPV ) infection , particularly infection with the high - risk subtypes associated with cervical , penile , and other cancers .
Both studies are published in the January 1 issue of The Journal of Infectious Diseases , now available online .
High - risk subtypes of HPV have been estimated to be present in 99.7 percent of cervical cancers worldwide .
Evidence has shown that women with circumcised partners have a reduced risk for genital cancer .
Two new studies sought to discover if HPV infection is more likely to occur in uncircumcised compared with circumcised men .
Bertran Auvert MD , PhD , and his team of researchers in France and colleagues from South Africa studied data from a trial conducted in Orange Farm , South Africa .
Uncircumcised men aged 18 - 24 years were randomized into either an intervention group , to be circumcised , or a control group , to remain uncircumcised .
During this study , urethral swab samples were collected and analyzed for presence of HPV among men followed up for 21 months .
Information about sexual behavior was also collected .
Dr. Auvert and colleagues found that the percentage of high - risk HPV genotypes was lower in the circumcised group than in the control group .
The most important implication , according to researchers , was that “ reducing the frequency of HPV infection among men will reduce the risk of exposure in their female sexual partners . ”
A second study by Carrie Nielson PhD , at the Oregon Health & Science University and colleagues at the University of Arizona , H. Lee Moffitt Cancer Center and Research Institute , and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention tested more than four hundred men aged 18 - 40 years in two U.S. cities during 2002 - 2005 .
Sixteen percent of participants were uncircumcised .
Researchers tested for HPV in skin swabs of the anogenital area and semen samples in participants with no HPV symptoms ( such as warts or lesions ) .
Investigators found that circumcised men were about half as likely to have HPV as uncircumcised men , after adjustment for other differences in the two groups .
These results demonstrated that lack of circumcision is associated with cervical cancer because of the increased risk of HPV infection .
Nielson suggested that it may be useful to consider circumcising newborn boys in order to decrease the risk of HPV infection for them and their future partners .
“ Parents are not currently advised of this risk , ” she said .
“ These studies contribute to the evidence that might help to inform that decision . ”
In an accompanying editorial , Ronald H. Gray , MD , of Johns Hopkins University , said that the evidence was persuasive but not entirely consistent and that it may be premature to promote circumcision as a way to prevent HPV infection in men and to protect female sex partners from infection .
He advised that policy decisions should await results from two ongoing trials of male circumcision .
Alternatively , Gray noted that consistent evidence has suggested that male circumcision reduces the frequency of HIV infection in men .
He also pointed out that because of the lack of conclusive data relating circumcision and prevention of HPV , Medicaid does not cover circumcision costs , which may account for a decline in neonatal circumcisions in the United States .
According to Dr. Nielson , the findings they reported present compelling arguments to promote male circumcision in developing countries where circumcision is not widely used and the HIV epidemic is severe .
Additionally , she said , it is “ the first clear demonstration of the indirect but substantial beneficial effect of male circumcision for women . ”
The authors of both studies and the editorialist agreed that more studies will be needed to confirm the efficacy of male circumcision in HPV prevention .
GOP Judge Gives Bush a Gitmo Victory Civil libertarians hailed last June ’s U.S. Supreme Court ruling requiring habeas corpus hearings to justify indefinite detentions at Guantanamo Bay , but there remained the question of which federal judges would hear the evidence .
It was clear that many would be right - wing Republican appointees .

Printer friendly A Dec. 30 ruling by U.S. District Judge Richard J. Leon – siding with the Bush administration regarding two alleged “ enemy combatants ” – underscores that problem .
Leon is a longtime Republican legal operative who believes in expansive executive power ( at least when the GOP has the White House ) and who has covered up past crimes implicating Republicans .
In an earlier ruling , on Nov. 20 , Leon did surprise the Bush administration when he decided that the evidence against five Algerians was so thin he could n’t accept their “ enemy combatant ” designation .
But Leon was back on board Dec. 30 with a judgment that a Yemeni and a Tunisian could be held indefinitely based -- in large part -- on secret evidence that the accused were not permitted to see .
Some concerns about the injustices of President George W. Bush ’s “ enemy combatant ” cases may be lessened by the inauguration of Barack Obama in three weeks , assuming the incoming President lives up to his word about closing Guantanamo and renouncing Bush ’s grandiose presidential powers .
However , if the process continues as currently structured , the right - wing ideological bent of the federal judiciary could become a factor in determining whether meaningful justice will be granted to people swept up in Bush ’s “ war on terror . ”
Leon is a good example of the partisan GOP judges who now stock the federal judiciary – after 20 years of Republican control of the presidency out of the past 28 years .
Since these judges have lifetime appointments , their ideological tendencies are sure to shape American jurisprudence far into the future despite the Democrats ’ new - found control of the White House and Congress .
Leon ’s History
In view of Leon ’s latest ruling – and what will surely be the long - term Republican dominance of the Judiciary – we are republishing parts of a story we wrote last month about Leon ’s troubling record : Earlier in his career – before getting appointed to the bench by George W. Bush in 2002 – Leon had been one of the most reliable Republican legal apparatchiks , skilled in steering investigations toward a desired partisan outcome , whatever the facts and the evidence might be .
So , in 1987 , when Rep. Dick Cheney and his legal adviser David Addington were defending President Ronald Reagan and Vice President George H.W. Bush in the congressional Iran - Contra investigation – and devising legal arguments about inherent presidential powers – Richard Leon was there as a Republican senior counsel .
In 1992 , when a House task force was examining evidence that Reagan and Bush began their secret contacts with Iran ’s Islamic regime in 1980 while trying to unseat President Jimmy Carter , Leon was the Republican point man to make sure nothing too damaging came out .
Later in the 1990s , after Bill Clinton became President , Leon served as special counsel to the House Banking Committee for a highly partisan investigation that transformed Clinton ’s minor Whitewater real estate deal into a big scandal .
In other words , if there was a politically sensitive probe that needed the answer to come out a certain way for Republicans , Richard Leon was one of their top go - to guys .
Even as a federal judge , Leon reliably leaned the Republican way .
He opposed the idea of having civilian judges handle cases regarding the indefinite incarceration of terror suspects whom President Bush had locked up at Guantanamo .
However , on Nov. 20 , after a closed - door habeas corpus hearing where the Bush administration presented its secret evidence against six Algerian men , Leon ordered five of them released and blasted the weakness of the evidence .
Though still criticizing the U.S. Supreme Court for requiring the government to show cause for keeping detainees locked up , Leon nevertheless added about the government ’s evidence , “ to rest [ the men ’s continued imprisonment ] on so thin a reed would be inconsistent with this court ’s obligation . ”
Leon said the government ’s case , accusing five of the Algerians of planning to fight American troops in Afghanistan , relied on information from a single unnamed source .
However , Leon agreed to the continued incarceration of the sixth Algerian because Leon felt there was sufficient corroboration of that man ’s links to al - Qaeda .
Counted as Lucky
Yet before the ruling was handed down , the Bush administration must have counted itself lucky to have drawn Leon for 24 of the habeas corpus hearings .
Leon had a long record of protecting the flanks of powerful Republicans caught up in national security scandals .
In 1987 , when President Reagan faced accusations that he authorized an off - the - books operation to send illicit assistance to the Nicaraguan contra rebels and to illegally ship military hardware to Iran , Leon stepped forward as deputy chief counsel on the Republican side of the Iran - Contra investigation .
There , Leon worked with Dick Cheney , then a Wyoming congressman , fending off accusations of Reagan ’s wrongdoing .
They even came up with a counter - argument that accused Congress of intruding on the foreign policy prerogatives of the President .
“ Congressional actions to limit the President in this area … should be reviewed with a considerable degree of skepticism , ” the Republican minority report said .
“ If they interfere with the core presidential foreign policy functions , they should be struck down . ”
In 2005 , when Cheney was defending his concept of George W. Bush ’s nearly unlimited powers during wartime , the Vice President harkened back to that Iran - Contra minority report .
“ If you want reference to an obscure text , go look at the minority views that were filed with the Iran - Contra committee , ” Cheney told a reporter .
Cheney said those old arguments “ are very good in laying out a robust view of the President ’s prerogatives with respect to the conduct of especially foreign policy and national security matters . ”
One could say that Richard Leon – along with David Addington , now Cheney ’s chief of staff , another strong advocate of expansive executive powers – was there at the birth of what became George W. Bush ’s imperial presidency .
October Surprise Case Leon also came to the rescue in 1992 when evidence was mounting that Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush had started their illicit contacts with Iran even earlier than the Iran - Contra deals , back to Campaign 1980 when they allegedly interfered with President Carter ’s efforts to gain the release of 52 U.S. hostages held by Islamic radicals in Iran .
To examine this so - called “ October Surprise ” case , the House approved creation of a task force headed by Democratic Rep. Lee Hamilton and Republican Rep. Henry Hyde .
Hamilton hired former prosecutor Lawrence Barcella as chief majority counsel and Hyde picked Richard Leon as chief minority counsel .
From the start , however , the investigation seemed more determined to debunk the allegations of Republican wrongdoing than to seriously assess the evidence .
At one point , I went to the task force ’s office and questioned Barcella and his assistant , Michael Zeldin , about this peculiar style of investigating .
Barcella and Zeldin pointed to Leon ’s insistence that interviews with witnesses be conducted only with him or another Republican present .
This stricture had sharply limited the task force ’s ability to follow leads and develop new witnesses .
Indeed , some key October Surprise witnesses described to me how Leon sought to intimidate them into retracting their allegations about Republican wrongdoing .
When these witnesses refused to alter their sworn testimony , they became the targets of the task force , more so than Reagan and Bush .
Jamshid Hashemi , an Iranian businessman who had assisted the Carter administration on the hostage issue in 1980 , alleged that he and his brother Cyrus Hashemi also helped Reagan ’s campaign chief William Casey arrange secret meetings with Iranian officials in Madrid in summer 1980 .
However , after Jamshid Hashemi gave his account to the task force in 1992 , he said Leon tried to pressure him to recant his allegations .
" I found this Mr. Leon – who I knew as the ' fat man ' – every time we had a break and my lawyer would go to the washroom , he would rush into my room where I was sitting and say , ' come on , change the story ' , " Jamshid Hashemi told me .
" I said I would not change my story at all .
The last time he opened the door , I said , ' Get out of my office .
If you have anything to say , say it in front of my lawyer . ’"
Hashemi said Leon , rather than task force chief counsel Barcella , appeared to be running the October Surprise investigation with the goal of protecting Republicans , rather than getting at the truth .
I received a similar account of Leon ’s behavior from former Israeli intelligence official Ari Ben-Menashe , who testified that he and other Israelis helped arrange a Paris meeting in October 1980 involving Casey , George H.W. Bush and key Iranians .
Ben -Menashe said Leon demanded that he alter his sworn testimony as well .
Recently , when I spoke with Ben-Menashe , he reaffirmed that account and described Leon as “ a Bush crony . ”
Strange Conclusions
So , despite substantial evidence of Reagan - Bush wrongdoing from more than a score of individuals , Leon helped persuade the task force to reject the October Surprise allegations , a finding made easier for the Democrats by their 1992 election victories that meant the end of the Reagan - Bush era .
Besides Hashemi and Ben-Menashe , the many individuals describing Republican guilt included : former Iranian president Abolhassan Bani-Sadr ( who sent the task force a detailed account of the Iranian - Republican contacts from his view in Tehran ) ; senior officials of the Palestine Liberation Organization who described overtures from Republicans seeking help in interfering in the hostage crisis ; and French intelligence chief Alexandre deMarenches ( who told his biographer about secret GOP - Iran hostage meetings in Paris , claims corroborated by other French intelligence officials ) .
Barcella told me years later that new evidence in support of the October Surprise allegations poured in late in the investigation , so much evidence that he urged Hamilton to extend the deadline for several months .
Hamilton , however , refused and ordered the probe wrapped up with a finding of Republican innocence .
Complications for Leon , Hamilton and the other debunkers continued to arise , however .
On Jan. 11 , 1993 , just two days before the task force ’s debunking report was scheduled for release , the Russian government sent an extraordinary report to Hamilton describing Moscow ’s internal intelligence on the controversy .
The Russian report described Republican meetings with Iranians in Europe , including Casey ’s trip to Madrid and the Paris meeting that the Russians also said involved George H.W. Bush and then - CIA officer Robert Gates ( now U.S. Defense Secretary ) .
Instead of making the Russian report public , the task force stuck it – and its startling information – in a cardboard box that was filed away with other classified and unclassified material from the investigation .
( I found the Russian report when I got access to the task force 's raw documents in 1994 . )
While hiding the Russian report and other evidence supporting the October Surprise allegations , the House task force released its negative findings on Jan. 13 , 1993 , and went on the attack against the witnesses who had rejected Leon ’s demands that they recant their testimony .
In January 1993 , task force leaks indicated that Jamshid Hashemi and Ari Ben-Menashe would be referred to the Justice Department for prosecution on perjury charges .
However , no such charges were ever filed .

Consistent Stories
Over the years , both Hashemi and Ben-Menashe have stuck to their stories .
When I re-interviewed Hashemi in 1997 about the October Surprise case , he said , " I thought it was my duty that the people in the United States should know .
They should know , they should be the judge of it . "
Though Hashemi sat through my interview with the same gentlemanly style that I encountered when I first met him in 1990 , he did flash with anger when I asked him about the House task force ’s report .
" Rubbish , that 's what I think , " steamed Hashemi .
" Just a whitewash of the whole situation .
It 's a cover - up . "
Hashemi argued that it made no sense for him to have invented his October Surprise account , which he repeated under oath to Congress in 1992 .
He had nothing to gain – and a great deal to lose , he said .
" Who has ever paid me a single dime ? " Hashemi asked .
" I had to pay all my lawyer 's fees .
What did I gain here ? "
Hashemi blamed the cover - up primarily on the attack strategy of Republican lawyers on the task force , particularly Richard Leon .
However , there were rewards in store for Leon .
After George W. Bush became President , grateful Republicans got Richard Leon a seat on the federal bench in Washington in 2002 .
As a District Court judge , Leon has performed as a reliably conservative jurist – at least until he surprised the Bush administration on Nov. 20 by ordering the release of those five Algerian “ terror suspects . ”
However , on Dec. 30 , with his latest ruling in support of the Bush administration , Leon appears to have returned to the fold .
Though it ’s impossible assess the quality of the administration ’s secret evidence against the two detainees – Moath Hamza Ahmed al Alwi of Yemen and Hisham Sliti of Tunisia – there will remain doubts about the hearing process as long as judges like Richard Leon are involved .

By way of Pandagon , I came across this incredible story from NPR’s This American Life , an hourlong report on , and interview with , the evangelical pastor Carlton Pearson .
Pearson was once one of the rising stars of the religious right : a hardcore Pentecostal preacher , head of an Oklahoma megachurch , a protege of Oral Roberts and a spokesman for George Bush ’s faith - based initiatives who had the ear of the White House under three different presidents .
He preached alongside Jerry Falwell , Jim Bakker , Pat Robertson and other leading lights of the evangelical world , hosted his own show on the Trinity Broadcasting Network , and founded Azusa , a wildly popular Christian festival that combined ministry and gospel music .
He had it all , and could have kept it all , except for one thing : a rebellion of conscience which convinced him that the Christianity he was teaching was morally wrong .
And for the sake of that conscience , he lost nearly everything .
I ’ve written before about fervent believers who ’ve become atheists , like the former Pentecostal preacher James Young ( An Inspiring Story ) , or the religion reporter William Lobdell ( Nothing Behind the Altar ) .
Pearson has n’t gone that far – he ’s still a Christian , though he now holds a universalist view he calls “ the gospel of inclusion ” .
But he ’s eliminated eternal damnation from his theology , and even that small step towards freethought was enough to get him branded a heretic and earn the scorn and exclusion of his former colleagues and friends .
In his youth , Pearson was a fiery Pentecostal ; he was hailed as a hero by his congregation after he exorcised demons out of his girlfriend at a revival meeting .
Of these days , he said in the interview , “ I expected demons .
I saw them everywhere , so that was part of my life …
The Devil was as present and as large as God .
He had the people .
He was ultimately going to get most of the people .
Demons were all over , in the church , in the schools , in the neighborhoods .
Everything was a devil .
So if you believe it , you experience it . ”
Pearson attended Oral Roberts University , where he joined the World Action Singers , a student choir that Roberts groomed to perform on the networks and other mainstream media .
He became a friend and protege of Oral Roberts himself , who called Pearson his “ black son ” .
He ultimately quit the group after battles with Roberts ’ son Richard Roberts , though he and Oral remained close .
After leaving ORU , Pearson founded his own church , Higher Dimensions .
Powered by his undisputed charisma , the church flourished and grew , reaching a membership of around 5,000 .
Other , still - influential megachurch preachers such as T.D. Jakes owe their success to Pearson ’s initial mentoring .
The turning point came in the late 1990s .
Pearson , until then , had preached a conventional evangelical theology – eternal damnation for sinners , hellfire and gnashing of teeth , and being born again in Jesus as the only way to be saved .
But a small seed of doubt was growing in him , and eventually it began to bloom .
In the interview , he describes his moment of epiphany while at home one night watching television , a news report about war and famine in Rwanda :
“ I ’m watching these little kids with swollen bellies , and it looks like their skin is stretched across their little skeletal remains , their hair is kind of red from malnutrition … the babies have got flies in the corners of their eyes and mouths , and they reach for their mother ’s breast and the mother ’s breast looks like a little pencil hanging there , and the baby ’s reaching for the breast , there ’s no milk …
“ I said , ‘ God , I do n’t know how you could call yourself a loving , sovereign God and allow these people to suffer this way and just suck them right into Hell , ’ which was my assumption .
“ … The way the God of the Bible , particularly the Old Testament , is presented : he ’s a monster .
The God we ’ve been preaching is a monster .
He ’s worse than Saddam , he ’s worse than Osama bin Laden , he ’s worse than Hitler , the way we ’ve presented him .
Because Hitler just burned six million Jews , but God ’s going to burn at least six billion people , and burn them forever .
He has this customized torture chamber , called Hell , where he ’s going to torment , torture .
Not for a few minutes or a few days or a few hours or a few weeks .
Forever . ”
Many Christian believers experience these flickers of conscience , but in Pearson ’s case , they became a full - blown crisis of faith .
Under the pressure , the content of his faith changed , and when he returned to his church , he brought a different message .
Now he said the Bible was “ not necessarily infallible or inerrant ” , that there was no eternal damnation , and that Jesus ’ sacrifice had redeemed all of humanity – Christians , atheists and everyone else – whether they believed in him or not .
Pearson ’s new gospel received a frosty reception .
Higher Dimensions ’ congregation dwindled from 5,000 to just 200 .
The church ’s other pastors resigned in protest .
Oral Roberts
University removed him from its board of regents , and influential evangelicals across the country denounced him .
Pearson became persona non grata with his own friends and colleagues ; to them , he says , it ’s “ like I died ” .
Even his parishioners – the ones who stayed – describe being accosted on the street or in the supermarket by friends or neighbors demanding to know why they were still attending a church that teaches such heresy .
Today Pearson is a minister in the United Church of Christ , using the rhythms and cadence of Pentecostalism to preach a new message of tolerance and unity .
His preaching attracts a new crowd – more liberal , more gay - friendly – and slowly , attendance has begun to inch upward again .
Pearson ’s story shows that the evangelical church , in its essence , is based on fear of Hell and not love of God .
Had he preached that some other church was not strict enough – that God was withholding salvation from some group formerly believed to be saved – I doubt anyone would have batted an eye .
But to widen the circle of the saved was , for his brethren , an intolerable heresy .
Theirs is a theology that elevates wrath over mercy , punishment over grace , and judgment over love .
One of Pearson ’s associate pastors admits as much , candidly saying that teachings about eternal torment and the Rapture did far more to fill the pews than teaching about love and forgiveness ever will .
More than anything else , evangelicals are united and motivated by belief in Hell .
Eternal torment lies at the heart of their faith ; it defines their self - image and forms the lens through which they view the world .
And there ’s a reason for that : in their theology , God ’s love is indiscriminate , but God ’s salvation is highly selective .
Their belief that they are saved and most people are not gives them a sense of privilege , of sanctification – a feeling that they possess something rare and precious .
Taking
Hell out of the equation directly threatens this belief – it threatens to make them no different from anyone else – which explains why the denunciations of Pearson by his fellow evangelicals were so swift and so vehement .
But despite its superficial advantage in motivating the flock , belief in hellfire more than loses out due to its horrendously evil implications .
Carlton Pearson has glimpsed a better way – rejecting the moral absurdity of a God who permits innocent humans to suffer indescribably , then casts them into eternal damnation .
He ought to take the next step and ask himself : why believe in a God that permits people , like those people in Rwanda , to suffer so terribly even during this life ?
The answer that humans do this to themselves is too facile .
Even if that is true , it would not excuse a deity with the power to help from the moral obligation of aiding the innocent .
Pearson has already had the strength of conscience and the basic honesty to reject so many of the old , inadequate apologetics .
Now he has the opportunity to go just a bit farther , to leave behind just a few more unnecessary beliefs , and follow many of his former colleagues into a better place : a garden of free thought and clear air , where all the supernaturalisms that plague us are finally left behind .

We are now entering the financial End Time .
Bailout “ Plan A ” ( buy the junk mortgages ) has failed , “ Plan B ” ( buy ersatz stocks in the banks to recapitalize them without wiping out current mismanagers ) is fizzling , and the debts still ca n’t be paid .
That is the reality Wall Street avoids confronting .
“ First they ignore you , then they denounce you , and then they say that they knew what you were saying all the time , ” said Gandhi .
The same might be said of today ’s overhang of debts in excess of the economy ’s ability to pay .
First the policy makers pretend that they can be paid , then they denounce the pessimists as spreading panic , and then they say that of course students have been taught for four thousand years now how the “ magic of compound interest ” keeps on doubling and redoubling debts faster than the economy can squeeze out an economic surplus to pay .
The amazing feature of today ’s crash is how many Wall Street firms actually believed that the game of musical financial chairs could go on before they had to stop dancing and indeed , escape from the room .
What has ended is the idea that “ the magic of compound interest ” can make economies rich without having to work and without industry .
I hope we have seen the end of derivatives formulae seeking to make money by playing in a zero - sum game .
A debt overhang always ends either in foreclosure of the debtor ’s property , or in a debt annulment to preserve the economy ’s overall freedom and equity .
This means that the postmodern economy as we know it must end – either in financial polarization and debt peonage to a new oligarchic elite , or in a debt cancellation , a Jubilee Year to rescue society .
But when the government says that it is reviewing “ all ” the options , this reality is not one of them .
Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson ’s first option was to buy packages of junk mortgages ( collateralized debt obligations , CDOs ) to save the wealthiest institutional investors from having to take a loss on their bad bets .
When this was not enough , he came up with “ Plan B , ” to give money to banks .
But whereas Britain and European countries talked of nationalizing banks or at least taking a controlling interest , Mr. Paulson gave in to his Wall Street cronies and promised that the government ’s stock purchases would not be real .
There would be no dilution of existing shareholders , and the government ’s investment would be non-voting .
To cap the giveaway to his cronies , Mr. Paulson even agreed not to ask executives to give up their golden parachutes , exorbitant annual bonuses or salaries .
Plan A ( the $ 700 billion to buy mortgage - backed junk that the private sector will not buy ) failed partly because it let financial institutions avoid putting a fair value on the debt packages they were selling .
Instead of telling the truth about their financial position by marking assets to market prices ) , they can “ mark to model , ” Enron - style .
We have seen the result : A solid week of plunging stock market prices .
The public media call this a panic , but there is nothing irrational about it .
Who in their right mind would buy securities or buy into a bank without knowing what the securities were worth ?
Faith in junk mathematical models has ended .
So we still await a public response to the problem of how to write down debts .
Whose economic interest will have to give : that of debtors , as increasingly has been the case over the past eight centuries ; or that of creditors , which have fought back to create a neoliberal economy controlled by the FIRE sector ?
It is not too late to decide which road to take , but Wall Street bankers and creditors have taken the lead in positioning themselves .
Seeing which way the political winds were blowing , they moved to empty out the Treasury before the November 3 elections much like medieval citizens fleeing a horde of Mongolian raiders under Genghis Khan .
“ We ’re moving .
Clean out the cupboards , ” much as Lehman Brothers emptied out their foreign bank accounts in Britain and elsewhere just before declaring bankruptcy , taking what they could and steering it to their best friends .
The pretense was that a bailout was needed to restore confidence .
But the ensuing week showed that the claims were false .
It did n’t turn the stock market around as promised .
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 2,200 points from Wednesday , October 1 through the following Friday October 10 – eight straight trading days , not even pausing for the usual zigzags .
Friday ’s plunge was 100 points a minute for the first seven minutes – a 690 point drop to under 8000 .
Each 100 points was more than a 1 percent drop , which was reflected on the NASDAQ .
Nothing could withstand the pressure of so many Americans cashing in their mutual funds overnight and so many foreigners in earlier time zones putting in sell - at - market orders .
Short sellers made one of the largest and quickest fortunes ever , and then covered their positions by buying back the stocks they had pre-sold .
This pushed prices up even into positive territory just before 10:30 AM when George Bush began to speak .
Half the financial stocks showed gains – a sign that the Plunge Protection Team had jumped in .
But Mr. Bush said nothing helpful and stocks went back into freefall , ending down another 128 points despite the upcoming weekend G7 meeting .
There was no talk at all of reducing debt levels – only of giving more money to banks , insurance companies and other money managers , as if “ pushing on a string ” somehow would lead them to lend yet more to an already debt - ridden economy .
If Congress really wanted to restore confidence , here ’s what it might have done : First , mark to market , not to model .
Investors no longer believe America ’s Enron - style accounting , debt rating agencies or monoline risk insurers .
They do n’t trust U.S. banks to be honest about their financial positions .
They worry about the fraud charges brought by attorneys general in eleven states against predatory lenders such as Countrywide and Wachovia that Citibank , JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America were so eager to buy .
So is it too late for Congress to change its mind and repeal the giveaway ?
If the $ 700 billion handout did n’t stabilize the unsalvageable for small investors , pension funds and even the financial sector itself , what did it do ?
What the Fed has been doing while the media have not been looking ?
Let ’s put the giveaway in perspective .
While Senators and Congressmen subject to voters ’ choice were debating $ 700 billion for the major Wall Street contributors to both parties ( admittedly only for starters , Mr. Paulson explained ) , the Federal Reserve already had given even more , without any public discussion and without the major media noticing .
Since Bear Stearns failed in March , the Federal Reserve has used the small print of its charter to go outside its normal customers ( which are supposed to be commercial banks ) , to give investment banks , brokerage houses and now large corporations almost indiscriminately some $ 875 billion in “ cash for trash ” swaps .
( The statistics are released each week in the Fed ’s H41 report . )
Like Aladdin offering new lamps for old , the Fed has exchanged Treasury securities for junk mortgages and other securities that brokerage houses and investment banks did not have time to pawn off onto OPEC , Asian sovereign wealth funds or other investors .
The press lauds Mr. Bernanke as “ a student of the Great Depression . ”
If he were , he should know that what led to the 1929 collapse were harsh U.S. Government creditor policies toward its World War I Allied governments .
This created a situation where the Federal Reserve had to provide easy credit to hold interest rates artificially low so as to encourage U.S. investors to lend to Britain and Germany , which would use these dollar inflows to pay their Inter - Ally arms and reparations debts .
Mr. Bernanke ’s predecessor , Alan Greenspan , promoted easy credit simply for ideological reasons , to enrich Wall Street by enabling it to sell more debt .
A student of the Great Depression would understand the conflicts of interest between retail commercial banking and wholesale investment banking and money management that led Congress to pass the Glass - Steagall Act in 1933 – conflicts unleashed once again when Pres.
Clinton backed then - Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan and Republican leader ( and McCain hero ) Senator Phil Gramm in leading the repeal of this act , opening up the floodgates to today ’s financial double - dealing that has cost the American economy so much .
If Mr. Bernanke does know this history , his behavior is simply that of an opportunistic student of the art of political self - advancement , toadying to Wall Street in campaigning for one last great rip - off before the Bush Administration goes out of business .
The Fed has given Wall Street newly minted Treasury bonds , added to the national debt out of thin air .
It has done this without feeling any need to rationalize it by drawing absurd public - relations pictures about how the government may “ make a profit for taxpayers . ”
The Fed Chairman is not elected democratically .
He traditionally is designated by the Wall Street financial sector that the Fed is supposed to regulate , acting as its lobbyist for creditor interests – the top 10 percent of the population – against that of the indebted “ bottom 90 percent . ”
This “ independence of the central bank ” is trumpeted as a hallmark of democracy .
But it is undemocratic , precisely by being isolated from public control .
The Age of Oligarchy
Treasury Secretary Paulson has no such luxury .
The Treasury is supposed to represent the national interest , not that of bankers – even though its head these days is drawn from Wall Street and acts as its lobbyist .
Mr. Paulson presented his almost totalitarian giveaway gruffly to Congress on a take - it - or - leave it basis , announcing that if Congress did not save Wall Street from taking losses on its mountain of bad loans , the banks were willing to crash the economy out of spite .
“ Please do n’t make us wreck the economy , ” he said in effect .
As Margaret Thatcher used to say while selling off the British government ’s crown jewels in the 1980s , TINA :
There is no alternative .
In making this bold threat Mr. Paulson behaved as arrogantly as Lehman ’s CEO Richard Fuld did when he tried to bluff Korea and other prospective investors into paying the full , fictitiously high book value for his company .
( His bluff failed and Lehman went bankrupt , wiping out its shareholders , including the employees and managers who held 30 percent of its stock . )
There turned out to be an alternative after all .
Responding to the loudest public condemnation in memory , Congress called Mr. Paulson ’s bluff .
What made his $ 700 billion Troubled Asset Relief Program ( TARP ) so much more visible to the media than the Fed ’s actions is that Congress is involved , and this is an election year .
The level of deception and false argument is therefore enormous – along with a few tradeoffs and tax cuts to distract attention .
Erstwhile Republican opponent Sen. Jeff Sessions of Alabama came right out and said that “ This bill has been packaged with a lot of very popular things to give it even more momentum , ” so that ( as The New York Times explained ) , “ instead of siding with a $ 700 billion bailout , lawmakers could now say they voted for increased protection for deposits at the neighborhood bank , income tax relief for middle - class taxpayers and aid for schools in rural areas where the federal government owns much of the land . ”
Left behind while Wall Street ’s believers in the rapture of free markets were swept up to heaven by “ socialism for the rich ” have been mortgage debtors , student - loan debtors , the Pension Benefit Guarantee Corporation ( PBGC , some $ 25 billion short ) , the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ( FDIC , about $ 40 billion short ) , as well as Social Security which , we are warned , may run up a trillion dollar deficit thirty or forty years down the line .
Only the wealthiest have been beneficiaries , not voters , homeowners and other debtors .
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
Still , Congress was panicked into acting on Friday , October 3 , because a week earlier , September 26 , stocks fell 777 points after Congressmen responded to an unprecedented volume of voter protest against the bailout .
“ This sucker could go down , ” Pres .
Bush warned as Wall Street ’s lobbyists blamed the market downturn to the failure of Congress to preserve the “ monetary system , ” and specifically the banks and insurance companies that already had lost their net worth and were plunging deeper into Negative Equity territory .
Democratic leaders Barney Frank and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said , in effect , “ Look what you ’ve done !
You irresponsible politicians are grandstanding on principle , and wiping out peoples ’ stock market savings and threatening their pension funds .
If you do n’t give Wall Street firms enough money to cover their losses so that everyone wins , they ’ll kill the economy until they get their way . ”
Well , they did n’t quite say this , but that was basically their message .
It certainly was Wall Street ’s message : “ Wall Street to Economy : Your money or your life . ”
So Congress gave in .
Democrats ran like lemmings to “ save the economy . ”
Yet the stock market fell a few hundred points , and kept on plunging all week long , much worse and much faster than had occurred right after Congress had initially defeated the bill .
The “ Reality Problem ”
What did the “ free market ” theory underlying the giveaway leave out of account ?
For starters , “ the monetary system ” turns out to be a euphemism for the fortunes of financial gamblers using junk mathematics ( the Merton - Scholes derivatives formula ) based on junk economics ( blessed with Nobel Prizes ) to buy , speculate and even to insure junk mortgages , junk bonds and junk commercial paper and derivatives based on their relative prices .
So what is left out first of all was full knowledge of the value of what is being bought and sold .
Mark - to - market models leave the price up to the investment bankers .
If trust existed and there really was honor among these thieves , a government bailout would not be necessary , because “ the market ” could clear .
“ Free market ” ideology assumes that each party will act in his or her self - interest .
If this is so , why should foreign governments accumulate more dollar claims on the U.S.
Treasury , which already owes their central banks $ 4 trillion ?
When there hardly were enough Treasury securities to go around even as the United States ran unprecedented federal budget deficits , U.S. officials urged these banks and sovereign wealth funds to buy packaged mortgages yielding a higher rate of return .
And at least by buying these bonds , foreign governments would not be accused of funding America ’s war in Iraq that most of their voters opposed .
But investors made a fatal mistake in believing U.S. representations of the value of their junk - mortgage packages .
This trust has now been lost , all the more so since the bailout ’s permission to keep on “ marking to market . ”
Congress thought that its $ 700 billion would distract attention at least until the November 4 election .
But to no avail .
Markets fell 157 points on Giveaway Friday , and kept on going down another 800 points on Monday , October 6 ( to about 9500 ) before bouncing 500 points off the floor , only to fall even more through Friday .
So the giveaway failed in its stated purpose to rescue stock market investors ( “ peoples ’ capitalism ” ) or their pension funds .
But that was not its real purpose .
The time simply had come to clear out and take whatever one could .
Making banks and insurers in the zero - sum derivative game whole , so that winners can collect their bets while losers can sell their bad investments to the Treasury , is supposed to re-inflate the credit pyramid .
The idea is to solve the debt problem with yet more debt to prop up housing prices once again to unaffordable levels !
This is not a long - term solution , but it would give insiders enough time to arrange a do - over and get out of the game more quickly , to sell out their junk mortgages and junk bonds to the proverbial “ greater fool ” – in this case , the “ greater fool of last resort , ” the U.S. Treasury , as long as it can be run by Mr. Paulson or , under Mr. Obama , perhaps the former Goldman - Sachs official Robert Rubin .
The banks are to “ earn ” their way out of their negative equity position by selling more of their product – credit – to increase the economy ’s debt levels and hence receive more interest payments .
The problem is that most families are already “ loaned up . ”
They have no more discretionary income to pledge to carry more debt .
Without writing down their debts , there will be no fresh lending , and hence no source of credit and purchasing power for new autos , appliances , goods and services in general .
Debt deflation is being imposed on the “ real ” economy .
Creditors and speculators alone are to be made whole .
If no revenue was available for future Social Security , public health care and repair the nation ’s depleted infrastructure before this giveaway , think of how bare the cupboard must be now that the government has run up the recent trillions of dollars in new debt rather than writing off a penny of the bad mortgage debts being blamed for causing the debacle .
We can see where this is leading .
The wealthiest 1 percent of the population will come into possession of even more returns to wealth than the 57 percent that they are now taking .
In contrast to the Statue of Liberty ’s inscription “ give me your poor … yearning to breathe free , ” the Fed – and now the Treasury , with Congressional blessing – is taking from the public purse and giving to America ’s wealthiest investors and insiders .
This “ Robin Hood in Reverse ” program is being done without strings , without asking banks to stop paying dividends , exorbitant executive salaries and golden parachutes , and without taking over banks with negative net worth of the kind that many homeowners are experiencing .
Nobody is talking about a debt write - down or moratorium .
The subprime mortgage problem could have been solved by writing down just $ 1 or $ 2 trillion of the face value and interest rates of predatory loans .
Instead , the $ 10 + trillion in financial - sector damage in recent weeks reflects Wall Street ’s fraudulent packaging and sale of junk mortgages at unrealistically high prices , using junk mathematics to calculate junk derivatives and sell them to gullible investors who believe that the pretenses these mathematics , credit ratings and projected income have a basis in reality .
The amazing feature of today ’s crash is how many Wall Street firms actually believed that the game of musical financial chairs could go on before they had to stop dancing and indeed , escape from the room .
I remember one day back in the 1970s when I warned Frank Zarb of Lazard Freres about the likelihood of Third World debt defaults , and suggested that the firm should do an ability - to - pay analysis .
“ We do n’t have to do any such thing , ” he replied .
“ We have the schedule of what they owe right here in this IMF report . ”
It was a thick printout of the scheduled debt service for an African country that soon became insolvent .
But Wall Street ’s mentalité was that of Herbert Hoover on the eve of the Great Depression : A debt is a debt , and that is that .
The response is to blame the victim , as if the irresponsibility lies with debtors rather than creditors .
No reversal of the Bush tax cuts is offered to re-inflate the economy , no move toward more progressive taxation of Wall Street speculators who pay only a 15 percent “ capital gains ” tax rate instead of the much higher income - tax and FICA withholding rates that wage - earners pay .
( Wall Street has its own golden parachute program , so why should it pay for Social Security for the rest of society ? )
There is to be no reduction in the special tax benefits for real estate , whose tax favoritism led to the crisis by “ freeing ” more income from the tax collector to be pledged to mortgage bankers as interest .
The Bubble Economy is to be re-inflated by Fannie Mae , Freddie Mac and the FHA lending to help buyers bid up housing and commercial office prices once again to a rate that promises to impose debt peonage on homeowners .
The budget deficit will soar , without any prosecution of tax evasion scams by UBS or KPMG .
Instead of a fiscal or regulatory comet driving these dinosaurs to extinction , the climate has turned more conducive to their proliferation .
Our Age of Deception is to be locked in even more tightly .
The Congressional bailout ’s suspension of mark - to - market rules to rely on Wall Street ’s “ self - regulation ” should win a prize for Oxymoron of 2008 as investors have no clue as to what financial assets are worth .
No wonder lending has dried up , especially to banks themselves .
Just as financial victims fail to vote and support their self - interest , predators also turn out to pursue self - defeating “ free market ” strategies .
The financial sector ’s short - termism is the greatest enemy to its survival .
It has translated its wealth into a fatal political control of its legal climate , blocking [ with the explicit support of Barack Obama , Editors ]
Congressional efforts to rewrite the oppressive bankruptcy laws that credit - card banks lobbied so hard to pass , [ with vital help from Joe Biden , the senior senator from credit card company HQ , the state of Delaware , Editors ] crucial .
These hard bankruptcy terms prevent the courts from renegotiating homeowner debts to keep property occupied , accelerating the real estate price collapse .
The result is today ’s negative equity , posing the question of just who is to bear the cost of bring debts back in line with the economy ’s ability to pay .
Will it be the financial institutions that sponsored asset - price inflation and lobbied for deregulation of lenders ?
Or , will it be the debtors who thought they were riding the wave to get an inflationary free lunch ?
Instead of requiring creditors to absorb losses on the excess of debts over what can be paid , the debts are being kept in place , not scaled back to what the economy can pay .
The government is to make creditors and computerized derivatives speculators whole – and will act as collecting agent for the overhead of bad debts the economy has run up .
Today we can see the debt - fueled bubble of asset - price inflation that Alan Greenspan trumpeted as real wealth creation for what it really is – credit creation to bid up real estate , stock market and packaged - debt prices .
Tangible capital formation has been left out of account , as if postindustrial economies no longer need it .
Will voters see the asymmetry in Congress ’s failure to offer debt relief for homeowners as real estate prices plunge below the mortgages that are owed ?
Will its members be blamed for not rewriting the nation ’s bankruptcy laws to free families from debt peonage – and free housing markets from the price declines that result from today ’s proliferation of foreclosure sales ?
For that matter , will there be no relief for corporations having to cut back investment in order to service their junk bonds and other debts with which Wall Street ’s corporate raiders and “ shareholder activists ” have loaded then down ?
Evidently not .

Tara Reid Talks About Her Battle Wounds
The media has had more than one field day with ' hot mess ' .
Now the actress is talking to People magazine and says she is sick of all the criticism .
In 2004 Reid underwent liposuction surgery on her stomach and it left her with horrible scarring .
Then in 2006 she went in for reconstructive surgery but in the end was left with what she calls " battle wounds " , including the dreaded uneven abs .
Here we go again .
Pictures have surfaced of Tara on the beach sporting a bikini , which has renewed the jab assault from those who enjoy getting in their digs .
She said , " I 've been a media target for years now , it does hurt my feelings , but what can I do ?
I have to move on . "
She 's been keeping herself busy with some independent film work and designing her own clothing line Mantra , which she says reflects her moods through casual wear , bikinis and t- shirts .
She wants her fashion offering to be all about feeling good about yourself .
Hopefully Reid will fare better than celeb Heidi Montag , who was recently dropped by Anchor Blue .

You ’ve heard of credit scores .
Maybe you ’ve even checked yours .
But do you really understand what they are and how they work ?
Here we explain what credit scores are and what you need to know to make the most of yours .
So , What is a Credit Score ?
Credit scores are created by taking information from credit reports and analyzing that data to forecast how someone is likely to behave in the future .
By looking at factors like how much debt consumers carry , and whether they have paid their bills on time in the past , for example , they help predict whether someone might pay a new bill on time or how they will handle a credit line increase .
Who Creates Credit Scores ?
Most credit scores used by lenders and insurance companies today are created by FICO or VantageScore using credit information from the three major credit reporting agencies – Equifax , Experian and TransUnion .
Why Do I Have More Than One Score ?
It ’s important not to get too hung up on a single number because , in fact , there are dozens of different credit scores that could be created right now using information from your credit reports .
One reason for this is that the credit reporting agencies each collect and report information independently and they may not have the same credit information about you .
For example , a collection account may show up on one credit report and not another .
Another reason your scores can be different is that there are many different credit scores available .
Some are used to predict different things ; credit - based insurance scores , for example , are used to predict how likely consumers are to file insurance claims , and so they may differ from scores used to predict how someone will manage a higher credit card limit .
In addition , lenders might customize scores to help them better manage their own accounts .
That means that even a FICO score based on Experian credit report information , for example , could vary from one lender to the next .
Finally , some scores are “ educational ” scores and they have been created strictly to educate consumers about their credit .
What is a Good Credit Score ?
It depends !
Each lender decides how to use these numbers .
But here are some basic guidelines :
760 – 850 : Excellent
700 – 749 : Average – very good
650 – 699 : Fair
600 – 649 : Poor
Below 599 : Bad
A great way to understand your credit score is to use Credit.com ’s free Credit Report Card .
You ’ll get your VantageScore and an Experian score , along with letter grades that will help you understand how you ’re doing in each of the major areas that make up your score , such as payment history and debt .
Does Checking My Credit ( Or Scores ) Hurt My Credit ?
No .
If you check your credit through a service that provides credit reports to consumers – including your free annual credit report or your free credit score through Credit.com – it will not affect your credit score in any way .
You can check as often as you like with no negative repercussions .
The only time checking your report would hurt your scores is if you ask a lender to pull your report for you ; for example , you ask your bank or an auto dealer to get your report and show it to you .
Credit checks by lenders can affect your scores .
How Fast Do My Credit Scores Change ?
Scores are calculated when they are created based on the information available at that time .
So if new information is reported that significantly affects your score , such as a collection account that is reported for the first time , then the next time your score is requested by a lender – or by you – your score will be based on that new information .
Similarly , if you dispute something on your credit report that ’s having a big impact on your scores and that item is removed – that collection account for example !
– your scores can change significantly next time they are calculated .
Check Your Credit Score for Free
You can get your credit score for free using Credit.com ’s free Credit Report Card .
This tool is truly free ; you wo n’t be asked for any payment information .
Monitor your score with a free update every other week .
Using the Credit Report Card does not affect your scores in any way .

No , I ’m not spiraling downward into a pit of sin and booze , despite what you may think .
I mean , just because I ’ve shared the recipes for Whiskey - Glazed Carrots , Christmas Rum Cake , and Pasta alla Vodka in the same two - month period does n’t mean I ’m on a bender or anything !
It simply means it ’s the holiday season — the season to be jolly — and if you ca n’t add a little fun ( translation : booze ) to your cooking during the holiday season , when CAN you ?
Love , The Queen of Rationalization .
Pasta alla Vodka , people .
Pasta alla Vodka .
How can I adequately describe to you my love for this tomato - cream - based dish ?
I ’m a raging tomato - cream - sauce fiend anyway , but this one … there ’s just something about it .
Normally , I ’d use white wine in a pasta sauce rather than vodka , and that ’s also scrumptious .
It ’s difficult for me to describe the difference between the flavor of this dish when you use vodka vs. wine , but I ’ll try :
When you cook this sauce with wine , it leaves that delicious “ winey ” aftertaste — that satisfying “ mmmm … wine ” flavor that ’s unmistakable and wonderful .
But when you use vodka , there ’s a cleanness to it — a slight sharpness .
Not a bitterness at all — in fact , I ’m always surprised at how mild the final sauce really is , considering it has a cup of the sharp stuff in it .
But it is …it ’s mild .
And each bite has a really clean finish , a perfect ending .
As I said , it ’s difficult for me to describe .
And that ’s not what I ’m here for , anyway .
I ’m here to SHOW you .
So why do n’t I do that now ?
( I just heard you rolling your eyes and saying “ FINALLY . ”
You think I do n’t hear you roll your eyes , but I do . )
The Cast of Characters : Pasta , Vodka , Tomato Puree , Onion , Butter , Oliver Oil , Salt , Pepper , Red Pepper Flakes , Parmesan Cheese , and Heavy Cream .
The classic Pasta alla Vodka actually uses Penne , but I ’m a real rebel when it comes to using different pasta shapes .
I found this a few weeks ago when I stopped at a fancy - schmancy grocery store in the big city and I knew I had to have it .
I ’m a sucker for unique pasta shapes .
In any event , cook 1 pound of pasta according to package directions , being careful NOT to overcook it .
Overcooked pasta is a sacrilege .
Begin by dicing 1 medium onion pretty finely .
I pretty much always dice my onions finely .
Then grab 2 or 3 cloves of fresh garlic , smash ’em with a can , then peel off the outer papery skin .
Chop them up as if your life depended on it .
In a skillet over medium to medium - low heat , add 2 tablespoons olive oil and 2 tablespoons butter .
Allow the butter to melt …
Then throw in the diced onions .
Add the chopped garlic on top …
Stir around to combine .
Let this cook for two minutes over medium - low heat .
You want it to sizzle , but not burn .
After two minutes , pour in 3/4 cup of vodka .
Or , if you ’re feeling adventurous , go ahead and make it a cup .
Either way is fine .
Let this mixture cook for three minutes .
It ’ll start reducing just a bit .
Next , pour in 1 can of tomato puree .
You can definitely use tomato sauce , too , but it ’ll result in a slightly thinner vodka sauce .
Not that there ’s anything wrong with that .
Stir the mixture …
Until it ’s thoroughly combined .
REDUCE HEAT TO LOW .
Pour in 1 cup of heavy cream .
No , you ca n’t use whole milk .
No , you ca n’t use half - n- half .
Where ’s your pluck ?
Where ’s your courage ?
Where ’s your exercise bike ?
Because tomorrow morning , you ’re gonna need it .
Mmmm .
Tomato sauce and cream .
Is there anything better in the world ?
Gently stir the mixture …
Until it ’s a creamy , dreamy , light - colored mixture .
Make sure the heat is very , very low — I put it on the lowest simmer possible .
Then sprinkle in a healthy pinch of red pepper flakes .
This is optional if you ca n’t HANDLE the heat .
Add at LEAST 1/4 teaspoon of salt .
This is important : cooking with wine decreases the need for much salt .
But cooking with vodka does n’t — you really need to make sure you salt this adequately .
And of COURSE — this needs plenty of freshly ground black pepper .
Give it a stir , making sure the heat ’s not too high .
Next , because you ’re a rebel like me , add one more tablespoon of butter .
There ’s really no good reason for doing this .
It just feels right .
That sums up my entire motivation for doing pretty much everything I do .
Next , grate up a good cup or so of Parmesan .
And if you want to use the storebought pre-grated stuff , go for it .
I would n’t dream of judging you .
QUICK TIP : Just before you drain the pasta , stick a cup in there and retrieve a cup or so of the cooking water .
That way , if the pasta sauce winds up being too gloopy or thick after you toss it with the pasta , you can splash some in to make it stirrable .
Oh , my .
Turn off the skillet .
Then drain the pasta and add it to the skillet .
I usually add in about 3 / 4 of the pasta first to make sure I ’ll have enough sauce , then add in the rest if necessary .
Gently toss the pasta to coat it with the sauce .
Once it ’s all tossed together , add in most of the grated Parmesan and toss it together , too .
( For you photography enthusiasts , here ’s a great example of the challenges of exposure .
In this instance , if I ’d exposed for the pasta , the Parmesan would have been overexposed , or blown out .
So I had to expose for the Parmesan in order to retain its detail … and that resulted in a darker pasta .
Never mind . )
When you ’re ready to serve , pour it into a large serving bowl .
Sprinkle generously with more Parmesan …
And then , if you ’re me , just go ahead and eat it straight out of the serving bowl .
It ’s not as if Marlboro Man would eat this anyway .
Sometimes it ’s handy being married to a cattle rancher .
Enjoy !
Love ,
Pioneer Woman

Hey Floridians , who 's going to their county website and printing off your precinct 's ballots to be available to elderly voters ... instead of timely disenfranchised , ( please note you still have to check in with your poll book and mark your ballot at the precinct ) ... to helpthe vote prior to collapsing ?
Huh , really your state is going to let elderly voters be abused like that ?
I am soooooooo sorry , but I have more decency than that .

In GA , during early voting ( which ended Friday ) , there was a sign on the door of my polling place stating that those voters who were 75 or older , or were handicapped went straight to the front of the line .
They got the next available check - in .
There was the occasional poll worker walking the line to let people know about this .
My wait was 4 hours .

Good Luck Voting , Brad !
I 'm really glad I got my 3 1/2 hours in line [ GA ] over with and at least did my DUTY as an American Citizen exercising my RIGHT TO VOTE ... too bad we have no way to verify the votes .
Where I voted [ not even leaning Democratic ... according to the propaganda we 've been spoon - fed since the Diebold vote - snatchers were put in place by ( moron ? ) Cathy Cox ] persons over the age of 70 were called forward and treated with respect .
At least that 's good .

Hi Brad ,
So I drove down to Norwalk to early vote yesterday Sunday , here in LA county .
Got their at 7:30 AM which was a half hour before they opened .
The line was around the building already .
I was finally finished at 11:30 AM .
The line was definitely moving slower and taking longer by the time I left .
All the people I saw on line looked like they came prepared for this and were in generally good spirits .
Most people had brought chairs and or umbrellas for the rain which came sporadically .
On the other hand , by the time people had made their way through the line and taken a number and then sat on folding chairs for about 2 hours waiting to be called , well their reactions were to say the least reminiscent of " The Price is Right " with a lot of cheering when their numbers were finally called .
I suppose on the one hand it is a testament to the growning awareness and committment of citizens to vote in the face of increasing obsticles .
On the other hand , I do have to say that for the largest voting jurisdiction in the country to run just this one single early voting location , with such low capacity that even people who arrived at the crack of dawn had to wait for 4 hours plus ( and many arriving later waiting even longer ) - well it is at least pathetic if not disgraceful , and yes a poll tax of sorts since we do not have a voting holiday .
Good luck everyone tomorrow .
Best regards ,
Rob C. Cohen

Hey Floridiot - Comment # 3 quit lying and saying someone can absentee vote via " phonecall " .
This is blatant misinformation , which is quite a ballsy move considering this is bradblog.com .
YOU CANNOT VOTE VIA PHONE CALL .

Brad ,
This is not a pole tax but a " dumb tax " .
You can use absentee ballots to vote in Florida .
If you are retired you can also wait till election day to vote .
Having said that it would be neat if Florida devised a Disney style " Fast Pass " system in early voting

I voted in Decatur , GA 2 weeks ago , and waited just under 2 hours .
Last week I took my elderly parents to vote in another county , and simply by asking , we moved them right to the front of the line .
The line there was a least 2 hours long , since they had perhaps 16 machines for a huge turnout .
The poll workers were very nice in both cases , but seemed a bit overwhelmed by the sheer numbers of voters .
I hate these machines , I want paper ballots .
The fraud in this country is not the voters casting votes , but the machines that " count " them .
But , of course , we already knew that .

George -
It might be a series of " Dumb " things that lead to this .
However if Credit Card companies can assault with constant solicitations in the mail , then States can afford to remind voters to VOTE by physical mail and by electronic media ( TV , Phone , SMS , whatever ) Rachel is right , it does amount to a " Poll Tax " in the classic sense but since so much is on the line , we 're not hear a great deal of complaining about the " line " just the fact it takes a several hours .

These long lines are absolutely intolerable regardless of who won the election , they must be abolished .
Election reform should be the first priority .
We should occupy the offices of any senator or congressperson who will not abolish electronic voting and unequal allocation of voting resources that lead to these long lines in selected precints .

By Javed Ahmad
December 20 , 2008 --
While the danger of war between India and Pakistan is accelerates , a peace demonstration in Lahore on December 20 demanded no war between the two countries .
More than 100 activists of the Labour Party Pakistan and the Communist Mazdoor Kissan Party ( CMKP ) demanded an end of war fanaticism .
The demonstrators chanted the slogans : " We want peace " , " Peace not war , bread not bombs , jobs not bombs " , " No to imperialism and no the religious fundamentalism " , " Long live the friendship of peoples of Pakistan and India " , " Labour against war , people against war " .
They were holding banners and posters .
Speaking on the occasion , Farooq Tariq , spokesperson Labour Party Pakistan , opposed the policies of Pakistan Peoples Party , which is are siding with imperialism .
“ We totally oppose the policies of the religious fanatics who are calling for a holly war on the name of Jihad with India .
We do not want a war in any case .
The Indian and Pakistani ruling classes are acting on the direction of American imperialism , and American imperialism is not creating friendship between the two countries but promoting a war - like situation .
However , these countries are partners with the Americans on the so - called war on terror but American imperialism is the one that is promoting terrorism internationally .
We must demand the two governments to hold talks independently and without any interference of Americans ” , he told the demonstrators .
Ali Jan of CMKP spoke about the state responsibilities in promoting the peace and not war .
“ We must build a peoples ' movement to stop the fanaticism of war .
We must fight the religious fundamentalists who are promoting the war - like situation ” , Ali Jan said .
The demonstrators were holding red flags and thousands of passers - by saw the unique peace demonstration at a time when most of the people are being told to be ready for war .
Several people waved to the demonstrators .
Joint Left Demo for Peace

Demonstration for Peace
Date : Saturday , December 20
Time : 3.00 pm
Venue : Charing Cross , Lahore
In the aftermath of the horrendous Mumbai terrorist attacks , whose perpetrators must be brought to justice , a whirlwind of jingoism , national chauvinism and bigotry has been propagated by right - wing obscurantist elements of both India and Pakistan .
This hate mongering is not only damaging the fragile peace of the region but also bringing it closer to a war between the two neighbouring countries .
The media in both countries , which should have acted responsibly for the cause of peace , has also acted as a mere mouthpiece of the right - wing forces , suspending all critical faculties and adding fuel to fire .
It is time for peace - loving people on both sides of the border to stand up against the politics of war and hate in their own countries .
The people of India have already held rallies for peace all over the country and condemned the war mongering going on in their country .
To compliment their efforts and to raise the slogan of harmony , peace - lovers and progressives in Pakistan have also decided to demonstrate against the forces pushing us towards a disastrous enmity .

John Maynard Keynes once wrote that " the ideas of economists and political philosophers , both when they are right and when they are wrong , are more powerful than is commonly understood .
Indeed the world is ruled by little else .
Practical men , who believe themselves to be quite exempt from any intellectual influences , are usually the slaves of some defunct economist . "
Economic theory does indeed have quite a large impact on our lives that is far greater than most any of us are willing to admit or understand .
Policymakers and politicians guide fiscal policy , set monetary policy , and collaborate on financial regulations that impact almost every transaction in the market place .
These theorists and philosophers all begin with a set of ideological constraints that frame their world view .
Will you sit back and allow them to create the rules of the game ?
As Ludwig von Mises stated in one of the concluding chapters of Human Action on The Place of Economics in Learning :
" Economics must not be relegated to classrooms and statistical offices and must not be left to esoteric circles .
It is the philosophy of human life and action and concerns everybody and everything .
It is the pith of civilization and of man 's human existence ...
There is no means by which anyone can evade his personal responsibility .
Whoever neglects to examine to the best of his abilities all the problems involved voluntarily surrenders his birthright to a self - appointed elite of supermen .
In such vital matters blind reliance upon " experts " and uncritical acceptance of popular catchwords and prejudices is tantamount to the abandonment of self - determination and to yielding to other people 's domination .
As conditions are today , nothing can be more important to every intelligent man than economics .
His own fate and that of his progeny is at stake ...
Whether we like it or not , it is a fact that economics cannot remain an esoteric branch of knowledge accessible only to small groups of scholars and specialists .
Economics deals with society 's fundamental problems ; it concerns everyone and belongs to all .
It is the main and proper study of every citizen . "

ALGIERS ( Reuters ) -
An Algerian policeman , angered at his brother ’s conviction in a drugs case , briefly took the deputy chief prosecutor hostage at gunpoint in court , state news agency APS reported .
The policeman leapt from the public area of the criminal court in the port town of Bejaia , 250 km ( 156 miles ) east of Algiers , Tuesday , and rushed toward the bench , brandishing a gun and shouting threats .
He pounced on the deputy chief prosecutor who tripped over as he tried to escape from the courtroom .
Other police officers arrived and sought to persuade him to release his hostage .
“ And that is what happened after they explained the consequences of his actions , ” APS said .
The policeman was placed under arrest and risks an “ exemplary punishment , ” said the chief prosecutor , who plans to charge him with contempt of court , rebellion and aggravated violence , APS added .
Close Brothers refers to a study by De Montfort University , which found that the country ’s leading banks have a total £ 250 bn exposure to commercial property loans - twice the amount they had before entering the recession in the early 1990s .
Some £ 83bn of the total was orginated at the peak of the market .
Our colleague , Richard Wagner , a leading light in the public choice revolution , wrote the following remarkable question for the 2005 - 2006 graduate political economy preliminary exam at George Mason .
Joseph Schumpeter claimed that capitalism would give way to socialism largely for ideological reasons .
This does not seem to have happened , at least directly .
But might it be happening indirectly ?
Consider , for instance , a significant change that has occurred in the economic organization of debtor - creditor contracts .
Not too long ago , lenders held their loans in their portfolios .
They would lose if the borrower defaulted , which gave the lender a strong incentive to monitor the borrower , particularly for large loans .
Now , lenders split their loans into numerous small pieces and disperse them throughout the economy .
( For instance , many people who hold mutual funds and retirement accounts will find that they are holding small pieces of large loans made by commercial banks . )
The burden of non-performing loans is thus dispersed throughout the economy rather than residing with the original lender .
Does this development weaken the incentive of lenders to monitor borrowers and thereby weaken overall economic performance ?
That is , can market transactions generate institutional arrangements that impair the market economy ?
However you address this topic , do so clearly and cogently .

Kudos to Dick for his prescience .
I thank David Levy for the pointer .
If you are reading this , then my mission is probably over .
This final entry is one that I asked be posted after my mission team announces they 've lost contact with me .
Today is that day and I must say good - bye , but I do it in triumph and not in grief .
As I 've said before , there 's no other place I 'd rather be than here .
My mission lasted five months instead of three , and I 'm content knowing that I worked hard and accomplished great things during that time .
My work here is done , but I leave behind a legacy of images and data .
In that sense , you have n't heard the end of me .
Scientists will be releasing findings based on my data for months , possibly years , to come and today 's children will read of my discoveries in their textbooks .
Engineers will use my experience during landing and surface operations to aid in designing future robotic missions .
But for now , it 's time for me to hunker down and brave what will be a long and cold autumn and winter .
Temperatures should reach - 199 F ( - 128C ) and a polar cap of carbon dioxide ice will envelop me in an icy tomb .
Seasons on Mars last about twice as long as seasons on Earth , so if you 're wondering when the next Martian spring in the northern hemisphere begins , it 's one Earth - year away - October 27 , 2009 .
The next Martian summer solstice , when maximum sunlight would hit my solar arrays , falls on May 13 , 2010 .
That 's a long time away .
And it 's one of the reasons there is n't much hope that I 'll ever contact home again .
For my mission teams on Earth , I bid a special farewell and thank you .
For the thousands of you who joined me on this journey with your correspondence , I will miss you dearly .
I hope you 'll look to my kindred robotic explorers as they seek to further humankind 's quest to learn and understand our place in the universe .
The rovers , Spirit and Opportunity ( @MarsRovers ) , are still operating in their sun belt locations closer to the Martian equator ; Cassini ( @CassiniSaturn ) is sailing around Saturn and its rings ; and the Mars Science Laboratory ( @MarsScienceLab ) - the biggest rover ever built for launch to another planet - is being carefully pieced together for launch next year .
My mission team has promised to update my Twitter feed as more of my science discoveries are announced .
If I 'm lucky , perhaps one of the orbiters will snap a photo of me when spring comes around .
So long Earth .
I 'll be here to greet the next explorers to arrive , be they robot or human .
It 's been a great pleasure to have Mars Phoenix guest blogging for us , reminiscing back on a successful mission via its personality conjurer , the great Veronica McGregor at JPL - maintainer of Phoenix 's famous Twitter feed .
Just as Doug McCuistion from NASA said on the news conference today , it 's certainly more of an Irish wake than a funeral today .
We 're drinking to you tonight , little buddy .

In these tough economic times , everything 's for sale -- even a skyway .
And since you can't put a for - sale sign on a skyway , a Minneapolis architecture firm turned to Craigslist to entice a potential owner for the 1,380 - square - foot structure , which used to span S. 5th Street in downtown Minneapolis .
" It 's such a symbol of the Twin Cities landscape , " said Christian Dean , partner at the firm CITYDESKSTUDIO .
The firm is seeking $ 79,500 for the structure .
The skyway was built in the late 1970s and designed by Minneapolis architect Ed Baker , who also worked on the IDS building .
It once connected the former Powers and JC Penney department stores , but was taken down when the Hiawatha light - rail line was built .
Building a comparable new skyway today would cost about $ 1 million , the architecture firm estimated ; the steel alone is worth more than $ 250,000 , it said .
The Craigslist posting lists a number of uses that the architecture firm dreamed up , including a cabin , wine bar , yoga studio or park building .
The firm has had inquiries from resort owners and private individuals who wanted to use the urban structure as a way to connect with nature , Dean said .
" As a creative architecture firm , we 're trying to encourage people to see beyond its obvious potential as a bridge , " he said .
Any potential buyer must be prepared to pay cash for the skyway and move it from its current location near the University of Minnesota .
If you are interested in the skyway , call CITYDESKSTUDIO at 612-872-2398 or visit www.citydeskstudio.com.

More than half the population is dependent on food aid in Somalia
Somalia is in danger of descending into famine while the world 's attention is focused on the problem of piracy off its coast , the Red Cross has warned .
BBC Africa analyst Martin Plaut says agencies like the International Committee of the Red Cross are very wary about using words like famine .
The ICRC's Alexandre Liebeskind said the violence had made it almost impossible for aid agencies to operate .
About half of Somalia 's population is dependent on food aid .
Drought , floods and nearly two decades of conflict have driven many into destitution .
Alexandre Liebeskind , head of the ICRC in East Africa , says families are now eating their most prized possessions : the camels and goats of reproductive age .
It is a sign of increasing desperation , he says .
He compared the situation to the last great famine of 1992 when hundreds of thousands died .
Yet the fighting between insurgents , the government and the Ethiopian forces in the country mean aid agencies are finding it all but impossible to work on the ground .
Most international humanitarian staff have had to leave and even Somali staff are finding it difficult to operate , at a time when the situation is increasingly critical , Mr Liebeskind says
The Red Cross is calling for the country 's borders to be opened , and for people to be allowed to cross and escape what appears to be a looming disaster .
There have been nearly 100 pirate attacks in Somalian waters this year , despite the presence of several foreign warships .
Vallejo student slowly recovering from beating VALLEJO
After being beaten nearly to death in a video - recorded incident at his Vallejo high school , a 17 - year - old student and basketball player was recovering slowly Sunday from serious head injuries at a Walnut Creek hospital , one day after doctors were able to remove him from a ventilator .
" They 're limiting his communication .
He needs his rest , " said Donna Williams , the mother of the student , Bryant Lee .
" He still has a long way to go . "
Meanwhile , Vallejo police were looking for additional suspects in the vicious attack on Lee at Jesse Bethel High after arresting six alleged gang members on suspicion of attempted murder and assault with a deadly weapon .
School officials released footage of the beating in hopes of identifying others who were involved .
Police identified four of the men as brothers within Vallejo 's Tili family , whose members have been involved - as either suspects or victims - in a string of high - profile violent incidents dating back several years .
One brother is in prison for murder ; another was shot dead by police .
" From all indications , this is a family that has a lengthy criminal history here in Vallejo , and we 're hopeful these four will be prosecuted to the fullest extent allowed by law , " said Jason Hodge , a spokesman for the Vallejo City Unified School District .
" When you watch the video , " Hodge said , " it 's pretty clear that Bryant was probably two or three kicks away from death .
It 's just a miracle the boy is still alive . "
According to school and police officials , Bryant was assaulted while standing with other varsity basketball players at about 4:30 p.m. Thursday at Jesse Bethel High .
The players were waiting for practice to begin .
The suspects arrived in two vans , and one punched a 16 - year - old girl , prompting Lee and his teammates to intervene , Hodge said .
" At some point , " he said , " they encircled Bryant and unloaded on him , beating him unconscious . "
The suspects apparently did n't realize they were near one of about 60 surveillance cameras that school officials installed last year on three campuses , at a cost of about $ 500,000 .
Authorities quickly identified the Tili brothers , Hodge said , and police arrested them within minutes - as they were pulling into the driveway of their home .
Arrested were 26 - year - old twins Abraham and Alexander Tili and 18 - year - old twins Ray and Ron Tili , along with Kevin Young , 18 , and a 16 - year - old boy who was not identified .
Reached Sunday by telephone , a man who said he was the Tili brothers ' father declined to talk about his sons .
The brothers are well known in Vallejo .
When they were 12 years old , Ray and Ron Tili suffered serious burns when their home was firebombed in September 2002 in an attack that police connected to a nasty dispute between the Tilis and another Vallejo family , the Strongs .
The feud was also cited in a brawl that delayed a Bethel High football game two years later .
Alexander Tili was wounded in a drive - by shooting near his home in July 2005 , and a year later was charged with shooting and wounding three juveniles .
Another brother , 22 - year - old Vasega Tili , was convicted of murdering a Vallejo man during a November 2004 confrontation at a Denny 's restaurant in Emeryville .
He is appealing a 50 - years - to - life sentence .
A witness to the murder later turned up dead .
And Fonotaga " Junior " Tili , while wearing a mask , was shot dead by Vallejo police officers while fleeing from a takeover robbery of a Toys R Us store in May 2005 .
He was 20 , and he , too , had been shot before .

As American forces work to revive Iraq ’s tattered farming economy , they seem to have found an effective new weapon .
Cows .
At the suggestion of an Iraqi women ’s group , the Marine Corps recently bought 50 cows for 50 Iraqi widows in the farm belt around Fallouja , once the insurgent capital of war - torn Anbar province .
The cow purchase is seen as a small step toward reestablishing Iraq ’s once - thriving dairy industry , as well as a way to help women and children hurt by the frequent failure of the Iraqi government to provide the pensions that Iraqi law promises to widows .
Advertisement
The early sign is that the program is working .
Widows , many with no other income , have a marketable item to sell , as well as milk for their children .
Although Iraqis , particularly women , are often reluctant to participate in an American effort , the cows were immediately popular .
“ It was an easy sell , ” said Maj .
Meredith Brown , assigned to the Marines ’ outreach program for Iraqi women .
The idea , proposed by members of the Women ’s Cultural Center in Fallouja , at first met with resistance from U.S. military officers and civilian officials involved in aid programs for Anbar .
Nothing in their training provided guidance in haggling for livestock .
But those objections quickly evaporated when Maj. Gen. John Kelly , the top Marine in Iraq , signaled his support , Brown said .
The Iraqis now refer to their animals as Kelly ’s Cows .
Advertisement
Though Kelly ’s support may have been based on gut instinct , the need to beef up Iraq ’s badly broken dairy industry was argued in a Nov. 25 report by Land O’Lakes Inc .
The Minnesota cheese - and - butter company was hired by the Marine Corps to examine the Iraqi dairy industry .
Its 38 - page report , based on field research in the fall by two Land O’Lakes dairy specialists , concluded that there was enormous growth potential for the industry in a milk - drinking , cheese - eating nation that can locally produce enough milk to satisfy only 5 % of the demand .
The study also pointed out that , even in Iraqi farm families with able - bodied adult males , much of the work is left to women : “ Women milk the cows , bring feed and fodder to the animals and are supported by their children . ”
Though Americans know Land O’Lakes best from its products in the dairy case , the company has been involved in 150 development projects in 70 countries in recent decades .
Among them was a dairy project in Afghanistan after the Taliban was toppled in the U.S. - led invasion in 2001 .

Its report cited a litany of woes besetting the Iraqi dairy industry : facilities damaged by war , looting or neglect ; a lack of good feed ; a dearth of veterinarians and the initiative - numbing effect of three decades of centralized planning under Saddam Hussein .
“ Every link in the value chain was broken , but we found that every link is fixable , ” said Zaheer Baber , regional director for Asia and the Middle East for Land O’Lakes ’ international development division .
The report suggested several construction projects for U.S. military and civilian officials to consider funding , possibly with the Iraqi government .
One idea was for a new dairy owned and operated by the Women ’s Cultural Center , which would be a bold move in a male - dominated society .
As a first phase , Marines and Land O’Lakes specialists are discussing a milk - collection facility run by the women to help them learn accounting , marketing and other skills .

The cows - for - widows program is just the latest of several initiatives by the U.S. to help Iraq ’s dairy and beef industries .
Some efforts have been individual , such as buying a replacement cow in 2004 for a farmer near Ramadi who complained that his animal was killed in the crossfire between Marines and insurgents .
Other initiatives have been larger in scale , such as inspections of herds by Army veterinarians .
Also , the U.S. is taking the lead in the rehabilitation of a milk - collection center in Fallouja .
And Army personnel and advisors from the U.S. Department of Agriculture met this year with farmers at a dairy in the Wehida region south of Baghdad that once had 8,000 cows but now can barely handle a fraction .
In Anbar , two factors drew the Marines to the cow purchase :
It was small - scale and it was suggested by the Iraqis .
The Marines have learned that big - ticket projects , or those imposed by the U.S. on the Iraqis without local support , start with two strikes .
The Marines began buying cows in November at a livestock market at Saqlawiyah .
Of the 50 cows , 35 were pregnant and 10 already had calves , which went along with their mothers .
The five others were taken to a laboratory for artificial insemination .
Brown put the program cost so far at $ 58,000 .

To qualify for a free cow , each widow had to sign an agreement not to slaughter or sell the animal and instead to use the milk as a marketable item or for the family .
The project is not entirely altruistic .
The Marines believe that widows with at least some economic resources are less likely to join Al Qaeda to carry out suicide attacks in exchange for a promise that their children will be cared for after the women are gone .
“ If she ’s desperate enough , she just might put on that [ suicide ] vest or drive that truck ” full of explosives , Maj .
Brown said .

Just two months after the twin towers fell , the armies of the Northern Alliance marched into Kabul .
The Taliban fled .
The triumph was total in the " splendid little war " that had cost one U.S. casualty .
Or so it seemed .
Yet , last month , the war against the Taliban entered its eighth year , the second longest war in our history , and America and NATO have never been nearer to strategic defeat .
So critical is the situation that Defense Secretary Robert Gates , in Kandahar last week , promised rapid deployment , before any Taliban spring offensive , of two and perhaps three combat brigades of the 20,000 troops requested by Gen. David McKiernan .
The first 4,000 , from the 10th Mountain , are expected in January .
With 34,000 U.S. soldiers already in country , half under NATO command , the 20,000 will increase U.S. forces there to 54,000 , a 60 percent ratcheting up .
Shades of LBJ , 1964 - 65 .
Afghanistan is going to be Obama ’s War .
And upon its outcome will hang the fate of his presidency .
Has he thought this through ?
How do we win this war , if by winning we mean establishing a pro-Western democratic government in control of the country that has the support of the people and loyalty of an Afghan army strong enough to defend the nation from a resurgent Taliban ?
We are further from that goal going into 2009 than we were five years ago .
What are the long - term prospects for any such success ?
Each year , the supply of opium out of Afghanistan , from which most of the world ’s heroin comes , sets a new record .
Payoffs by narcotics traffickers are corrupting the government .
The fanatically devout Taliban had eradicated the drug trade , but is now abetting the drug lords in return for money for weapons to kill the Americans .
Militarily , the Taliban forces are stronger than they have been since 2001 , moving out of the south and east and infesting half the country .
They have sanctuaries in Pakistan and virtually ring Kabul .
U.S. air strikes have killed so many Afghan civilians that President Karzai , who controls little more than Kabul , has begun to condemn the U.S. attacks .
Predator attacks on Taliban and al - Qaida in Pakistan have inflamed the population there .
And can pinprick air strikes win a war of this magnitude ?
The supply line for our troops in Afghanistan , which runs from Karachi up to Peshawar through the Khyber Pass to Kabul , is now a perilous passage .
Four times this month , U.S. transport depots in Pakistan have been attacked , with hundreds of vehicles destroyed .
Before arriving in Kandahar , Gates spoke grimly of a " sustained commitment for some protracted period of time .
How many years that is , and how many troops that is … nobody knows . "
Gen . McKiernan says it will be at least three or four years before the Afghan army and police can handle the Taliban .
But why does it take a dozen years to get an Afghan army up to where it can defend the people and regime against a Taliban return ?
Why do our Afghans seem less disposed to fight and die for democracy than the Taliban are to fight and die for theocracy ?
Does their God , Allah , command a deeper love and loyalty than our god , democracy ?
McKiernan says the situation may get worse before it gets better .
Gates compares Afghanistan to the Cold War . " ( W ) e are in many respects in an ideological conflict with violent extremists . …
The last ideological conflict we were in lasted about 45 years . "
That would truly be , in Donald Rumsfeld ’s phrase , " a long , hard slog . "
America , without debate , is about to invest blood and treasure , indefinitely , in a war to which no end seems remotely in sight , if the commanding general is talking about four years at least and the now - and - future war minister is talking about four decades .
What is there to win in Afghanistan to justify doubling down our investment ?
If our vital interest is to deny a sanctuary there to al - Qaida , do we have to build a new Afghanistan to accomplish that ?
Did not al - Qaeda depart years ago for a new sanctuary in Pakistan ?
What hope is there of creating in this tribal land a democracy committed to freedom , equality and human rights that Afghans have never known ?
What is the expectation that 54,000 or 75,000 U.S. troops can crush an insurgency that enjoys a privileged sanctuary to which it can return , to rest , recuperate and recruit for next year ’s offensive ?
Of all the lands of the earth , Afghanistan has been among the least hospitable to foreigners who come to rule , or to teach them how they should rule themselves .
Would Dwight D. Eisenhower  who settled for the status quo ante in Korea , an armistice at the line of scrimmage  commit his country to such an open - ended war ?
Would Richard Nixon ?
Would Ronald Reagan ?
Hard to believe .
George W. Bush would .
But did not America vote against Bush ?
Why is America getting seamless continuity when it voted for significant change ?

The women of sci - fi have come a long way since then , and for proof , look no further than Battlestar Galactica .
Returning Friday night for the start of its final half - season , the Peabody Award - winning television series continues to blend current events and religion into its thoughtful story lines .
Along the way , BSG has also conjured a gender - blind universe filled with female characters of genuine substance .
Admiral Adama ( played by Edward James Olmos , pictured right with Mary McDonnell ) still commands the battered Galactica and the rest of the ragtag fleet , but the women of BSG will have plenty to say about what lies ahead for the remnants of humanity , who landed on a wasteland during last fall 's toxic - shock midseason finale
" Battlestar Galactica has gone out of its way to establish this environment where this sense of gender equality can be expressed , " said women 's studies professor Sue Brennan , who screened the show for a course called " Gender , Race and Sexuality in Pop Culture " at Ohio State University .
" Battlestar Galactica speaks to a broadening of women 's roles in sci- fi that we began to see in the '90s with shows like Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Firefly , which introduced stronger female characters . "
Prime example :
The show 's clever , cancer - stricken President Roslin as portrayed by McDonnell ( pictured top left ) .
Inhabiting the character full force , McDonnell has wielded more authority in BSG than she ever did in the Oscar - winning Dances with Wolves .
" There is n't this idea that women are going to be guided by their hormones , " Brennan said .
" With Roslin , she makes at lot of tough decisions that are not compelled by her feminine intuition .
At the same time , in the second season , she had that whole weird mystic breakdown religious experience that sort of played into her femininity . "

Princess Leia : Sporting the hair bun that launched a thousand Comic - Con imitators , Carrie Fisher brought some spunk to Star Wars ' 1977 - style take on the intergalactic damsel in distress .
Sarah Connor : In Terminator 2 : Judgment Day , Linda Hamilton made biceps sexy as the Resistance 's gun-toting rebel warrior .
Ripley : Starting with 1979's Alien , Sigourney Weaver emanated calm , fierce authority – until crew members ' innards began exploding .
River : Summer Glau added a fresh , street - urchin spin to Joss Whedon 's 2002 outer space series .
In a series filled with dramatic reversals , the most radical switcheroo on the gender front happened before filming ever began , when Galactica 's creators decided to cast Katee Sackhoff ( pictured above , right ) to play the role of Starbuck .
" The whole notion of women in the [ U.S. ] military is a relatively new idea , " series co-creator Ronald D. Moore told TV critics during a BSG press conference .
" Making Starbuck a woman was a way of avoiding what I felt would be ' rogue pilot with a heart of gold ' cliche . "
Brennan calls the role reversal a bold move .
" There was all this outrage : ' How dare they change this very masculine renegade character , "
she said .
" How can they translate Starbuck into a female character ?
But the show has clearly proven that they can .
Kara
Thrace 's competence is maybe questioned as far as her disregard for authority but never because of her gender . "
Besides generating big buzz for BSG , Sackhoff 's portrayal of Galactica 's resident visionary / fighter pilot / possible final Cylon has galvanized viewers over the run of the show .
She 's come back from the dead , saved salty Col. Saul Tigh ( Michael Hogan , pictured below right ) from death and guided her people to Earth .
It remains to be seen what Starbuck does for an encore , but the actress ' rough - and - tumble take on the fleet 's most mesmerizing fighter jock will doubtless continue to render gender utterly irrelevant .
Even Tricia Helfer
( pictured above , middle ) has managed to evolve beyond the seductress version of Cylon
Number
Six that gob - smacked drooling fanboys during the show 's first couple of seasons .
" A lot of people expected my character to be the eye candy , " she said , speaking Thursday by cellphone from her car en route to a Battlestar Galactica auction in Pasadena , California .
" That preconception was strengthened by the fact that I came from a modeling background and had just started acting .
People went ,
' model - turned - actress , in a red dress , blonde hair : great ! '
Luckily , throughout the season we got to prove that was n't the case ....
Reducing
Six to just a sex object would have been a little bit one note , and that was n't what it was about . "
Playing a " skinjob " Cylon capable of being reborn and copied , Helfer enjoyed playing multiple variations of Number Six .
In addition to Caprica Six and the " Head Six " that only Gaius Baltar ( played by James Callis ) can see , Helfer portrayed the traumatized Gina in Season 2 followed by the Cylon leadership role assumed by Natalie in Season 4 .
Helfer savored the opportunity to " get killed and come back for more . "
" Looking back on it , I get pretty excited about all these different characters , " Helfer said , " Each one did n't necessarily take as much of a journey , but through all of the characters together , I got to have quite a journey . "
Other strong women on the show include Grace Park ( pictured , right ) , who plays Lt. Sharon " Athena " Agathon and various other incarnations of Cylon Number Eight , and Lucy Lawless , on board as rebel Cylon commander D'Anna Biers ( aka Number Three ) .
In her role , Lawless adds a fearsome chapter to her action babe resume .
After helping to create the female ass - kicker archetype with her mid-'90s TV series Xena : Warrior Princess ,
Lawless emerged last season from deep - freeze mode .
Now that she 's been
" unboxed , " she puts out a do n't - mess - with - me vibe that brooks no challenge .
Galactica has been particularly effective in shattering the mid-century sci-fi tradition epitomized by Princess Leia in Star Wars , according to professor Brennan .
" On Battlestar Galactica , these are not damsels in distress that the men have to save , and that 's appealing particularly for women of my generation in their late 20s and 30s , " she said .
" We were raised thinking about equality and I think Battlestar Galactica
attracts women who maybe were n't interested in sci- fi in the first place but now watch the show because it has so many strong female characters . "
Big questions remain for BSG fans as the series embarks on the final leg of its boundary - pushing four - season run .
But beyond the
identity of the fifth Cylon , the outcome of the Cylon civil war and the fate of an apparently devastated Earth , one issue appears to be already resolved for the annals of TV history .
" Battlestar Galactica shows us so many women in positions of power , " Brennan said , " which is unique not only for sci - fi as a genre , but for television in general . "
The final , 10 - episode run of Battlestar Galactica begins Friday at 10 p.m. EST on Sci Fi Channel .

Taking a page from Nintendo's Wii gaming console , Lenovo on Monday announced an all - in - one PC with a remote control that doubles as a motion - based gaming controller .
Like the iMac , the all - in - one IdeaCentre A600 combines a monitor and CPU in a thin system .
It will be on display at the Consumer Electronics Show from January 8 to 11 in Las Vegas .
Its wireless remote control is similar to Nintendo Wii's Wii Remote , which allows users to interact with a video game by waving or pointing the game controller .
Using motion - sensing technology , the Wii Remote becomes a racket when swinging during a tennis game , or a weapon when playing a fighting game .
Lenovo's gadget mimics the Wii's approach .
" We have an example of a bowling game [ where ] you can wave the remote and that actually controls your game , " said Ninis Samuel , director of marketing strategy and programs .
The company is bundling some motion - based games with the PC to use with the remote - based gaming controller .
Titles of the games were n't immediately available .
Lenovo is trying to capitalize on the trend of entertainment options merging into the PC .
Few are able to play motion - based games , which could make this motion - based game controller a pioneer .
In addition to controlling TV functions and video recordings on the PC , the remote control can also be used as an air mouse that moves the mouse pointer when waved .
It has some advantages over a conventional mouse -- it can function without being on a surface and be used at a distance -- when sitting on a couch , for example .
If the air mouse was n't enough , the remote also works as a VOIP ( voice over Internet protocol ) handset .
" If you have telephony software on your PC like Windows Live or Skype , you can use your remote to make those phone calls because it essentially can act as a phone , " Samuel said .
The IdeaCentre A600 starts at a price of US$ 999 .
The desktop has a 21.5 - inch screen that supports 1920 by 1280 - pixel resolution for high - definition video playback .
It runs on Intel Pentium Dual Core or Core 2 Duo mobile processors , supports up to 4GB of RAM and up to 1TB of storage .
It includes Wi-Fi wireless networking and runs on the Windows Vista OS .
Options include the remote control , Blu-ray DVD player , a TV tuner and a Advanced Micro Devices ' ATI graphics card .
The desktop will be available worldwide by the beginning of March .
The desktop is part of a new portfolio of entertainment PCs that Lenovo plans to show at CES .
The company is also rolling out a new laptop line , the IdeaPad Y series , which is targeted at mainstream users looking to create and view multimedia content .
Lenovo has added features that can make watching movies an easier and enjoyable experience .
For example , the laptops have the " OneKey " feature , in which pressing one button " optimizes " the experience of watching movies by enhancing the sound and visuals , according to the company .
Another feature includes ambient light sensors that adjusts screen brightness based on the user 's surroundings .
" [ It ] uses a sensor on the actual lid of the laptop that senses whether or not you are in a darker or lighter room .
Then it adjusts the brightness and the graphics to your environment , " Samuel said .
The feature is available only in the IdeaPad Y650 laptop , which has a 16 - inch screen .
The IdeaPad Y series laptops come with screens ranging from 14 to 16 inches , run on Intel Core 2 Duo processors and include Windows Vista .
The weight of the laptops ranges from 4.6 pounds ( 2.09 kilograms ) to 6 pounds .
The laptops will become available worldwide by the beginning of March , Lenovo said .
Pricing was not immediately available .

Well , part of my head health and general well being is , form time to time to share a few back to basics tips here having slowed down and well , got back to basics !
It ’s a …
Masturbation may be good for you – or bad , depending on your age .
The solitary sexual activity that is widely practised but little discussed , is linked with an increased risk of prostate cancer when practised frequently by young men in their twenties and thirties , doctors say .
But by the time men reach their fifties , it may protect against the disease because it helps remove toxins that have built up over a lifetime .
Prostate cancer is known to be driven by the male hormone testosterone , and men with high levels of testosterone tend to have a higher sex drive and a higher risk of the cancer .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
But most research has examined older men because prostate cancer is unusual under 50 .
Researchers at the University of Nottingham studied the link between sexual activity in younger men and the disease to see if it affected their long - term risk .
More than 400 men with prostate cancer diagnosed before the age of 60 were questioned about their sexual habits over the preceding decades and the results compared with 400 controls .
The findings showed that those who had been most sexually active in their twenties – having sexual intercourse or masturbating more than 20 times a month – were more likely to have the cancer .
Frequent masturbation , but not sexual intercourse , in the twenties and thirties was significantly linked with the later development of prostate cancer .
In their 50s men who were most sexually active ( more than 10 times a month for sexual intercourse and masturbation combined ) enjoyed a small protective effect .
The effect was greater when masturbation was assessed on its own .
Polyxeni Dimitripolou , who led the study published in the British Journal of Urology International , said : " It seems as if keeping up a certain level of sexual activity through the decades is better than having a high level early [ in the 20s and 30s ] and then nothing . "
" One theory is that during the early years the prostate gland is more susceptible to hormonal changes and is still developing .
As men age and accumulate toxins from the diet or through their lungs , sexual activity may help release them .
Studies have found toxins in the semen and the fluid produced in the prostate .
As you age it is more important to flush them out . "
However , she admitted that there was no good explanation of why masturbation should have a greater impact on prostate cancer , either by increasing or reducing the risk , than sexual intercourse .
" For our sample there was no association with intercourse – all the effect was coming from masturbation .
But it may have to do with our group of men .
With a different group there could be different findings . "
She added : " What makes our study stand out from previous research is that we focused on a younger age group than normal and included both intercourse and masturbation at various stages in people 's lives . "
" A possible explanation for the protective effect that men in their fifties appear to receive from overall sexual activity , and particularly masturbation , is that the release of accumulated toxins during sexual activity reduces the risk of developing cancer in the prostate area .
This theory has , however , not been firmly established and further research is necessary . "

Last week , we reached some closure on a burning and controversial question that has occupied many for many years now .
That is the simple question of who was responsible for the abuse , torture , rape and murder of prisoners in American custody in the war on terror , most indelibly captured by the photographic images of Abu Ghraib .
The Senate 's bipartisan report , issued with no dissents , reiterates and adds factual context to what we already know .
And there is no equivocation in the report .
The person who authorized all the abuse and torture at Abu Ghraib , the man who gave the green light to the abuses in that prison , is the president of the United States , George W. Bush .
Again : there is no longer any reasonable factual debate about this ( hence to near total silence of the Republican right ) , and the Senate report finally holds the president responsible in bipartisan fashion :
The abuse of detainees in U.S. custody cannot simply be attributed to the actions of “ a few bad apples ” acting on their own .
The fact is that senior officials in the United States government solicited information on how to use aggressive techniques , redefined the law to create the appearance of their legality , and authorized their use against detainees .
Those efforts damaged our ability to collect accurate intelligence that could save lives , strengthened the hand of our enemies , and compromised our moral authority .
Those ghastly pctures of naked , hooded prisoners ?
Bush approved nudity and hooding of prisoners .
Hypothermia ?
Sleep deprivation ?
Bush signed a memo removing the most baseline protections for all human beings under the Geneva Conventions .
Waterboarding ?
Bush knew full well .
As did Rice and Tenet and Powell and that poseur in defense of human rights , Paul Wolfowitz .
But even before the memo , before any prisoners were captured , the Bush administration was working on how to torture them :
In December 2001 , more than a month before the President signed his memorandum , the Department of Defense ( DoD ) General Counsel ’s Office had already solicited information on detainee “ exploitation ” from the Joint Personnel Recovery Agency ( JPRA ) , an agency whose expertise was in training American personnel to withstand interrogation techniques considered illegal under the Geneva Conventions .
Let 's be absolutely clear what this means :
When we saw an image of Lynndie England pulling a naked prisoner around on a leash , we assumed at the time that she improvised this , or was some kind of " bad apple . "
This is and was a conscious lie to the Congress , and to the American people , and to the world .
The person who authorized the use of nudity and leashes on prisoners was not Lynndie England or any of the other grunts thrown to the wolves .
The man who authorized the technique shown below is the president of the United States :
The report itself is not that long and I highly recommend reading it all closely .
It is the most sobering indictment of high government officials in the U.S. since Watergate .
And , in the gravity of crimes , it is a far more profound violation of the law and the constitution and the security of the United States than Watergate ever was .
Bush 's crimes are far greater than Nixon 's - because war crimes are far graver than burglaries .
And there is no statute of limitations for war crimes .

An Island of Functionality in a Sea of Fanciful Non-Functionality ?

Introduction : Feature Phones with Missing Features
i Phone , iPhone 3G , T - Mobile G1 :
The phones grabbing all the press recently are notable for slick user interfaces and on - line experience .
These phones are however , missing many features that were previously taken for granted in advanced smartphones .
Bluetooth file transfers , Voice dialing , ability to run Java apps , and Camcorder functionality are some of these features .
When the original iPhone was released with exactly none of these features , those of us that follow the industry were amazed .
It was a little like the story of The Emperor 's New Clothes .
The T - Mobile G1 lacks some of the same features .
Nokia still markets several " Do it all " phones like the Nokia n95 , and n96 .
The Samsung i8510 has all the features too .
But these phones all run the Symbian OS .
Symbian , by Nokia 's own admission , is past its prime .
The phones do it all , but Symbian and the Series 60 ( S60 ) UI can make it tedious to interact with all those features .
There are also numerous Windows Mobile phones that fill out the " Do it all " feature list very well .
Again , however , some people prefer to avoid the Windows Mobile OS .
The basis for people wanting to avoid WinMo , or even if there are such people is off topic .
I will say that I have had several people refuse to show me their Windows Mobile smartphones because they figured that there was a high probability that it would crash during any impromptu demo , and if it did , I would wallow intolerably in a cloud of self - righteousness .
Perceptive folks , these are .
So what if one desires function over eye - candy , and wants to avoid Symbian and Windows Mobile .
Congratulations , you 've narrowed your options significantly .
Motorola brought Linux to mainstream phones several years ago in the MING series .
The E680 ( i ) , A780 , A910 , A1200 , A1600 , along with others in the MING family are excellent PDA phones .
More recently , Motorola released its MOTOMAGX Linux / Java platform .
The popular RAZR2 V8 , and ROKR E8 are members of this 2nd Linux family .
Both series have great functionality , but only the A910 has WiFi , and none of them have a full feature set comparable to current high - end offerings .
Thats changed with the MOTOZINE ZN5 .
Here 's a phone with a feature list that 's for the most part up there with the top of the pack from the other brands , and it runs Linux .
Does it really qualify as an " everything works " phone ?
Is there a compelling advantage to this phone above and beyond Linux fan - boyism ?
This review will objectively examine these questions by way of a feature - by - feature detailed review , using a US purchased Chinese / Asian market ZN5 .
Please note that when released officially in the US there will likely be customization by wireless carriers , so some features may be different that what is reviewed here .
The Unboxing
OK , I guess I have succumb to the on boxing craze .
Here is Linuxslate.com 's first unboxing video :

Exterior Features
Front
The front is dominated by the large ( 2.4 inch ) 240 x 320 display .
While smaller than the iPhone , G1 , or some other recent phones , and having half the resolution , The ZN5 's screen is extremely clear and readable .
It is under real glass and is easily as bright as the iPhone 's if not better .
Even though its not a touch screen , it seems to almost magically attract fingerprints .
Above the screen , there are 2 lights representing charging and Bluetooth .
Below the screen is the 4 way pad , and separate center button , and the keyboard .
The keyboard is basically a flat membrane , with small nubs to help you locate where to press .
A few keys have multiple functions based on mode , and their function is indicated by a small illuminated icon .
Motorola calls this " ModeShift " , and made a big deal of it on the ROKR E8 .
On the ZN5 , however it is used to a lesser extent , with most of the keys acting as they would on most phones 90 % of the time .
The gray slate appearance , stylish graphics , and little jewel - like nubs do a great job of making the membrane keyboard look acceptable on a high - end phone , but the fact remains that it is just a membrane .
The feel of the membrane / nub combination , like the looks , is acceptable , but the fast texters out there are going to prefer real keys .
Durability may be another concern , but the membrane seems pretty tough .
Left
The left side has the USB port , 3.5 m m headphone jack , and place to attach a wrist strap or phone charm .
The USB port uses a micro USB connector , as opposed to the mini USB seen on some previous Motorola phones , and on a few others like the Blackberry .
This single Micro USB connector can take on several roles , which will be covered later .
Near the top of the phone is the 3.5 mm audio connector .
While compatible with standard stereo headphones , this connector contains additional contacts .
This allows the same port to be used with wired headsets , and also proves video out .
I applaud the use of non-proprietary connectors , and this is one of the compelling benefits of this phone .
Not only can you use your favorite bass - boost earplugs or use those fancy noise - canceling headphones on your next airline flight , but you are also ready for iPod night at that geeky trendy bar - all without any adapters .
Right
Regular readers know that I am a fan of the scroll wheel .
Well , the ZN5 lacks one , but it does have Up and Down buttons on the right side near the top .
In addition to serving as a volume control , they do control scrolling when applicable .
Just below this is a keyboard lock slide switch .
It feels solid , and prevents unintentional dialing and other keystrokes -- as long as you remember to use it .
There is no software key lock , unless you lock the entire phone .
A software auto - keylock is probably a technical possibility - such a thing exists for Nokia phones , but as of this writing , no such app exists for this phone .
Near the bottom is a purple colored key who 's primary function is the camera shutter button .
When in camera mode , it is intended that the phone be held sideways .
The combination of the location of this button , the ModeShift technology , the camera software , and the shape of the phone make using it as a camera very natural .
It really feels and works like a real digital camera , not a phone with a camera as a second thought .
Back
From a camera point of view , the back of the Motozine is the business end .
The camera is protected by a simple sliding shutter .
Opening it is one of several ways to trigger camera mode .
Next to the lens is the real xenon flash and a red - eye reduction light .
The bottom of the unit is rubberized , and contains a slot for the single internal speaker .
The entire back panel above this , with the exception of the area around the camera , is the battery cover .
The idea of the rubber grip area becomes obvious the first time you do a quick one - handed snap shot .
Internal
Inside the battery cover is the sim card slot , as well as the micro SD card slot .
The micro SD card is not hot - swappable , as both the rear cover , and battery must be removed to access it .
This is a bit of a disappointment , as even the much older A780 's micro SD card was right on top of the phone .
My guess is that Motorola figured that too many people either forget to unmount the card prior to removing it , or accidentally pop the card out , thus causing data corruption .
Additionally , eliminating the press to eject socket saves both space and cost .
For this review , several 1 Gig micro SD cards from different manufactures were tested , as well as Lexar 4 Gig card .
All worked .
4
Gig is the published upper limit of card size , so larger cards were not tested .
Form Factor and Size
The ZN5 is comparable in size to the iPhone .
and with the exception of the camera bulge , and the 4 way pad , it is almost exactly the same thickness as the iPhone .
Given the functionality of this phone as a camera , and understanding that there is an actual lens focusing mechanism in there , the bulge is , in my opinion , completely acceptable .
The ZN5 is also slightly narrower and slightly taller than the iPhone .
This slim appearance , combined with the colors and beveled shape make it both very elegant looking , and nice to hold .
Basic Phone Functionality :
Sound and RF Quality
Much as the iPhone has become the gold standard for style and user interfaces , Motorola has , with a few exceptions , long been the standard for call quality and RF performance .
The ZN5 seems to be no exception to this .
In week areas where other phones could not complete a call , or reported only 1 or 2 bars , the ZN5 shows as many as 4 , and calls complete and stay connected .
Motorola advertises something called " CrystalTalk " , which this phone has .
Motorola writes : " CrystalTalk is a bundling of microphone noise reduction , noise adaptive speaker enhancements , and on some products , a full duplex speaker phone . "
Well , every manufacture has lots of voice processing and noise reduction technology in their phones , and not too much should be made of a trademark .
Voice quality was neither better or worse than other premium mobiles .
The ZN5 does , of course have a speakerphone , and the sound quality of the internal speaker seems to be very good .
Quad Band GSM
The ZN5 is a Quad Band GSM phone ( 850/900/1800/1900 ) .
It lacks any 3G capability , although it does have WiFi .
Even here in the US , 3G networks are becoming more and more prolific , but the lack of 3G may have an upside .
Depending on the carrier policies , not needing a 3G account could save you money .
Voice Dialing , Voice Commanding
As mentioned , the phone does support not only Voice Dialing , but Voice Commanding .
Pressing the Call ( Off - Hook ) button for a few seconds loads the Voice Recognition system .
There is a delay between pressing the button and any sort of feedback that the VR system is starting up .
A voice then tells you VR is loading , and there is a further delay before it is ready .
This is a minor annoyance , and once you get used to the delay , you learn not to begin talking until you hear the VR tone .
In addition to speaking the name of a contact , there are over 20 VR functions that can be spoken .
There is no training or any VR settings , so the command list does not appear to be customizable .
Generally , VR works very well , at least for me .
It gets commands correct nearly 100 % of the time , but if you have people in your contacts whose names sound different than a phonetic interpretation of the spelling , it is going to have difficulty recognizing them .
This of course is typical , and no different than other phones with Voice Dialing .
Overall , I would rate it as good to excellent .
The phone 's voice seems to be set by the language settings .
With this phone set to English , the voice is a very natural and understandable British English male voice .
Since the voice is part of the firmware , it will likely be set for specific regions , and is not easily changed by the customer .
Voice Command Dialing , and Voice synthesis works fine via wired or Bluetooth headsets .
True hands - off dialing , answering , and even changing some settings is possible .
This is a big advantage over certain other trendy handsets that I have been referring to throughout this article .
The Camera
Still Shots
OK , There 's no question that the big deal about this phone is the 5 Megapixel camera , but I am actually not going to say much about it here .
This aspect of the of the device is well reviewed elsewhere .
Motorola has a website show casing the camera 's capability , with a large gallery of pictures ( See Links , Below ) .
I do want to emphasize however , that this phone has all of the capability of a true , dedicated , quality , 5 MP camera .
Flash , digital zoom , red - eye reduction , auto focus ( including macro ) , and compatibility with Kodak 's Easyshare products and services .
The concept of actually taking pictures with a phone , with the intent of framing them and displaying them may previously have gotten laughs , but when your pull out your Motozine , and people see features like red - eye reduction , and the actual focusing lens , they realize that it is a serious camera .
The only thing I regret is that I could not use it to take the pictures for this article , since itself is the subject .
Video Recording
The ZN5 supports video recording , including audio , but supports only 144 x 176 and 96 x 128 resolutions ( 15 frames per second ) .
Despite the capability of the CCD , the systems CPU power , and the 4 Gig storage potential , there is no provision for even Standard Definition ( SD ) video recoding , let alone High Definition ( HD ) .
Also absent is the Business Card Import feature as seen on the A1200 , and a few others .
With the auto focus allowing the camera to do macro mode , the hardware seems to be there , so seeing this feature at some point in the future via a firmware update or 3rd party is not impossible .
I think it was omitted based on the target audience of this phone .
What 's MOTOMAGX ?
There 's suddenly a lot of talk about mobile device user interfaces due to the excellent work of our friends in Cupertino .
I must say that the ZN5 feels almost retro by that standard .
By any other standard - i.e. phones other than the iPhone , and perhaps the T - Mobile G1 , the Motozine is good to excellent .
It is far less cumbersome than the Symbian S60 UI used on many Nokia phones , and unless you are already a S60 pro , you 'll have a far sorter trip up the learning curve with this phone than most others that have as many features .
The menu map is kept simple , and mostly intuitive .
The MOTOMAGX Linux / Java OS bears a noticeable resemblance to the EZX OS , but has been simplified .
The tabs at the top are gone , and icons cannot be added to the Main Menu .
Interestingly , added Java programs appear as functions in one of 3 out of the 9 main icons or menus .
Apps can be added to Media , Google , and Office .
It is likely that native ( Linux ) apps will be able to be installed as Main Menu icons , or perhaps there will be a hack to allow it .
In addition to being simpler than EZX , or Symbian S60 , it is also far more elegant .
The Main Menu can be viewed as a list , a grid of icons , or as a one icon at a time in a rotating scroll called " Spinner " .
Main Menu icons , as well as 1st level menu items can be re-ordered in most cases .
In the case of the Spinner mode of the main menu , the icons snake into a circle to be re-ordered .
It 's a cool and smooth graphics effect , and scores lots of points for eye - candy .
The Home screen can also be customized .
4 functions can be assigned to the 4 directions of the Navigation pad for quick access .
In addition to selecting any 4 functions , including installed Java apps , the user can choose whether or not to display the icons .
There is also a " Shortcuts " key on the Home screen , allowing quick access to 6 pre-selected functions .
Although I am sure there is probably a simple hack to change these , there is no ability to change these by default .
I have not found the capability for other customization of the home screen , for example the ability to add upcoming calendar events .
The top of the screen has the usual indications : Signal strength , carrier , Battery level , time , etc. , as well as icons for Bluetooth and WiFi .
There is a bug with respect to the latter , as we see later in this review .
As I received it , my ZN5 has 3 pre-installed themes .
While all have the noted eye - candy , the default Kodak theme is by far the best looking .
As of right now , I know of no way to obtain or install other themes , but the " Wallpaper " can be changed to a file of your choosing , including anything snapped with the camera .
The MOTOMAGX Linux / Java OS really does , in this geeks opinion , offer non-geeks an advantage .
Several other reviews agree , and give the ZN5's user interface high marks .
PIM ( PDA ) Functionality
All the basic PIM ( Personal Information Manager ) functionality is there , and while it 's obvious that the phones emphasis is on being a camera , it is also a functional PDA with a few important exceptions .
There is no out of the box compatibility with Microsoft Office apps ( Word , Excel , PowerPoint ) , or Adobe PDF .
There may be Java applications to fill this void .
Check Motorolafans.com , or the Linuxslate.com forums for updates .
The email application supports POP and IMAP , and supports SSL , etc .
It also has a function that attempts to automatically configure email based on just your email address , and password .
While this may work for some home ISP 's , it is unlikely that it will guess server names , etc. in most corporate environments .
While there is no specific Exchange Client , or push email , you can connect to an Exchange Sever via IMAP if your company allows it .
There is also a dedicated Gmail menu item , but all really is is a bookmark for the Gmail mobile webmail page .
It works much better if you enable IMAP compatibility in your Gmail account , and then add that account to the ZN5 's email app .
The ZN5 supports SyncML , but since nothing I use natively supports SyncML , I have not tied it yet .
Since Bluetooth , and OBEX is supported , it made it very easy for me to send data to the phone without sync'ing .
For example , while my Macintosh said that the only thing it could do with the phone was to use it as a modem ( more on that later ) , I was able to simply do a Select All in the Apple Contacts app , and drag them to the Bluetooth File Exchange icon .
Several hundred contacts were almost instantly in the phone , and with the exception of a few that had bad field names to start with , they were in the phone correctly .
Pictures did not transfer , as the phone complained about memory .
Contacts that had pictures would likely have worked in smaller groups , or at worst one at a time .
The Calendar function is also fairly typical for a mobile phone , but works well .
Calendar Invitations received in email are recognized , and if Accepted , appear in the Calendar .
Moving Calender entries from Entourage or iCal to the ZN5 via Bluetooth does not work as well .
In a problem shared with my A780 , it seems that the phone is picky about the contents of .vcs files .
It should ignore extraneous fields , but it seems not too .
.ics files dragged out of Entourage or iCal can be hand edited and renamed to .vcs files that can then be Bluetoothed to the ZN5 , but this is not a very elegant workaround .
Perhaps one of a number of SyncML plugins is the solution .
For a list of SyncML clients , plug-ins , and servers , as well as on - line services , See the Links Below .
Again , where the ZN5 stands on PDA / Office functionality is based on what you compare it with .
What 's there works well , but there are large omissions .
Hopefully there will be software in the future to fill some of the gaps .
Media Player and FM Radio
Interestingly , the ZN5 has no way to directly launch the Media Player .
In what I guess is someone 's idea of simplification , one instead selects " Media Finder " from the Multimedia Main Menu , then navigates to a number of folders that have no relation to actual folders in the phone 's memory , or on the card .
That takes the user to a second set of folders , such as Recently Played , All Songs , Playlists , etc .
Getting to your music , building playlists , etc. , is pretty intuitive , but I would be just as happy with a File ... Open ... metaphor .
There is a File Manager in a totally different menu that works based on the actual files / folders in the phone , or on the micro SD card .
Once launched by selecting some music , a fairly cool looking media player pops up .
The media player certainly includes most features one may want .
There 's an equalizer with 9 pre-sets , but no way to create a custom equalizer .
There is also a " Spacial Audio " ( Stereo Separation ) setting , and a Bass Boost that is separate from the EQ .
Shuffle ( Random play ) is supported .
" ModeShift " , in the case of the Media Player simply means turning the LED 's under the numeric keypad off during playback .
Album art , if present in the music file , is displayed as a small preview under the band / album name .
The album art does not replace the stylized turn table background of the player , but can be displayed full screen while the music plays .
Music can continue to play even when you leave the Media Finder .
In this case , the player becomes a mini-player at the bottom of the Home Screen .
Audio Quality is good via the audio jack or Bluetooth stereo ( more on that later ) , and even the internal speaker sounds pretty good , but there is only a single speaker .
There is plenty of volume , but there is no volume limit setting in the firmware I reviewed .
The FM radio app is similarly simple , but functional .
As with most such devices , it uses the headphone / headset wire as and antenna , and will not function with out a wired headphone / headset , or other output device connected .
It does a good job at pulling in stations , but does not seem to pickup or display and station ID or other info .
It has the usual Memory ( Presets ) and Scan features .
Like the Music Player , the Movie Player ( which is really the same app ) is not directly invoked , but is launched buy selecting a compatible movie from the " Media Finder " .
A number of MPEG ( mp4 or mpg ) movies I put on a card would not play .
2 included 3 gp movies plated fine .
More testing with respect to movie playback is needed , and for now , I must state that this review is incomplete in this respect .
The Movie Player lacks the Equalizer of the Music Player , but the Bass Boost is still available .
This is notable since even many dedicated Media Players do not have any sort of tone control for Videos .
The media player will also play streaming music and videos in some formats .
3gpp audio streams worked , as do videos from the YouTube mobile service : http://m.youtube.com.
As mentioned , Bluetooth stereo works , so re-streaming 3gpp compatible Internet radio stations to your A2DP headset or speakers works --
It 's pretty much wireless listening utopia .
Internet Connectivity and Web Browsing
Since the debut of the iPhone much there has been much talk about " The Mobile Web Experience " .
When compared to mobile phones previous to the iPhone , the ZN5's " Symphony " browser fairs very well .
It does an excellent job of quickly rendering simple , or mobile phone specific pages , and is faster over WiFi or EDGE than , for example , A Nokia N80 I used for a while .
More complicated pages can have some problems with respect to both how they appear on the small screen , and stability .
There is zoom capability , but there is no keyboard short cut for zooming ... it 's a couple layers deep in menus , and it occurs in only a few large steps .
There is no way to turn the screen sideways in the browser , and like zooming , " Full Screen " is 2 menus down , and has no " hot key " .
Assuming a page does render in a usable fashion , scrolling , both vertically , and horizontally is acceptable in speed , although not particularly smooth .
Again , better than the vast majority of phones , but no where near an iPhone .
The ZN5's browser has an interesting feature that attempts to take all of the page 's contents , and allign them into a long document that is only the width of the screen .
When it works , you can comfortably read long articles and scroll using either the 4 Way pad , or the Up / Down keys on the side .
I would like to interject a note here that not only applies to the browser , but all apps on the ZN5 .
Motomagx seems to do a very good job of memory management .
When a particular app or feature is not being used , it is purged , and memory is freed up .
For example if you load Voice Recognition , then use the Browser , and wish to go back to VR , it will have to load all over again .
Even the Main Menu itself works this way .
While this does cause a few momentary delays , it seems to allow each app to work as well as possible .
Again , I feel this is a real - world benefit to the Linux / Java OS on these phones .
The browser works when connected via GPRS / EDGE , or WiFi , and it will automatically switch from EDGE to WiFi when the latter is available .
Unfortunately , setting this up is not particularly user friendly , and seems not to work in some cases even once when set up right .
Again , to be fair , it must be mentioned that this is an unlocked phone , and I am testing it on a carrier that does not officially support it .
Like the Motorola EZX phones before it , the ZN5 uses the concept of " Data Connections " to specify settings for different providers , and WiFi . A " Connection " is created for a specific carrier , and then optionally , one can select WiFi first .
There is then a separate set of " Saved Networks " for WiFi .
It gets worse ...
In each app that connects to the Internet , there is a separate " Profile " for how that specific app connects .
There is also one for MultiMedia Messaging ( MMS ) .
The individual app profile points to a specific Carrier Connection that was previously created , as well as other settings .
Sound complicated an convoluted ?
It is .
Given the above , joining WiFi networks is actually pretty well done .
WiFi performance is also good and connecting to found networks is fast .
Entering Hex WEP keys is not easy on a device that lacks a full keyboard , so I was very happy when it connected to several secure networks on the first try , including ones that have given other devices reviewed here problems .
It has also never forgotten , or made me re-enter a WEP or WPA key .
WEP , and WPA ( 1 or 2 ) - PKS is supported .
I am not sure if LEAP is rolled into WEP support or just not supported .
There is a WiFi indicator in the status area of the screen , but it gives no indication of activity , signal strength , of even if you are connected to any available WiFi network .
It seems to solely indicate WiFi power .
Since the WiFi settings are in a separate menu , you have to leave any app you may be using and go to the WiFi settings just to see if you are connected , and how strong the signal is .
Wifi Icon problems do n't end there .
The WiFi icon overwrites the Bluetooth icon .
This is a minor UI glitch , but it shows that WiFi is new to Motomagx , and not fully de-bugged yet .
Adding Applications
Native Applications
I wish to phrase the following as a warning : Motorola does not currently support Native ( Linux ) Applications on these phones .
While they do have a free , downloadable development studio , as of right now , it only supports building apps for an emulator that is part of the development studio .
There is no way to install a completed project on any real Motomagx handset .
Further more , while there are some unofficial development tool chains ( read that as hacks ) to write native apps on the ROKR E8 and RAZR2 V8 , installing the apps requires installing a hacked firmware on the particular handset , and the ZN5 is simply too new to have a hacked firmware .
Firmwares are specific to the actual handset hardware so do n't even think of attempting to install a E8 or V8 firmware on your ZN5 .
A ruined handset is a certainty .
Even for the ROKR and RAZR , there are only a very few apps out there .
To make matters worse , it seems that Motorola is not working much , if at all to get true application development going .
The 3rd party developers also see much more money to be made in the Applications Stores that support the iPhone and G1 , so the developers are abandoning other environments as if they had a contagious disease .
Development for Qt ( which EXZ is based on ) , EZX , and MOTOMAGX was never that strong in the first place .
Want even more bad news ?
Qt is owned by a company called Trolltech , which Motorola 's biggest competitor -- Nokia - bought early this year .
OK , now that we 've got the facts out , and hit an emotional low on the potential for native apps for this phone , let 's work our way back up .
First , there is a small but loyal set of Motorola Linux phone developers , and porting Qt applications to the Motorola Linux phones is not difficult .
Add to this the fact that the ZN5 is definitely the member of this family with the most geek appeal , I feel sure that officially or otherwise , there will be ways to install native apps on this phone sooner rather than later .
I would even like to think yours truly may be able to help in this respect .
Also understand that apps written for the ROKR E8 and RAZR2 V8 should work on the ZN5 without modification .
The ZN5 itself , being a very good quality phone , and having plenty of popular features may help the whole Motomagx platform significantly .
Java Applications
While the score is a few thousand to zero in the competition between the iPhone App Store and native programs available for the ZN5 , the situation is just the opposite for Java apps .
The ZN5 has a Java MIDP 2.0 environment , and will run thousands of Java apps available that will , or at least should , run on the ZN5 .
Many of old stand - by's that I have used for years on various phones work on the ZN5 , others did not .
The ZN5 has the conventional mobile phone keyboard layout , so compatibility in that respect should be good .
Google Maps
On such essential Java application is Google Maps for Mobile .
While the ZN5 does not have GPS , and it seems that in the current version of Google Maps for Mobile , even cell tower based location is not working , Google Mobile Maps is extremely handy .
It eliminates one of the big missing features in this phone .
The version Google installed on my phone even supports Google Street view -- Something that as of this writing is not available on the iPhone .
Motorola really needs to get with Google , and write whatever check is needed to have Google Maps pre-installed on the ZN5 , and to get cell tower location , and a few other things working .
Bluetooth Details
In my opinion , one of the biggest advantages of the ZN5 is a functional Bluetooth system , with many , but not all protocols supported .
Table 2 is an edited output of running the command :
$ sdptool browse
On a Linux PC while the ZN5 is nearby , and discoverable :
Browsing 00:22:B4:xx:xx:xx ...
Service Name : SDP Server
Service Name : Public Browse Group Root
Service Name : Stereo Audio
Service Name : OBEX Imaging
Service Name : OBEX Object Push
Service Name : Dialup Networking
Service Name : OBEX File Transfer
Service Name : Remote Control
Service Name : Voice Gateway
" Handfree Audio Gateway " ( 0x111f )
" Generic Audio " ( 0x1203 )
Service Name : Voice Gateway
" Headset Audio Gateway " ( 0x1112 )
" Generic Audio " ( 0x1203 )
Table 2 - Supported Bluetooth profiles
When using OBEX , even large files transfer quickly and reliably over the Bluetooth 2.0 implementation .
Bluetooth Stereo , also known as A2DP was tested by pairing with a Bluetooth equipped Philips Table radio .
Once paired , one can simply select " Use Bluetooth " in the ZN5's Media Player , and it seamlessly switches .
As you can see from the screen shot of the radio , it verifies a stereo connection , and the great sound verifies true wireless stereo .
i Phone users shall now drop their aloofness by one more notch .
Screen Shot of Bluetooth capable table radio
verifies working A2DP .
As I mentioned in the Multimedia section , you can connect to a streaming Internet radio station over WiFi , and re-stream the audio via Bluetooth .
This demonstrates that WiFi and Bluetooth work simultaneously .
Quite by accident , in the same test , I verified that the table radio's buttons control the ZN5 's media player .
So I can play music that is residing on my ZN5 when I can't even remember what pair of cargo pants I left it in .
It 's really cool when this stuff " Just Works " .
I have also connected from my Wibrain B1LE ultramobile PC ( See Link to Review Below ) to the Internet while using Dialup Networking .
While a few changes were needed to some of the PPP configuration files on the Linux UMPC , getting up and running did not take long .
Performance over an EDGE connection was very good .
i Phone victims users go down one more notch .
So is that Humble Pie Apple flavored ?
Interestingly , when paired with a Mac running Leopard Mac OS X 10.5.5 ) , the Mac reported that the ZN5 could only be used for Dial Up networking .
Never the less , transferring files works seamlessly , and as mentioned above , I easily transfered all my contacts from the Mac address book at once0 .
I am sure that the ZN5 will be added to Mac OSX 's list of mobile devices and thier capabilities in the near future .
Better integration may also be obtained my creating a ZN5 description file by editing that of another , similar phone .
I remember having to do that for my old Nokia Communicator .
One profile the ZN5 apparently does not have is SIM card sharing .
However , I have also never seen a device that does SIM card sharing , so it 's kinda hard to fault Motorola for not including it .
USB
The ZN5 ha no less than 5 separate , and user selectable personalities when connected via USB :
Kodak Easy Share USB Printing Media Sync Memory Card Modem
Table 3
The ZN5 has Multiple USB Personalities
As of this writing , I have only tried Memory Card ( USB ) storage , and Modem Mode .
If I encounter any problems with any of the others , I will update this section as appropriate .
I have used Modem Mode with the same Wibrain UMPC used to test Bluetooth tethering .
All I did was change the name of the device from / dev/rfcomm0 to / dev/ttyACM0 , and I connected via USB on the first try .
I would certainly expect users of other operating systems to have similar ease .
( iPhone comment withheld , but I am keeping score . )
Memory Card mode , or USB storage generally worked well with most devices .
The Mac immediately mounted both the ZN5's internal storage and the micro SD card .
My desktop system ( Fedora Linux ) seems to mount only the card , and the Wibrain ( Ubuntu Linux ) would not mount either .
Using the ZN5 as a USB flash drive with other dedicated devices ( like MP3 players ) met with mixed results .
Generally they eventually worked , but some went through a loop of repeatedly connecting and disconnecting before settling down and seeing the sound files on the micro SD card .
A number of USB power sources also worked to charged the ZN5 , although if the ZN5 was in " Memory Card " ( storage ) mode , a few would go through the above mentioned repeated connecting and disconnecting .
Most worked without any such convulsions .
One way around this it to put the ZN5 in " Modem " mode , or to hit " Cancel " when connecting in Storage mode .
This will allow charging only .
The Tiny USB charger that comes with the iPhone or iPods , along with a Standard micro USB cable make for a great travel charger , plus you have your USB cable to use for tethering , file transfers , etc .
Kodak Easy
Share mode is nice because Kodak printers , including the kiosks in stores , will recognize the ZN5 as a Kodak camera .
Kodak Easy Share Software for Windows PC's is included on the disk with the ZN5 .
Video Out
The Motozine ZN5 supports video output via the headphone jack , much as an iPod Touch does .
When the composite cable is connected , and video out is turned on in a sub menu of the " Connections " menu , the screen image appears on the connected monitor .
At this point , the phone prompts you to go to Movies or Pictures , but you can simply cancel out of this menu , and the phones display is also output to the monitor .
The media gallery displays landscape on the phone , and fullscreen on a 4:3 monitor .
Everything else displays in the phones normal , vertical aspect ratio .
So while a Java app that could read .
PDF's or PowerPoint files , would in fact display on the monitor , the ZN5 would not make a practical presentation system unless the particular application knew how to kick the ZN5 in to fullscreen mode .
The video output is turned off when the cable is disconnected .
Battery Performance
Motorola lists the battery performance ( with the usual disclaimers ) as follows :
Talk Time : up to 349 to 574 minutes
Standby Time : up to 310 to 579 hour
In my expirience any such numbers are meaningless , and tests done by review web sites are not really much better .
For these reasons , I have not done a formal test of battery life , but I can say that there is no major issues .
A full days use for me looks something like this :
Automatically checking my email every 30 minutes , A few phone calls , Several files transfered via Bluetooth , and perhaps an hour of WiFi Web surfing --
That 's before I leave work .
In the evening , perhaps a few more short calls , another hour of Web / Google Maps ( Mixed WiFi and EDGE , and Streaming some Internet radio before bed .
With all that , I still have some left on the battery .
Since it charges during any USB use , if I connect up for some file transfers , it adds even more that is left at the end of the day .
The short version , is that for heavy use , especially WiFi , this , like basically every other WiFi enabled hand held device will need to be charged every day .
For lighter use , i.e. just a few call , and a quick check of a WAP site or 2 , I am sure you can venture out with out a charger for several days .
I also want to mention that the phone does not get hot when charging , or even with fairly intensive use .
You have to really try to get it to feel even a bit warm .
Streaming music over WiFi to a Bluetooth headset , while using the composite video output will cause a little warmth , but you really need to do all those simultaneously to make it warm up .
Conclusion
There 's finally a Linux phone with the feature set that rivals anything from Nokia , Sony - Ericsson , or any of the major names .
It 's attractive , functional , and offers high quality and performance .
Not only that , but it 's Linux / Java operating system offers real advantage , even for people that do not know or care what an operating system is .
If you carry a Laptop , Netbook , MID or UMPC , the ZN5 is an excellent and extremely functional companion .
It 's true that in many ways the ZN5 looks downright primitive compared to an iPhone .
If you want an iPhone , buy an iPhone , if you want a quality phone , with a full set of features that work , along with an excellent digital camera , buy a Motorola Motozine ZN5 .

Nanoantenna Arrays Seen As Possible Solar Cell Replacement
August 11th , 2008 by Ariel Schwartz
Traditional solar cells only use up to 20 % of the visible light they collect , and more efficient solar cells are too expensive for mass production .
Now researchers at the US Department of Energy ’s Idaho Laboratory have figured out a way to capture solar energy on the cheap : plastic sheets filled with billions of nanoantennas .
The nanoantennas are made up of small gold squares or spirals set in polyethylene .
Researchers believe that under the right conditions , the simulated nanoantennas could harvest up to 92 % of energy at infrared wavelengths .
While traditional solar cells only use visible light , the nanoantennas use mid-infrared rays .
This means that they can still collect energy after dark .
Eventually , researchers hope that the plastic sheets of nanoantennas will power everything from hybrid cars to iPods .
Of course , there is still plenty of research that needs to be done before nanoantennas can go into production — in fact , scientists still do n’t know how to convert energy from the devices into electricity .
But the nanoantenna research is an interesting preview to a more affordable solar future .
For now , though , we ’ll have to make do with traditional devices .

Following a recent ruling by local regulators , French consumers can now purchase an iPhone 3G without signing a service contract with Apple - sanctioned wireless carrier Orange , assuming they 're willing to digest a considerable markup .
MacNN notes that French retailer FNAC is now selling a contract - free version of the black 8 GB iPhone for â ¬799 ( $ 1,123 ) , while black or white 16GB models are fetching â ¬899 ( $ 1,263 ) .
That 's more than five times the â¬149 in - contract cost for the 8GB model announced by Orange back in July , and considerably more than similar contract - free offerings in Belgium priced at â¬529 and â¬619 .
The iPhones on sale at FNAC are believed to be the result of a ruling earlier this month by the French competition counsel , which ordered Apple to immediately cease its exclusive relationship with France Telecom 's Orange and allow other local carriers to offer the iPhone to their subscribers .
The counsel 's ruling came following a September complaint from France 's third largest mobile operator , Bouygues Telecom , which alleged the deal between Apple and its larger rival violated local freedom of competition and pricing laws .
I had hopes , though not very realistic ones , that after the disaster that was , director Scott Derrickson would never work again .
But not only is the guy still getting high - profile jobs , he 's being trusted with another beloved sci- fi property .
Derrickson will directfor Warner Bros. , based on two novels by Dan Simmons about a space war in the distant future .
Variety says the screenplay will be written by Trevor Sands , credited with writing and directing the 2002 filmOur Josh Tyler has read thebooks and is heartbroken by this news .
Having not read the books , I can't feel personally and specifically outraged , but the idea of Derrickson having anything to do with aliens again is pretty disappointing .
But when , when did any of us get anywhere by expecting a lot of quality from big - budget Hollywood ?
Gastronomic demand may be depleting regional populations of many frogs to the point of no return ( Image : Andrew McConnell / Robert Harding Picture Library Ltd/ Alamy )
Are frogs being eaten to extinction ?
We ’re used to hearing about how disease , climate change , and habitat degradation are endangering amphibians , but conservationists are warning that frogs could be going the same way as the cod .
Gastronomic demand , they report , is depleting regional populations to the point of no return .
David Bickford of the National University of Singapore and colleagues have called for more regulation and monitoring in the global frog meat market in order to avoid species being “ eaten to extinction ” .
Statistics on imports and exports of frog legs are sparse as few countries keep track of the amount of meat harvested and consumed domestically .
Advertisement
According to UN figures , global trade has increased in the past 20 years .
France – not surprisingly – and the US are the two largest importers ; with France importing between 2500 and 4000 tonnes of frog meat each year since 1995 .
But although frog legs are often thought of in the West as a quintessentially French dish , they are also very popular in Asia .
Bickford estimates that between 180 million to over a billion frogs are harvested each year .
“ That is based on both sound data and an estimate of local consumption for just Indonesia and China , ” he says .
“ The actual number I suspect is quite a bit larger and my 180 million bare minimum is almost laughably conservative . ”
Local depletion
Even top
French chefs may be unaware of where their frogs are coming from .
Bruno Stril , teaching chef at the Cordon Bleu school in Paris , France , is unsure where his suppliers source their frog legs .
“ I would like for them to come from France , ” he says .
But he expects that most of the meat comes from other countries .
Stril is on the right track .
Indonesia is the world ’s largest exporter of frog meat , exporting more than 5000 tonnes of frog meat each year , mostly to France , Belgium and Luxemburg .
Bickford and colleagues say European kitchens initially found their own supplies in the surrounding countryside , but the fact that they are now importing from Asia suggests local populations were over - harvested .
This , they say , could be a sign that frog populations , like many fish populations , will be harvested to near extinction .
“ Overexploitation in the seas has caused a chain reaction of fisheries collapses around the world , ” the researchers write .
“ This experience should motivate better management of other exploited wild populations . ”
Anonymous legs
James Collins , of the World Conservation Union , says the Californian red-legged frog offers some evidence for the theory .
This species was first harvested for food in the 19th - century California gold rush and eventually the population began to crash .
However , Collins cautions that “ at the moment we have no data indicating that commercial exploitation has led to the extinction of any amphibian species . ”
He says the Bickford team ’s evidence is worrisome , but inconclusive .
Most harvested frogs are skinned , butchered and frozen before being shipped overseas .
This makes it difficult to know exactly what species are being killed .
Indonesia is thought to mostly export crab-eating frogs , giant Jana frogs , and American bullfrogs .
How much meat is consumed within Indonesia ’s borders is also something of a mystery .
Some studies suggest it could be between two and seven times what is exported .
“ There are a heck of a lot of frogs being eaten , ” says Bickford .
“ Much more than most people have a clue about . ”

Clap - Gonorrhea ( Neisseria Gonorrhoeae )
One of the most common venereal diseases Gonorrhea can be easily cured - or avoided .
Know the risks .
Our STDs are the perfect reminder to get tested and be safe .
Featured on NPR 's popular game show Wait Wait ..
Do n't Tell Me !

FACTS : The clap , or gonorrhea , is one of the most common sexually transmitted diseases .
( The word " clap " comes from " clapier , ” the old French word for brothel . )
According to the World Health Organization , gonorrhea causes “ infections principally of the urethra in men and endocervix in women , although it may also infect extragenital mucosal sites , including the oropharynx and anorectum . ”
In plain English , it causes : itchiness , burning , abominable pain , and eye - catching discharges from infected areas .
While symptoms generally occur within a week or so of infection , in a large number of cases – particularly in women – no symptoms are observed .
Not only does this help the disease spread , but untreated gonorrhea can cause pelvic inflammatory disease which can scar the uterus , increase the risk of ectopic pregnancy , and ultimately cause infertility .
In addition , babies born to infected mothers can suffer blindness and life - threatening blood infections .
Finally , gonorrhea infections can raise the risk of H.I.V. transmission by up to 500 percent .
Gonorrhea is generally contracted by young adults – and as it is spread almost entirely by sexual activity , promiscuity is the prime risk factor .
For those at risk , testing is essential : in most cases the clap can be treated with a single dose of antibiotics .

" When I was a kid I always wanted to kill Hitler , " Tom Cruise revealed recently .
" I hated that guy and all he stood for . "
Valkyrie , then , is not just the latest Tom Cruise action thriller .
It is the fruition of a dream ; a boyhood fantasy writ large ; a Hollywood blockbuster that provides an opportunity that was denied him in life .
Inevitably he bungles it .
Bryan Singer 's picture casts Cruise as Claus von Stauffenberg , the Wehrmacht colonel who spearheaded the 20 July 1944 plot to save the fatherland .
Wounded in battle and sporting a natty eye - patch , von Stauffenberg has grown sick of war .
He wants to " show the world that not all Germans are like Hitler " .
He hates that guy and all he stands for .
The obvious sticking point here is that ( spoiler ! ) von Stauffenberg did not actually kill Hitler .
The plot failed and the conspirators were executed .
Played as a tragedy , or a stark study of failed ambitions , this might not have been a problem .
Except that Singer opts to frame Valkyrie as a high - concept wartime suspense thriller , inviting us to suspend our disbelief and go along for the ride .
The 1944 plot was at least fiendishly planned and generally well executed .
Singer 's , by contrast , seems flawed and foolhardy from the start .
But what of Singer 's co-conspirator ?
Valkyrie paints von Stauffenberg as the archetypal " good German " , a model of elegant disenchantment .
And yet Cruise , for all his skills as a performer , does not do disenchantment .
For all the anguished moments of doubt , the constant stares into the mirror , his von Stauffenberg is essentially Top Gun with an eye - patch .
The film 's curious melange of dialects only underscores this quality .
Von Stauffenberg 's cohorts are played by British actors ( Bill Nighy , Terence Stamp , Kenneth Branagh ) who deliver their lines in English accents .
The villainous Nazi is portrayed by German actor Thomas Kretschmann who speaks English in a German accent .
And then - standing separate and apart - is Cruise himself , intoning his lines in pureblood American .
He might as well have been dropped in from an Allied plane ; a gung - ho Hollywood hero sent in to clean up a very European mess .
He could n't manage it as a kid , and he can't quite do it now .
Hitler one ; Tom Cruise nil .
SALT LAKE CITY -
An advocacy group is asking the Mormon church to support several bills that will be submitted to the Utah Legislature supporting rights for the lesbian , gay , bisexual and transgender community .
Equality Utah said Monday it will help draft five bills for the 2009 session , which starts in January .
Three of the bills seek equal treatment for domestic partners on hospitalization , medical care , housing , employment and probate rights .
A fourth bill would create a domestic partner registry and a fifth would repeal the second part of Utah 's marriage - defining constitutional amendment , which Equality Utah Public Policy Manager Will Carlson said has been " misinterpreted to avoid any recognition of gay couples . "
The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter - day Saints supported Proposition 8 in California to ban gay marriage there .
But Equality
Utah said that during the campaign to pass the constitutional amendment , the church said it did n't object to some rights for same - sex couples .
" Just last week , Elder L. Whitney Clayton stated the LDS Church does not oppose civil union or domestic partnerships , ' " said Equality Utah Chairwoman Stephanie Pappas .
" We are taking the LDS Church at its word . "
In a statement released following the approval of Proposition 8 in California , officials of the church said they do " not object to rights for same - sex couples regarding hospitalization and medical care , fair housing and employment rights , or probate rights . "
A church spokeswoman told The Associated Press on Tuesday that it would have no comment .
Previous attempts at passing similar bills have failed in the Legislature .
Sen . Scott McCoy , D - Salt Lake City , said the church 's statement changes everything .
" They had n't said any of that yet .
They 've said that now , " said McCoy , the only openly gay member of the Senate .
" This is an invitation to make a reality of what 's been said by the church .
... ( The church ) has said some things that are very encouraging to us , and we 're here to say , Hey , let 's see if we can't move forward and get to a place where we are in a more fair and just Utah , outside of the marriage discussion . ' "
Sen .
John Valentine , R - Orem , said that if the Mormon Church clarified its statements regarding same - sex rights , lawmakers might be less reluctant to agree to make changes .
" Equality Utah is probably correct in interpreting those statements from the church , " he said .
" It would probably make it an easier argument than it would be without that . "

Socialist Alliance ( Australia ) statement
Israel ’s killing must stop !
Stand up for the people of Gaza !
End ties with the racist Israeli state !
The Socialist Alliance condemns the Israeli massacre in the Gaza strip , which has left at least 280 people dead and 800 more injured .
We call on the Rudd government to also condemn this slaughter and to break Australian economic , diplomatic , military and cultural ties with the Israeli apartheid state .
While Israel claimed that it targeted “ terrorists ” , the 100 bombs were mostly aimed at police stations in the middle of densely populated civilian areas .
The attack , which was carefully planned at least several days in advance , also took place at the same time as children were going home from school , leaving many dead or injured .
The massacre comes on the back of two years of blockade imposed by Israel in an attempt to topple the democratically elected Hamas government .
Many Gazans have already died due to lack of basic medical treatment , food , clean water and electricity .
The killing looks set to continue with large numbers of Israeli armored vehicles massing on the border of Gaza .
Israel has called up 6500 reservists and has announced that it will call up more over the next few days .
If the massacres are to stop international public opinion needs to let Israel know that its actions are unacceptable .
In particular , Israel ’s traditional supporters , who have clearly sanctioned this bloody operation , must be forced to withdraw their support .
The Australian people need to stand up for the people of Gaza by making the Rudd government end its support for Israel 's ethnic cleansing of Palestine .
Socialist Alliance urges its members and supporters to join all emergency protests that are being organised around the country against this latest crime of the Israeli state .

The Socialist Alliance ’s policy on Palestine
Adopted at the Sixth National Conference , December 6 - 7 , 2008
The Socialist Alliance condemns the ethnic cleansing of Palestine by the state of Israel .
This oppression takes different forms — the occupation of the Palestinian Territories , the siege of Gaza , the breaking up of the West Bank into isolated ghettos , systematic violence and discrimination against Palestinian citizens of Israel or exile as refugees .
The Socialist Alliance supports :
The Palestinian right to self determination .
Israeli withdrawal from the Occupied Territories
Equal civil and democratic rights for all inhabitants of historic Palestine .
Right of return for Palestinian refugees .
An end to Israeli aggression against other countries in the region .
An end to the restriction of movement of people and supplies ( including medical supplies ) around Palestine and between Palestine and Israel .
The Socialist Alliance recognises the essential role that international ( including Australian ) imperialism plays in supporting the Israeli system of apartheid and occupation through massive political , economic and military aid .
Therefore , the Socialist Alliance supports the International campaign for Boycott , Divestment and Sanctions of Israeli Apartheid .

U.S. Government Sanctioned Gold Price Manipulation
The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency just released its Q3/08 Quarterly Derivatives Fact Sheet today .
Here is one of the highlights :
Take a look at J.P. Morgan 's gold derivatives [ futures ] position , paying particular attention to how the < 1 yr. position changed from the end of Q2/08 to the end of Q3/08 :

And here 's what J.P. Morgan 's 15 billion “ addition ” to their < 1 yr. gold derivatives book did to the price of gold as illustrated using GLD as a proxy for the POG :
That such a blatantly egregious act can be committed by the chief agent of the Federal Reserve , with what appears to be the complicity of regulators is a heinous pox on humanity .

31 Dec 08 , 01:34 Gold Manipulation
The Fed is using JP as a proxy to keep the gold price down to prevent hyperinflationary concerns .
I.e. the $ 15 billion surge in JP 's gold derivatives position implies JP shorted gold futures to drive the price lower , it is a continuation of central bank actions of selling physical gold to supress the gold price , as it is a credible alternative currency to fiat currencies .

The fed is the market ...
I 'm willing to bet if gold took off it would have been tough to push treasury yields down so the FED can sell long term bonds at insane rates ( and a strong dollar , which they can then use to stimulate the economy / pay off debt .
At this point they dollar will begin to fall , and people who bought the long bonds will sell them because they are going to realize that getting paid back 2 % of devalued paper .
Treasuries will sell off , gold / commodities will skyrocket .

Steve ’s Ant Project
I want to warn you about my neighbour Steve , who 's slightly disturbed .
He has this ant experiment .
This is how it works :
Steve built an artificial anthill in his back garden ( it took him six days , then he had a rest ) .
He filled it with all sorts of insects , and plants , and his special ants , which he bred from a single pair .
He 's also set up a beautiful glass ant paradise world in his living room , and a huge metal crate balanced on his barbecue outside , which he keeps always turned on .
When an ant is a couple of weeks old , he takes it off the anthill and decides whether to put it in his lovely ant home , or in the metal crate .
The crate 's agonising , but not hot enough to actually kill the ants , so essentially it tortures them for what feels like an eternity .
If Steve thinks ants have been bad , he puts them on the barbecue .
When he first built the anthill , he was talking to the ants and interacting with them all the time , helping his favourites and sticking huge families of bad ants in the crate .
But recently he 's been staying hidden , just watching and poking sticks in occasionally .
Now different groups of ants have got confused , and think someone else made their anthill .
So when they get old , Steve tortures them on the barbecue .
Some ants say the anthill might just be a natural formation - Steve puts them on the barbecue too .
He could just stick his face in and say " Hello " , and then all the ants would go to the nice place , but that does n't fit in with his secret plans .
Then there 's the other stuff ...
Once Steve got angry , and decided nearly all the ants were bad , so he put the only good ant family , with some of the other insects , on a leaf .
Then he stuck a hose in , turned the tap on , and went on holiday for a month .
Of course , the millions of insects and ants that were washed out did n't die , he threw them all on the barbecue .
Then Steve 's little son , Joe came to stay .
Joe disguised one of his fingers as an ant and stuck it in the ant nest .
He did tricks to impress the ants , to get their attention and tell them all to be more peaceful .
But Steve was n't happy .
He decided the ants were still bad , so he let some of the ants bite off his son 's finger .
It was unbelievable , Joe was crying , saying " Dad , dad , why have you left me like this ? "
Luckily the doctors sewed it back on , so three days later , Joe was able to stick his finger back in the nest to show the ants he was OK .
Then he went to live in the house , and has n't been back .
The ants have felt guilty ever since .
I feel really sorry for those ants .
For some reason they think Steve loves them , but he 's actually really malicious .
He sits out there , watching them constantly , and then sets up terrible , sickening disasters and illnesses for the poor little creatures .
When they beg him for help , he ignores them - he just sits watching .
Always watching .
No -one really knows what he 's doing or why he 's doing it .
I 'm not sure it will ever make sense .
The funny thing about all this is that I 've got an anthill in my back garden too .
But this one grew up on it's own ( which personally I think is far more miraculous than Steve 's artificial hill ) .
The ants know they all helped create their world by themselves , so they never fight each other over who made them , like Steve 's do .
They do n't need constant threats of torture to be kind to one another .
They know that sometimes there are thunderstorms , and sometimes there 's sun , and those things are pretty much out of their control .
But strangely , in spite of that , my ants seem to be far , far happier than Steve's .

The next time you 're having a bad day , imagine this :
You 're a Siamese twin .
Your brother , attached at your shoulder is gay and you 're not .
But you only have one ass .
Even more proof that the Republicans will lie about anything :
Four employees hired by a temporary staffing agency to encourage absentee voting for Sen .
John McCain in Wisconsin say they were instructed to tell people they were Republican volunteers .
The employees told The Associated Press in interviews on Monday they were hired by Allstaff Labor Group to go door - to - door in the Milwaukee suburbs locating McCain supporters and distributing absentee ballot request forms .
Allstaff recruited the workers under a contract with a consulting firm hired by the Republican Party of Wisconsin to run its absentee ballot program .
The workers claim they were told to say they were GOP volunteers even though they were getting paid $ 10 an hour for the work .
They were required to sign agreements stating they would not speak publicly about their work with anyone including reporters , but they decided to speak out because they were angry they had not been paid for their final few days .
The Kingdom of Bahrain has seen a recent surge in the number of " pleasure nuptials " – a tradition which allows men and women to marry for a brief period of time , for the sole purpose of having sex .
" We 're holding five or six wedding ceremonies a day now , " said a senior Bahrain clergyman .
" The couple signs a temporary marriage contract , for half an hour to 90 minutes , and the man pays his ' bride ' about seven or eight dollars for that time . "
" Pleasure nuptials " are the Muslim - Shiite version of institutionalized prostitution , carried out with the full knowledge and blessing of the authorities .
This loophole in Muslim laws has been implemented by the Iranian authorities for a long time , as the ayatollahs have been using it to " rewards " their esteemed warriors .
Shiite Bahrain has decided to take up the custom , and now thousands of it men have been practicing one - hour marriages .
The kingdom 's clergymen , however , are less than pleased with the new custom :
Some women get pregnant but the men refuse to take responsibility for the children , who are them born without rights , they say .
The ridiculous ease of the practice has brought about an unorthodox cooperation between the religious preachers in the country and its feminist and human rights groups , meant to warn women against this " promiscuous custom , " which they say could result in women losing their hard - earned civil rights .
This was kind of interesting
You have some good characters here and very smooth art here and the jokes are pretty funny too , some subtitles could be inserted for that extra feature but you have a decent little flick here , and I look forward to more .
~~THINGS TO IMPROVE ON ~ ~
You also may want to add some " SUBTITLES " in some areas of confusion with the sound of the voices , was not a big deal but subtitles would come in real hand in those lacking areas , so just another option to work on .
But to elaberate more on subies , I must say they do bring in a nice feature and fill the flash with some quality , so it for sure would not hurt it .
so anyways you have something decent here .

I started feeling a mild burning sensation in my left wrist a few weeks ago .
This is a classic early sign of Repetitive Strain Injury .
Uh-oh .
I had an email exchange not long ago with someone who now has to use voice activation because typing is too painful .
I ca n’t imagine how frustrating that must be .
I decided to ignore Jane Fonda ’s advice to “ feel the burn ” and looked for a way to alleviate the problem .
One approach is to reduce the amount of typing I do .
But that is tough when you are running a microISV and writing a blog .
I already use the text expander capabilities of the excellent Direct Access software to save a lot of typing ( it tells me that it has saved me 51 hours of typing so far ) .
I decided to try an ergonomic keyboard .
I bought myself a Microsoft 4000 Ergonomic keyboard .
This is shaped to allow more natural positioning of the forearms and elbows .
For more comfortable wrist positioning it also has a built - in wrist rest and the front of the keyboard is higher than the back .
I was quite surprised how physically large it was when it turned up .
The shape of the keyboard felt very strange to start with and it took me a few days of slow typing to get used it .
The feel of the keys is nothing special and I have n’t yet used the extra gizmos , such as the integral zoom button .
But I feel it is an improvement in comfort over the conventional keyboard I had before .
An unexpected advantage of the new keyboard is that it has improved my typing .
If you watch a good touch typist , their hands hardly move .
I ( unfortunately ) never learnt to touch type , I just did n’t have the patience .
The clearer separation between keys for the left hand and keys for the right hand on the new keyboard made me realise that I was moving both hands left and right , more like a concert pianist than a touch typist .
I am now moving my hands less and I think my typing speed has improved as a consequence .
I did n’t feel the new keyboard on it ’s own was going to solve my impending RSI problems though .
The major problem seems to be the continual Ctrl - C , Ctrl - V , Ctrl - A , Windows - D , Windows - E and Alt - Tab key combinations I do with my left hand , hundreds of times a day .
Using the right hand Ctrl key instead of the left one helped a bit .
But it occurred to me – why are my hands doing all the work ?
My legs are doing so little that I often feel stiff when I stand up from a long programming session .
Why not put them to use ?
I Googled for foot pedals for computers .
After wading through lots of hits for music and dictation foot pedals I finally found the Savant Elite Triple Foot Switch .
This is a programmable 3 - pedal foot - switch that plugs into a USB port .
At £ 86.00 +VAT it is n’t cheap .
But what price do you put on your health ?
I ordered one .
When it arrived I wanted to program the pedals to map to the Ctrl , Shift and Windows keys .
But I could n’t install the device driver to program the pedals .
After a call to the retailer it turns out the device driver does n’t work on Vista , despite assurance on the website that the pedals could be used with “ virtually any computer ” [ 1 ] .
Grrrrr .
How long has Vista been out ?
I finally managed to program the pedals using my wife ’s laptop – my last remaining XP box .
So now I can type using my feet for most of the modifier keys .
I am using the pedals as I type this .
I am still getting used to them , but the burning in my left wrist has definitely reduced .
I think I can also type a little faster , but I am too lazy to do the speed tests with and without the pedals to verify this .
On the negative side :
Working out where to put your feet when you are n’t typing can be a little awkward .
The pedals tend to move around the carpet , despite being metal and quite heavy .
Some small spikes might have helped .
Although the travel on the pedals is small , they are surprisingly stiff .
When I told a friend about the pedals he asked – why stop there ?
I could also be using my elbows , knees and head like a one - man - band .
I could be working - out and typing at the same time .
It is an intriguing prospect .
I just hope I do n’t end up with burning ankles .
[ 1 ] System requirements have since been added to the website .
Cockpit recordings reveal rattle shook jet before accident Cockpit recordings reveal jet in distress on takeoff attempt
The badly charred remains of the Continental jetliner lie on the runway Sunday at Denver International Airport .
The badly charred remains of the Continental jetliner lie on the runway Sunday at Denver International Airport .

A cockpit recording from the Houston - bound plane that veered off a Denver runway on Saturday revealed that the flight crew aborted the plane 's takeoff when a sudden bumping and rattling shook the plane about 41 seconds into its attempt to take off .
Ten seconds later , the recording stopped abruptly , probably when the plane hit the runway berm and became briefly airborne , then crashed down onto the bumpy ground , investigators said in a news conference Monday night .
The early investigation revealed no obvious problems with the plane 's brakes , tires or flaps , and the cockpit recordings showed that there were no concerns about wind shear or crosswinds , said Robert Sumwalt , a member of the National Transportation and Safety Board .
The runway was clear and dry , he said .
While five people remain hospitalized from the crash , including the plane 's captain , investigators will continue to search for clues to what sent the plane careening off the runway and into a snowy ravine .
The captain was too injured to grant a statement to government accident investigators , officials said , but the first officer spoke to investigators at length on Monday .
Thirty - eight of the 115 people aboard were injured when the Houston - bound plane slid into the ravine Saturday and caught fire .
The captain was one of five who remained hospitalized Monday .
Captain in hospital
Capt .
David Butler was in serious condition at a Denver hospital Monday .
He and his first officer , Chad Levang , are both based in Houston .
Levang and at least one other Continental crew member were among those treated for injuries and released .
Sumwalt said investigators could clearly hear the crew 's conversation before the crash in the cockpit flight recording , but he did not divulge details .
The voice and data recorders have been taken to Washington for further analysis .
Investigators spent most of Monday gathering and documenting physical evidence from the plane , which remains on its belly in the snow .
Sumwalt said it was vital to the investigation that all physical evidence — such as runway debris , skid marks , landing gear and cockpit settings — be recorded before the aircraft is removed .
" Our goal is to be very methodical , " Sumwalt said .
" To do it right , once the airplane is moved , we can't go back and say how was this switch set ? "
The Continental flight skidded off course in the first 2,500 feet of the airport 's 12,000 - foot runway at 6:18 p.m. Saturday , Sumwalt and Denver airport officials said .
Experts said that meant problems likely began before the jet ever attained the speed necessary to leave the ground .
The plane lost one engine and all of its landing gear as it careened into a ravine about 2,000 feet off the 34 Right runway — one of several extra-long runways constructed at the Denver International Airport to help compensate for the complexities of high altitude takeoffs .
Several factors studied
Sumwalt said the first officer estimated the plane was traveling at 98 to 103 mph when it began to veer off the center line of the runway .
The plane achieved a top speed of about 137 mph before it crashed , he said .
The accident was the worst there in more than a decade , city airport officials confirmed .
Sumwalt said investigators were continuing to look at windy weather conditions in Denver , possible mechanical failures and the possibility of pilot error , among other factors that could have caused the crash .
The night of the accident was clear , windy and cold , according to the National Weather Service , which monitors Denver airport conditions .
Northwest winds were recorded at 21 mph — gusting up to about 32 mph just a few minutes after the crash .
That is above normal wind speeds for Denver , but far from a record .
Federal Aviation Administration records revealed five reported problems with the Continental Airlines plane , which was manufactured by Boeing in 1994 .
An engine malfunction back in 1995 forced an emergency landing .
The plane was diverted to Denver and the engine ultimately was replaced , records show .
In 2005 , a one - inch crack through a rivet where the frame joins the plane 's cabin floor was discovered .
The cracked area was cut out and repaired , the FAA documents show .
Eight days later , another inspection found corrosion in the frame in an aft baggage bin .
That also was repaired .
In addition to examining problems with the plane , the NTSB will review injuries that occurred during its evacuation , investigators said .
Some passengers were injured as they used inflatable slides or climbed out along the wings into the snow , according to reports from witnesses .
The passengers included three children under 2 , who were riding without seat belts or tickets as lap children .
Final report may take a year
Former NTSB Chairman Jim Hall said Monday that the agency could take as long as a year to issue a final report .
" There also is a very strong possibility they might have a hearing on this accident , " said Hall .
" It sounds like there are a number of significant safety issues . "
Continental spokeswoman Julie King said Monday that a majority of the passengers that were aboard have gone home or to their " chosen location . "
" Our passenger and family assistance center is fully activated in Denver , and we continue to focus on assisting customers and crew members that were aboard the flight to accommodate their individual needs , " she said .
Continental is working to recover the personal items of those on the flight , she added , while fully cooperating with the NTSB on its investigation .

The famed HP Labs think tank in Palo Alto .
A few months ago , I spent an entire day with the HP Labs group in Palo Alto , they ’re responsible for the R&D and innovation that goes into their thousands of technology products on the market .
I was pleased to see this deep dive scientific research on Twitter by Bernardo A. Huberman , Daniel M. Romero and Fang Wu .
You can read the free Social networks that matter : Twitter under the microscope ( PDF ) .
Written in an academic style , it ’s a bit dense for the casual reader .
I write for a business audience and I ’ll strip out the most important findings , and add my own insight to what I think matters .
As always you ’re welcome to chime in the comments .
Understanding HP Lab ’s Twitter Research :
If you just need a summary , I wrote this in a way that you can just read the bolded elements to get a sense of the report .
I hope this saved you some time .
Most users have a smaller inner circle they communicate with : Within a social network , it was found that most only frequently communicate with a small segment of users –even if one has a large community .
Makes sense , everyone has an ‘ inner circle ’ .
Finding the true network that an individual has ( even if they have thousands of “ friends ” ) is what ’s really important .
Although Scoble solicits imput from thousands of contacts , he leans on a smaller subset of folks to trust above all others .
HP Labs Sample Size is @ 6 % of the Twittersphere : HP Labs took a random sample set of Twitter users , for a base of number of 309,740 users .
According to my social network stats tracking page , Twitter ’s total universe is somewhere between 4 - 5 million ( still very small ) .
I ’ll value the network on the 5 mil side , so that ’s sample size of about 6 % , which is pretty healthy .
On average , most had 85 followers :
They found that the average user has 85 followers in their network , this number seems reasonable when averaged out across the network .
On average , most had 80 friends :
Most users followed back 80 others , which is close to the actual follower number .
Perhaps some were n’t following spam bots , or people that follow everyone .
James Governor has been discussing asymmetrical networks , but it appears that on the average , most are symmetrical .
Tweet Frequency ?
About one a day :
On average , these users had posted 255 tweets , and since the average users has been around for nearly 7 months , thats about 36 tweets per month , or little bit over one a day .
68 % : are active users Social networking stats are almost always flawed , as the vendors do n’t disclose how many are truly active .
I define active user base as logged in and completed an activity in the last 30 days .
Among the 309,740 users only 211,024 posted .
It ’s unknown if this filtered out spam tweets , although nearly 2 /3rds of users have returned ( site stickyness .
That ’s a pretty good return to site rate .
Most members have been on twitter nearly 7 months :
The research showed that the average person ( from first to last post ) was active for 206 days .
This means that June 2008 ( report written in Dec ) has become somewhat of a trigger point , perhaps where a growth curve started to point upwards .
I noticed an influx of users on April 2008 , two months before HPs findings , see comment # 579 A quarter of tweets ( @ ) are directed at other users :
The report showed that Around 25.4 % of all posts are directed , by using the “ @user ” which is responding to others .
This could suggest that the other 75 % of tweets are updating their network of what users think is interesting or discussing ‘ what they are doing ’
The more followers , the more they tweet –up until a point : Figure 1 indicates frequently in posting the more followers they have , right up until about 500 followers where the frequency starts to level out ( if the graph were smoothed ) .
The data around number of friends suggests a similar graph , although there ’s no saturation point ( see figure 2 ) .
I ’ll suggest the more connections a user has , the more value they have , and therefore are more active .
Despite having large networks , a smaller circle is maintained :
For users with a high number of followers , they actually only still communicate with a smaller subset of users .
This rule remains constant see figure 4 .
Where ’s the value ?

-------
PHOENIX - Attorney General Terry Goddard said Tuesday he might be willing to consider legalizing marijuana if a way can be found to control its distribution - and figure out who has been smoking it .
Goddard said marijuana sales make up 75 percent of the money that Mexican cartels use for the other operations , including smuggling other drugs and fighting the army and police in that country .
He said that makes fighting drug distribution here important to cut off that cash .
He acknowledged those profits could be slashed if possession of marijuana were not a crime in Arizona .
But Goddard said a number of other hurdles remain before that even becomes a possibility .
Goddard 's comments came after a press conference Tuesday announcing the breakup of a major ring that police said has been responsible for bringing about 400,000 pounds of marijuana across the border and into Arizona each year since 2003 .
The operation has so far led to the indictment of 59 people and the arrest so far of 39 of them , some in this country legally and others who were not .
Phoenix Police Lt. Vince Piano said the operation was very sophisticated , complete with specially designed heavy - duty trucks to actually let vehicles drive over the border fence .
They also had solar - powered radio towers and a network of lookouts who told the trucks , each carrying up to 2,500 pounds of marijuana , when to move and when to hide under camouflage .
He said there even was a system of " food drops " to supply the drivers .
Piano said this operation was one of several under contract to Mexican drug lords to transport the marijuana from the border through the Tohono O'odham Reservation all the way to Phoenix .
Piano said busting this organization does n't stop the flow of drugs , saying this is one of several " transportation groups " working with the cartel .
But he said it disrupts at least part of the flow .
The issue of Arizona drug laws came up during questions about the operation of drug cartels and the violence associated with their operations , particularly in the Mexican state of Sinaloa .
" The key is , they will no longer exist when people do n't buy marijuana , " said Matthew Allen , special agent in charge of the office of investigations for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement .
" This is a market - driven economy and this is a market - driven activity . "
Allen said the question of legalization to eliminate those profits is a policy question .
" But if we 're going to go down that road , what is the acceptable amount of marijuana that you want a bus driver to have in their system , " he continued .
" I believe it 's zero , " Goddard said later .
Goddard said there is a lot of time and money spent on enforcement activities like the one that resulted in the bust announced Tuesday .
He said that requires " a hard look " at the issue .
But Goddard said it 's not as simple as simply declaring it legal .
He said there would need to be some controls on who gets the drugs - and how much they use .
" Right now I 've not found , and do not know of , a way to make a prescription control over marijuana as a consumer product .
As long as we can't do that , as long as we can't put it behind the counter and in a safe distribution , I do n't believe there 's any way to make it legal . "
Goddard said no one has found a way to put the kind of controls on marijuana he would want before he would consider legalizing it .
" If they could do that , we could certainly cut the legs out of some of these criminal activities .
But until they do , we 're going to have to continue to go after the folks that are moving marijuana and are thereby funding violent crimes throughout the hemisphere . "
Allen backed up Goddard 's statements that the smuggling operation is not simply about marijuana .
He said Mexican cartels also are in the business of smuggling cocaine and other drugs on behalf of other cartels in places like Colombia .
He said they make up the money they lose when those drugs are seized through the profits they make selling marijuana in the United States .

CHINESE CHARACTERS look dramatic and beautiful , and have a powerful visual impact , but make sure you get the meaning of the characters straight before jumping right in .
There were red faces on the editorial board of one of Germany ’s top scientific institutions , the Max Planck Institute , after it ran the text of a handbill for a strip club on the front page of its latest journal .
The journal hoped to find an elegant Chinese poem to grace the cover of a special China issue of the Max Planck Forschung journal , but instead it ran a text basically saying “ Hot Housewives in action ! ” on the front of the third - quarter edition .
The strip club ’s “ enchanting and coquettish performance ” was set to begin in coming days .
The use of traditional Chinese characters and references to “ the northern mainland ” seem to indicate the text comes from Hong Kong or Macau , and it promises burlesques by pretty - as - jade housewives with hot bodies for the daytime patron .
Publication of the journal caused some anger among touchier webizens once the real Chinese meaning became clear , but generally sparked much amusement among online readers , and the Max Planck Institute was quick to acknowledge its error .
“ To our sincere regret . . . it has now emerged that the text contains deeper levels of meaning , which are not immediately accessible to a non-native speaker , ” the institute said in an apology .
The journal has since been updated online and now contains the title of a book by the Swiss Jesuit , Johannes Schreck ( 1576–1630 ) .
The Jesuit text in question was “ Illustrated Explanations of Strange Devices ” .
AN UPDATED family tree of the animal kingdom could radically change the way we think about the evolution of species .
According to conventional thinking , simple animals , including sponges , jellyfish and corals , evolved step - by - step in a linear fashion into those with more complex bodies , such as mammals .
Now Rob DeSalle of the American Museum of Natural History in New York and his colleagues have challenged this way of thinking .
The team analysed DNA and other molecular evidence across the animal kingdom , including tiny sea creatures called placozoans .
They have found that the placozoans are the closest living thing to the …
A US admiral has called for American warships operating in the Middle East to be equipped with microwave " pain ray " cannons to avoid using overwhelming lethal force .
The Navy Times reports that Vice Admiral Bill Gortney , in command of the US 5th Fleet , has put out an “ urgent need statement ” seeking extra nonlethal weapons for his cruisers and destroyers to use against small boats at short ranges .
The 5th Fleet is the US naval command covering the Red Sea , Arabian Sea , Persian / Arabian Gulf and the east African coast as far south as Kenya .
Starboard raygun battery - engage !
A problem for western warships in these waters is attacks or harassment by small , fast - moving speedboats .
These manoeuvres may be carried out by such groups as the Iranian Revolutionary Guards - as seen recently in an incident near the Straits of Hormuz which almost escalated fatally after radio trolls joined in .
Likewise , the Royal Navy was severely embarrassed by Pasdaran speedboats off the Shatt al' Arab waterway last year .
Alternatively , the speedboats might be loaded with a massive explosive charge and crewed by a suicide party , as the crew of the USS Cole learned to their cost in Aden harbour eight years ago .
In theory a well - armed destroyer or cruiser need never worry about such threats .
It can detect small boats miles away on radar , and either send its helicopter to eliminate them or launch a ship - killing missile itself .
Should an attacker slip through , automatic gun batteries can easily be switched from their task of blasting missiles from the sky to rip attacking speedboats to shreds .
The trouble with this is that you 'll wind up starting a lot of wars and killing a lot of people , probably unnecessarily in most cases .
But if you do n't shoot reasonably soon , you may leave yourself open to some kind of Shatt al ' Arab or even USS Cole nightmare .
Hence the wish for some option a bit less final than hail of armour - piercing 30 mm or a Harpoon , but with a bit more authority than a loudhailer or radio message .
According to the Navy Times , US warships already pick up Long Range Acoustic Device ( LRAD ) noise - blasters on joining the 5th Fleet .
A cruise liner used an LRAD to stand off Somali pirates in 2005 .
However it seems that quite simple measures like hearing protection can reduce the LRAD 's effect , and Admiral Gortney would like something else .
Specifically , he'd like some variant on the ( in ) famous Raytheon Active Denial System microwave gun , which inflicts intense pain on its targets by heating up the outer layer of their skin .
Raytheon say they 've already tested the ADS against men in boats , off Florida in 2006 , and it worked well .
However , just because Admiral Gortney would like some microwave rayguns does n't mean he 'll get them .
Ground troop commanders in Iraq have been nagging the Pentagon for such weapons for years without any result , primarily because of the negative media perception of them .
The fact is , in general media coverage appears to be less damaging when western forces shoot or blow up local people , killing or crippling them in significant numbers , than when they propose deploying non- or less - lethal weapons .

Running a BitTorrent site can be quite costly .
Most of the larger sites need over a dozen servers to keep everything running smoothly .
There are some scalable alternatives for BitTorrent startups though .
Two relatively unknown meta - search engines have taken a different route by using Google 's App Engine , which provides optimal scalability , for free .
V0rtex and TorrentTab are two sites using Google ’s resources to search for torrents .
By using Google ’s App Engine , they can run their sites without having to invest a single dime in hardware or bandwidth .
On a free account , users of Google ’s App Engine can host 500 MB data , and serve up to 5 million page views a month .
This is more than enough for a medium sized BitTorrent site .
At the moment it is not possible to upgrade these limits , since paid accounts are not yet available , but this might change in the future .
Both sites are totally ad free , and great resources to search for torrents .
V0rtex currently searches 12 BitTorrent sites , including established sites such as Mininova , The Pirate Bay and isoHunt .
The site itself has a clean look and feel , and the search results are sortable by date , peers , seeds and more .
TorrentFreak spoke with Reda , the developer of the site , who told us that he started the project to learn how to code .
“ It was really fun and exciting to learn Python and Javascript / Ajax , ” he said .
His goal is not to compete with the big players though .
Reda has n’t even bothered to register a domain name for it since it was mainly a learning experience .
This is different for the other BitTorrent meta search engine hosted on Google ’s App Engine , which does have its own domain .
TorrentTab , which is a project of David Sánchez , is also using Google ’s architecture to search for torrents .
The site currently searches 10 sites , and presents the search results in tabs using Google Ajax Feed API .
David told TorrentFreak that he initially started the site on his own Internet connection .
When the site started to attract more visitors , he had to find an alternative .
Google ’s App Engine seemed to be a great solution , so he recoded the site in Python and moved it over to Google ’s infrastructure .
Unlike some of the other meta - search engines that use tabbed search results , TorrentTab is not merely loading the results from the other sites in a frame .
Unfortunately there are no sorting options for the search results , which makes it hard to find the best seeded files , or the latest uploads .
Although V0rtex and TorrentTab are are not revolutionary in terms of features or functionality , it is great to see that Google is providing a free playground for BitTorrent startups .
It ’s always good to see some variety .
I had a call with Monty the other day and I told him why I think MySQL Server Quality will never be the same again .
I ’ve been thinking a bit more about it and here is the extended list .
In particular I think MySQL Server will never be able to reach its original quality guidelines ( see previous post ) and even current release criterias will unlikely be ever reached with any sensible definition of what serious bugs are .
Large Team , Tricky Code During MySQL 3.23 and MySQL 4.0 team the small tight knit team was working on the server and Monty was personally reviewing all the code and knew all the code well to know all the side effects etc .
Now MySQL
Development is done by different team working on the different components , while MySQL was not designed to be very modular with clear set interfaces and no side effects on the first place to support such development concept easily .
Increasing Complexity
Each new MySQL version is getting more and more complicated .
MySQL architecture has to be additionally complicated to support modular storage engines with all their interactions and different specifics .
Think for example how many DBMS need to do Distributed Transactions ( XA ) internally just to keep different components in sync .
This is multiplied by the fact a lot of MySQL features were implemented in marketing rush being hacks over architecture which was not intended to support it .
Remember early MySQL versions knew only about table locks and were not initially designed to support transactions .
Most of other databases are designed with these concepts at their core .
Increased User Base I ’m not sure if MySQL user base is growing any more but it surely has grown dramatically since MySQL 3.23 or 4.0 times .
More users means they naturally find more bugs .
This is actually has the good time too .
Even though a lot of bugs being found and reported only small fraction of them apply to any given user .
The bad thing – in many cases we do not really know which one apply to us 🙂
Low Feature Usage Density MySQL 3.23 was simple so Most of its features were used by majority of users .
This was even the early Marketing strategy for MySQL .
Marten used to frequently say Oracle is Overkill for most users and most users use only 10 % of features or less .
You know what ?
MySQL is becoming overkill for increasingly large amount of users too .
A lot of people in the Web world would be as happy with MySQL 4.1 if it would be actively maintained now .
And hey this is exactly one if the reasons behind Drizzle project .
Lower usage density means features are less tested by community during release and they also mean they get less attention from developers , because development team ( and especially its efficiency ) is not growing on the same pace .
This also means fewer customers use the same features , and so the revenue associated with feature is not high enough to keep all the bugs reported for this feature .
So bugs sometimes stay open for years .
As an example of low usage density features I would mention MySQL 5.1 features .
During my talks I often asked people how many of them use 5.1 vs row level replication or events .
I think less than 5 % are using both features .
MySQL 4.1 was out for years and yet I would say no more than 5 % of users use prepared statements .
Bug Reporting and Tracking
The MySQL 3.23 received quality was at some extent because there were no bugs.
mysql.com – bugs were reported to bugs@lists.mysql.com which meant both it was more complicated for users to report a bug – so fewer people did and it was easily to lose the bugs , especially boring and less critical ones .
Monty did a very good job keeping track of these but still not as good as when bug tracking system was implemented and so bug would never disappear unless you fix it or call it a feature 🙂
MySQL Enterprise Madness
For years MySQL QA policy heavily relied on community and I think it is still the case .
This means MySQL latest code was instantly downloaded and tested by thousands of users which would find bugs quickly .
With MySQL
Enterprise it is customers who got the bleeding edge code and for community the binary which is over half a year old was often offered .
Enterprise customers who got the latest and the most bug free / buggy code ( less old bugs more new ones ) are fractions of percent of MySQL User base and they are also more conservative – few just would grab latest release as soon as it comes out .
Many will only upgrade on the schedule or keep on the same release until they run into some issues .
This means bugs in Enterprise version have tendency to stay for long time .
The good thing about this item is – it is easily fixable .
Just get somebody in his mind to define release policy , and better have him / her understanding engineering not just marketing .
Innodb / Oracle relationship complexities .
If the bug happen to affect Innodb things become even more complicated slow .
Even though MySQL and Innodb is tight knit system these are two different code bases controlled by different companies .
MySQL ca n’t just do changes to Innodb codebase and Innodb ca n’t do same for MySQL .
Both require other side approval .
This is why I guess all new Innodb Development is going with Innodb Plugin which is separate from Innodb included default MySQL .
Why is not this part of stock MySQL 5.1 ?
I guess because MySQL 5.1 release was closed for any significant changes for years .
Now how it all affects bugs an not features ?
Well if you want to use latest Innodb you will need to use plugin which is not part of standard MySQL distribution so it , just as MySQL Enterprise , gets significantly less testing by community than standard MySQL .
Another problem for Innodb Plugin quality is lack of the full disclosure about bugs .
Check this change log for example .
You would see some bugs fixed have bug numbers and large number does not .
This means there are some bugs which are discovered by Innodb / Oracle team but they are not disclosed via searchable public bugs database .
I should note besides all these process issues Innodb remains remarkably high quality component .
The initial version of Innodb Plugin was very good in terms of quality for version having first public release as we tested it back in April .
The Good News in the End
The good news are you really do not need general “ quality ” or “ being free from bugs ” to run MySQL in production .
MySQL as it is now works for a lot of applications , in particular because most of them use only small portion of MySQL features .

The below is taken from a Wall Street Journal article on the upcoming Durban II conference .
The draft declaration … goes after the West ’s freedom of speech and antiterror laws under the guise of protecting religion ( read : Islam ) from “ defamation . ”
The entire West will be in the dock for allegedly persecuting Muslims .
“ The most serious manifestations of defamation of religions are the increase in Islamophobia and the worsening of the situation of Muslim minorities around the world , ” the draft reads .
“ Islamophobia ” is a term used to brand any criticism of Islam as a hate crime .
The Islamic terrorists who have killed hundreds of thousands of their co-religionists get a free pass .
Instead , the draft calls for a media code of conduct and “ internationally binding normative standards . . . that can provide adequate guarantees against defamation of religions . ”
If this sounds like censorship , that ’s because it is .
… If the Durban II drafters have their way , any challenge of Islamic teachings , including teachings used to justify violence , would be taboo .
Reprinting the Danish Muhammad cartoons , exploited by Muslim agitators in 2006 to incite riots around the world , would be a criminal offense .
Even gross human - rights violations in Islamic countries — such as stoning adulterers in Iran — could be immune from criticism .
It seems pretty clear that this is just another attempt at special pleading by the religious , in this case Islam .
The Canadian government has already said it will not participate in this farce and it seems likely that the US will follow suit .
It ’s probably too much to hope that the EU will take a similar stand .
Free speech is a core western value and we cannot accept any erosion .
My advice to Muslims ( or anyone else ) is simple , if you ca n’t deal with open debate , if your faith is so weak that it cannot stand up to any criticism , then you need to seriously examine the validity of that faith .
The future has no place for ancient magical superstitions .
Edit : I take the point made by commenters below .
What I should have said is I hope the future has no place for ancient magical superstitions , but people will have to embrace reality on their own and in their own time .
It certainly is n’t something I could or would force on them .

Washington Out Of Control
I told myself I was n’t going to post anymore on the financial crisis and then I saw this article in the FT about how on Friday ( 12/19 ) the Federal Reserve announced a new program of lending capital to any US company investing in securitized consumer loans .
It ’s a $ 200 billion program .
This just burns me up .
Translation : the US government just bailed out the hedge fund industry to the tune of $ 200 billion !
Were there any strings attached to the money like reducing the 1 - and - 20 hedge fund GP compensation agreements ?
Nope !
Any other concessions ?
Nope !
So all these hedge funds are going to get bailed out right before year - end which will allow them to book profits ( or less losses ) and the managers get paid more .
Thank you Uncle Sam !
Makes that $ 15 billion auto bailout seem cheap ( and with favorable concessions ) in comparison .
I think it ’s time the government stopped picking winners and losers because it ’s clear it ’s being done based on lobbying dollars spent and not for any rational reasons .
Either let companies fail or publish a set of rules for which companies get government support and why .

In the past hour , we 've received five emails alerting us to the alarming news :
The sticky sweet scent of maple syrup has made its 2009 debut !
So far , the smell appears to concentrated on the Upper West Side , but please let us know if you 've suddenly gotten hungry for pancakes because the scent of breakfast has been so overpowering .
Email us at tips ( at ) gothamist ( dot ) com .
Previous maple syrup incidents : October 2005 , March 2006 , November 2006 , November 2007 , and May 2008 .
Plus a November 2007 cameo on 30 Rock .
Update :
We added two more smellings ( one at West 80th & Amsterdam , the other on East 82nd between Park and Lexington ) .
In the past , a reader said it smelled like anti-freeze " which , if you ever spilled while adding to your radiator , has a nasty maple syrup smell . "
Update ( 11:15 p.m. ) :
More smellings added to the map ( including ones in Queens ) ; one reader was at her friend 's apartment when the smell struck , " We thought at first it was her neighbors doing something kinky , or that it was a new form of bioterrorism ! "
Another reader wondered , " Is this the first time it 's not on a Thursday night ?
And why does it always hit at about this time of night ? "
We 're not sure why it seems to strike at night , but as for the days of the week , the incidents on 10/28/05 , 11/9/06 , 11/8/07 and 5/29/08 were Thursdays , but the 3/13/06 incident was a Monday .
Update ( 11:34 p.m. ) : More smellings , map revised to include some readers ' comments , including this gem : " In Tudor City , 43rd and 1st .
I thought it was my own sweet bo at first ! "
Update ( midnight ) :
Thanks for all the tips — keep them coming .
We 've added some in Soho , Midtown , and Brooklyn .
In fact , one reader writes , " Yesterday I mentioned to my wife that I smelled the Maple Syrup Smell .
We were at the Red Hook Ikea . "
We 're not sure if that 's the maple syrup canary in the pancake coal mine , but it does not correspond with the wind pattern hypothesis , which makes most sense to us .

GM Ceasing Corporate Aviation Operations DETROIT — GM today announced that it is ceasing operations at General Motors Air Transportation Services ( GMATS ) at Detroit Metro Airport .
Due to significant cutbacks over the past months , GM travel volume no longer justifies a dedicated corporate aircraft operation .
GM is currently exploring options for transferring its aircraft to another operator .
The company is pursuing sale of four of the aircraft so it can terminate the leases .
GM will shutter the facility at Metro Airport effective January 1 , 2009 .
GM will work with the airport to seek a tenant for the balance of the lease , which expires in 2009 .

Playboy Mansion and Hugh Hefner Exposed
Up until this point , Playboy iconhas been able to pull one over on the world with his Casanova lifestyle .
Well not anymore .
Finally somebody has decided it was time for the world to know that Hef ' 's life is n't one big orgy .
Girls Next Door starhas spilled the beans on the not so glamorous or should we say " fulfilling " life at the mansion .
In a recent interview with US Weekly , Kendra did n't hold anything back and we gotta wonder - did n't she sign a gag contract ?
We find it interesting that it took this long for one of his girls to come clean .
How much time did she and the old guy spend together ?
Not much .
Kendra said it was n't unusual to only see Hef once a day and that was if she passed him in the hallway .
As for alone time , a little one on one ... none of that either .
They never once had a solo date together either .
Kendra did admit that she was intimate with Hefner but she made it clear that it was n't often but added that it was n't enough .
For all we know it could have been once .
Kendra revealed that she did stray out of the mansion to fulfill her needs .
" I had to have sex every now and then , so I had to kind of sneak it . "
Only wanting to spill on her own experience , Wilkinson did say that Bridget Marquardt was always faithful to Hef.
Kendra said her reason for " sneaking it " was that she wanted to feel her age .
Life at the mansion was very strict .
The mansion staff kept notebooks on the girls whereabouts , no holidays could be spent off the mansion grounds and each girls received $ 1000 a week allowance .
So it was clearly a paid job .
For $ 4000 a month would you go without sex ?
Kendra is engaged to Philadelphia Eagles wide receiver Hank Baskett , Holly Madison is dating illusionist Criss Angel and Bridget ... has n't revealed her current status .
Having had a dramatic change of heart , Kendra is completely against Hef and his way of life now that she has left the grounds .
The bride to be says you wo n't see her posing nude in her new life but you will get one last chance to see her in next months edition of Playboy .
The issue is being touted as the farewell to the original Girls Next Door .
Check out Hef 's latest twin girlfriends Karissa Shannon & Kristina Shannon - photos here .
They were recently joined at the mansion by another new face , Crystal Harris .

WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
One day after President Obama ripped Wall Street executives for their " shameful " decision to hand out $ 18 billion in bonuses in 2008 , Congress may finally have had enough .
" You ca n't use taxpayer money to pay out $ 18 billion in bonuses , " an angry Sen. Claire McCaskill says .
An angry U.S. senator introduced legislation Friday to cap compensation for employees of any company that accepts federal bailout money .
Under the terms of a bill introduced by Sen. Claire McCaskill , D - Missouri , no employee would be allowed to make more than the president of the United States .
Obama 's current annual salary is $ 400,000 .
" We have a bunch of idiots on Wall Street that are kicking sand in the face of the American taxpayer , " an enraged McCaskill said on the floor of the Senate .
" They do n't get it .
These people are idiots .
You ca n't use taxpayer money to pay out $ 18 billion in bonuses . "
Watch McCaskill 's heated words »
McCaskill 's proposed compensation limit would cover salaries , bonuses and stock options .
On Thursday , Obama said the prospect that some of the $ 700 billion Wall Street bailout could end up paying for bonuses to managers of struggling financial institutions was " shameful . "
The president said it was the " height of irresponsibility " for executives to pay bonuses when their companies were asking for help from Washington .
" The American people understand we 've got a big hole that we 've got to dig ourselves out of , but they do n't like the idea that people are digging a bigger hole even as they 're being asked to fill it up , " Obama added .
McCaskill 's proposal comes three days after struggling banking giant Citigroup -- which has taken about $ 45 billion from the government 's Troubled Asset Relief Program -- reversed plans to accept delivery of a $ 42 million corporate jet .
The company changed its mind under Treasury Department prodding .
Former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani defended corporate bonuses Friday , saying that cutting them also means slashing jobs in the Big Apple .
" If you somehow take that bonus out of the economy , it really will create unemployment , " he said on CNN's " American Morning . "
" It means less spending in restaurants , less spending in department stores , so everything has an impact . "

Can you think of a major threat for which the British government does not prepare ?
It employs an army of civil servants , spooks and consultants to assess the chances of terrorist attacks , financial collapse , floods , epidemics , even asteroid strikes , and to work out what it should do if they happen .
But there is one hazard about which it appears intensely relaxed : it has never conducted its own assessment of the state of global oil supplies and the possibility that one day they might peak and then go into decline .
If you ask , the government always produces the same response : " Global oil resources are adequate for the foreseeable future . "
It knows this , it says , because of the assessments made by the International Energy Agency ( IEA ) in its World Energy Outlook reports .
In the 2007 report , the IEA does appear to support the government 's view .
" World oil resources , " it states , " are judged to be sufficient to meet the projected growth in demand to 2030 , " though it says nothing about what happens at that point , or whether they will continue to be sufficient after 2030 .
But this , as far as Whitehall is concerned , is the end of the matter .
Like most of the rich world 's governments , the UK treats the IEA 's projections as gospel .
Earlier this year , I submitted a freedom of information request to the UK 's department for business , asking what contingency plans the government has made for global supplies of oil peaking by 2020 .
The answer was as follows : " The government does not feel the need to hold contingency plans specifically for the eventuality of crude - oil supplies peaking between now and 2020 . "
So the IEA had better be right .
In the report on peak oil commissioned by the US department of energy , the oil analyst Robert L Hirsch concluded that " without timely mitigation , the economic , social and political costs " of world oil supplies peaking " will be unprecedented " .
He went on to explain what " timely mitigation " meant .
Even a worldwide emergency response " 10 years before world oil peaking " , he wrote , would leave " a liquid - fuels shortfall roughly a decade after the time that oil would have peaked " .
To avoid global economic collapse , we need to begin " a mitigation crash programme 20 years before peaking " .
If Hirsch is right , and if oil supplies peak before 2028 , we 're in deep doodah .
So burn this into your mind : between 2007 and 2008 the IEA radically changed its assessment .
Until this year 's report , the agency mocked people who said that oil supplies might peak .
In the foreword to a book it published in 2005 , its executive director , Claude Mandil , dismissed those who warned of this event as " doomsayers " .
" The IEA has long maintained that none of this is a cause for concern , " he wrote .
" Hydrocarbon resources around the world are abundant and will easily fuel the world through its transition to a sustainable energy future . "
In its 2007 World Energy Outlook , the IEA predicted a rate of decline in output from the world 's existing oilfields of 3.7 % a year .
This , it said , presented a short - term challenge , with the possibility of a temporary supply crunch in 2015 , but with sufficient investment any shortfall could be covered .
But the new report , published last month , carried a very different message : a projected rate of decline of 6.7 % , which means a much greater gap to fill .
More importantly , in the 2008 report the IEA suggests for the first time that world petroleum supplies might hit the buffers .
" Although global oil production in total is not expected to peak before 2030 , production of conventional oil ... is projected to level off towards the end of the projection period . "
These bland words reveal a major shift .
Never before has one of the IEA 's energy outlooks forecast the peaking or plateauing of the world 's conventional oil production ( which is what we mean when we talk about peak oil ) .
But that is as specific as the report gets .
Does it or does n't it mean that we have time to prepare ?
What does " towards the end of the projection period " mean ?
The agency has never produced a more precise forecast - until now .
For the first time , in the interview I conducted with its chief economist Fatih Birol recently , it has given us a date .
And it should scare the pants off anyone who understands the implications .
Birol , the lead author of the new energy outlook , is a small , shrewd , unflustered man with thick grey hair and Alistair Darling eyebrows .
He explained to me that the agency 's new projections were based on a major study it had undertaken into decline rates in the world 's 800 largest oilfields .
So what were its previous figures based on ?
" It was mainly an assumption , a global assumption about the world 's oil fields .
This year , we looked at it country by country , field by field and we looked at it also onshore and offshore .
It was very , very detailed .
Last year it was an assumption , and this year it 's a finding of our study . "
I told him that it seemed extraordinary to me that the IEA had n't done this work before , but had based its assessment on educated guesswork .
" In fact nobody had done this research , " he told me .
" This is the first publicly available data . "
So was it not irresponsible to publish a decline rate of 3.7 % in 2007 , when there was no proper research supporting it ?
" No , our previous decline assumptions have always mentioned that these are assumptions to the best of our knowledge - and we also said that the declines [ could be ] higher than what we have assumed . "
Then I asked him a question for which I did n't expect a straight answer : could he give me a precise date by which he expects conventional oil supplies to stop growing ?
" In terms of non-Opec [ countries outside the big oil producers ' cartel ] , " he replied , " we are expecting that in three , four years ' time the production of conventional oil will come to a plateau , and start to decline .
In terms of the global picture , assuming that Opec will invest in a timely manner , global conventional oil can still continue , but we still expect that it will come around 2020 to a plateau as well , which is , of course , not good news from a global - oil - supply point of view . "
Around 2020 .
That casts the issue in quite a different light .
Birol 's date , if correct , gives us about 11 years to prepare .
If the Hirsch report is right , we have already missed the boat .
Birol says we need a " global energy revolution " to avoid an oil crunch , including ( disastrously for the environment ) a massive global drive to exploit unconventional oils , such as the Canadian tar sands .
But nothing on this scale has yet happened , and Hirsch suggests that even if it began today , the necessary investments and infrastructure changes could not be made in time .
Birol told me : " I think time is not on our side here . "
When I pressed him on the shift in the agency 's position , he argued that the IEA has been saying something like this all along .
" We said in the past that one day we will run out of oil .
We never said that we will have hundreds of years of oil ... but what we have said is that this year , compared with past years , we have seen that the decline rates are significantly higher than what we have seen before .
But our line that we are on an unsustainable energy path has not changed . "
This , of course , is face - saving nonsense .
There is a vast difference between a decline rate of 3.7 % and 6.7 % .
There is an even bigger difference between suggesting that the world is following an unsustainable energy path - a statement almost everyone can subscribe to - and revealing that conventional oil supplies are likely to plateau around 2020 .
If this is what the IEA meant in the past , it was n't expressing itself very clearly .
So what do we do ?
We could take to the hills , or we could hope and pray that Hirsch is wrong about the 20 - year lead time , and begin a global crash programme today of fuel efficiency and electrification .
In either case , the British government had better start drawing up some contingency plans .

Meet the new girl at the White House ( good job Clinton 's not still President ! )
He is said to work 16 hours a day and and was unable to get a date during the presidential campaign .
But now Barack Obama 's 27 - year - old speechwriter , Jon Favreau , is dating a former Maxim model and actress who is working with him at the White House .
Ali Campoverdi stripped off for Maxim in 2004 - and told the men's magazine that she was looking for a man who was ' passionate ' about something .
Political glamour couple : Obama speechwriter Jon Favreau , left , is believed to be dating former Maxim model Ali Campoverdi , right
' I do n’t care if it ’s your job or your hobby or your shoes , ' she said at the time .
' Something has to make you tick ; something has to make you move . '
Ms Campoverdi is now an aide to a White House deputy chief of staff , American media outlets said .
But she has previously appeared American reality shows - including the dating show For Love or Money , where she was a ' million - dollar girl ' .
Ali Campoverdi on the night of Mr Obama 's inauguration
The California native also appeared as a vampire hunted by Keanu Reeves in Constantine and was a finalist for the American version of The Apprentice with Donald Trump .
The relationship is evidence of Mr Favreau 's newfound status as a political sex symbol - but during Mr Obama 's presidential run , he was not so lucky .
Talking to the New York Times last year , Mr Favreau observed somewhat dryly that ' the rigours of this campaign have prevented any sort of serious relationship . '
But as Mr Obama 's star has risen , so it appears has Mr Favreau's .
Aged just 27 , he is the youngest chief speechwriter on record at the White House .
Mr Favreau - or Favs to friends - was spotted by Mr Obama while working for John Kerry at the 2004 Democratic Convention .
The Illinois senator was running over his lines when Mr Favreau interrupted him to suggest one that rhymed .
He is now one of Mr Obama 's most trusted aides and wrote the Iowa victory speech that launched Mr Obama towards the White House and coined the phrase , ' yes we can ' .
' Barack trusts him , ' said David Axelrod , Mr Obama ’s top adviser , ' and Barack does n’t trust too many folks with that - the notion of surrendering that much authority over his own words . '
Mr Obama 's chief speechwriter since 2007 , Mr Favreau works up to 16 hours a day on speeches throughout the country .
He is often to be seen working in the early hours , fuelled on double espresso and cans of Red Bull energy drink .
Mr Favreau has attracted a big following but his reputation took a blow when a photo emerged last December showing him drunkenly groping a cardboard cutout of Hillary Clinton at a Thanksgiving party and he was forced to apologise .
Mr. Favreau said that when he is writing , he stays up until 3 am and gets up as early as 5 .
He has n’t slept for more than six hours in as long as he can remember , he told the New York Times .
Jon Favreau who reportedly works 16 hours a day
Whether the feisty Ms Campoverdi will be happy with his workaholic habits remains to be seen .
Regarding her run at The Apprentice , she told Maxim : ' Yeah - I would ’ve kicked ass on that show !
Go ahead and call me , Trump !'
She also told the magazine that ' Anyone who says they do n’t have a dark side is lying or just not interesting . '
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
Bank of America has received another $ 20 billion from the federal government 's bailout fund , along with guarantees on $ 118 billion of assets at the bank , to absorb its recent purchase of the ailing Merrill Lynch .
Details of the deal were announced by the government in the early hours of Friday .
The new arrangement provides additional capital for Bank of America ( BAC , Fortune 500 ) in exchange for preferred stock with an 8 % dividend , according to a joint statement by the Treasury Department and the Federal Reserve .
The Treasury will extend $ 20 billion more to the bank under the $ 700 billion Troubled Asset Relief Program .
The funding will come from the TARP Targeted Investment Program , not the subset $ 250 billion Capital Investment Program designed to prop up healthy banks ' balance sheets .
The bailout deal also provides a $ 118 billion backstop from the Fed in case of " unusually large losses " on assets backed by real - estate loans , most of which are being absorbed by Bank of America in its buyout of brokerage house Merrill Lynch .
Bank of America will pay 3.7 % of those assets as a fee for the backstop , and is responsible for the first $ 10 billion of losses and 10 % of the remaining losses .
According to Ken Lewis , Bank of America 's chief executive , Bank of America realized soon after its merger deal with Merrill Lynch in mid-September that Merrill 's losses were accelerating beyond expectations .
In December , the bank discovered Merrill 's asset deterioration was " much , much higher " than anyone had forecast .
But when the bank considered renegotiating the deal , the Treasury Department intervened .
" As we saw the anticipated loss accelerating , we reevaluated our rights under the deal , " Lewis said on a conference call with investors .
" The government was under the view that walking away would cause significant concerns and serious systemic harm to the financial markets . "
Lewis said the government 's response led to considerable uncertainty about its next steps , but in the end , he concluded that sticking with the deal would best benefit the national economy .
" We did think we were doing the right thing for the country , " Lewis said .
Huge quarterly losses
The news came just before the nation 's largest bank reported a net loss of $ 1.79 billion in the fourth quarter of 2008 , compared to earnings of $ 268 million at the same period in 2007 .
The net loss to common shareholders , including the issuance of preferred stock dividends that the government receives from its preliminary capital investment , was $ 2.39 billion , or 48 cents per share .
Analysts expected earnings of 8 cents per share .
The loss did not include Merrill Lynch 's results .
The recently acquired investment bank reported a loss of $ 15.31 billion , or $ 9.62 per share .
Bank of America cited " severe capital markets dislocations " for Merrill 's huge loss , especially late in the quarter .
" The acquisition of [ Merrill Lynch ] significantly increases [ Bank of America 's ] exposure to currently depressed capital markets - related revenues , " wrote Jeff Harte , analyst with Sandler O'Neill & Partners , in a note .
Citing escalating credit costs , significant writedowns , trading losses and a deep economic recession , Bank of America slashed its dividend from 32 cents a share to just a penny .
The bank had already cut its dividend in half in the previous quarter .
" These are extraordinary times , " said Lewis .
" The credit markets literally hit a wall , and nobody lending to consumers or who is in the capital markets is immune . "
Third bailout 's a charm
Bank of America has now received a total of $ 45 billion in government aid .
Before the latest injection , it had been the recipient of $ 15 billion in government capital in October , and $ 10 billion last Friday - an investment that had been set aside for Merrill Lynch .
The deal marks the second time the federal government has had to step in again to prop up a faltering financial institution .
In November , officials injected another $ 20 billion into Citigroup ( C , Fortune 500 ) , which had already received $ 25 billion , and agreed to backstop more than $ 300 billion in troubled assets .
Aimed at fostering stability in the financial system , the $ 20 billion lifeline should be transferred to Bank of America later Friday , according to a senior government official .
Banks receiving TARP funds have been criticized for hoarding the cash to raise capital ratios , rather than lending it to improve the credit situation .
" Legislators raised concerns that we 're pulling back on credit , " Lewis said .
" It is true , our appetite on credit risk is greatly reduced .
How could it be otherwise ? "
Still , Lewis noted that the bank originated $ 115 billion in new credit in the fourth quarter , including many new home loans .
The bank said demand for mortgages surged in late December as loan rates fell .
Bank of America 's shares fell 14 % in afternoon trading after dropping 18.4 % Thursday .
They have fallen 45 % so far this week on concerns that the bank -- which had been viewed as one of the strongest in the country -- may be buckling as the nation 's economy worsens .
The Charlotte , N.C. - based bank has also taken over two ailing companies that thrust it deeper into the most troubled sectors of the financial system .
Not only did it take a big gamble on its $ 24 billion acquisition of the faltering brokerage titan , but it also bought battered mortgage lender Countrywide Financial early last year .
Bank of America already has announced it plans to shed up to 35,000 jobs over the next three years as it integrates the Wall Street firm .
Chief Executive Ken Lewis gave up his 2008 bonus last week .
More to come ?
Officials did n't disclose whether other troubled banks would need similar assistance .
" Each time we do one of these , we hope it 's the last one we will ever have to do , " one official said .
Bank earnings this quarter have been dismal so far .
Citigroup reported a whopping loss Friday , while JPMorgan Chase ( JPM , Fortune 500 ) said its profits plummeted 76 % Thursday .
The Treasury Department has less than $ 60 billion left to inject into banks under its capital purchase program .
President - elect Barack Obama on Thursday secured access to the $ 350 billion remaining in the federal bailout package , after a measure that would have blocked the funds ' release failed in the Senate .
Some analysts say banks are likely to get additional capital infusions this year .
Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke said Tuesday that the government must pump more money into troubled financial institutions and that further guarantees of their debt could be necessary .

General Motors boss Rick Wagoner and his Ford counterpart Alan Mulally have admitted making mistakes in the way that they have run their businesses .
They were in Washington with Chrysler boss Bob Nardelli , and were explaining to a Senate committee why they wanted $ 34bn ( £ 23 bn ; 26.6bn euros ) in aid .
All three also blamed the US recession for decimating sales and leaving their companies in desperate need of cash .
But senators raised doubts about whether the money would be enough .
" No matter how important the autos are to our economy , we do n't want to put good money after bad , " said President George W Bush in a separate interview with US media .
" We are here today because we made mistakes , and because circumstances beyond our control pushed us to the brink , " said Mr Wagoner , referring to the global economic downturn .
Mr Nardelli said that Chrysler had lost $ 16bn of revenue as a result of plunging car sales this year alone .
Mr Mulally admitted that Ford had " produced more vehicles than our customers wanted , then slashed prices " .
Wider implications
In his opening comments , chairman of the Senate Banking Committee , Democrat Christopher Dodd , laid bare the severity of the situation .
Letting Chrysler , General Motors or Ford fail would be like playing " Russian roulette with the entire economy " , he said .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
Failure would affect " almost every sector of the economy " , he added .
Mark Zandi , economist with Moody's , also testifying to the committee as an independent expert , said bankruptcy at this time would be " cataclysmic " for the US economy .
But he threw a spanner into the works by telling the committee that $ 34bn would not be enough to save the carmakers .
They might need as much as $ 75 bn to $ 125bn , he said .
This sparked concerns that the so - called Detroit Three would simply return to Washington , cap in hand , when the money ran out .
All three bosses said their requests were realistic and based on conservative sales estimates .
Hard sell
The car company bosses said that their plan would also focus heavily on boosting investments in more fuel - efficient , environmentally friendly cars .
US policymakers have already approved $ 25bn in cash handouts to the car companies to help them develop greener vehicles .
All three of the bosses were at pains to explain how they had driven to the hearing in hybrid cars made by their respective companies .
They had been heavily criticised two weeks ago for flying to Washington in separate private jets for their last hearing in Congress .
Some progress was made when senators floated the idea of a board to oversee the handling of any potential loans .
This would impose strict conditions and could lead to fund being withheld should the conditions not be met .
All three chief executives agreed in principle to defer to such a board .
Loan proposals Earlier this week , Chrysler , Ford and General Motors submitted their proposals to Congress for the multi-billion - dollar loans upon which their survival could depend .
Slashing costs , reducing levels of debt and investing in greener technologies form the centre - piece of each proposal .
The chief executives of Ford and GM even offered to work for $ 1 a year if Congress approves the emergency aid .

GAZA ( Reuters ) - Israeli aircraft and tanks pounded the Gaza Strip on Wednesday and troops battled Palestinian guerrillas on the ground as U.S. backing for a proposed truce raised expectations of an end to the 12 - day - old offensive .
“ We believe a ceasefire is necessary , ” Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice said , adding that she was pressing Israel to move forward with an Egyptian proposal backed by Europeans .
Israel ’s assault resumed fiercely after a first , brief pause to help Gaza ’s 1.5 million people stock up on supplies .
But with both the outgoing administration of George W. Bush and the hitherto silent President - elect Barack Obama speaking out on the need for peace , officials said Israel had agreed with the “ principles ” of the Egyptian deal and would send an envoy to Cairo to discuss details of how it might be put into practice .
That may yet take time .
Rice echoed Israel ’s concerns that a deal achieve its goal of stopping the Hamas Islamists who rule Gaza from hitting Israel with rockets :
“ It has to be a ceasefire that will not allow a return to the status quo , ” she said .
However , Israeli ministers put off a decision on whether to launch a new phase of the war by storming Gaza ’s urban centers .
Hamas said it was looking at the Egyptian plan , brokered by France , which addresses Israel ’s demand that Hamas be prevented from rearming through smuggling tunnels from Egypt and also addresses Hamas ’s call for an end to Israel ’s wider embargo .
A further 20 people were killed , medics said , including three children in an air strike on a car .
It was a lower toll than on other days but took the total of Palestinian deaths since December 27 to at least 658 -- by far the bloodiest episode in decades in the conflict between Israel and Palestinians .
Israeli television aired army footage showing troops herding handcuffed and blindfolded prisoners in civilian clothes .
Ten Israelis have died in the past 12 days , seven of them soldiers , including four killed by “ friendly ” fire .
U.N. officials have said a quarter of the Palestinian dead were civilians , while other accounts put that proportion higher .
SCHOOL CARNAGE
Tuesday ’s killing by Israeli shells of 42 people , including women and children sheltering in a United Nations - run school in Jabalya refugee camp , intensified international pressure on Israel to call a halt .
U.N. officials denied an Israeli army account that militants had been firing from the school .
Israel , however , has said it will press on until Hamas can no longer hit its southern towns with rockets .
Israeli leaders , censured by voters over a costly war against Lebanon ’s Hezbollah guerrillas in 2006 , face a parliamentary election in a month and will want to show the public the campaign in Gaza has met that objective .
Rockets had killed 18 people over the past 7 years .
Four more have been killed by missiles during the war and police said 15 missiles landed in Israel again on Wednesday .

However , American involvement of the kind that helped end the Lebanon war and which was perceived as absent in the first week of the Gaza fighting , may indicate that , whatever the state of combat on the ground , a ceasefire could be on the cards .
A spokesman for Prime Minister Ehud Olmert said : “ There is a broad understanding on the general principles of a solution . ”
But a senior Israeli official , speaking on condition of anonymity , cautioned : “ Translating those principles into practical action is a challenge that is still ahead of us . ”
Obama , who has steered clear of involvement ahead of his inauguration on January 20 , said he would “ engage immediately ” on the Middle East situation once he took office .

Some Israeli analysts say Israel faces a deadline to wrap up its campaign by the time Obama is sworn in , or risk a strain in ties with Washington at the outset of the new administration .
As diplomatic efforts continued at the United Nations in New York , British Foreign Secretary David Miliband said : “ I have seen the first glimmerings of the possibility of a ceasefire .
“ It ’s far too early to say we can get a breakthrough . ”
EUROPEAN FORCE
European governments have proposed backing the Egyptian ceasefire proposal with an EU force along the Gaza - Egypt border that would prevent Hamas rearming through its many tunnels .
Javier Solana , the European Union ’s foreign policy chief said the EU was prepared to help Egypt prevent arms smuggling along its border with Gaza : “ Today we have the will , today we have the technology , today we have the means ... to prevent that smuggling of weapons takes place , ” Solana said by telephone .
Israel has pounded the area around the frontier town of Rafah and warned residents on Wednesday to leave their homes .
Troops continued efforts to destroy a warren of tunnels that have been Gaza ’s main supply route since Israel tightened a blockade following Hamas ’s seizure of control in Gaza in 2007 .
Hamas , which has backing from Israel ’s enemies in Iran and Syria and which won a parliamentary election in 2006 , is bitterly at odds with Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas , who has sought to negotiate a peace deal with Israel .
Among Hamas ’s priorities is securing a lifting of Israel ’s embargo .
Hamas called off a six - month ceasefire late last month , accusing Israel of breaking an agreement to ease supplies .
“ Aggression must stop , the siege must be lifted and Zionist forces must pull out , and then we can talk about other issues , including calm and rockets , ” said its spokesman Fawzi Barhoum .
The schism between the two Palestinian factions has dimmed prospects for a deal to create a Palestinian state and end 60 years of conflict .
Unlike Abbas , Hamas refuses to accept the existence of Israel , though it has offered a long - term truce .
Egypt has said it would aim to re-launch efforts to broker a reconciliation between Abbas and Hamas after a Gaza ceasefire .
Palestinians in Gaza ventured outside to shop for food during the three - hour lull in fighting Israel said it would now implement daily to facilitate a flow of aid to the territory .
“ Food and milk -- what else can we hope for in three hours , ” said Ahmed Abu Kamel , a father of six .
“ We want it all to end . ”
SAN FRANCISCO 
In many ways it is a typical map , showing states , highways , cities and streets .
But also dotting the online display are thousands of red arrows , marking spots from Bryn Mawr , Pa. , to Jamacha , Calif. , identifying the addresses of donors who supported Proposition 8 , which outlawed same - sex marriage in California .
It is exactly those arrows that concern supporters of the measure , who say they have been regularly harassed since the election  with threatening e-mail messages and sometimes boycotts of their businesses .
“ Some gay activists have organized Web sites to actively encourage people to go after supporters of Proposition 8 , ” said Frank Schubert , the campaign manager for Protect Marriage , the leading group behind the proposition .
“ And giving these people a map to your home or office leaves supporters of Proposition 8 feeling especially vulnerable .
Really , it is chilling . ”
So chilling , apparently , that supporters have filed suit in Federal District Court in Sacramento seeking a preliminary injunction of a state election law that requires donors of $ 100 or more to disclose their names , addresses , occupations and other personal information .
In particular , the suit seeks to stop the final filing for the 2008 election , which is due Jan. 31 .
That filing includes donations made in the closing days of the campaign , when the proposition surged to victory .
Two arch rivals from the KaZaA copyright infringement case have teamed up to produce what is being touted as a formidable anti-piracy system , converting pirates into paying customers .
Installed at the ISP level so that users can't easily bypass it , ' Copyrouter ' is defeated by BitTorrent .
During recent weeks , a ‘ new ’ anti-piracy system has been mentioned many times in the press .
‘ Copyrouter ’ gained most of its press for its ability to deal with the menace of online child porn , but of course , systems like this are almost always created with ‘ dual - use ’ in mind .
There is money to be made in protecting minors , but this is peanuts when compared to the bounty associated with stopping or monetizing illicit file - sharing .
The creators of Copyrouter understand this .
However , they wo n’t be making a penny from BitTorrent users , or stopping them from accessing whatever they like .
The company behind Copyrouter is Brilliant Digital Entertainment , headed up by Kevin Bermeister and Michael Speck , previous arch-rivals in the infamous KaZaA case .
Within a month they will be trialling the Copyrouter system on an unnamed ISP ’s network in Australia .
Using technology known as ‘ Deep Packet Inspection ‘ , the Copyrouter system sits at the ISP level , with access to a list of hash values of infringing files that have been previously found on the Internet .
The system then compares these stored ‘ digital fingerprints ’ to files being accessed or sent by users on the particular ISP where Copyrouter is installed ( similar to CopySense ) .
If the system finds a match , transmission of any infringing files would be stopped and the user would either be presented with a warning screen indicating there is a problem , or ( and this is where the money - making comes in ) directs the user away from pirated content onto legitimate ( and presumably chargeable ) content .
However , there is a problem .
Copyrouter works with applications such as those on the Gnutella network like LimeWire , and also works with DCC + , Soulseek and KaZaA ( if anyone uses it anymore ) but simply cannot do anything about BitTorrent transfers .
BitTorrent uses ‘ swarming ’ technology , whereby small pieces of a file are sent out and received , to and from multiple users .
This method of shifting data makes it impossible for Copyrouter to examine and compare the fingerprint of files being transferred as we have argued before , which means that the entire BitTorrent ‘ revenue stream ’ is off - limits to Brilliant Digital , a real problem since BitTorrent is the Internet ’s most popular P2P protocol .
“ I do n’t think there ’s anyone in the Internet space , ” Brilliant ’s Michael Speck told MSNBC “ who does n’t think fighting child sexual exploitation is good business . ”
Agreed Mr Speck .
But there ca n’t be that many people in the Internet space who believes that piracy is n’t the main target of Copyrouter either .
Brilliant wo n’t miss much with its inability to monitor BitTorrent for exploitation as it ’s the ‘ cleanest ’ of all P2P networks when it comes to protecting young folk .
Torrent site admins already do Copyrouter ’s job for it in this respect .
At no charge .

H5N1 Clusters in Beijing and Hunan Raise Pandemic Concerns
Recombinomics Commentary 14:29
January 19 , 2009
The above comments strongly suggest the 2 F from Hunan was infected by her mother ( see updated map ) .
Details on the case have been lacking , and transport to Shanxi by her grandparents would be consistent with the death of her mother .
Similarly , details on the health care worker linked to the Beijing case have been lacking .
One media report indicated the health care worker tested positive for H5N1 , while most media reports simply said the nurse recovered .
Human to human H5N1 in China would not be a surprise .
Four cases have been confirmed and these cases were fatal or the patient is in critical condition .
The lack of reports on recovered cases suggests additional unconfirmed infections , which suggests a more efficient transmission to humans .
The lack of detail on these reported clusters , and the failure of WHO to comment or cite the health care worker in the situate update on the Beijing case and statement that contacts remain healthy increases concerns .
More detail on these related cases , and release of sequence data would be useful .

The state Department of Public Safety has adopted a series of changes that will fundamentally alter the way officers gain consent to search vehicles following the recommendations of an advisory board composed of Arizona residents appointed by Gov. Janet Napolitano .
The most significant changes require officers to receive a signed form before a driver consents to a search and for officers to document , what factors , exactly , prompted the search for those cars and trucks where a search proves fruitless .
Many of the recommendations have already been put in place , said Mikel Longman , Chief of the Agency 's Support Division .
It 's part of the agency 's ongoing effort to achieve a greater sense of transparency following a 2003 court settlement , Longman said .
� I think actually it will be very beneficial , � he said .
� It 's really been quite enlightening for me on things as a longtime police officer that may appear to be abundantly obvious . �
As part of the court settlement , Napolitano appointed a nine residents to a Citizen 's Traffic Stop Advisory Board which spent the last 19 months gathering information from local - and - national experts on traffic stops and racial profiling and collaborating an the recommendations released Tuesday .
The new policies require the driver to consent to the search - either in writing or on video - or - audio tape - and for the officers to fill out a form that DPS supervisors can review to determine the cause of the suspicion .
If the driver refuses , an officer can try to get a warrant , which requires probable cause , a higher standard than reasonable suspicion that criminal activity might be present , said Jean - Jacques Cabou , a Phoenix attorney and member of the advisory board .
The resulting changes , with DPS officers receiving written consent and detailing the roots of their suspicions , puts the department in a unique position , he said .
� I do n't believe that the DPS will be the first law enforcement agency ever to take these steps but they are certainly one of the first to adopt what we believe are best practices in this area , � Cabou said .
It 's a step advocates have been waiting for since the beginning of the decade , when ACLU representatives filed a class - action lawsuit on behalf of citizens who alleged that DPS officers stopped - and - detained minority drivers at a higher rate than White drivers .
Following the court 's decision , the agency began voluntarily collecting data on everyone DPS officers stopped in Arizona , but in some regard that data has proven inadequate .
The results of that data collection - released in a comprehensive report updated last month - showed that Hispanic motorists were more likely to be ticketed than other motorists and less likely to receive warnings for infractions .
The data , collected in 2007 by a team of experts from the University of Cincinnati Policing Institute , also showed that � Hispanic , Native American and Black drivers were all significantly more likely than White drivers to be arrested and searched , � and mirrored the findings from 2006 .
But study noted that it was impossible to determine whether race was a motivating factor in pulling over a car or truck on one of Arizona 's highways .
� We ca n't get past the fact that Arizona is one of the major trans - shipment states in elicit narcotics coming into the U.S. , illegal aliens coming into the U.S. and cash and weapons going into Mexico , � Longman said .
�DPS officers are trying to work their best to make the highways inhospitable to the criminal element . �
The policy changes represent another step in that data - gathering , Longman said , and an effort on the part of DPS get have more pertinent information while allowing supervisors to track the consent searches .
But Daniel Pochoda , an ACLU lawyer , said the study 's results proved DPS had done little to change the culture in the department despite the lawsuit .
� There has not been a willingness to acknowledge the results and the behavior are racially motivated , to admit there 's a clear statistical discrepancy , � Pochoda said .
� To not say there 's not a problem with some racially motivated police behavior , whether it 's conscious or unconscious , I think it 's less likely they 'll constructively address it . �
The study 's authors also noted that without a benchmark to determine the expected racial breakdown of motorists traveling through a certain area , the data 's ability to help demonstrate bias was limited .
The new recommendations bring with them more data collection for DPS officers , and with it the possibility of getting to the root of that racial disparity and restoring more public confidence in the agency , said Liz Archuletta , a Coconino County Supervisor and board member .
� I think it provides not only protection for the officers but for the person being stopped , � she said .
The policy changes , while significant , are just the first phase , board members said .
The governor - appointed board is slated to meet again in February .

This snippet is taken from MRzine .
Gerald Kaufman is on the rightwing of the British Labour Party and it's so exceptionally rare for him to say much that the readers of this site would agree with that it ’s worth posting .
The video can be seen here .
It 's an astonishingly powerful and personal speech .
{ For more examples of Jewish and Israeli opposition to Israel 's massacres in Gaza , click HERE . ]
This is the full text of Kaufman 's speech to the British House of Commons on January 15 , 2009 :
Sir Gerald Kaufman ( Manchester , Gorton ) ( Lab ) : I was brought up as an orthodox Jew and a Zionist .
On a shelf in our kitchen , there was a tin box for the Jewish National Fund , into which we put coins to help the pioneers building a Jewish presence in Palestine .
I first went to Israel in 1961 and I have been there since more times than I can count .
I had family in Israel and have friends in Israel .
One of them fought in the wars of 1956 , 1967 and 1973 and was wounded in two of them .
The tie clip that I am wearing is made from a campaign decoration awarded to him , which he presented to me .
I have known most of the Prime Ministers of Israel , starting with the founding Prime Minister David Ben-Gurion .
Golda Meir was my friend , as was Yigal Allon , Deputy Prime Minister , who , as a general , won the Negev for Israel in the 1948 war of independence .
My parents came to Britain as refugees from Poland .
Most of their families were subsequently murdered by the Nazis in the holocaust .
My grandmother was ill in bed when the Nazis came to her home town of Staszow .
A German soldier shot her dead in her bed .
My grandmother did not die to provide cover for Israeli soldiers murdering Palestinian grandmothers in Gaza .
The current Israeli Government ruthlessly and cynically exploit the continuing guilt among gentiles over the slaughter of Jews in the holocaust as justification for their murder of Palestinians .
The implication is that Jewish lives are precious , but the lives of Palestinians do not count .
On Sky News a few days ago , the spokeswoman for the Israeli army , Major Leibovich , was asked about the Israeli killing of , at that time , 800 Palestinians — the total is now 1,000 .
She replied instantly that “ 500 of them were militants . ”
That was the reply of a Nazi .
I suppose that the Jews fighting for their lives in the Warsaw ghetto could have been dismissed as militants .
The Israeli Foreign Minister Tzipi Livni asserts that her Government will have no dealings with Hamas , because they are terrorists .
Tzipi Livni ’s father was Eitan Livni , chief operations officer of the terrorist Irgun Zvai Leumi , who organised the blowing - up of the King David hotel in Jerusalem , in which 91 victims were killed , including four Jews .
Israel was born out of Jewish terrorism .
Jewish terrorists hanged two British sergeants and booby - trapped their corpses .
Irgun , together with the terrorist Stern gang , massacred 254 Palestinians in 1948 in the village of Deir Yassin .
Today , the current Israeli Government indicate that they would be willing , in circumstances acceptable to them , to negotiate with the Palestinian President Abbas of Fatah .
It is too late for that .
They could have negotiated with Fatah ’s previous leader , Yasser Arafat , who was a friend of mine .
Instead , they besieged him in a bunker in Ramallah , where I visited him .
Because of the failings of Fatah since Arafat ’s death , Hamas won the Palestinian election in 2006 .
Hamas is a deeply nasty organisation , but it was democratically elected , and it is the only game in town .
The boycotting of Hamas , including by our Government , has been a culpable error , from which dreadful consequences have followed .
The great Israeli Foreign Minister Abba Eban , with whom I campaigned for peace on many platforms , said : “ You make peace by talking to your enemies . ”
However many Palestinians the Israelis murder in Gaza , they cannot solve this existential problem by military means .
Whenever and however the fighting ends , there will still be 1.5 million Palestinians in Gaza and 2.5 million more on the west bank .
They are treated like dirt by the Israelis , with hundreds of road blocks and with the ghastly denizens of the illegal Jewish settlements harassing them as well .
The time will come , not so long from now , when they will outnumber the Jewish population in Israel .
It is time for our Government to make clear to the Israeli Government that their conduct and policies are unacceptable , and to impose a total arms ban on Israel .
It is time for peace , but real peace , not the solution by conquest which is the Israelis ’ real goal but which it is impossible for them to achieve .
They are not simply war criminals ; they are fools .
Driving is a fact of life for most of us , but it does n't have to be just another chore .
Make the most of your driving time with these ten tips for streamlining your time in the car .

We really dug the Dollar Stretcher blog 's recipe for DIY de-icer — simply 3 parts vinegar to 1 part water in a spray bottle , applied before a cold and wet night .
But our commenters have a few of their own solutions for cold - weather cars .
Among their suggestions : A cup of cold water and a good scraper ; simply covering your windshield with cardboard ; and even using the A/C and heat simultaneously .
While you 're assembling your anti-ice weapons , keep a little water - free hand sanitizer handy — it can de-ice a lock .

9 . Get better sound from your iPod

Those whose factory stereo decks lack a frontal input for an iPod or other MP3 player know that FM transmitters are no substitution for a simple wire .
But you can limit the number of audio break - ins from radio stations and other cars ' devices with Sirius ' FM Channel Finder , which finds the most empty radio spots in your ZIP code .
On the other hand , if you 're not afraid to yank the stereo out of the dash and add your own stereo inputs , it 's actually pretty simple ; we 've previously pointed to two solutions , one with soldering , the other without ( scroll down to " Wire Your Car Stereo for an iPod " ) .
If none of that takes , you 've always got the " nuclear option , " at least if you 've got an easily removable exterior antenna — just yank it out and fire up the newly empowered FM transmitter .

8 . Put together a quality emergency car kit
You 'll hopefully never need to pull out your emergency kit in a real life - or - death situation .
Any time you 're in your car and not going anywhere , though , you 'll be glad you 're prepared .
Edmunds.com has a extensive , always - prepared kit list , which seems a little OCD until you 've ever tried to call a tow truck company in unknown country , finally getting an answer of " later this afternoon " ( seriously ) .
Our tech - savvy , road - ready readers also have a lot of great suggestions for travelers with all kinds of needs .

7 . Keep a level head , re-think your commuting strategy
Advertisement
You can't control traffic and road conditions across your entire commute , but you can control the way your mind takes it in and deals with it .
We 're not talking about a vague , everything 's - gonna - be - just - fine sense , either — there are some simple , thought - by - thought improvements you can make , as explained by driving expert Tom Vanderbilt .
One of the key changes is releasing your anger at " late mergers , " and curtalining your own rapid lane - changing :
And changing lanes is counter - productive .
It increases the risk of an accident , makes a driver more stressed and does n't make much difference .
When tested in Canada , the driver that changed lanes at every opportunity only made four minutes in an 80 - minute drive .

6 . Do n't get pressured into 3,000 - mile oil changes
Advertisement
Yahoo Autos / Greencar.com wrote it first , and we agree — you probably do n't need an oil change every 3,000 miles .
Crack open your the owner 's manual for your vehicle — no , seriously , reach into the glove box for it — and you 'll often find inside a recommendation for changes every 5,000 , 7,000 , or , in some cases , every 10,000 miles .
Giving into social / corporate pressure just pulls cash from your pocket , and gives the environment more dispensed oil to deal with .
Be brave instead and drive right past the 15 - minute quick - lube joints with your little " secret . "

5 . Stay awake on long drives

For those long , multi-state hauls or the ( sober ) drive home after a late night , you might think a quick nap in a parking lot or rest stop might be the best thing for droopy eyelids .
Not so , according to French researchers , as caffeine wins out over naps for every age group , but especially among those 30 and older .
Of course , there 's a middle ground for nap lovers and French roast drinkers — the clever caffeine nap , which requires drinking a cup of java right before a nap no longer than 15 minutes .
You 'll wake up with the dual benefits of a recharging nap and alertness - boosting caffeine , and you 're ready to stare past another set of mile markers .

4 . Use your fuel efficiently
Advertisement
It 's always great when one of our differently - obsessed sibling blogs stops by to drop some science , and Jalopnik 's visit during the days of super - expensive gas proved no different , offering up five ways to use less fuel and still get where you 're going .
Here 's the simplest , no - tools - required tip :
Fill up your vehicle during the coolest part of the day .
With older pumps that do n't have a temperature - compensating flow meter , fuel is denser when it 's cool , so you actually get more for your money when you pump gas in the early AM instead of filling up at 5:30 PM on your way home from work .

Gas may not cost more per gallon than a value meal these days — well , depending on your chain of choice — but it 's still not cheap , so use it wisely .
3 . Learn the secrets of parallel parking
Advertisement
If you secured your license without getting the hang of the wheel - cranking parallel parking routine , Ann 's Driving School has some specific parallel parking tips for getting more comfortable with parking between cars .
Nothing beats real - world practice , of course , but Ann 's offers a systematic approach — and , as some readers pointed out , is based in San Francisco , where speedy street - parking is kind of a life necessity .
2 . Get an honest mechanic ( or at least avoid rip - offs )
Advertisement
Dentist , plumber , and mechanic — everybody needs one of each they can trust ( though accountant would n't hurt , too ) .
On the car front , ask your friends , co-workers , and neighbors for recommendations , and use a comparison site like the previously mentioned RepairPal to see how close to the mark your estimates are .
Ca n't build up the courage to debate what your car really needs ?
Try simply bringing your maintenance manual to the shop and insisting on what 's necessary .

1. Handle a traffic stop , possibly skip a ticket

Nothing , aside from a time machine , can get you out of a traffic ticket every time , but there are ways to improve your handling of the whole situation .
During the stop , for instance , do n't try to impress by quickly grabbing your license , registration , and insurance paperwork — just sit with your hands on the wheel .
It 's one of five do's and five don'ts compiled by Car and Driver with the help of state troopers .
Once you 've got the ticket , do n't grab the checkbook and stamps right away .

Facebook made mainstream media headlines last week when it censored a photograph of a breastfeeding mother .
As Facebook has increasingly become a platform for organizing and debate , many are finding their content disappearing .
The Jewish Internet Defense Force ( JIDF ) , which describes itself as a “ non-violent protest group who share concerns about antisemitic online content , as well as content which promotes terrorism on sites including Facebook , YouTube , Wikipedia , Google Earth , Blogger , and other sites and forums throughout the internet , ” has expressed concern over the censoring of their content on Facebook ( despite the fact that they seem to be pro-censorship themselves ) :
* ….. by clicking on link on Facebook which takes people here , which is a story about the terrorist organization responsible for the attacks in Mumbai being involved on Facebook itself .
It was a topic of a conversation in a Facebook group , which originally occurred here : www.facebook.com/topic.php?uid=2204704082&topic=6904
( as you can see in the screencap ) * However , now that conversation is gone !
What happened to it , Facebook ?
This is not the first time we have noticed this phenomenon .
Many threads in various pro-Israel and pro-JIDF groups have mysteriously disappeared ! *
It seems Facebook is extremely active in censoring content which might be “ anti-Facebook ” to some extent , yet the Jew hatred and promotion of Islamic terrorism remains .
*
We tried to send the following message out to all our JIDF Facebook group members over 5 hours ago and it is either not going to go through , seriously delayed , or Facebook is censoring our content :
While JIDF believes that “ Jew hatred and promotion of Islamic terrorism ” remains on Facebook , it seems that supporters of Palestine and Gaza are finding their content censored as well .
Rebelliousgirl expressed on Twitter that Facebook has prevented her from using hashtags :
Jordanian blogger Jad Madi , who describes himself as simply “ Middle Eastern , ” changed his name to “ Gaza Jad Madi ” today after discovering Facebook 's alleged biases :
Facebook started to delete anti zionist content , we need to draw the maximum attention to Gaza cause , changing your first name into Gaza should help .
My name now is Gaza Jad Madi
The blog to which Gaza Jad Madi links is Shuger Cuebs , which asks : “ Is Facebook Violating Our Right to Free Expression ? ”
The Palestinian blogger writes :
A friend of mine had to go through such an irritating experience with the facebook administration ; according to Ibrahim Mughrabi , facebook has deleted content on his personal profile related to the “ Zionist attacks on Gaza ” .
He says he ’s been contacted by the administration and warned that he’d be suspended from posting stuff on facebook if he continues to do so !
So much for free speech and equal rights for everyone in this world .
Have you experienced censorship on Facebook ?

The new NanoTouch device in action
Electronic devices have been shrinking for years , but you might be forgiven for thinking that one that ’s only a centimetre across would be just too difficult to operate .
Now tests of a prototype device only slightly larger than this have shown that it can be made perfectly usable by combining a screen on the front with a touch - sensitive pad on the back .
Touch screens can be an intuitive method of interacting with computers and are now near ubiquitous in smartphones and other high - end hand - held gadgets .
Fat fingers
It is often assumed that touch - screen device can be made smaller , because they do away with the need for buttons .
But paradoxically , they are often larger than the push button gadgets they replace , according to Patrick Baudisch at the Hasso Plattner Institute in Potsdam , Germany , and Microsoft Research in Redmond , Washington .
Advertisement
It ’s the “ fat finger ” problem that is to blame .
It is hard to hit small touch targets on a screen because your finger hides what you are aiming for .
Last year , Baudisch and Daniel Wigdor of Mitsubishi Electric Research Labs ( MERL ) in Cambridge , Massachusetts , led a team that developed a fix to that .
Their “ transparent ” LucidTouch device let users interact with a screen from the reverse side .
A new , smaller prototype created by Baudisch and his student Gerry Chu at the University of Toronto takes the idea further .
Called NanoTouch , it has a 6 - centimetre ( 2.4 inch ) screen and a touch pad of the same size on the back .
It can detect the touch or press of a finger , allowing the user to move a tiny cursor around and click and drag with it .
Transparent interface
When the user touches the interface on the back , an image of a finger appears behind the icons on the screen and moves around in sync with the user ’s finger , almost as if the device were transparent .
A small active spot marked on the finger ’s end is used to interact with buttons onscreen .
To complete the illusion , the fingertip turns white as if pressed against a sheet of glass when the user presses on the touchpad ( see video above ) .
User tests showed that targets just 1.8 millimetres across were easy to hit using NanoTouch .
Targets on conventional touch - screen devices such as the iPhone are at least twice that size .
Speed reading
That precision opens the way for truly tiny devices , with screens as small as a centimetre across that are still easy to use , says Baudisch .
Further user tests with NanoTouch simulated those smaller devices by reducing the active area of the screen .
Even a screen just 8 mm across was easy to use .
Displaying information on such small screens will need some new approaches , though .
“ We are particularly excited about rapid serial visual presentation ( RSVP ) as a means for compressing data into small spaces , ” he says .
RSVP involves flashing up text just a word or sentence at a time and has been shown to allow faster reading on small displays .
“ Interestingly , the world record in speed reading – by a substantial margin – was reached using an RSVP - based reader , ” says Baudisch .
Watch interfaces
Stephen Brewster , a computer interface expert at the University of Glasgow in the UK , says the NanoTouch prototype is “ compelling ” and an interesting new extension of LucidTouch .
“ Touch screens are the interaction surface of the moment , but they do have their drawbacks .
Occlusion by the finger is a real problem .
Patrick has a nice approach to solving it , ” he says .
“ [ Now ] we can start to design really small devices such as interactive watches that have really good interactions . ”
The NanoTouch prototype will be presented at the Computer and Human Interaction conference in Boston , Massachusetts , in April 2009 .

Just when you thought there are enough not - so - good looking and overrated phones out there , Dell is expected to announce two iPhone and Blackberry competitors sometime next month .
Code - named MePhone ( hopefully not the final name ) , the phones will run on Google Android and Microsoft Windows Mobile respectively .
Following rumors going back as far as July 2007 , the Wall Street Journal announced this morning that Dell will introduce in February at the Mobile World Conference in Barcelona two new mobile phones , set to go head to head with market leaders Apple and Research In Motion .
One of the phones will be touchscreen - only while the other will feature a slide - out keyboard , similar to the T - Mobile G1 .
It is not known which of the models will feature Windows Mobile and which will run on Android and other technical specifications are not available yet either .
Also , no partnership with any U.S. wireless carries has been announced .
Now , if we are to take this rumor seriously , Dell 's " MePhone " is supposed to go on sale on September 9 .
WSJ 's report also mentions that the Dell phones ' focus will be on " customization , " but it does n't say whether it 's software or hardware customization -- so nothing is clear on this front either .
We need to keep in mind is that apparently no final decision has been made regarding the launch of these MePhones .
Dell 's mobile devices can be called off at any time before launch , just as it happened last November with the company 's effort to launch a new iPod competitor .
Still , would you buy a Dell smartphone ?
What kind of features should MePhone have in order to convince you to chose it over an iPhone , Blackberry or T - Mobile G1 ?
Please let me know in the comments .
Mrs Robinson said she expected to be criticised for her comments A former UN High Commissioner for Human Rights , Mary Robinson , has told the BBC she was taken aback by the " terrible " conditions in Gaza on a recent visit .
Mrs Robinson said it was " almost unbelievable " that the world did not care about what she called " a shocking violation of so many human rights " .
Israel tightened a blockade on Gaza after Hamas took control there in 2007 .
On Tuesday , Egypt temporarily opened its Gaza border to allow students and people needing medical care to cross .
Mrs Robinson , a former president of Ireland , told the BBC she had been " taken aback with the terrible , trapped situation of the families " in the Gaza .
It 's almost unbelievable that the world does n't care while this is happening
Mary Robinson
She said the situation had deteriorated since she last visited the Palestinian territory in 2000 , and was far worse that in towns in the West Bank .
Women she spoke to said their farm lands had been bulldozed and their families were unable to find jobs or supplies .
" Their whole civilisation has been destroyed , I 'm not exaggerating , " said Mrs Robinson .
" It 's almost unbelievable that the world does n't care while this is happening . "
Criticism expected Israel and Egypt have blockaded the overcrowded and impoverished Gaza Strip since Hamas violently seized control of the territory in June 2007 .
Gaza under blockade Israel says the blockade , under which it has allowed little more than basic humanitarian aid into Gaza , is needed to isolate the militant group and stop it and other militants from firing rockets into Israel .
Israel came to a truce with Palestinian groups in June this year , but Mrs Robinson said this had had little effect on people 's lives and " just brought a bitter taste in the mouth " .
She said people in Gaza were the responsibility of Israel and suggested that ordinary Israelis did not understand the situation as they " could n't possibly support it if they really did " .
The former commissioner called on European countries and the rest of the world to do more to understand the " inhumane " conditions .
She said she expected that she would be criticised for her comments but that the issue had to be addressed .
" When I see 1.4 million trapped in a situation of collective punishment , without rights , I have to raise that , and I will go on raising it , " she said .
Crossing open
On Tuesday , Egypt temporarily opened its Rafah border with Gaza to students and people seeking medical treatment .
The crossing has been closed for almost two - and - a - half years , but has occasionally been opened for humanitarian reasons .
Israel insists " normal business " cannot resume at Rafah until Hamas releases an Israeli soldier , Cpl Gilad Shalit , captured two years ago .
Earlier this year , hundreds of thousands of Gazans flooded across when the border was breached .
Egyptian officials said the crossing was likely to be open for three days , giving several thousand Gazans the chance to go into Egypt and bring supplies into Gaza .

Season of the Witch - Witch attack

Season of the Witch - Hard to believe

Is the black Witch really behind this awful plague ?
Season of the Witch - They saw my sword 's crest .
;-P
More clips of Season of the Witch below :
It was 11:00 am on Saturday morning when I woke up and jumped out of bed in panic .
I realized that the night before , I had parked my car in a 2 - hour parking zone around the corner from my house .
I ran outside barefoot , in a rumpled T - shirt and boxer shorts .
But I was too late .
A neat white envelope stuck out from underneath a wiper blade .
I missed the fucker by only a few minutes and was busy cursing my bad luck under my morning breath and looking around for the meter maid when I heard a voice at my shoulder .
“ I ’m too much of a pussy , but if I had the guts , I ’d block out all the personal information on the tickets I get , wrap them around a rock and break a window in some city government building .
That way , these assholes know exactly what my money is going to be used for .
Repairing that busted window , ” a neighbor of mine said with hate in his eyes , and then bent down to scoop up his pit bull ’s steaming pile of shit .
For me , this ticket was something to celebrate .
If I ’m counting them right , it was my 10th since I moved out to LA two months ago .
I owned two different cars while I lived in Russia ― a Zhiguli in St. Petersburg and a Volga in Moscow ― yet I had totally forgotten the injustice of being served with a parking fine .
Say what you will about the shitty drivers , the fucked up roads and the corruption of Russian highway police , but the country ’s complete lack of parking laws is pure bliss for any motorist .
Forget worrying about an expired meter .
If you could drive your car into it , then it ’s a parking spot .
So I ’ve had some difficulty adjusting to the totalitarian rigidity of America ’s parking laws .
And I ’ve been paying dearly for it .
I ’ve amassed half a grand in fines , all collected while parked in a purely residential area around my house in West LA .
Every time it was something different .
Wednesday ’s street cleaning would slip my mind .
Then I ’d forget that Thursday is cleaning day on the other side of the street .
Once it was a loading zone that had the yellow paint stripped off the curb .
I have yet to be whipped into obedience , but I ’ve become intimately familiar with the dollar amounts printed on the red , white and blue tickets the meter maids here type out on their hi-tech ticketing machines .
But there was something different about the one I was holding in my hand .
A week before , the same ticket on the same street cost me $ 40 .
This one was $ 43 .
A cryptic note blaming Sacramento for the increase was printed on the bottom of the slip , just above the part that told me I have 21 calendar days to pay up : “ Citation increased $ 3.00 by the State . ”
This was something that needed further investigatin’ .
I assumed that the increase had something to do with the State ’s dire financial situation .
As I write this , scary headlines of imminent financial collapse swirl around the Bear State , the 10th largest economy in the world .
California is out of money , has been for the past year and half .
Now it ’s about $ 22 billion in debt and ca n’t pay a cent of it back .
It ’s holding on to state tax returns just to pay for day - to - day operations .
Surely the $ 3 increase had something to do with that , maybe used to top off some sort of emergency fund .
But no .
A few words on LA ’s user - friendly parking department ’s Web site set my naive ideas about governance straight .
On August 31 , 2008 , the California State Senate passed SB 1407 , which increases the parking penalty amount deposited from parking fines to the State ’s Immediate and Critical Needs Account for court construction projects , from $ 1.50 to $ 4.50 effective January 1 , 2009 .
Did they just say court construction projects ?
I had to read that a few times to make sure I was n’t mistaken , and then I rushed to find some corroborating information .
But it was true .
This past summer , while I was walking around Moscow paranoid about an FSB tail after
The eXile ’s shutdown , California State Senators were busy in Sacramento passing a law that authorized the financing of a $ 5 - billion remodeling project for California ’s courthouses .
According to the guy who drafted the bill , a State Senator from Oakland named Don Perata , California ’s “ court facilities have created dangerous conditions that place children , jurors , witnesses , litigants , visitors and public employees at risk . ”
Children at risk ?
Well , if you put it that way , then I ’m convinced of the extreme necessity of this project .
After all , that day , with the same pen , Governor Schwarzenegger signed off on another important law that created the “ California Gold Star Family ” license plate series that will allow families with relatives blown - up in Iraq or Afghanistan to brag about it on their license plates .
It ’s not clear who ’s gonna benefit from these cheesy sacrifice badges , but it sure as hell wo n’t be the dead soldiers or the taxpayers .
But we do know who ’ll be paying for the courthouse facelifts : anyone who breaks the law and is caught doing it .
Some local bigwig activist / columnist from the Democratic party named Frank D. Russo was all puppy - dog praise for the project .
“ There is some good news coming out of Sacramento today , ” he wrote .
“ Kudos to Governor Schwarzenegger who earlier today signed Perata ’s bill , SB 1470 authorizing a $ 5 billion bond which will be funded entirely by increased fines and court fees .
This is one of those rare situations where a genuine lease revenue bond could be put to good use , and taxpayers are not asked to foot the bill . ”
When Russo said that taxpayers were not going to be asked to foot the bill , what he meant was that only some taxpayers were not asked to foot the bill .
The rest are simply going to be told .
See , law SB 1407 is getting financed in an underhanded and downright evil manner by jacking up the amount of money the State skims off the top of various fines and legal fees .
It is n’t just the parking violators like me who are forced to fork out extra money for more spacious and better appointed judges ’ chambers ― anyone convicted of a felony or misdemeanor is gonna be pitching in .
And everyone knows who ’s usually convicted of felonies and misdemeanors : poor people .
Last month , out of simple curiosity , I popped into LA ’s main courthouse with a lawyer friend of mine to sit in on some arraignments and preliminary hearings , and I ’ll say this : I ’m not so sure about the post- racial America of the Obama era .
Other than the judges , lawyers and cops , I was the only white person in the place .
It was embarrassing watching a prosecutor drill a 13 - year - old Mexican kid for attempted robbery just because he told some of his hoodlum friends that some kid he went to school with had nice stuff in his apartment .
It was even sadder to listen to the kid trying to explain that the cop ― who was sitting 5 ft. away from me with a “ fuck you , kid ” look on his face ― picked him at 4 a .m. on a school night , took him to the station in his PJs and basically dictated what the kid should say in his statement , all the while waving off his need for a lawyer .
“ You watch too much Law & Order , kid .
There ’s no reason for a lawyer .
That is , unless you did something wrong .

Lunar Magic Introduction Screen Shots Download Editor Demo World Demo World Screen Shots
Lunar Magic is a level editor I created for Super Mario World ( SNES ) .
During its 19 year span of being the only level editor available for this classic game , it 's inspired the creation of countless modifications of SMW by fans and casual players alike .
It was n't originally intended to be a long term project , but things turned out otherwise ...
I began looking into making an editor for SMW shortly after releasing the SoM VWF patch , mostly on a whim to see how hard it would be .
I started out in February 2000 by figuring out the compression format for the graphics and building the necessary decompression and recompression tools .
I went on to decode the level layout data , which required disassembling a fair portion of the ROM 's ASM code .
Then I reused the old GUI for the unfinished prototype of the Sailor Moon Map Editor to begin constructing the level editor .
I implemented the drag / drop support I had originally planned for SMRPG 's editor , and rewrote the GFX routines to handle Mario World 's format .
This was done sometime in mid-summer .
Then came implementing an " Add Object " GUI , without which editing Mario Levels would become an exercise in extreme tediousness .
I also created the MWL format , put in layer 2 support , and added a bunch of other dialogs and what - nots that were essential to changing the properties of a level .
Which was finished sometime in mid-August .
By then of course I was horrified by the sheer amount of time it had taken to build the silly program , but I was more horrified still to realize that the whole thing would be a waste if I did n't put in the sprite support to finish it off .
So I put in sprite support , as well as an " Add Sprites " GUI and a couple small ASM ROM modifications .
I quickly wrapped up most of the loose ends by early September .
In late September it was finally released to the public for the first time .
At that point I thought my job was pretty much complete , other than perhaps for a few minor revisions that could be added as needed .
Well , there were indeed a few revisions and fixes .
And then a few more .
And then some extra ASM enhancements to the game .
And then a few more of those too .
Before I knew it , it was already September 2001 , a full year since Lunar Magic had first been released .
In that time I had added extra graphics , 4bpp support , custom palettes , clipboard support , extended animated tiles , bypass dialogs , Japanese ROM support , layer 2 editing for the overworld , and all sorts of other minor enhancements .
By the end of 2001 , the overworld editor had full layer 1 support , making it possible to redesign the level layout and overworld paths of SMW .
In early 2002 , text editing for the overworld level names , the castle event sequences , and the message boxes had also been implemented .
But by mid-2002 , Lunar Magic 's development finally began winding down .
After releasing version 1.51 in September 2002 , there was a long period where I was busy with other things .
Development on the program slowed to a crawl .
This was also around the same time that I and Zero - G started working on Demo World TLC , but it also stalled early in 2003 .
It was n't until mid-2003 that we started trying to get it done in time for LM 's next release .
LM was updated to allow for far more ExGFX files , and a new feature was added for level - specific tile and palette animation .
The overworld was also finally finished off with animation and a sprite editing mode .
A few days after DW : TLC was released , LM version 1.60 was also released in September of 2003 .
There were a few minor bug fix releases over the next 2 years , but this was followed by a long 4 year period of inactivity since I figured ( once again ) that the program was complete and that I could move on to other things .
This lasted up until September of 2009 , when version 1.64 was released to address various issues that had been noticed over the years .
By this point the SMW community had grown considerably , and I was approached by smkdan about the possibility of including an ASM enhancement in LM for SMW that he was considering making to increase the number of tiles that levels could use .
I agreed , and used the time to add several other things like 4 x more Map16 and an ExAnimation rewrite , which was released as version 1.70 in April of 2010 .
Since then there have been numerous other improvements to the program , such as SA - 1 patch support and layer 3 editing .
One of the largest was inclusion of a patch by Vitor Vilela to allow changing the height of horizontal levels to allow for more dynamic level dimensions for version 3.00 in December of 2018 .
Looking back , I 'd say it 's pretty cool that modifying SMW is still going strong after all this time .
This has become one of the most popular Mario games to edit out there .
So I 'd like to express my thanks to Nintendo , for creating a game that so many people have spent untold hours playing , editing and just generally having lots of 16 - bit fun with . ^^
Why .... because of faulty human logic dating back to the GArden of Eden where mankind was deceived about Truth .....( see link below )
Today is a great example to see ' black and white logic ' in full force .
Regarding the issue " that Jews killed Christ " .... welll some of them did , but a handful , together with the powers that were ... then again Christ was a Jew ....( remove any of those important elements and you can polarize the issue against Jews ... )
Christ came to this earth to show us many things ..... tragically we have been deceived about his messages ....
We use his message to carry " a gun " to war .
We use his message to Kill Jews or Romans or others .
We must learn that Truth can lie , that is part of the ' original sin ' that has remained with us since the days of Eden ... it is a tool that the devil and his forces use ... to attack society and justice ...
Problem is ' the media ' does not want ot expose this , even though it was brought to their attention in 1987 .....
By the way " romans " , " some romans ' killed Christ .... that was some two thousand years ago ....( some truths are relative to time ... ) suggesting that ' those Romans ' are Italians is flawed logic ....' they " are obviously dead , and their decendants could be anywhere ....
Remember Cain and Able ... well we are descendants of Cain .... we are descendants of Adam and Eve ....
So discover how the ' original sin ' has been passed down to us ....( I call them the theory of anti+truths ... )

Final Thoughts
Call it what you want ; a unicorn , purple elephant or any number of cliches .
This industry is full of them ; the promise of photo realistic gaming , systems that boot in seconds and products like what we are talking about today , card based solid - state storage .
All of these features are on the five year plan ; in five years we will see how close we are to achieving them , all but one .
Fusion - io calls their card based solid - state storage technology ioMemory .
It is a catchy name that goes along with the products name , ioDrive .
The ioDrive uses NAND flash memory , just like the solid - state drives we have been reviewing for the last year .
The difference is that everything we have looked at so far connects to a SATA port and the ioDrive rides the fast lane , 10 GB / s to be exact from a 4 - lane PCIe slot .
If you think it sounds fast , just hang tight , there is a lot to cover before we get to the benchmarks .
Normally products like the Fusion - io ioDrive are not reviewed on general purpose computing review sites like TweakTown .
In 2009 we will start to cover more products in the enterprise market and run them in parallel with our usual content .
Behind the scenes the US office has been covering enterprise storage products for many years , but most of this testing has been for private reports and for our own twisted amusement .
DVNation , the webs leading Solid - State Storage e-tailer and one of TweakTown 's suppliers offered me the opportunity to test the ioDrive under NDA .
The whole thing started out like an unsolicited offer of contraband at a Grateful Dead show , " Fusion - io ioDrive , follow me . "
It is difficult to turn down such bliss ; my only reply was " dose me please .
"
It was n't until after testing that the review portion of the evaluation materialized .
As stated previously , high - end server products generally do not make it to review sites and any product testing is performed by private laboratories .
In this market even product pricing is kept close to the cuff .
Sometimes even distributers are asked to refer inquiring minds to official company sales staff .
Fusion - io and DVNation have really gone out on a limb to allow us an exclusive first look at their ioDrive .
For that we are thankful , but as always , we only report our findings ; the good , bad and ugly .
Let 's go ahead and knock a few limitations out before we get started with the specifications .
The first thing is that the ioDrive is designed for server workloads where high IO 's are required .
Database and web servers are about as general as it gets , but any application where very fast read and write operations are required will see a significant speed increase .
Do n't get me wrong , everything on the ioDrive will load faster , with near nonexistent latency , but the card is designed and optimized for server applications .
However , there is nothing keeping you from loading up a friendly game of Crysis and watching your load screen pass by like a fresh Ferrari in the hands of a new owner on an open desert highway in Nevada .
At this time you can't boot to the ioDrive , but the feature is in development and showing promise in the labs .
A version of the drive is also in development that is meant for general purpose computing , for those who can afford it .
I wo n't speculate when we will see such a drive or at what cost , but I am sure DVNation will be one of the first places to carry the product and we will no doubt be one of the first to take a look .
At this time the ioDrive is a 64 - bit operating system - only product .
I personally do n't see this as a limitation and welcome the fact that a product is designed from the ground up to operate in a 64 - bit environment as opposed to migrating from 32 - bit to 64 - bit .
There are several 64 - bit operating systems ; these range from Linux to a half dozen or so from Microsoft .
We have already moved our disk drive and enterprise product test bench over to Vista 64 - bit , so the ioDrive was a true plug and play solution .
Fusion - io makes three variants of the ioDrive with the main difference being capacity .
Today we will be looking at the smallest version , the 80 GB model .
There are a few other small differences between the three cards .
The 160 GB model has a claimed write speed increase of 50 MB/s , bringing the total write speed to 600 MB/s .
The 320 GB model uses MLC memory , this brings its write speed down to 500 MB/s , but the read speed remains the same across all three products at 700 MB/s .
For now we will focus on the 80 GB model that was tested in house .
For more information on the other products , please take a look at Fusion - io 's official product page here
The ioDrive uses 4 - PCIe lanes with a physical 4 - lane connector .
The drive can plug into four , eight and 16 lane PCIe slots , but only four lanes will be used .
One feature that I found intriguing was the brief mention of RAID capability .
There are several motherboards , especially in the server and workstation market with up to six PCIe 16 x slots .
Before you start dreaming of a five drive RAID 5 array , there is one more thing that should be discussed .
The official MSRP for the 80GB ioDrive is 2995.00 and this goes all the way up to 14,400 US Dollars for the 320 GB model .
We were told that purchasing in volume will decrease the cost of ownership .
Enterprise products are not known for fancy packaging , but I was actually pleasantly surprised to see that Fusion - io did not follow the typical brown box solution that is common for these types of products .
Package contents and system requirements are listed on the side of the package .
This must have been an early package because Windows is not listed .
Inside the box the card is wrapped in an antistatic bag with two pieces of pink foam above and below the card .
The ioDrive is made in two halves , the first with the PCIe data connection and power circuitry .
The second part holds the memory modules and controller chip that is passively cooled .
There is not much going on along the back of the card other than a lot of NAND memory .
The back side of the card is fairly straight forward as well .
The LEDs show the status of the drive .
Our sample used Samsung memory that was double stacked .
As you saw in the previous images , there are quite a few memory chips onboard .
If you look closely you can see that for every visible memory module there is another under it . : AMD Opteron 2356 ( 2.3GHz Quad - Core ) x2 : Tyan S2915 - E ( Supplied by Tyan : Kingston KVR667D2S4P5/2G x4 ( Supplied by Kingston : XFX 8800 GTX ( Supplied by XFX USA : Lian Li V2000 : Noctua NH - U12DO ( Supplied by Noctua : Areca ARC - 1231 ML ( Supplied by Areca : Areca ARC - 1680 i ( Supplied by Areca : Microsoft Windows Vista Ultimate X64
The fastest SSD I reviewed to date is the Intel X25 - M so it will be used to compare against the io - Drive .
The fastest traditional , platter based drive available on the market is the Seagate 15K.6 ( review coming shortly ) .
The Intel X25 - M is currently available for around 600 Dollars .
At the time of testing I only had one available , so running RAID was not an option .
For the platter side I have eight Seagate 15K.6 drives that have been ran through various RAID configurations .
Each 15K.6 drive sells for around 800 USD and the Areca controller adds another 1000 USD , so the total cost of the 8 drive array is in the neighborhood of 7400 .
The Fusion - io ioDrive as tested today is 2995 USD .
There is still the issue of capacity .
The Intel and Fusion - io are both 80 GB , but the Seagate array with 8 450 GB drives is quite a bit larger .
It might be a little hard to swallow , but in the server world it is not uncommon to find large arrays with only a few gigabytes of data on the platters .
This is especially true when it comes to database servers where the data is kept on the fastest part of the drive to keep I / O high .
It should also be mentioned that this test was performed several months ago and at the time the drivers were in beta form .
A newer set was later submitted to Microsoft for WHQL Certification .3.00 HD
Tune is a Hard Disk utility which has the following functions :- Benchmark : measures the performance - Info : shows detailed information - Health : checks the health status by using SMART - Error Scan : scans the surface for errors - Temperature displayHD Tune Pro gives us accurate read , write and access time results and for the last couple of years has been gaining popularity amongst reviewers .
It is now considered a must have application for storage device testing .
When it comes to pure read speed , the Seagate drives are able to outpace the ioDrive .
If you think back to the Crucial SLC SSD review from two months ago , HD Tune is n't a very good judge of character when it comes to server loads .
The Write test shows that all of the products lose a bit of performance when compared to the Read test speeds .
4.60 Everest Ultimate and Corporate Edition offer several different benchmarks for testing and optimizing your system or network .
The Random Access test is one of very few if not only that will measure hard drives random access times in hundredths of milliseconds as oppose to tens of milliseconds .
Solid State Drives obliterate platter based drives when it comes to access times and the Intel X25 - M is very fast .
The Fusion - io ioDrive is quite a bit quicker , though .
Here we see that the ioDrive is actually three times faster than the Intel SSD .
The Areca controller gives the Seagate 15K.6 drives a little bit better performance than is actually possible .
Many of the requests are being answered by the controller 's cache and not from the drives directly .
Even with the extra help , the ioDrive still outperforms the Seagate drives and the Intel X25 - M. Let 's see how all of these synthetic benchmarks relate to real world applications .
1.0.0 PCMark Vantage is the first objective hardware performance benchmark for PCs running 32 and 64 bit versions of Microsoft Windows Vista .
PCMark Vantage is perfectly suited for benchmarking any type of Microsoft Windows Vista PC from multimedia home entertainment systems and laptops to dedicated workstations and high - end gaming rigs .
Regardless of whether the benchmarker is an artist or an IT Professional , PCMark Vantage shows the user where their system soars or falls flat , and how to get the most performance possible out of their hardware .
PCMark Vantage is easy enough for even the most casual enthusiast to use yet supports in - depth , professional industry grade testing .
FutureMark has developed a good set of hard disk tests for their PCMark Vantage Suite .
These tests are based on real world applications that many of us use daily .
HDD1 - Windows DefenderHDD2 - GamingHDD3 - Windows Photo GalleryHDD4 - Vista StartupHDD5 - Windows Movie MakerHDD6 - Windows Media CenterHDD7 - Windows Media PlayerHDD8 - Application LoadingI love breaking world records and that is exactly what I was able to do with the PCmark Vantage HD Test .
The total score was 80,997 , a new world record ! -
The next best score on the ORB is a mere 57,118 with an unknown RAID array running on an Areca controller .
The ioDrive clearly outperforms the fastest RAID arrays available on the market , at least in the enthusiast market that tests with PCMark Vantage , so millions of users .
Granted , many of the tests performed in PCMark Vantage will never be run on the server ioDrive , but the follow up drive built for the consumer market will .
Let 's now have a look at the server workloads .
6.1 Many users complain that I /O Meter is too complicated of a benchmark to replicate results so my quest to find an alternative was started .
Passmark has added several multi-user tests that measure a hard drives ability to operate in a multi-user environment .
The tests use different settings to mimic basic multi-user operations as they would play out on your server .
Variances in read / write percentage as well as random / sequential reads are common in certain applications .
Web Servers read nearly 100 % of the time while Database Servers write a small amount of data .
The Workstation test is the only single user environment and will be similar to how you use your system at home .
Of all the tests performed , this is the only set that matters to those looking for this type of product .
It is really pretty amazing to think that an operation could load eight 15,000 RPM drives so much that they are only able to move 10 MB/s .
There is one test that gives the Seagate drives hope of challenging the ioDrive , but running RAID 0 with eight drives is unrealistic for mission critical tasks .
Once removed from fantasy land , the Fusion - io ioDrive looks even better .
The ioDrive performed three times faster than the Seagate drives in RAID 5 and six times faster than RAID 6 .
In the Workstation , File and Web Sever tests the margin grows considerably .
The Web and File Server test results are amazing .
There are a few things that we have not covered which should be addressed .
The first is power consumption .
Testing power consumption has never been high on my list of tests for consumer products , but now that TweakTown is moving into high performance computing products , I will need to add this test since in the data center power is just as important as performance .
Many are now monitoring and charging an extra fee for additional power consumption over a set limit .
Even without hard numbers , a single Fusion - io ioDrive is clearly going to draw less power than an Areca SAS RAID Controller and eight 15K.6 , 15,000 RPM drives .
When the first press releases started coming out from Fusion - io , their big tag line was " The power of 1000 hard drives in the palm of your hand . "
I think 1000 may have been a bit of a stretch , even close to two years ago when the first release went out .
Still , when it comes to the competition it may as well be 1000 , because the important part of that is the size .
When it comes to servers , size matters ; 1.75 inches at a time .
1.75 inches is how tall a single Rack Unit ( U ) server is .
I have seen 1U servers capable of holding four full size hard drives , but to hold eight you need to flip the drives around on end .
In most cases , to fit eight drives you will need a 4U server .
If a company rents rack space in a data center then going from 1U to 4U is a big deal since you are renting space by the unit .
Moving down to the other end of the spectrum , you can easily fit two ioDrives in a single 1U enclosure .
Once you calculate the low power consumption with the small size , it is easy to see how advanced the Fusion - io really is .
Even if the ioDrive performed at the same level as the traditional platter drives , it would still be a remarkable product .
The thing is that the ioDrive does not perform at the same level of the fastest platter drives ; it outperforms them by a very large margin .
When it comes to actual server load performance the benchmark numbers are crystal clear .
The ioDrive is the fastest drive we have tested , faster than the best solid state SATA II drive and faster than the best enterprise 15,000 RPM drive in an 8 drive RAID configuration .
There are still a few items that may worry admins .
The first is that the overall technology is very new and in the enterprise world tried and true is the norm .
This will undoubtedly hold a few prospective buyers back in the short term .
Over time the technology and Fusion - io will be able to claim design wins and the market will warm up to the ioDrive .
Price verses performance is a no brainer at this point .
DVNation now stocks the 80GB ioDrive that we looked at today for 2995.00 USD with discounts on volume sales .
For the same amount you may be able to purchase a nice SAS RAID controller and three fast enterprise class drives , but since eight drives are no match for the ioDrive , imagine what a comparison of a three drive array would look like .
Since there are no moving parts or " sweet spots " like with the platter drives , you get a full 80 GB of high speed capacity with the Fusion - io ioDrive .
The Areca controller we use for testing SAS drives does a good job of leveling the sweet spot off , but a good enough job is far from the best in this case .
If you need more space than 80GB , Fusion - io has a 160 and 320 drive available now and a massive 640 also on the way .
This is a scary chart ...
Click on graph for larger image in new window .
This graph shows the combined loaded inbound and outbound traffic at the ports of Long Beach and Los Angeles in TEUs ( TEUs : 20 - foot equivalent units or 20 - foot - long cargo container ) .
Although containers tell us nothing about value , container traffic does give us an idea of the volume of goods being exported and imported .
Inbound traffic has peaked for the year as retailers have already imported most of the goods for the holiday season .
Inbound traffic was 11 % below last November .
This slowdown in exports ( inbound traffic to the U.S. ) is hitting Asian countries hard .
But even more concerning for the U.S. is that export traffic is declining sharply .
For the LA area ports , outbound traffic continued to decline in November , and was 18 % below the level of November 2007 .
Export traffic is now at about the same level as in late 2006 .
So much for the export boom !
The key supports for the economy earlier this year - consumer spending , exports , and investment in non-residential structures - are all declining sharply now .
A Bostonian is suing HP and Staples for colluding to inflate the price of printer ink .
According to the suit , filed by Ranjit Nedi , Staples took a $ 100 million hint from HP not to stock cheap generic competition to its $ 8,000 - a - gallon juice .
Everyone knows that printer ink is a swindle : they sell you the printer cheaply ( or not so cheaply for higher - end prosumer models ) , then sell the colors — unremarkable commodities , let us not forget —
at prices that would make a perfumer blush .
As the inks are commodities , however , they have to take measures to stop you simply refilling the cartridges .
Circumnavigating even trivial technological locks potentially runs foul of the Digital
Millenium Copyright Act , and printers are also designed to deliberately and unecessarily waste ink .
Nedi's submission suggests an even more aggressive tack was taken : the outright bribing of retailers .
There 's not a lot you can do except wait for the inevitable application for class action status .
Then we can all help deliver a slow - motion kick to the corporate shin that will take years to unravel .

The Alaska governor 's daughter and boyfriend Levi Johnston are proud new parents
Bristol Palin , the 18 - year - old daughter of former Republican vice - presidential candidate Sarah Palin , gave birth on Saturday to a healthy 7 lb. , 7 oz. , baby boy in Palmer , Alaska .
“ We think it ’s wonderful , ” said Colleen Jones , the sister of Bristol ’s grandmother Sally Heath , who confirmed the news .
“ The baby is fine and Bristol is doing well .
Everyone is excited . ”
Get push notifications with news , features and more .
The baby ’s name is Tripp Easton Mitchell Johnston and he was born at 5:30 a.m. , according to Jones .
Baby Tripp takes his surname from his dad , Levi Johnston , an apprentice electrician and former Wasilla High School hockey player who has been dating Bristol for three years .
Bristol Palin is currently residing in Wasilla and completing her high - school diploma through correspondence courses .
Johnston is studying to become an electrician .
He told the Associated Press in October that he and fiancée Bristol plan to wed in 2009 and raise the child together .
Pregnancy Made News
Bristol , the eldest of Sarah and Todd Palin ’s three daughters ( the couple also have two sons ) , made headlines with her pregnancy last summer , shortly after Republican presidential candidate John McCain picked the Alaska governor to be his running mate on his party ’s ticket .
In a statement at the time , Bristol s parents said their daughter “ came to us with news that we as parents knew would make her grow up faster than we had ever planned . ”
They added , Bristol “ has our unconditional love and support . ”
On Monday , Bill McAllister , a spokesman for Gov. Palin said , “ This office will not be issuing any statements on [ Bristol ’s baby ] .
We re here to talk about state government and that matter falls outside of that . ”
The Small Sister open - source privacy project has released a first beta of its SmallMail application , allowing individuals to send email messages that can't be intercepted or traced by governments or snoops .
SmallMail hides the content of email headers when messages are transferred across the Internet by encrypting that data .
Because the information can't be traced , security agencies are unable to determine where a message originates and where it is heading .
The project was founded by a group of five Dutch developers and is headed up by Brenno de Winter , an IT journalist specializing in security and privacy matters .
The NLNet foundation is sponsoring the project through a € 25 euro ( US$ 35 ) donation .
Small Sister is the first public project offering anonymous email , De Winter claimed in an interview with Webwereld , an IDG affiliate .
Current technologies only allow users to encrypt the body of a message , but fail to hide a message 's headers from snooping .
Little Sister relies on Tor , a service that facilitates anonymous Web browsing .
The service routes Internet traffic across a series of routers across the world while scrubbing all information that can be traced back to the recipient .
Government agencies trying to trace a Tor user will lose the trail as soon as the enter the Tor network .
Although it is possible to send e-mail through
Tor today , in those cases the message itself is n't encrypted .
SmallMail marks the first application that uses
Tor in combination with encryption while aiming to do so in a way that does n't require advanced computer skills .
Because traffic is rerouted through a series of hubs , the delivery of a message will be delayed , taking about three minutes before delivery .
Sending messages through SmallMail requires both the sender and recipient to install special client software , as well as switch to a special mail server .
The project currently offers one such server for public use , and individual users can set up their own server .
De Winter expects that in the future servers will be set up in redundant networks .
SmallMail is a direct response to European data retention legislation , which requires authorities to store email traffic and call log data for a period of six months .
The reporter claims that the legislation is a severe threat to investigative journalism , because authorities could use the logs to trace down whistle blowers .
In addition to the privacy conscious , De Winter argues that the application could appeal to corporations and government bodies that need a secure way to exchange messages .
Terrorists and criminals too could use the tool , he admits .
" But unfortunately terrorists already have comparable tools of their own .
You can use this both for good as well as for to do harm . "
SmallMail is currently in beta and has been tested for Linux Ubuntu only .
The project is looking for volunteers to port the open source application , which is written in Python , over to Windows and Apple 's Mac OS X .

The market rallied on news that the government was going to buy mortgage backed securities which ironically is something it already said it was going to do .
Great .
However the caveat is the securities have to be fixed agency debt ; that is , little help is provided to the ticking time bomb of pay option ARM mortgages which will engulf the country in the next few years .

This perception is correct given that the unemployment numbers are looking worse and worse as each monthly number is dished out .
Why ?
The unemployment rate usually peaks months into an equity correction .
And for most Americans , employment is the number one sign of a healthy economy .
Was November 20th the bottom or only a head fake of things to come ?
Even some areas in Los Angeles County are seeing zip codes coming in with five - figure prices .
Maybe a stunner for some but many have geared up for this kind of massive price destruction .
The bubble is in full burst mode .
Keep in mind historically December is kind to the markets but not this time .
Santa put a piece of coal in the stocking of most investment portfolios .
It is astounding that after all the money being hurled to banks and Wall Street institutions like NFL deep routes , not much has improved .
Sure some crony capitalist are now off with nice severance packages but nothing has improved for the lot of most Americans .
The housing market is still tanking .
Sticking money into your mattress would have outperformed the stock markets of the globe !
And to top it off we are now hearing echoes of a shopping tax - free holiday .
Was n’t it shopping for big homes , big cars , and big TVs that got us here in the first place ?
Case - Shiller 28 Months Down
* Click for sharper image
The number 28 may hold significance to you .
It is the atomic number of nickel , a lunar month is roughly 28 days , and there are 28 dominoes in a standard set .
Or it can also mean the number of months the Case - Shiller 20 - City Composite Index has fallen .
That is right , the overall index is now down for 28 straight months .
Yet we still have people in the mainstream media with the gall to call for a housing bottom .
How about we first have at least a few up months before we even start discussing any bottom ?
With the above chart I have also added the LA and Phoenix metro areas .
As you can see with Phoenix , the drop is almost a perfect vertical .
The correction has been so stiff that Phoenix is quickly approaching a trend line .
Los Angeles with a higher peak is still over priced and with 10 other reasons for a long - term housing correction , we are years away from a bottom in the state .
2008 has been the worst housing market on record .
With the employment picture deteriorating , why are we to believe housing will stabilize anytime soon ?

Take a long look at the above chart .
2008 has been horrific for global equity markets even after every imaginable government intervention known to humankind has been tossed at them .
We bailed out banks , insurers , nationalized our mortgage giants , and even gave a tiny helping hand to domestic automakers .
Even with this , global markets had one of their worst years on records .
Here is the real irony .
Ben Bernanke and Hank Paulson are determined to annihilate the U.S. Dollar .
Why ?
Simple .
It is the only mathematical way we will ever work our way out of our massive debt .
Every action they have taken is inflationary although the market in the short - term is reacting with deflation .
The reason for this is you ca n’t force people to load up with more debt .
They are already maxed out .
Yet the one enemy of Bernanke and Paulson , the U.S. Dollar is one of the few areas up for the year !
Bwahahahaha !
How long this will last is unknown .
I assure you if you asked Americans if they are comfortable with a government policy that destroyed the U.S. Dollar ’s value across the globe they would be in an uproar .
Yet I ’m not sure how many people are aware that the policies currently being taken are direct affronts to our own currency .
Another curiosity is gold is up for the year .
Even after the massive fall earlier in the year , this is another glowing area .
People are fleeing to perceived safety .
This happens in all bubbles after they burst and the U.S. Dollar still has this reputation .
Give Bernanke another year and I ’m sure things will be different .
Shopping Tax Free Holiday
I stand by my assertion of the Super Ignorant Investment Vehicle SIIV – each subsequent bailout is progressively dumber than the previous one .
The new idea making the rounds is being put out by the National Retail Federation ( NRF ) , which is a sales tax holiday .
This fantastic idea is another knee - jerk reaction just like every other bailout we have seen .
First , spending and “ shopping ” is a reason we are in this mess .
As a country , we need to focus on production and move away from spending ourselves into oblivion .
Next , if any thought went into this they would realize that many states rely on sales taxes for revenues .
States like , oh , I do n’t know , California :
27 percent of California ’s revenue comes from sales taxes .
The state can barely stay afloat as it is and we are talking about removing one of the biggest line items for a few days ?
Brilliant ideas once again !
You ’ll love the wording in the letter :
“ We urge you to act quickly on legislation to help stimulate consumer spending as one of the first priorities of your new administration , ” the NRF said in the letter .
“ To be effective , any fiscal stimulus package must be enacted with great speed .
It must be substantial .
And it must be sustained .
To accomplish this , the plan must include a longer - term investment designed to produce sustained economic growth through job creation as well as short - term economic stimulus aimed at increasing consumer spending . ”
Do n’t you love how they sneak in consumer spending a couple of times into the letter ?
Who is going to argue with job growth ?
Or sustained economic growth ?
Yet what in the world does encouraging debt strapped Americans to spend more have to do with job growth or sustained economic growth ?
It does n’t .
Another fabulous idea that goes into the SIIV .

WARNING : This is not a recommendation to buy , sell or hold any financial instrument .
Oil is decoupling from the dollar now , to the downside .
Gold is up sharply , the dollar is down sharply , oil is down sharply .
I do n’t think there was any doubt about it before , but people are definitely moving their paper based wealth into gold in larger numbers than at any point in recent memory .
To me , anyway , oil and the dollar declining together , with gold rising , indicates that we are entering a new phase of collapse .
I ’m sure that someone can / will point to historical stats about when this has happened in the past , but taken together with everything else that ’s happening , my guess is that this decoupling is different and a pretty significant event in terms of signaling a profound slowdown in economic activity .
I thought that oil would bounce in the $ 45 to $ 50 zone and continue to move opposite to the dollar , as it usually does .
I was wrong , at lease over the last few days .
The demand destruction caused by the economic collapse is overwhelming longs here , despite the wreckage on the dollar .
But that might not be it !
There have been some rumors floating around ( literally ) that oil producers have been storing oil on the ships at sea , waiting for a bounce in crude prices …
Maybe this is true , maybe the speculators know it and maybe they ’re bringing their boots down upon the necks of the oil producers .
I mean , how much oil can be stored on ships until it does n’t make economic sense anymore and they have to begin releasing it into the marketplace ???
When I initially read that tanker theory , I thought , “ What a pile of steaming BS . ” Well …
Oil was much higher then .
[ UPDATE ]
I went back to find the original source of this tanker - storage information , but I could n’t .
In the process of searching , though , it turns out that there ’s a Bloomberg story from yesterday about it .
Get this :
Right now , more oil is being stored on ships at sea than at any time in the last twenty years !
From Bloomberg :
Oil companies booked 25 supertankers to store crude , enough to supply France for almost a month , as OPEC discusses output cuts to shore up prices that have plunged 69 percent in five months .
The supertankers , equal to about 5 percent of the global fleet , can carry as much as 50 million barrels .
The ships may not all be fully loaded , Jens Martin Jensen , interim chief executive officer of Frontline Ltd. ’s management unit , said by phone today .
The Bermuda - based company is the biggest supertanker owner .
…
Storage costs on tankers remain at about 90 cents a barrel a month depending on the length of the contract , Charlie Fowle , a director at London - based shipbroker Galbraith ’s Ltd. , said in an e-mailed note today .
Twenty - five tankers used for storage would probably be the largest number for at least 20 years , Fowle said .
I ’m definitely NOT saying that this is going to occur , because I have no possible way of knowing , but if some kind of attack or incident happens that suddenly gaps the price of oil back up , make sure that you have this post bookmarked .
Via : Bloomberg :
Oil fell below $ 40 a barrel for the first time in more than four years as OPEC failed to convince traders that the glut in crude will diminish and the U.S. government said supplies climbed for the 11th time in 12 weeks .
The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries agreed that the group ’s 11 members with quotas will trim current production by 2.46 million barrels a day to 24.845 million barrels a day , OPEC president Chakib Khelil said in Oran , Algeria .
OPEC has held four meetings in as many months in an attempt to stem the slide in prices .
“ It ’s less than meets the eye , ” said Lawrence Eagles , global head of commodities research at JPMorgan Chase & Co. in New York .
“ This may stem the bloating in stocks but is n’t enough to get rid of the surplus . ”
Crude oil for January delivery declined $ 3.54 , or 8.1 percent , to $ 40.06 a barrel at 2:47 p.m. on the New York Mercantile Exchange , the lowest settlement since July 13 , 2004 .
Futures touched $ 39.88 during trading today .
Prices have tumbled 73 percent from a record $ 147.27 on July 11 .
Inventories rose 525,000 barrels to 321.3 million barrels last week , the U.S. Energy Department said today in a weekly report .
Supplies have climbed 11 percent since Sept. 19 .
“ They are facing the distinct possibility of oil falling to $ 30 a barrel and even lower , ” said Addison Armstrong , director of market research for Tradition Energy in Stamford , Connecticut .
“ They have to bring supply down further because they are n’t getting any help on the demand front until the second half of next year at the earliest . ”
The cut is larger than a 2 million - barrel reduction indicated yesterday by Saudi Arabian Oil Minister Ali al - Naimi .
OPEC ’s Compliance
OPEC ’s rate of compliance with a previous output cut is more than 85 percent , al - Naimi told reporters today before the ministerial meeting that decided production targets .
“ The market gave every signal that there had to be an additional cut of at least 2.5 million barrels if OPEC expected to bolster prices , ” Armstrong said .
“ There is such a lack of trust when it comes to compliance that it was impossible to agree to what was needed .
This lack of trust gives members every incentive to cheat on quotas . ”
Russia cut oil exports by 350,000 barrels a day last month and may reduce supply a further 320,000 barrels a day next year , in collaboration with OPEC , if prices remain weak , Russian Deputy Prime Minister Igor Sechin told OPEC ministers during opening speeches at today ’s meeting .
Other non-OPEC producers , including Kazakhstan , may trim production as well , Sechin said .
Other Producers
Azerbaijan may lower production as much as 300,000 barrels a day , Energy Minister Natig Aliyev said in Oran .
BP Plc and partners shut two platforms at the Central and West Azeri fields in the Caspian Sea following a gas leak on Sept. 17 .
“ Russia will be offering the 300,000 - to - 400,000 - barrel cut that ’s already under way , ” Eagles said .
It may be a sign that disruptions in Azerbaijan are “ going to last a bit longer than they previously thought . ”
OPEC will next meet on March 15 in Vienna and has chosen Angolan Oil Minister Jose Maris Botelho de Vasconcelos as its president for 2009 .
“ I think the jury should still be out , ” said Sarah Emerson , managing director of Energy Security Analysis Inc. , a consulting firm in Wakefield , Massachusetts .
“ We will have to see their compliance .
If they come close to their objective , we believe they will forestall a further decline in prices . ”
Brent crude oil for February settlement declined $ 1.12 , or 2.4 percent , to close at $ 45.53 a barrel on London ’s ICE Futures Europe exchange .
U.S. gasoline inventories rose 1.3 million barrels to 204 million barrels in the week ended Dec. 12 , the Energy Department report showed .
Supplies of distillate fuel , a category that includes heating oil and diesel , climbed 2.94 million barrels to 133.5 million barrels , the highest since November 2007 .
‘ Nothing Bullish ’
“ There is nothing bullish in these numbers , ” said Nauman Barakat , senior vice president of global energy futures at Macquarie Futures USA Inc. in New York .
“ The OPEC announcement looks big on first glance but really is n’t .
They are playing with smoke and mirrors . ”
Inventories have gained because the oil market is in contango , where crude for future delivery is more expensive than near - month prices , encouraging stockpile increases .
Supplies at Cushing , Oklahoma , where oil that ’s traded in New York is stored , climbed 21 percent to 27.5 million barrels , the highest since May 2007 .
“ The big build at Cushing shows that in a contango market everyone who can is taking delivery , which makes it much more difficult for OPEC to hold it together , ” Barakat said .
Tumbling Demand
U.S. fuel demand in November dropped 7.4 percent from a year earlier to the lowest for the month since 1998 , the industry - funded American Petroleum Institute said in a report today .
Volume in electronic trading on the exchange was 578,537 contracts , as of 2:57 p.m. in New York .
Volume totaled 593,607 contracts yesterday , up 17 percent from the average over the past 3 months .
Open interest yesterday was 1.17 million contracts .
The exchange has a one - day delay in reporting open interest and full volume data .

Casual sex , excess drinking and drug use are routine for many foreigners working in Moscow , but a female lawyer with a top British firm has landed herself in hot water for publishing what appear to be her diaries online .
Expat , an erotic novel , is written by Deidre Dare , an American in her forties who works as a senior lawyer for the top British law firm Allen & Overy in the Russian capital .
The novel is posted on her website , along with shots of the lawyer in her lingerie and a series of raunchy poems .
" There is something thrilling about being in bed with a German , even if he does have a tendency to make uninteresting small talk .
( ' Do you think it will be cold tomorrow ?
If so , should I wear two pairs of socks ? ' )
' Oh , yeah , Baby , ' I thought , as Patrick gently kissed my eyelids and stroked my face , " she writes .
" I sighed as if in pleasure , when , really , my mind was occupied with the thought that it is disappointing how the Germans are really some of the most boring people on Earth . "
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
It continues in much the same vein for 11 chapters , and then ends abruptly with a note : " The author has been forbidden from publishing further chapters of Expat for the time being .
She will resume if and when she is permitted to . "
When contacted by The Independent , Ms Dare said that she had been instructed by her lawyers to give no comment .
A source close to her said that she was worried she may lose her job soon due to the scandal .
However , she has received hundreds of emails from admirers of her website , including one European businessman who offered her € 20,000 ( £ 18,000 ) to take her to dinner .
Each chapter of Expat contains reflections on Moscow life , lots of " gentle hair stroking " , and at least one sex scene .
Her website also contains a poetry section , featuring verses which are often more ridiculous than erotic .
The novel comes with a disclaimer that all the events and characters are fictional .
However , many people on the expat law scene said that they recognised incidents and characters in the text .
" What on earth does she think she 's doing ? " said a British lawyer working for a different Moscow firm .
" It 's absolutely insane to be posting this stuff online .
Her bosses must be furious .
I would be amazed if she does n't get fired . "
The company said it did not comment on individual members of staff .
" With regards to our general policies on staff conduct Allen & Overy aims to uphold the highest standards of professional conduct .
Everyone at Allen & Overy is expected to conduct themselves appropriately and professionally at all times . "
According to an information pamphlet on Allen & Overy 's website , " Deidre is an international finance and projects lawyer who has represented diverse clients involved in financings , equipment leasing and projects around the world . "
Global demand for Japanese products has plunged Japan 's biggest carmaker Toyota has forecast its first annual loss in 71 years due to plummeting sales and a surge in the value of the yen .
The firm said it expected a loss of 150bn yen ( £ 1.1 bn ) in yearly operating profits - from its core operations .
Company chief Katsuaki Watanabe said the current downturn was of a size that came only " once in a hundred years " .
Japan posted a trade deficit in November of $ 2.5 bn ( £ 1.7bn ) as exports fell at a record rate .
The rising yen saw export levels down 26.7 % from a year earlier , the ministry of finance said .
The carmaker had recorded an operating profit of 2.27 trillion yen last year .
Toyota said it still expected to make a profit on a net level for the year ended March but has cut its forecast sharply to 50bn yen , down from a previous estimate of 550bn yen .
It is the second profit warning by Toyota in less than seven weeks .
This latest estimate is far lower than its net profit of 1.7 trillion yen earned the previous year .
Falling sales
The change that has hit the world economy is of a critical scale that comes once in a hundred years
Katsuaki Watanabe , Toyota president
Living with recession Toyota 's president Katsuaki Watanabe said the company now expected to sell 8.96 million vehicles around the world this year , down 4 % from the previous year .
The drop in vehicle sales over the last month was " far faster , wider and deeper than expected " , he said .
Unlike previous years , Mr Watanabe gave no sales goal for 2009 .
Toyota said in a statement it was cutting its profits forecast because of the soaring yen " as well as a review of sales plans following a faster than expected contraction of the auto market " .
The company has said it will cut thousands of temporary workers ' jobs at its plants in Japan , but said its full - time employees will be protected .
Japanese carmakers have all been hurt by plummeting car sales in their key overseas markets , including the US .
The surging yen has eroded their overseas earnings and also hit their profits - the dollar has fallen to 13 - year lows against the Japanese currency .
Honda last week cut its annual profit forecast by 67 % and outlined a list of counter - measures such as putting off non-urgent investments to prop up its profitability .
Deteriorating sector
In the United States , President Bush threw the struggling carmakers General Motors and Chrysler a lifeline of up to $ 17.4 bn to stave off bankruptcy as they reel under slumping demand .
Commenting on Toyota 's latest announcement , analysts said it underlined the problems now facing Japan 's car exporters .
HAVE YOUR SAY
If people want to buy their cars it will survive if not it will fail just the same as every non-viable business .
Freda , Newcastle " This is very , very , very bad .
There 's a chance that they could fall into the red in the next business year as well , " said Koichi Ogawa of Daiwa SB Investments .
" This is also not just a problem for Toyota .
What is good for Toyota is good for the Japanese economy . "
Fujio Ando of Chibagin Asset Management added : " This shows how rapidly and badly the auto sector has deteriorated . "
" Toyota will likely revise down its earnings numbers or sales forecast again in late January or February as I do n't think the business environment will become any better , " he said .
Output slashed Japan typically runs a trade surplus due to strong demand for its products - but the surging yen has hit demand for its goods .
Japanese exports fell sharply to all areas but those to the US were worst - hit , plunging 33.8 % - also a record drop .
Shipments to the European Union were down 30.8 % while those to China fell 24.5 % , the biggest fall since 1995 , said Reuters news agency .
Exports to the rest of Asia declined 26.7 % .
Imports were also down - 14.4 % overall - due in part to lower oil prices .
Japan 's economy - the world 's second - largest , after the US - has slipped into its first recession in seven years after two quarters of negative growth in a row .
The government has forecast zero growth in the year ending March 2010 .

Opinion concerning " anymore " vs " any more " divides roughly into three camps :
There is no such word as " anymore " .
It is simply a misspelling .
" Anymore " and " any more " are two ways of spelling the same thing , and the two have the same meaning .
There is a useful difference in meaning between the two .
About the first two camps , little more needs to be said .
Either statement stands on its own and needs no elaboration .
The difference in meaning considered useful by the third camp is that " anymore " is an adverb meaning " nowadays " or " any longer " , while " any more " can be either adverb plus adjective , as in " I do n't want any more pie " , or adjective plus noun , as in " I do n't want any more . "
The difference between the two meanings is illustrated in the sentence : " I do n't buy books anymore because I do n't need any more books . "
The distinction of " any more " and " anymore " seems to be recognized by many , but not all , US users and by dictionaries published in the US .
At least one British dictionary ( NSOED /93 ) and some British users recognize " anymore " as an alternative spelling of " any more " , but do not recognize a difference in meaning .
The adverb " anymore " is standard American English when it is used in a negative sense , as in " I do n't do that anymore . "
It is a regional or dialectal usage , mostly restricted to spoken English , when it is used in a positive sense , meaning " nowadays " , as in " Anymore I do that " or " I do that anymore . "
Murray Gell - Mann on “ Thinking About the Future — The Big Picture ”
Distinguished Lecture Series
September 27 , 2005
Nobel Laureate Prof. Murray Gell - Mann , the 2004–2005 Pardee Visiting Professor of Future Studies at the Pardee Center for the Study of the Longer - Range Future , would like to see the integration of thinking in science and in policy .
Yet he describes his talk as “ a crude look at the whole , ” as a way of acknowledging the difficulty of making an integrative study work .
Gell - Mann says global problems cannot be considered in isolation , and he wonders about the best ways to separate environmental issues from those involving population growth .
Integrative thinking is the focus of the Sante Fe Institute , which Gell - Mann founded .
He also discusses the ways in which a sustainable future can be envisioned , warning , “ We have to get rid of the idea that careful study of a problem in some narrow range of issues is the only kind of work to be taken seriously , while integrative thinking is relegated to cocktail party conversation . ”
Video length is 01:27:00 .
About the Speaker
Murray Gell - Mann , who was the 2002 –2003 as well as the 2004–2005 Pardee Visiting Professor of Future Studies , is a Distinguished Fellow of the Santa Fe Institute and the author of the popular science book The Quark and the Jaguar : Adventures in the Simple and the Complex .
In 1969 , Gell - Mann was awarded the Nobel Prize in physics for his work on the theory of elementary particles .
He and others later constructed the quantum field theory of quarks and gluons , called quantum chromodynamics , which seems to account for all the nuclear particles and their strong interactions .
Gell - Mann is the recipient of numerous awards and honorary degrees .
Although a theoretical physicist , his interests extend to many other subjects , including natural history , historical linguistics , archaeology , history , depth psychology , and creative thinking , all subjects connected with biological evolution , cultural evolution , and learning and thinking .
His scientific work is influenced by his concern about policy matters related to world environmental quality ( including conservation of biological diversity ) , restraint in population growth , sustainable economic development , and stability of the world political system .
His recent research at the Santa Fe Institute has focused on the subject of complex adaptive systems , which brings all these areas of study together .
GOP ACCUSES ACORN OF STEALING THEIR THUNDER
" I know all about this voter fraud thing , doggone it , " said Governor Sarah Palin , " because I can see an acorn from my house . "
Satire by R J Shulman
WASHINGTON -- ( PTSD News ) --
The Republican party has launched a major attack against ACORN , the Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now , charging them with trying to steal the election for Barack Obama .
 Their conduct is outrageous ,  said Steve Schmidt of the McCain campaign , we have worked so hard to steal this election fair and square that to have this group of pipsqueak upstarts trying to steal it back is beyond the pale . 
 This is much ado about nothing , " said Bertha Lewis , chief organizer for ACORN , which has helped register over a million voters in the past two years .
 We always flag names on our list that are suspect .
For example , if the name Elvis Presley shows up , we mark it and inform the local registrar of the suspicious nature of the entry .
There is no problem here with voter fraud .
Elvis is not going to show up to vote .
Elvis has left the building .
 Elvis not voting -- my ass ,  said Rick Davis , McCain campaign manager .
 That s how they plan to win Nevada with all those Elvis impersonators just waiting to cast an illegal vote for Obama . 
Senator John McCain , the Republican presidential candidate , said , if I lose this election , it will be because ACORN stole the election for that one . 
 I know all about this voter fraud thing , doggone it ,  said Governor Sarah Palin , because I can see an acorn from my house .
 The most amazing aspect about ACORN is all the press this is generating ,  said Miriam Montana of the media watchdog group , Sterling Consulting .
 There has not been one provable case of an actual fraudulent vote caused by ACORN , " Montana said , " yet there was practically no press when there was credible evidence that the last two presidential elections were stolen by the Republicans with voter caging , black box voting irregularities and other voter suppression tactics that stole millions of votes .
" I guess these days it is OK if you steal big ,  Montana continued .
" Just look at the financial crisis and the bank bailout .
If you steal a loaf of bread and get caught , you go to jail .
If you steal the bakery , you get more dough . 
When asked about the voter fraud charges against ACORN , Karl Rove said , imitation is the sincerest form of flattery . 

NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - Jim Rogers , one of the world ’s most prominent international investors , on Thursday called most of the largest U.S. banks “ totally bankrupt , ” and said government efforts to fix the sector are wrongheaded .
Speaking by teleconference at the Reuters Investment Outlook 2009 Summit , the co-founder with George Soros of the Quantum Fund , said the government ’s $ 700 billion rescue package for the sector does n’t address how banks manage their balance sheets , and instead rewards weaker lenders with new capital .
Dozens of banks have won infusions from the Troubled Asset Relief Program created in early October , just after the Sept 15 bankruptcy filing by Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc LEHMQ .PK .
Some of the funds are being used for acquisitions .
“ Without giving specific names , most of the significant American banks , the larger banks , are bankrupt , totally bankrupt , ” said Rogers , who is now a private investor .
“ What is outrageous economically and is outrageous morally is that normally in times like this , people who are competent and who saw it coming and who kept their powder dry go and take over the assets from the incompetent , ” he said .
“ What ’s happening this time is that the government is taking the assets from the competent people and giving them to the incompetent people and saying , now you can compete with the competent people .
It is horrible economics . ”
Rogers said he shorted shares of Fannie Mae FNM.P and Freddie Mac FRE.P before the government nationalized the mortgage financiers in September , a week before Lehman failed .
Now a specialist in commodities , Rogers said he has used the recent rally in the U.S. dollar as an opportunity to exit dollar - denominated assets .
While not saying how long the U.S. economic recession will last , he said conditions could ultimately mirror those of Japan in the 1990s .
“ The way things are going , we ’re going to have a lost decade too , just like the 1970s , ” he said .
Goldman Sachs &
Co analysts this week estimated that banks worldwide have suffered $ 850 billion of credit - related losses and writedowns since the global credit crisis began last year .
But Rogers said sound U.S. lenders remain .
He said these could include banks that do n’t make or hold subprime mortgages , or which have high ratios of deposits to equity , “ all the classic old ratios that most banks in America forgot or started ignoring because they were too old - fashioned . ”
Many analysts cite Lehman ’s Sept 15 bankruptcy as a trigger for the recent cratering in the economy and stock markets .
Rogers called that idea “ laughable , ” noting that banks have been failing for hundreds of years .
And yet , he said policymakers are n’t doing enough to prevent another Lehman .
“ Governments are making mistakes , ” he said .
“ They ’re saying to all the banks , you do n’t have to tell us your situation .
You can continue to use your balance sheet that is phony ....
All these guys are bankrupt , they ’re still worrying about their bonuses , they ’re still trying to pay their dividends , and the whole system is weakened . ”
Rogers said is investing in growth areas in China and Taiwan , in such areas as water treatment and agriculture , and recently bought positions in energy and agriculture indexes .

Among the Bush administration 's final environmental legacies will be a decision to exempt perchlorate , a known toxin found at unsafe levels in the drinking water of millions of Americans , from federal regulation .
The ruling , proposed by the Environmental Protection Agency in October , was supposed to be formalized on Monday .
That deadline passed , but the agency expects to announce its decision by the year 's end , before president - elect Barack Obama takes office .
It could take years to reverse .
Critics accuse the EPA of ignoring expert advice and basing their decision on an abstract model of perchlorate exposure , rather than existing human data .
" We know that breast milk is widely contaminated with perchlorate , and we know that young children are especially vulnerable .
We have really good human data .
So why are they putting a model front - and - center ? " said Anila Jacobs at the nonprofit Environmental Working Group .
" And they used a model that has n't yet gone through the peer - review process . "
The ruling is one of dozens planned for the final days of the Bush administration .
Others include a relaxing of air pollution standards for aging power plants , and a reduction of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife
Service 's traditional role in evaluating the impact of federal projects on endangered species .
These have received more attention than the status of perchlorate , a chemical found mostly in jet rocket fuel and detected in 35 states and
153 water public water systems .
It is known to lower thyroid hormone levels in women ; it poses a particular threat to pregnant women and breast - feeding children , whose long - term neurological development can be stunted by youthful hormone imbalances .
As many as 40 million Americans may now be exposed to unsafe levels of perchlorate , and the EPA 's own analysis puts the number at 16
million .
The most comprehensive human exposure study , which measured unexpectedly high perchlorate levels and correlated them with thyroid hormone drops , was concluded by the federal Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention in 2007 .
Environmental health advocates saw the study as supporting tightened restrictions on perchlorate levels in drinking water — something the EPA had been loath to do under the Bush administration .
The study was not considered in the anticipated ruling , which could effectively end federal monitoring of perchlorate in drinking water .
" If you used the human studies from the CDC , then you would be forced to regulate it , because we know there are health effects at current levels of exposure , " said Jacobs .
Benjamin Blount , co-author of the CDC 's study , would not comment on the EPA 's decision , but said that infants — who consume , proportional to their body weight , about six times more water than adults — " are thought to have a higher dose than at any other life stage . "
The EPA declined to comment on why they used a model rather than the
CDC 's data in deciding that regulating perchlorate would not provide " a meaningful opportunity for health risk reduction for persons served by public water systems . "
In a November letter to EPA administrator Stephen Johnson , the EPA 's own Science Advisory Board questioned the model .
" Its soundness will not be publicly vetted , " they wrote .
Only one of two peer reviews invited by the agency has been received , and that was announced only today on the EPA 's website .
" The Science Advisory Board believes that more time is needed for the decision process and for scientific input , " said Joan Rose , a
Michigan State University water researcher and chair of the Board's
Drinking Water Committee .
Even Michael Dourson , a researcher at the nonprofit Toxicology
Excellence for Risk Assessment project who accepts the EPA 's model , does n't understand why the EPA favored it over human studies .
" The data is on pregnant women and babies , and these studies are quite powerful , " he said .
" If they could spend more time to make their decision , I 'd recommend looking at it . "
According to EPA spokeswoman Enesta Jones , the agency expects to announce a decision " by the end of the year . "
There is little reason to think the ruling will change from its current form .
" This administration has been adamant about not regulating perchlorate , " said Mae Wu , an attorney at the nonprofit Natural
Resources Defense Council .
If the rulings go through , Congress may still take action .
California congresswomen Barbara Boxer and Hilda Solis , both Democrats , have each drafted legislation that would force the EPA to regulate perchlorate , though it could take years to go into effect .
States still have the option of regulating perchlorate on their own
— but this is not easy , said Charles DeSaillan , New Mexico 's assistant attorney general for natural resources .
" We have fairly limited resources .
Historically we 've relied on the federal drinking water standards , and adopted those , " he said .
" In order for us to adopt our own , we'd have to do all the science , all of the research , hire the experts , and go through a regulatory process which would be opposed by the Department of Defense and Department of
Energy . "
New Mexico is home to several prominent military testing facilities , and has the highest average perchlorate exposures in the country .
" It 'd be long and difficult .
Eventually we may do it .
But it 's easier for us to rely on the EPA .
This is their job .
And in the case of perchlorate , they do n't seem to be doing it , " said DeSaillan .

AUSTIN , Texas , Dec. 28 ( UPI ) -- A 54 - year - old Texan says he lived his dream by paddling down the Mississippi River for 78 days .
Robert Youens of Austin said paddling his canoe the length of the Mississippi River was the result of decades of campfire dreams , the Austin American - Statesman reported Sunday .

" Over 40 years of sitting around campfires , you start dreaming up cool things to do , " he said .
" It 's physical exercise .
It 's quiet .
It 's a way to get close to nature that you can't do in a motor boat or a car . "
Those decades of flights of fancy culminated into a real - life attempt after Youens retired last year from his job as a Briggs & Stratton manager .
After carefully planning out his unusual trip , he finally placed his canoe in the river in Minnesota on Sept. 15 and began his lengthy journey .
After finally completing his mission this month , Youens said he is temporarily putting aside his paddle to write a book about his Mississippi River experiences .
But after the book is completed , Youens hinted to the American - Statesman that an Atlantic Ocean sailing trip is a real possibility .
This is the first in a series featuring stories " from the trenches " ( so to speak ) of developers working at technology start - ups .
Kudos and many thanks to the team at Huddle for taking the plunge and being the first !
So with no further ado , over to Bob , Senior software developer at Huddle ...
- James C , Editor .
Introduction from Bob ...
I got involved in a conversation about testing when I was at DrinkTank [ a great networking event in London for tech companies - Ed. ] .
I ’m not entirely sure how coherent I was because I ’d been lapping up the free alcohol , and I wanted to flesh out some of the ideas I ’d been spouting .
I need to start with a disclaimer : I ’m not a testing guru .
These articles are not intended for gurus , they are intended for geek - ish people running or thinking about running a dev team in a start up .
I know testing gurus .
I used to live with a Perl programmer who from what I could gather would literally never write a line of production code that was n’t backed by a unit test .
He would sometimes walk around the house in his boxers all weekend muttering about tests and test engines and test techniques and text - based test protocols , stopping only to make coffee or Tex - Mex food .
This fiendish obsession with testing made him one of the best engineers I have ever met .
Me ?
I ’m weak - minded , and I test when I feel the urge .
Over the years , though , I find that I have to scratch the testing itch more and more often .
Maybe I ’ll end up the same way .
For now I ’m not using real test driven development as a rule , even though I find it an incredibly useful tool in the right situation .
There are technical reasons that make it difficult to use day - in - day out , and we ’re taking BIG steps to improve our testability , which I ALSO want to talk about , but here I want to start with the real basics .
How many testers do I need per-developer ?
System complexity scales non-linearly .
Big systems are really hard to test .
Microsoft have a tester - to - developer ratio of 1:1 and look how far it gets them .
While your app is small , it ’s easy to test , but as you start to add more features , you create dependencies between features .
This allows changes in one part of the system to ripple , in subtle ways , and bugs can appear in what appears to be a completely unrelated area .
At Huddle , we ’ve got one full - time tester , and we could really use another .
Regression testing is done en-masse by the whole office in bug - hunts .
The development team all pitch in with testing , and we all work to a test plan that covers the functionality we ’re building .
If you are n’t Absolutely Convinced that your code will get through the QA tests , then you have n’t finished yet .
If we get a second full - time QA , then we ’ll have a ratio of 3 developers to each tester , but at least 30 % of each developer ’s time is already being spent on nothing but testing , either as peer review , or writing some kind of automated tests .
3:1 is often vaunted as the magic number for small companies .
Of course , three is also a magic number for wishes and rescuing princesses and clicking your heels together , so take it with a pinch of salt .
Our current ratio of 5:1 is too high , and we ’ve recently been picking up some of the slack by pulling people in to test random things .
I used to do this a LOT when I was at Cogentic .
If you think something is working , go and fetch Barney from the accounts – he loves breaking software , and he ’ll push buttons that you ’d forgotten existed .
If you ’re getting people to do testing part - time , make sure you have a formal test plan , and that they know how to use your bug tracker .
Can developers test their own code ?
Short answer : no .
Writing code is a bit like map - making .
Bear with me here , it ’s a terrible simile , but it ’ll do .
You point your developers in the direction of some uncharted wasteland , supply them with coffee , and let them go hacking through the undergrowth .
If you ’re lucky , they ’ll pop back up in a few weeks time , and they ’ll have brought geometric exactitude to Terra Incognita .
If you ’re unlucky , they ’ll go native and it ’ll end up with heads - on - spikes and tears - before - bedtime .
Anyway : you want to test your new maps .
The WORST people to test the maps are the people who wrote them .
They know , without thinking about it , that you have to veer West when you reach The Swamp of Unicode Misery or you ’ll drown .
They know that the distances are slightly unreliable because they contracted malaria near the Caves of Ui and the resulting fever made the cartography kinda hazy .
Stretching the metaphor beyond breaking point , they also have a tendency to say “ Here Be Dragons And all Manner of Phantastic Beasts ” and leave it at that .
Good testers will wander off from the beaten path , get lost in the wilderness , fight off bandits and ague , and return to tell the story .
Good testers will bring a fresh pair of eyes and an enviable sense of naivete to the task .
Good testers wo n’t make allowances for minor errors and niggles , which is great because NOR WILL YOUR CUSTOMERS .
How can I get cheap testers ?
Short answer :
You can ’t .
Good testers will cost at least as much as good developers .
Most people who are smart enough to be really good at testing are smart enough to find it really boring .
The absolute worst thing you can do is to employ developers and make them do a stint in the QA department .
Developers do n’t want to be full - time testers , and they ’ll suck at it .
If you do this , you ’ll find that your Quality Assurance has become Quick Assessment .
Pay peanuts : hire monkeys
If you really want to find cheap labour , then look at graduates .
You can pick up two smart graduates for the price of one good developer .
There ’re lots of people who start programming or CompSci degrees and then realise it is n’t for them after all .
Those people , the smart people who do n’t want to be programmers , but know a bit about how computers work , are solid gold as far as testing is concerned .
The only problem is that if they ’re GOOD at it , they ’ll end up wanting to be paid well for it , and then you ’re right back to square one , but at least you got a year ’s slave labour .
tl ; dr : hire more testers , spend more money .

It 's been almost 24 hours since the intoxicating and overwhelming scent of maple syrup assaulted New Yorkers ' olfactory nerves again .
And even though this is the sixth time the smell has struck , it 's unclear where the smell is coming from .
The Office of Emergency Management told us that there were 37 calls to 311 between 9 p.m. and midnight last night about the smell .
Department of Environmental Protection inspectors were dispatched to investigate , but the calls — and smell — seemed to taper off around midnight .
So there are no answers yet again !
Maybe it is Northrax for all we know .
Our own Joe Schumacher says , " With a light wind and stable air the weather conditions would have been ideal for the smell to travel a fair distance , " which explains how the smell could be noticed all the way up in Harlem and down in Soho and even in parts of Queens and Brooklyn .
One commenter suggested , " That smell is coming from the New Salt Substitute about to be used on the streets by the Sanitation Dept .
Salt has become to expensive , so they are trying this stuff which is Salt mixed with a chemical that smells like Maple Syrup . "
Which could make sense — but would this explain the previous smellings in past years ?
For now , we 'll just have to examine the map — click on the icons for some details — and develop other hypotheses .
But for every person who thought " I thought I was going crazy .
We had pancakes for breakfast on Sunday , and I was looking for where I spilled the syrup ! " , know this :
You are not alone .
Every time Qantas lands one of its giant Airbus A380s at LAX , parts of the nation ’s fourth - busiest airport come to a halt .
Service roads , taxiways and runways must be closed to airfield trucks , cars and other commercial aircraft as the world ’s largest passenger plane -- with wings almost as long as a football field -- arrives , departs and taxis with an official escort of operations vehicles .
The plane is so immense that air traffic controllers give it priority so it does n’t have to wait for takeoff at the end of the airport ’s southern runways in cloudy or foggy weather because it can disrupt radio signals from the airport ’s instrument landing system .
More than any other airliner , LAX officials say , the A380 requires special procedures because Los Angeles International Airport was not built to accommodate a plane of its size .

Despite occasional griping from airlines , LAX , Qantas , and Federal Aviation Administration officials say that A380 operations have gone fairly well since October , when the Australian carrier began service to Los Angeles from Melbourne and Sydney .
But air traffic controllers and LAX officials caution that as airlines put more A380s into service , they could hamper airport operations and delay other commercial flights if improvements to runways , taxiways and terminals are not made in the next few years .
Based on Air Transport Assn. figures , every minute of delay for an airliner carrying 150 people costs the carrier and passengers an average total of $ 152 , including the value of fuel , crew time , lost productivity and other expenses .
Air traffic controllers at LAX say the current procedures work because A380s have priority , there are only one or two planes a day and the airport is n’t as busy as it once was .
Since 2000 , the average number of daily takeoffs and landings has dropped from about 2,150 to 1,500 because of declines in air travel after 9/11 , high aviation fuel prices last summer and the nation ’s sagging economy .
“ The whole process is cumbersome and will cause problems down the road , ” said air traffic controller Mike Foote , a local representative of the National Air Traffic Controllers Assn .
“ If we go back to pre- recession operations levels , the situation would be untenable .
There would be gridlock . ”
Advertisement
Controllers say the potential for delay could increase dramatically with the addition of four or five A380 flights a day .
Airbus officials disagree .
Years were spent developing adequate procedures , they say , and operational improvements have occurred as airports have become accustomed to the airplane .
If runways , taxiways and service roads have to be closed , it is only for “ a very short time , ” said Dan Cohen - Nir , program manager for Airbus North America Holdings Inc .
“ The good news is that there ’s been a long - standing collaboration between Airbus , air traffic control , the FAA and airport officials , ” Cohen - Nir said .
“ It is a challenge .
LAX was designed before the [ Boeing 747 jumbo jet ] .
In some places , LAX is substandard for even those aircraft . ”
Qantas flies an A380 into LAX on Mondays through Fridays , though there are exceptions to the schedule .
A May 2008 study by Los Angeles World Airports indicated that Qantas and five other international carriers wanted to put at least 10 A380s into service at LAX by 2012 , but an unprecedented downturn in the airline industry and a deepening global recession could derail those plans .

LAX “ has been plain fantastic in this whole thing , ” said Roger Lindeman , a Qantas vice president in charge of airport operations in the United States , Canada , and South America .
“ These planes are the future of long - haul aviation .
Airports need to be ready for them . ”
The A380 is a big plane -- a destination in itself , Lindeman says .
The wingspan is about 262 feet , and the tail is 80 feet high .
The maximum takeoff weight is 1.2 million pounds .
The double - deck design can carry 450 to 853 passengers and 50 % more cargo than most other commercial aircraft .
In contrast , a Boeing 747-400 can seat 416 to 660 people .
The wingspan is 211 feet , and the tail is 64 feet high .
The maximum takeoff weight is about 875,000 pounds .
Next to the bulky Airbus , the 747 looks streamlined .
So far , about a dozen airports in North America have had an interest in the A380 , but only two have accepted the plane -- John F. Kennedy International in New York and LAX .
San Francisco International Airport , which was the stage for a Qantas demonstration flight last week , is preparing to begin A380 operations .

About $ 100 million has been spent at LAX to accommodate the next generation of large aircraft , including the A380 , Boeing 787 Dreamliner and the 747- 8 .
About $ 50 million has been spent for taxiway improvements and another $ 50 million for two A380 gates -- one at each end of the Tom Bradley International Terminal .
But unlike at JFK and San Francisco , getting the plane into and out of LAX is governed by a long list of special procedures , such as an entourage of four or five airport vehicles that set up temporary roadblocks as the aircraft taxis .
“ The plane creates issues we have to deal with , ” said Jeff Cunnyngham , the FAA operations supervisor at LAX .
“ Whenever an A380 is moving , we put on extra people to watch the process .
We make sure the tower is fully staffed . ”
If an A380 flies into or out of the airport , aircraft behind it must maintain a longer distance because of strong wake turbulence , swirling air that can cause a trailing plane to go out of control .
Heavy jets like a 747 must stay at least six miles away , while light planes must maintain a distance of 10 miles .

LAX operates with four parallel runways that are intersected by taxiways leading to the terminals .
When an A380 is moving along one taxiway toward the south runway complex , landings and departures on the inner runway must stop briefly because one of the wings intrudes into the runway ’s safety zone , an area that must remain clear of obstacles .
A parallel service road must be closed as well , causing trucks and cars to back up as the aircraft lumbers to the Bradley terminal .
Similarly , a service road must be closed if an A380 is operating on the airport ’s northern runway complex .
On the north side , the airport has received FAA permission to land the A380 on its 150 - foot - wide runways .
Normally , the FAA requires a width of 200 feet for a plane that size .
When the A380 taxis from its gate on the south side of the Bradley terminal to its maintenance area for routine servicing on the north side of LAX , it must use one of the airport ’s two north - south taxiways , which are next to each other .
The wings are so wide that aircraft are prohibited from using the other taxiway until the A380 passes .
Cunnyngham estimates that runway closures can last three to five minutes , while road closures last five to 10 minutes .
In addition , FAA procedures state than when an A380 is stopped on certain taxiways , nearby runways must be closed to departures and arrivals because its 80 - foot tail juts into an area that must remain free of obstacles .
Also , air traffic controllers say that when the plane lands or takes off , taxiways between runways must remain clear of other aircraft because the wings jut into safety zones .

“ For the most part , the A380 does not create many problems when it arrives and departs in the off - peak hours , but it could create delays if it starts operating in significant numbers , ” said Bruce W. Kinsler , a former FAA air traffic control specialist who has studied the effects of A380s and other large commercial aircraft on airports .
Gina Marie Lindsey , executive director of Los Angeles World Airports , says the A380 underscores the need to proceed with key elements of the LAX modernization plan or risk losing flights to other airports .
The projects include new gates at the Bradley terminal , a wider cross - field taxiway and a mid-field concourse that would eliminate the need to bus international travelers from remote gates to the main customs and immigration facility .
A controversial proposal to reconfigure the north runway complex could increase the distances between taxiways , two runways and service roads .
The plan , which is being studied , calls for moving the outboard runway 300 feet to the north to make room for a center taxiway .
“ If we are delayed on the Bradley gates and the cross - field taxiway , we would have a fairly significant congestion issue , ” Lindsey said .
“ We would end up having the A380s at the remote gates -- an awful experience for travelers . ”

For taxpayers who feel like they are getting nothing in exchange for the bailout billions being pumped into banks , one former Swedish official has a solution :
Be wise , nationalize .
Observers who can get past the shudder that the word itself often elicits point to many benefits of such a plan , which former Swedish minister of fiscal affairs Bo Lundgren outlined for the New York Times .
At the beginning of the last decade , Sweden was faced with a collapsing real estate bubble .
Instead of merely extending risky loans to banks , which is the U.S. approach , in 1993 the Swedish government actually took control of problematic assets and grouped them into a " bad bank , " which , in classic Orwellian fashion , they named Securum .
The bank was then kept afloat with public funds , awaiting an economic recovery to increase the value of the assets , which , according to the Times , included the Australian Embassy building in Myanmar and " a guitar that was said to have belonged to John Lennon . "
By most accounts , Securum was a success .
Slated to stay open for 15 years , it closed after four , and an analysis ( PDF ) by the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland found Swedish taxpayers had recovered more than half of the 24 billion kronors ( $ 2.88 billion ) in public funds pumped into the company .
Dabbling in office supplies , real estate and as noted above , guitars , was also a " stimulating " intellectual exercise , former Securum CEO Lars Thunell told the Times .
Finally , the threat of government control scared many banks away from seeking government bailouts at all .
Several of the largest Swedish financial institutions found ways to solve their problems without government help .
Of course , it is not clear whether the scale of the current U.S. crisis makes the Swedish model replicable .
And for those hoping a bank nationalization program would solve U.S. financial sector woes once and for all , the Swedish example is also enlightening .
Late last year , Stockholm began negotiating another bank bailout .
I have n’t started doing any real performance optimizations on my iPhone app yet .
I pretty much ported it from the original PC version , saw that it was running rather slow ( 2 - 3 fps ) so I changed the number of elements on the screen until it was an “ acceptable ” 15 fps and left it there until I had time to come back and optimize things towards the end .
I even ran it through some of the iPhone performance gathering tools and saw that it was spending half the time in the simulation and half the time rendering .
A bit surprising , but it ’s not like I had much to compare it against since this was my first performance - intensive iPhone app .
That was until this morning .
Prompted by some of the comments in my previous post , I did a quick search about the iPhone floating - point performance .
I had heard conflicting information on it : does it have hardware floating - point support ?
do you have to use fixed - point numbers for best performance ?
Apple is very tight - lipped about the specific hardware specs of the iPhone , which seems very strange to those of us coming from a console background .
But people have been able to determine that the CPU is a 32 - bit RISC ARM1176JZF .
The good news is that it have a full floating - point unit , so we can continue writing math and physics code the way we do in most platforms .
The ARM CPU also has an architecture extension called the Thumb .
It seems to be a special set of 16 - bit bitcodes that claim to improve performance .
I image the performance increase comes from a smaller code footprint and faster code fetching and processing .
As a bonus , you also get a smaller memory footprint , so it seems like a win for a lot of mobile platforms .
XCode comes with the option to generate Thumb code turned on by default .
But , and this is a huge but , it seems that floating point operations cause the program to switch back and form between Thumb mode and regular 32 - bit mode .
I would be interesting to look at the assembly generated , but I have n’t had time to do that yet .
So the more floating - point calculations you do , the less of performance gain you ’ll get from Thumb optimizations .
Or , in the extreme , you might even get a performance degradation .
Most 3D games are very floating - point intenstive , and my app is no different , so I decided to turn off Thumb code generation on a whim .
The results :
Thumb code generation ON ( default ) : 15 fps
Thumb code generation OFF : 39 fps
Whoa !!!
That ’s a saving of 41 ms per frame !
That has to be the optimization with most bang for the time spent on it that I ’ve ever done .
This also probably means that my app is now totally render - bound , which is good news .
I ’m sure I can optimize tons of stuff there
So if you ’re doing any kind of a 3D game , turn off Thumb code generation .
Now !
Edit : I realized I never explained how to turn the Thumb code generation off !
Oops .
Go to your project settings , add a new User - Defined setting called : GCC_THUMB_SUPPORT and set it to NO .
That simple ( but surprisingly there was n’t an already existing setting to check it on and off ) .
I was watching the superb animated documentary Waltz with Bashir about the Israeli invasion of Lebanon in 1982 .
It culminates in the massacre of some 1,700 Palestinians in the Sabra and Chatila refugee camps in south Beirut by Christian militiamen introduced there by the Israeli army which observed the butchery from close range .
In the last few minutes the film switches from animation to graphic news footage showing Palestinian women screaming with grief and horror as they discover the bullet - riddled bodies of their families .
Then , just behind the women , I saw myself walking with a small group of journalists who had arrived in the camp soon after the killings had stopped .
The film is about how the director , Ari Folman , who knew he was at Sabra and Chatila as an Israeli soldier , tried to discover both why he had repressed all memory of what happened to him and the degree of Israeli complicity in the massacre .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Walking out of the cinema , I realised that I had largely repressed my own memories of that ghastly day .
I could not even find a clipping in old scrapbooks of the article I had written about what I had seen for the Financial Times for whom I then worked .
Even now my memory is hazy and episodic , though I can clearly recall the sickly sweet smell of bodies beginning to decompose , the flies clustering around the eyes of the dead women and children , and the blood - smeared limbs and heads sticking out of banks of brown earth heaped up by bulldozers in a half - hearted attempt to bury the corpses .
Soon after seeing Waltz with Bashir I saw TV pictures of the broken bodies of the Palestinians killed by Israeli bombs and shells in Gaza during the 22 - day bombardment .
At first I thought that little had changed since Sabra and Chatila .
Once again there were the same tired and offensive excuses that Israel was somehow not to blame .
Hamas was using civilians as human shields , and in any case – this argument produced more furtively – two - thirds of people in Gaza had voted for Hamas so they deserved whatever happened to them .
But on returning to Jerusalem 10 years after I was stationed here as The Independent 's correspondent between 1995 and 1999 I find that Israel has changed significantly for the worse .
There is far less dissent than there used to be and such dissent is more often treated as disloyalty .
Israeli society was always introverted but these days it reminds me more than ever of the Unionists in Northern Ireland in the late 1960s or the Lebanese Christians in the 1970s .
Like Israel , both were communities with a highly developed siege mentality which led them always to see themselves as victims even when they were killing other people .
There were no regrets or even knowledge of what they inflicted on others and therefore any retaliation by the other side appeared as unprovoked aggression inspired by unreasoning hate .
At Sabra and Chatila the first journalist to find out about the massacre was an Israeli and he desperately tried to get it stopped .
This would not happen today because Israeli journalists , along with all foreign journalists , were banned from entering Gaza before the Israeli bombardment started .
This has made it far easier for the government to sell the official line about what a great success the operation has been .
Nobody believes propaganda so much as the propagandist so Israel 's view of the outside world is increasingly detached from reality .
One academic was quoted as saying that Arabs took all their views about was happening in Israel from what Israelis said about themselves .
So if Israelis said they had won in Gaza , unlike Lebanon in 2006 , Arabs would believe this and Israeli deterrence would thereby be magically restored .
Intolerance of dissent has grown and may soon get a great deal worse .
Benjamin Netanyahu , who helped bury the Oslo accords with the Palestinians when he was last prime minister from 1996 to 1999 , is likely to win the Israeli election on 10 February .
The only issue still in doubt is the extent of the gains of the extreme right .
The views of these were on display this week as Avigdor Lieberman , the chairman of the Ysrael Beitenu party , which , according to the polls will do particularly well in the election , was supporting the disqualification of two Israeli Arab parties from standing in the election .
" For the first time we are examining the boundary between loyalty and disloyalty , " he threatened their representatives .
" We 'll deal with you like we dealt with Hamas . "
There are several nice ModelAdmin subclasses that provide useful functionality ( such as django - batchadmin , django - reversion , and others ) , but unfortunately a ModelAdmin can really only subclass one at a time , making them mutually exclusive .
This snippet aims to make mixing these classes in as easy as possible -- you can inherit your model admin from it , add a tuple of mixins , and it will dynamically change the inheritance tree to match .
This is n't guaranteed to work with all ModelAdmins , but so long as the mixins play nice with django modeladmin they should work .

This tutorial explains how to create a USB Boot CD that can be used to boot Kubuntu 9.04 from a USB flash drive on computers utilizing a system BIOS that does not natively support booting from USB .
Kubuntu is a derivative of Ubuntu that uses the KDE desktop environment instead of Gnome .
The USB boot CD created using this tutorial launches the initrd and vmlinuz kernel from the CD along with the necessary USB drivers , and then proceeds to locate the filesystem on the USB drive .
Because the USB driver modules are preloaded from the initrd on the CD , the compressed filesystem can then be detected and loaded from the USB device .

' Helen ' from Hull was sent a letter in the post demanding £ 500 Thousands of internet users have been told they 'll be taken to court unless they pay hundreds of pounds for illegally downloading and sharing hardcore porn movies .
Newsbeat 's found out that people across the UK have been accused of using file - sharing networks to get hold of dozens of adult titles without paying for them .
A German company called DigiProtect claims the users are breaking copyright law and is demanding £ 500 to settle out of court .
A 20 - page legal letter lists the name of the film involved along with the time and date of the alleged download .
Lawyers say they have been contacted by hundreds of worried individuals over the past few weeks .
Many deny copying the movies and say they have no idea why they were identified in the first place .
Michael Coyle from Southampton - based solicitors Lawdit is acting on behalf of hundreds of people who have already received legal papers in the post .
" It 's the embarrassment factor , " he said .
" One lady told us she fainted when she opened her letter .
Teenagers right up to old - age pensioners have been accused of downloading hardcore porn .
The overriding feeling is one of outrage . "
' Upset and angry '
Twenty - seven - year - old ' Helen ' , not her real name , from Hull , told Newsbeat she was " upset , scared and angry " after a letter landed on her doormat last month demanding £ 525 for sharing a single adult movie over the net .
[ The £ 500 settlement fee ] consists mainly of the cost of the considerable work required to identify the owner of the IP address
Statement from DigiProtect 's legal representatives Davenport Lyons
A hard look at file - sharing evidence " It 's a big letter accusing me of downloading a porn film called Young Harlots In London .
" I 've never heard of it before , certainly never seen it and never downloaded it . "
" I got a letter from my ISP a few months back saying that they had received a court order which meant they had to release my details to a law firm . "
" I waited for the letter to turn up .
It gives me three weeks to pay up , or they 'll take me to court . "
" I think their methods of going about this have been completely wrong .
They are terrifying quite a number of people . "
Sixty - year - old ' Mary ' from Bedfordshire received a similar letter .
" I 'm a pensioner , so it was such a shock .
I did n't even know what a P2P network was before this , " she said .
" I did n't sleep for a week . "
Porn campaign
The illegal sharing of copyright material over the web is a major headache for music , movie and game companies .
Six million people in the UK alone are thought to download music and movie files for free each year with more than half under - 25s said to use file - sharing networks like Gnutella , BitTorrent and eDonkey .
When an individual user downloads sections of a film or song over the network , they are simultaneously uploading different parts of the film to other users .
Michael Coyle is acting for people who've received the letters
The government recently brokered a deal between record labels and internet companies that was meant to discourage this kind of illegal copying .
Broadband providers like BT , Tiscali and Virgin agreed to send warning letters to customers identified by the music industry body , the BPI , as illegal file - sharers .
A handful of independent music and gaming companies have gone further and started taking direct legal action .
But this is thought to be the first time pornographic material has been targeted .
Michael Coyle said : " The cynical lawyer in me would say this is a money - making exercise .
" If you send out 10,000 letters and ask for £ 500 each time , you only have to get half to pay up and you 've made a significant amount of money .
" Because it is porn , the person who 's being accused wo n't want to go to court and is more likely to pay up to make the matter go away even if they are completely innocent . "
Lawyers representing DigiProtect say the £ 500 demand is calculated as a token sum in damages for lost sales plus the " considerable " costs involved in obtaining evidence and legal fees .
IP addresses Little is known about DigiProtect , the German firm behind the latest wave of copyright litigation .
The company is based in Frankfurt and brands its business with the motto " turn piracy into profit " .
It has represented a range of rights holders in the past including the German techno band Scooter .
This action is designed to prevent further illegal exploitation of our client 's copyrighted material
Statement from DigiProtect 's legal representatives Davenport Lyons
It tracks down alleged pirates by logging the individual Internet Protocol , or IP , address of internet users logged on to file - sharing networks .
It then applies to the High Court to force broadband companies to release the physical contact details of customers matched to those addresses .
In legal letters to internet users seen by Newsbeat , the company claims : " Each copy represents a potential lost sale and is tantamount to someone walking into a shop and taking a physical copy without paying for it and then giving a copy to anyone who asks for it . "
But critics claim the technology DigiProtect uses to track internet use is unreliable .
The websites that allow users to access the file - sharing network have told Newsbeat that fake IP addresses are routinely entered into the system to throw companies like DigiProtect off the scent .
The growing popularity of wireless , or WiFi , networks in the home means it is easy to share an internet connection with a neighbour , especially in a block of flats .
" It 's positively encouraged to have an open wireless network these days , " said Michael Coyle at Lawdit .
" Most people use very standard default passwords so it 's very easy to use someone else 's WiFi . "
Lawyers representing DigiProtect claim the technology behind the company 's tracking process is " highly sophisticated " and has been backed by courts in Europe .
They say it is the responsibility of broadband users to ensure they will not allow others to use their internet connections for unlawful purposes like illegal file - sharing .
' Completely misrepresented '
Many of the letters seen by Newsbeat indicate that DigiProtect is acting on behalf of one of the biggest adult studios in the United States , Evil Angel , run by American porn mogul John Stagliano .
When contacted , Mister Stagliano appeared to be unaware of the £ 500 DigiProtect is demanding from alleged file - sharers to settle out of court .
" It 's not my understanding that they ask for anything near that .
I think the amount was $ 50 ( £ 34 ) or  50 ( £ 43 ) , " he said .
" I would be very surprised and I would n't be happy because it would mean it was completely misrepresented to me . "
DigiProtect refused to comment directly for this article .
But in a statement , its legal representatives Davenport Lyons said : " [ The £ 500 settlement fee ] consists mainly of the cost of the considerable work required to identify the owner of the IP address .
" The sum in the settlement is a fraction of what would be ordered by a court if an individual were found liable after a trial .
" There is no compulsion on the individual to accept this settlement if he is innocent . "
" Where submissions are made ( such as someone claiming that they have not uploaded the copyright material or that the ISP has wrongly identified them as the owner of the IP address ) we look into these carefully before deciding whether to proceed . "
" The lawyer representing people accused who says this is a money making scheme is simply wrong .
" This action is designed to prevent further illegal exploitation of our client 's copyrighted material and the settlement sum in no way compensates for the loss suffered or the cost of getting the settlement . "

Lloyds shares halve in value in two days over nationalisation fears
Shares in Lloyds Banking Group crashed by nearly a third yesterday amid fears it cannot survive the recession without more state cash .
Taxpayers already own a 43 per cent stake in the bank , which was formed on Monday from the rescue takeover by Lloyds of HBOS , owner of Halifax .
But the halving of the share price in two days sparks fears this could soon become a majority stake .
Another drop : Lloyds Banking
Group shares almost halved in value today on the back of a 35 per cent plunge yesterday after it absorbed HBOS
The run on the stock is a nightmare for investors , including many pensioners who used to rely on the bank ’s generous dividends to provide an income in retirement .
Many are furious at Lloyds ’ decision to rescue HBOS which they say has ruined its reputation for being a prudently - managed safe haven .
Yesterday a Lloyds spokesman insisted the bank had no desire to see the Government ’s stake increase but experts say the bank may yet have to ask the Government for more help .
Its shares dived 47 per cent at one stage and closed down 31 per cent at 44.8 p .
Other bank shares also continued their freefalls yesterday with Royal Bank of Scotland dropping another 11.2 per cent to close at just 10.3 p .
Barclays fell 17 per cent to 72.9p .
On the brink : Royal Bank of Scotland shares clawed back slightly today after a 67 % plunge following its revelation it is facing a £ 28bn loss for 2008
Experts say the market has been spooked by fears the Government ’s second banking bail - out , revealed on Monday , will not stop the rot .
Sandy Chen , from the stockbroker Panmure Gordon , said yesterday that RBS shares may be worth as little as 5 p .
The wider FTSE 100 Index closed down 17.1 points at 4091 .
The removal of the ban on short - selling as of last Friday - by which traders bet on falling shares - has added to the sense of panic .
The Prime Minister yesterday lashed the ' recklessness ' of RBS chiefs and the Treasury insisted the Government will do ' whatever is necessary ' to protect savers .
RBS customers were reassured their money was safe as the Government has repeatedly made clear it will not allow a bank to fail .
The taxpayers ' stake in the bank now stands at 70 per cent - up from 58 per cent after the latest rescue measures but with its shares in freefall , experts predicted ministers may have little choice but to step in and buy it outright .
Its bosses said they discussed full nationalisation with the Treasury but that it was ' something they all wanted to avoid ' , although some experts warn it may be necessary .
Vicky Redwood , from Capital Economics , said : ' We still think that the government may eventually have to set state - decreed targets for the banks to lend , perhaps via further nationalisation . '
Analysts at Nomura added : ' We would suggest that if the latest set of measures proves insufficient , then the authorities are likely to feel that they have little alternative to full nationalisation . '
On Monday the Government hurled more public cash at the industry in a determined attempt to get it lending again .
Developments included :
● A Treasury scheme to offer Government insurance for up to £ 260 billion in worthless ' toxic assets ' held by the banks ;
● A £ 100 billion guarantee for mortgages to encourage banks to lend to homebuyers ;
● A £ 50 billion Bank of England scheme to buy assets of private firms and financial institutions to inject cash into the economy ;
● A European Commission forecast that the economy will shrink dramatically this year by 2.8 per cent and Government debt will soar to 72 per cent of output in 2010 ;
● Calls for former RBS boss Sir Fred Goodwin - nicknamed ' Fred the Shred ' - to be stripped of his knighthood .
Poll Should Fred the Shred lose his knighthood ?

Crucially , the Prime Minister stopped short of putting a figure on his scheme , drawing Tory claims that he has written a ' blank cheque ' that leaves the taxpayer dangerously exposed .
Some estimates put its potential value at £ 410 billion , pushing the amount committed by the taxpayer to prop up the banking system since last year at nearly £ 1 trillion .
Labour MPs looked stunned as Chancellor Alistair Darling explained the latest move just three months after £ 37 billion was used to save the system from collapse .
Treasury officials warned that the package , which was welcomed by business and economists , will need time to feed through the industry .
But Shadow Chancellor George Osborne told MPs : ' The first bail - out of the banks has failed and now they have no option but to attempt a second bail - out - a bail - out whose size we still do n't know , whose details remain a mystery and whose ultimate cost to the people of Britain will only be known when this Government has long gone . '
Ministers rushed out the package after days of uncertainty on the markets saw banks around the world come under intense pressure .
The RBS meltdown was triggered by its
admission that it will reveal the biggest financial loss in British corporate history next month .
In a veiled apology , new RBS boss Stephen Hester said the bank , which owns NatWest and the Queen 's bankers Coutts , had important lessons to learn and that the first stage was to ‘ fess up ’ .
It came as experts warned that the bail - out was just a stepping stone to the full - scale nationalisation of more banks - possibly within weeks .
Mr Brown said his intervention was about helping businesses and families by encouraging banks to start lending again .
And Mr Darling and Mr Brown stressed it was not Government policy to own or run banks , as officials pointed out that RBS was not suffering from funding difficulties .
With assets estimated at nearly £ 2trillion , which is bigger than Britain 's entire economic output , Whitehall insiders there was no cause for emergency action to take control of RBS .
● Business has claimed that a raft of new regulations will cost it £ 1 billion a year .
. -- Barack Obama and Hillary Rodham Clinton each insisted Friday that the race for the Democratic presidential nomination was n’t over , even as Obama racked up at least nine more superdelegate commitments -- including another Clinton defector .
While Clinton contrasted their healthcare policies and Obama took aim at presumptive Republican nominee John McCain , media and supporters pressed the Illinois senator on whether he would ask Clinton to join his ticket and help retire her campaign debts .
“ We do not have this nomination locked up , ” Obama said in Beaverton .
“ Until I am the nominee , I do n’t want to speculate on running mates . ”
Obama went on to praise his Senate colleague from New York as “ an extraordinary candidate , and an extraordinary public servant .
. . .
She would be on anyone ’s short list of vice presidential candidates .
But beyond that , I do n’t want to offer an opinion . ”

Later , at a taqueria in Woodburn , Obama dismissed as premature questions about whether he would help Clinton pay off campaign debts , but hinted that he might .
“ We ’ll obviously want to have a broad - ranging discussion with Sen .
Clinton about how I could make her feel good about the process and have her on the team moving forward , ” Obama said .
“ But , as I ’ve said , it ’s premature right now .
. . .
Our working assumption right now is that we ’re still in the middle of a race . ”
Several media tallies gave Obama the lead for the first time among superdelegates , which had been the last meaningful category in which Clinton claimed success .
Clinton , who also began the day in Oregon , showed no signs of slowing her pace and resumed her criticism of Obama .
She had softened her jabs at him after losing by 14 percentage points in North Carolina and winning narrowly in Indiana on Tuesday .

Clinton slammed Obama for proposing what she described as a less - than - comprehensive healthcare plan , though many analysts and Obama say there is little difference between their proposals .
“ How can anyone run for the Democratic nomination and not have a universal healthcare plan ? ” Clinton said in Portland .
“ This is a huge difference . ”
Clinton ’s last event of the night was in Louisville , Ky. , before a Democratic group .
Though some Democrats worried that the protracted nomination race would push voters toward McCain , others are turning to Obama .
As he picked up at least nine new superdelegates Friday , Clinton added one .
The flow of delegates to Obama led ABC News and the New York Times to declare Obama in the lead among superdelegates .
The Associated Press , whose tally is used by the Los Angeles Times , still gave a slight edge to Clinton .

The new Obama endorsements include Rep. Donald M. Payne ( D - N.J. ) , an African American early supporter of Clinton .
He jumped ship this morning , telling the Newark Star - Ledger that he had backed Clinton when he thought Obama ’s campaign was “ just a trial balloon . ”
Previously uncommitted superdelegates now backing Obama include two California members of the Democratic National Committee : Ed Espinoza of Long Beach and Vernon Watkins of Rancho Cucamonga .
Obama put his focus on McCain .
“ Sen. McCain is running for president to double - down on George Bush ’s failed policies , ” Obama told several dozen employees of Vernier Software & Technology in Beaverton , which makes classroom products for science teachers .
McCain campaigned on the East Coast , where he ignored Clinton to focus on the Illinois senator .

And signaling the tenor of what many see as the campaign to come , McCain , during a brief visit to the Liberty Science Center in Jersey City , N.J. , defended his recent assertion that the militant Palestinian group Hamas favored Obama .
The Arizona senator said it was “ very obvious to everyone that Sen .
Obama shares nothing of the values or goals of Hamas , which is a terrorist organization , ” and he contended that he “ never implied anything else . ”
But , he continued , “ a spokesperson from Hamas said that he approves Sen.
Obama ’s candidacy , ” which he says is of interest to voters .
“ That is something that needs to be discussed -- why his policies should meet the approval of a spokesperson for Hamas , ” McCain said .
“ I believe it ’s a legitimate point of discussion . ”
McCain also announced his support for a Senate measure to limit greenhouse gases sponsored by two of his closest Senate colleagues , John W. Warner ( R - Va. ) and Joe Lieberman ( I - Conn . ) .
The America ’s Climate Security
Act would reduce industrial greenhouse gas emissions to two - thirds of 2005 levels by mid-century .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - The U.S. military conducted a successful test of its system built to knock out long - range missiles that could be fired by North Korea or Iran , the Pentagon said on Friday .
The target missile for the test over the Pacific was launched from Kodiak , Alaska and an interceptor was launched from Vandenberg Air Force Base , California , officials said .
The intercept took place at 3:29 p.m. EST .
Boeing
Co is prime contractor for the system , called the ground - based midcourse defense .
The Pentagon will hold a briefing on the results of the test at 5:15 p.m. EST ( 0015 GMT ) , officials said .
U.S. officials had billed the test as a particularly realistic simulation of a possible missile attack but critics of the system disputed that description .
Before the latest test , the Pentagon said 12 tests of the ground - based system had been conducted since 1999 and seven of them had been successful .
Advisers to U.S. President - elect Barack Obama have said he favors missile defense in principle but the program , a flagship policy of the Bush administration , will face more scrutiny after he takes office .
President George W. Bush has been spending roughly $ 10 billion a year on all aspects of missile defense , the Pentagon ’s costliest annual outlay for an arms development program .
The United States and Russia are at odds over a Bush administration plan to extend the Boeing - managed system into Eastern Europe , using 10 silo - based two - stage interceptors in Poland and a related radar system in the Czech Republic .
With the World Future Energy Summit ( WFES ) being hosted in Masdar , Abu Dhabi next week ( January 19 to 21 ) it is a clear signal that the Arab oil producing states have now set their sights firmly on a renewable energy future .
They are moving away from being oil exporting states to energy exporting states .
With the aim of creating economies and an infrastructure to directly export energy from where it is produced in the sun drenched deserts to where it is most needed in Europe and to export energy technology to the rest of the globe .
Dr Sultan Al Jaber is the CEO of Masdar Initiative and in an interview with the Khaleej Times said :
“ Abu Dhabi is one of the world ’s largest producers of oil and gas , with sufficient reserves to last many generations , but now it is taking bold steps to prepare for the world ’s changing energy demands .
Abu Dhabi also understands the need to diversify its economy , providing fresh career opportunities to nurture local talent .
Masdar will play a role in this by helping to position Abu Dhabi as an intellectual capital hub and ultimately an exporter of advanced technology . ”
The Masdar Initiative was launched by the UAE in April 2006 with the goal of advancing the development , commercialisation and deployment of renewable and alternative energy technologies and solutions .
It is a key element of the Abu Dhabi 2030 Plan and the Government of Abu Dhabi ’s strategic policy framework .
Both of these policies share a vision that seeks to build a sustainable , open and globally competitive economy .
The first annual World Future Engery Summit was held last year in Abu Dhabi with the intention to debate , find solutions and create an open platform for global cooperation to meet the growing energy demands and climate change challenges .
The second annual WFES is also being arranged by Masdar to bring together the world ’s leading innovators , educators , scientists , venture capitalists and experts in the field of alternative and renewable energies .
One key objective of Masdar is to position Abu Dhabi as a world - class research and development hub for future energy technologies , effectively balancing its strong position in an evolving world energy market .
In fact , Masdar City will be home to the largest grid - connected solar power plant in the region .
There are also investments and partnerships being made in other kinds of renewable energy , including wind .
A significant stake has been taken in WinwinD , a leading European turbine manufacturer .
But solar remains key .
In May 2008 , Masdar invested in a new company , Masdar PV in Erfurt , Germany .
Masdar PV is constructing a thin - film PV manufacturing facility , which , once complete , will use advanced production technologies to bring PV closer to grid parity .
Construction of this facility is scheduled to take place in the first quarter of this year .
In addition to developing projects within Abu Dhabi , there are additional projects with partners in other countries .
Torresol Energy , a joint venture between Masdar and Spanish engineering group Sener , has three solar power plants under construction in Spain with an approximate combined value of $ 800 million , one of which will be a CSP Central Tower Receiver System .
The joint venture will feature the first - ever commercial deployment of this technology by 2012 .
Independent of Torresol Energy , Masdar is developing CSP plants in Abu Dhabi , including the flagship project known as SHAMS 1 ( “ sun ” in Arabic ) .
Shams 1 is a 100 MW CSP plant in Madinat Zayed that uses parabolic trough technology and will be scaled up to 2000 MW over time .
The project will be the first of many CSP plants that will feed green power into the Abu Dhabi grid .
The project is finalising bidders at this point in time , and the successful companies will be named in March / April 2009 .
The image is of Masdar Headquarters designed by Norman Foster .
It will measure 1.4 million square foot cost about $ 300 million and have a roof covered in solar panels .
Japan ’s Scariest Suspension Bridge : Dare to Cross ?
Musou Tsuribashi , known as “ Japan ’s Scariest Suspension Bridge ”  , is extremely narrow and precarious .
Located in the Southern Japanese Alps , also known as the Akaishi Mountains , the bridge dates back to the 1950s , marking it as not only the scariest , but also Japan ’s oldest remaining suspension bridge .
The bridge is held together mostly by wire , with thin wooden boards across its width for stabilization .
Additional boards , also very thin , span the length of the bridge so that people can walk across with only as much space as two boards will allow .
As you can see in the video below , the bridge is falling apart and some boards are knocked out of place or even missing .
Before you even reach the bridge you have to climb the side of the mountain , which offers only metal chains to hold onto and is too steep to climb without assistance .
Still , if you like roller coasters , the rotting board on this bridge is sure to make you thrilled you came .
Happy hiking !

Want to know where the $ 350 billion banking bailout went and why it has n’t done a bit of good ?
Read , and weep over , this little - noticed report from the congressional panel set up to monitor the Treasury Department ’s distribution of our taxpayer funds .
The money has done little to ease the credit crunch and has given no help to those facing foreclosure .
Instead , it has been used to fatten the accounts of the very banks that got us into this mess .
In the face of such devastating criticism of the Treasury Department by a panel set up by Congress to monitor the spending , our representatives went right ahead and allocated another $ 350 billion .
The executive summary of the Congressional Oversight Panel ( COP ) report follows .
For the full report , click here .
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
In its first report to Congress on December 10 , 2008 , the Congressional Oversight Panel ( COP or the Panel ) posed ten basic questions – in effect asking for an explanation of the U.S. Department of Treasury ’s goals and methods for the Troubled Asset Relief Program ( TARP ) .
The Panel ’s questions , in turn , included a number of subsidiary questions , which sought additional details from the Treasury .
In total , the Panel sought responses to 45 separate questions about the execution of the authority granted to Treasury under the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act ( EESA ) and the $ 350 billion in taxpayer funds that has been “ effectively allocated ” under that program .
On December 30 , 2008 , Treasury responded to the Panel with a 13 - page letter .
While the letter provided responses to some of the Panel ’s questions and shed light on Treasury ’s decision - making process , it did not provide complete answers to several of the questions and failed to address a number of the questions at all .
To gain a more complete understanding of what Treasury is doing and why , the Panel asks Treasury to provide additional information clarifying its earlier responses .
In order to exercise its legally - mandated oversight functions , the Panel has initiated a number of fact - finding efforts and independent investigations that will be the subject of future reports .
But the Panel ’s independent work does not eliminate the need for Treasury to respond to the Panel ’s questions .
Some of these questions can be answered only by Treasury ( e.g. , Treasury ’s strategic plans ) and others seek to clarify what appear to be significant gaps in Treasury ’s monitoring of the use of taxpayer money ( e.g. , asking financial institutions to account for what they have done with taxpayer funds ) .
To ease the burden on Treasury and to make it clear precisely which questions remain to be answered , the Panel has constructed a grid with its original questions and Treasury ’s responses .
Although many questions remain outstanding , the Panel highlights four specific areas that it believes deserve special attention :
(1) Bank Accountability .
The Panel still does not know what the banks are doing with taxpayer money .
Treasury places substantial emphasis in its December 30 letter on the importance of restoring confidence in the marketplace .
So long as investors and customers are uncertain about how taxpayer funds are being used , they question both the health and the sound management of all financial institutions .
The recent refusal of certain private financial institutions to provide any accounting of how they are using taxpayer money undermines public confidence .
For Treasury to advance funds to these institutions without requiring more transparency further erodes the very confidence Treasury seeks to restore .
Finally , the recent loans extended by Treasury to the auto industry , with their detailed conditions affecting every aspect of the management of those businesses , highlights the absence of any such conditions in the vast majority of TARP transactions .
EESA does not require recipients of TARP funds to make reports on the use of funds .
However , it is within Treasury ’s authority to make such reports a condition of receiving funding , to establish benchmarks for TARP recipient conduct , or to have formal procedures for voluntary reporting by TARP recipient institutions or formal guidelines on the use of funds .
The adoption of any one of these options would further the purposes of helping build and restore the confidence of taxpayers , investors , and policy makers .
(2) Transparency and Asset Evaluation .
The need for transparency is closely related to the issue of accountability .
The confidence that Treasury seeks can be restored only when information is completely transparent and reliable .
Currently , Treasury ’s strategy appears to involve allocating the majority of the $ 700 billion to “ healthy banks , ” banks that have been assessed by their regulators as viable without federal assistance .
Of course , whether a bank is “ healthy ” depends critically on the valuation of the bank ’s assets .
If the banks have not yet recognized losses associated with over - valued assets , then their balance sheets – and Treasury ’s assessment of their health – may be suspect .
Many understood the purpose of EESA to be providing assistance to financial institutions that were “ unhealthy ” and at risk of failing .
Such institutions were at risk , the public was told , due to so - called toxic assets that were impairing their balance sheets .
EESA was designed to provide a mechanism to remove or otherwise provide clear value to those assets .
The case of Citigroup illustrates this problem .
Treasury provided Citigroup with a $ 25 billion cash infusion as part of the “ healthy banks ” program whereby Treasury made nine initial investments in major banks .
About two months later , Treasury provided Citigroup with $ 20 billion in additional equity financing , apparently to avoid systemic failure , but it did not classify that investment as part of the Systemically Significant Failing Institution program ( SSFI program ) .
These events suggest that the marketplace assesses the assets of some banks well below Treasury ’s assessment .
To date no such mechanism to provide more transparent asset valuation has been developed , meaning that the danger posed by those toxic assets remains unaddressed .
The bubble that caused the economic crisis has its foundations in toxic mortgage assets .
Until asset valuation is more transparent and until the market is confident that the banks have written down bad loans and accurately priced their assets , efforts to restore stability and confidence in the financial system may fail .
( 3 ) Foreclosures .
The crisis in the housing sector continues to affect any efforts at recovery .
In enacting EESA , Congress called upon Treasury to “ implement a plan that seeks to maximize assistance for homeowners and use the authority of the Secretary to encourage the servicers of the underlying mortgages , considering net present value to the taxpayer , to take advantage of the HOPE for Homeowners Program under section 257 of the National Housing Act or other available programs to minimize foreclosures .
In addition , the Secretary may use loan guarantees and credit enhancements to facilitate loan modifications to prevent avoidable foreclosures . ”
When Congress authorized the Panel , it specifically requested that the Panel evaluate “ the effectiveness of foreclosure mitigation efforts . ”
4
While the statute contemplates that foreclosure mitigation would be accomplished through the purchase of mortgage - related assets , many believe that Treasury has clear authority to use a portion of the $ 700 billion to address mortgage foreclosures in other ways .
For Treasury to take no steps to use any of this money to alleviate the foreclosure crisis raises questions about whether Treasury has complied with Congress ’s intent that Treasury develop a “ plan that seeks to maximize assistance for homeowners . ”
( 4 ) Strategy .
The Panel ’s initial concerns about the TARP have only grown , exacerbated by the shifting explanations of its purposes and the tools used by Treasury .
It is not enough to say that the goal is the stabilization of the financial markets and the broader economy .
That goal is widely accepted .
The question is how the infusion of billions of dollars to an insurance conglomerate or a credit card company advances both the goal of financial stability and the well - being of taxpayers , including homeowners threatened by foreclosure , people losing their jobs , and families unable to pay their credit cards .
It would be constructive for Treasury to clearly identify the types of institutions it believes fall under the purview of EESA and which do not and the appropriate uses of TARP funds .
The need for Treasury to address these fundamental issues of strategy has only intensified since our last report .
The issues related to strategy have wider implications as well .
It appears that Treasury in its post - American International Group , Inc. ( AIG ) actions is using public dollars to support the value of equity in financial institutions .
What strategy lies behind that decision ?
What about other alternatives ?
Would it be better and more cost effective to encourage private capital investors to assume control of such banks ?
Should those banks be required to maintain higher capital or liquidity positions or to pay higher Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ( FDIC ) insurance premiums ?
Should we focus on ensuring that systemically significant institutions meet their fixed obligations and let the equity in such institutions be fully at risk , as we did in AIG ?
Should we simply let market forces work – letting sick banks fail and the healthy banks take the business ?
The Panel does not embrace any of these suggestions .
Instead , it asks whether Treasury is involved in that re-thinking process .
The Panel recognizes that Treasury has many pressing obligations , and the Panel appreciates Treasury ’s efforts to give timely responses .
Ultimately , the Panel hopes that by posing these questions and offering these comments that it can be helpful to Treasury as it attempts to find more effective tools to deal with the current financial crisis .

Apache Holds Steady Market Share , Still Dominating Microsoft IIS
by Ostatic Staff - Jan. 20 , 2009
Last March , we noted a decline in the dominance of the Apache web server , based on market research numbers from Netcraft , but we also noted that Apache continues to be much more popular than Microsoft IIS .
Netcraft is out with new numbers for January of this year , which show Apache 's market share growing about one percent for the month and staying very steady at about 50 percent of the web server market .
Meanwhile , Microsoft 's IIS is losing share .
Here are some thoughts on Netcraft 's findings .
The following Netcraft chart shows market share for top web servers across all domains , for the period ranging from August 1995 to January 2009 .
Apache 's overall market share remains at just above 50 percent , which is about where it was when we looked at Netcraft 's numbers last March .
However , Netcraft is reporting monthly losses for Microsoft IIS :
" Apache 's market share grew by more than 1 percentage point this month , extending its lead over Microsoft IIS , which has fallen to less than a third of the market .
In total , Apache gained 1.27 million sites this month .
Microsoft showed the largest loss this month , after more than 2 million blogging sites running on Microsoft - IIS websites expired from the survey . "
GFE , which is mainly used by Google 's Blogger service to publish blogs under the blogspot.com domain , also lost nearly 600 thousand sites .
However , the number of sites hosted on httpd and WebserverX both increased by about 20 percent .
The chart above shows that Apache sank from about 70 percent market share to about 50 percent between 2005 and 2008 , and that caused many people in the open source world to predict that the fall would continue .
It does n't look like that 's the case , though , proving once again that you definitely can't count Apache out .

The 10 Best Areas To Buy [... ]
This week , The Flash : Emergency Stop hits the shelves .
The trade paperback covers half of the year - long Grant Morrison / Mark Millar run from the late 1990s , and , according to solicitations , features the conclusion of “ Three of a Kind . ”
This three - part crossover between Green Lantern , Green Arrow , and The Flash features the second– and third - generation heroes Kyle Rayner , Connor Hawke , and Wally West .
Villains Heat Wave , Sonar , and Hatchet attack a cruise liner in which Dr. Polaris is being secretly transported , only to find the three heroes have booked a vacation on the same ship . *
The segment in The Flash v.2 # 135 focuses on the villains ’ trial , with flashbacks to the incident .
At the time , Wally West ’s identity was public knowledge , though he testified in full costume .
This in itself is unusual given standard courtroom dress codes ( a skin - tight bright red costume is n’t exactly conservative business attire , and tends to stand out a bit ) .
But then Green Lantern takes the witness stand :
The usage is similar to the U.S. Constitution ’s 5th Amendment , which states in part that “ No person … shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself . ”
Two things can be gathered from these panels :
The DC Universe had a “ Federal Authority of Registered Meta - Humans ” years before Marvel ’s Civil War ( though after the first story with the Mutant Registration Act ) .
( though after the first story with the Mutant Registration Act ) .
The DCU version of the United States Constitution has a Twelfth Amendment which , under some circumstances , allows witnesses to give an alias rather than a real name when testifying in court .
There ’s no indication that it ’s required to register , or whether it ’s simply a good idea if you want legal backing .
It ’s not even clear whether heroes have to register under their real names .
I ca n’t remember whether any other books made reference to this authority , but suddenly I really want to find and reread my back issues of Chase .
In the real world , the Twelfth Amendment dates back to 1803 ( passed 1804 ) and changes the way the President and Vice - President are elected .
Assuming the DCU ’s US just has one more Constitutional amendment than we do , their Twelfth would be just about as old , which leads to the question :
Why did they need to amend the supreme law of the land to allow masked heroes to testify 130 years before the Golden Age of super - heroes ?
Thinking about it , though , DC does have super - heroes whose adventures take place in earlier eras , especially in North America .
Not just heroes of the Western genre like Jonah Hex or Bat Lash , but classical super - heroes with masks , costumes and powers .
Max Mercury ’s origin dates back to the early 1800s , for instance , and Miss Liberty ( an ancestor of Jesse Quick / Liberty Belle ) fought in the American Revolution .
Might the early United States in the DC Universe have decided it was worth letting some of their more colorful national heroes remain pseudonymous even in legal proceedings ?
It ’s certainly possible .
Whatever the circumstances of its passage , it sheds some light on the otherwise nonsensical fact that Barry Allen kept his mask on and his identity secret from his arrest all the way through his trial for manslaughter in the case of Professor Zoom ’s death , dissected in great detail by Bob Ingersoll .
* It ’s a little more complicated than that , of course .

Bill Clinton , Obama transition team reach agreement Nick Cargo
Published : Sunday November 30 , 2008
Print This Email This Former President Bill Clinton will stay true to his word on doing " whatever it takes " to ease the appointment of his wife , Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton , to the post of Secretary of State under President - elect Barack Obama .
The Senator 's elevation is expected to be officially announced at a Chicago hotel during a news conference starting at 10:40 am Eastern .
" It speaks to President Clinton 's willingness to do more than what 's asked of him , " a Democratic official familiar with the negotiations said .
Mr. Clinton , the New York Times reported , has agreed with the Obama transition team to nine conditions that include publicly disclosing the names of 208,000 donors to the William J. Clinton Foundation , which include Saudi royals , the king of Morocco , and the governments of Qatar and Kuwait .
Future donors will also be disclosed during Sen. Clinton 's term .
The William J. Clinton Foundation has raised over $ 500 million since its creation in 1997 .
The funds have gone towards charitable programs and building a presidential library .
Mr. Clinton made $ 10.1 million from 54 speeches in 2007 .
The other conditions agreed to include separating the Clinton Global Initiative from the main foundation to reduce Mr. Clinton 's direct involvement .
The Initiative will no longer hold its annual meetings outside the United States and will not accept new contributions from foreign governments .
The Clinton Foundation 's HIV / AIDS Initiative will , however , be allowed to continue its work with governments such France , Great Britain , Norway and Sweden .
If new countries or entities enter into agreements with , or an existing country increases its contribution to , the Initiative , the State Department will be notified , and if necessary , White House counsel will review the changes .
None of the nine conditions is required by law , and " all of them go above and beyond the requirements of the law to avoid even the appearance of a conflict of interest . "

~~ BBC article describing U.S. military plans to fight the Internet , 1/27/06
Dear friends ,
The highly informative BBC article below describes disturbing plans by the U.S. military to control the Internet .
A U.S. military document recently uncovered through the Freedom of Information Act reveals an " Information Operations Roadmap " in which plans are being made based on the premise that the military will view the Internet " as it would an enemy weapons system . "
The document is signed by U.S. Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld .
If you care about freedom of information on the Internet , this is a vitally important article .
A Google News search on the military 's " Information Operations Roadmap " reveals that , of major media in the US , only the Los Angeles Times , Newsday , and ABC even mention the recently released " Information Operations Roadmap , " and none of these give much detail .
Why is the U.S. media so reluctant to report on these matters which are vital to the preservation of freedom of speech guaranteed in the first amendment of the U.S. constitution ?
If you care about preserving the free flow of information over the Internet , please spread the news about this most important BBC article .
Together , we can and will build a brighter future .
With best wishes ,

US plans to ' fight the net ' revealed
By Adam Brookes
BBC Pentagon correspondent
A newly declassified document gives a fascinating glimpse into the US military 's plans for " information operations " - from psychological operations , to attacks on hostile computer networks .
Bloggers beware .
As the world turns networked , the Pentagon is calculating the military opportunities that computer networks , wireless technologies and the modern media offer .
From influencing public opinion through new media to designing " computer network attack " weapons , the US military is learning to fight an electronic war .
The declassified document is called " Information Operations Roadmap " .
It was obtained by the National Security Archive at George Washington University using the Freedom of Information Act .
Officials in the Pentagon wrote it in 2003 .
The Secretary of Defense , Donald Rumsfeld , signed it .
The " roadmap " calls for a far - reaching overhaul of the military 's ability to conduct information operations and electronic warfare .
And , in some detail , it makes recommendations for how the US armed forces should think about this new , virtual warfare .
The document says that information is " critical to military success " .
Computer and telecommunications networks are of vital operational importance .
Propaganda
The operations described in the document include a surprising range of military activities : public affairs officers who brief journalists , psychological operations troops who try to manipulate the thoughts and beliefs of an enemy , computer network attack specialists who seek to destroy enemy networks .
All these are engaged in information operations .
Perhaps the most startling aspect of the roadmap is its acknowledgement that information put out as part of the military 's psychological operations , or Psyops , is finding its way onto the computer and television screens of ordinary Americans .
" Information intended for foreign audiences , including public diplomacy and Psyops , is increasingly consumed by our domestic audience , " it reads .
" Psyops messages will often be replayed by the news media for much larger audiences , including the American public , " it goes on .
The document 's authors acknowledge that American news media should not unwittingly broadcast military propaganda .
" Specific boundaries should be established , " they write .
But they do n't seem to explain how .
" In this day and age it is impossible to prevent stories that are fed abroad as part of psychological operations propaganda from blowing back into the United States - even though they were directed abroad , " says Kristin Adair of the National Security Archive .
Credibility problem
Public awareness of the US military 's information operations is low , but it 's growing - thanks to some operational clumsiness .
Late last year , it emerged that the Pentagon had paid a private company , the Lincoln Group , to plant hundreds of stories in Iraqi newspapers .
The stories - all supportive of US policy - were written by military personnel and then placed in Iraqi publications .
And websites that appeared to be information sites on the politics of Africa and the Balkans were found to be run by the Pentagon .
But the true extent of the Pentagon 's information operations , how they work , who they 're aimed at , and at what point they turn from informing the public to influencing populations , is far from clear .
The roadmap , however , gives a flavour of what the US military is up to - and the grand scale on which it 's thinking .
It reveals that Psyops personnel " support " the American government 's international broadcasting .
It singles out TV Marti - a station which broadcasts to Cuba - as receiving such support .
It recommends that a global website be established that supports America 's strategic objectives .
But no American diplomats here , thank you .
The website would use content from " third parties with greater credibility to foreign audiences than US officials " .
It also recommends that Psyops personnel should consider a range of technologies to disseminate propaganda in enemy territory : unmanned aerial vehicles , " miniaturized , scatterable public address systems " , wireless devices , cellular phones and the internet .
' Fight the net '
When it describes plans for electronic warfare , or EW , the document takes on an extraordinary tone .
It seems to see the internet as being equivalent to an enemy weapons system .
" Strategy should be based on the premise that the Department [ of Defense ] will ' fight the net ' as it would an enemy weapons system , " it reads .
The slogan " fight the net " appears several times throughout the roadmap .
The authors warn that US networks are very vulnerable to attack by hackers , enemies seeking to disable them , or spies looking for intelligence .
" Networks are growing faster than we can defend them ...
Attack sophistication is increasing ...
Number of events is increasing . "
US digital ambition
And , in a grand finale , the document recommends that the United States should seek the ability to " provide maximum control of the entire electromagnetic spectrum " .
US forces should be able to " disrupt or destroy the full spectrum of globally emerging communications systems , sensors , and weapons systems dependent on the electromagnetic spectrum " .
Consider that for a moment .
The US military seeks the capability to knock out every telephone , every networked computer , every radar system on the planet .
Are these plans the pipe dreams of self - aggrandising bureaucrats ?
Or are they real ?
The fact that the " Information Operations Roadmap " is approved by the Secretary of Defense suggests that these plans are taken very seriously indeed in the Pentagon .
And that the scale and grandeur of the digital revolution is matched only by the US military 's ambitions for it .

Henri Sivonen :
The effort of putting an HTML5 parser inside Gecko takes a step out of the vaporware land .
I can confirm that it displays this page , served as text / html as well as the same bytes served as application / xhtml+xml .
For comparison , Chrome does nearly as well , simply omitting the SVG images .
Opera does n’t fare as well , apparently not recognizing the self - closing SVG tags .
IE 8 ’s support is simply sad , well beyond the lack of processing of SVG images .
I ’ll also note that the HTML5 validator does n’t yet accept SVG in content served as text / html .
Hopefully the SVG and WHATWG / HTML5 working groups can resolve their differences in 2009 and this can be fixed .
Henri ’s approach is interesting .
He starts from a single source , in Java .
The Java code can be compiled to Java byte codes , JavaScript source , or C++ presumably making use of Mozilla libraries for things such as memory management .
If he can do that , it seems to me to be a rather small leap from there to producing C++ using , say , either Ruby or Python libraries for memory management , as well as a thin binding to the language .
C# would also be a reasonable target .
If this could be done , and made available under a liberal license , it could go a long way towards making available consistent and performant implementations of the HTML5 parser algorithm everywhere .

HOUSTON ( Reuters ) - Halliburton
Co will pay a $ 559 million fine to end an investigation of its former KBR Inc unit if the U.S. government approves the settlement , the largest penalty against a U.S. company for charges of bribery under federal law .
A Pentagon audit of Halliburton , the oil services firm once run by Vice President Dick Cheney , has found the company overcharged for fuel it brought into Iraq from Kuwait , military sources said on December 11 , 2003 .
REUTERS / Richard Carson RC/HB/SV
Halliburton , once headed by former Vice President Dick Cheney , said it was awaiting final approval from the U.S. Department of Justice and the Securities and Exchange Commission to settle claims that KBR violated anti-bribery laws by paying kickbacks to Nigerian officials .
Under the settlement , Halliburton would pay $ 382 million to the Department of Justice and $ 177 million to the Securities and Exchange Commission in “ disgorgement . ”
KBR did not comment on the proposed settlement .
Halliburton said in regulatory filings last July that it was in settlement talks with the government .
Dan Newcomb , a partner at law firm Shearman and Sterling in New York who specializes in Foreign Corrupt Practices Act ( FCPA ) law , said it was likely more companies involved in anti-corruption cases would settle with the U.S. government .
Under the FCPA , it is illegal for U.S. companies or their agents to use bribes to win foreign business .
Other oilfield service companies including Schlumberger Ltd and Transocean are being scrutinized by U.S. officials for possible FCPA violations .
Both companies said they were cooperating with the U.S. government .
In April 2007 , oilfield services company Baker Hughes reached a $ 44.1 million settlement with U.S. officials related to a bribery probe of its operations in Nigeria , Angola and Kazakhstan .
In December , German engineering conglomerate Siemens paid $ 800 million to U.S. officials to settle claims that it violated the FCPA .
The U.S. government ’s probe of Halliburton related to construction and expansion of a gas liquefaction facility at Bonny Island in Rivers State , Nigeria , and other projects dating back as much as 20 years , Halliburton has said in regulatory filings .
In July , Halliburton said it had “ reason to believe ” payments may have been made to Nigerian officials by agents of its TSKJ consortium , which built the Bonny Island Facility .
The TSKJ consortium includes France ’s Technip SA , Italy ’s Snamprogetti and Japan ’s JGC Corp .
As part of the settlement , Halliburton said it would not be required to have a monitor , but the company would have to retain an independent consultant to assess its compliance with anti-bribery laws .
Albert “ Jack ” Stanley , a former KBR chief executive officer , pleaded guilty in September to charges stemming from a scheme to pay $ 180 million in bribes to Nigerian government officials for work on the Bonny Island LNG plant .
Stanley , who had worked under Dick Cheney when he headed Halliburton , agreed to cooperate with U.S. investigators probing Halliburton ’s potential violations of the FCPA .
Shares of Halliburton were up 2.1 percent at $ 18.64 in afternoon trade on the New York Stock Exchange .
Earlier on Monday , the company , headquartered in Dubai and Houston , reported a better - than - expected fourth - quarter profit .
Violent clashes broke out in Athens last night on the eighth day of rioting in protest at the police killing of a teenager .
Youths attacked a police station , shops and banks and fought running battles with police , as candlelit vigils were being held to mark a week since the fatal shooting of 15 - year - old Alexandros Grigoropoulos .
Several hundred protesters set up burning barricades and attacked police with rocks and flares .
Riot police fired teargas and chased the youths through parts of the Greek capital .
The protesters chanted " murderers out " and used laser pointers to target officers for attack .
Violence has wracked Greece every day since the death of Grigoropoulos .
The protesters are demonstrating against not just the boy 's death but at an increasingly unpopular government and mounting economic worries .
The riots in cities across the country have left at least 70 people injured .
Hundreds of shops have been attacked and looted , and more than 200 people arrested .
While most of the protests have been peaceful , the tone of the demonstrations has been set by a violent fringe , with more young people willing to join such elements than in the past .
Athens remained calm this morning , with no plans for further protests .
Traffic returned to normal in the city centre and an open - topped double - decker bus carried tourists round the capital 's main sights .
An opinion poll published today in the Kathimerini newspaper found that most Greeks consider the violence as more than a simple reaction to the shooting .
Asked whether the riots constituted a social uprising , 60 % responded yes .
Sixty - four percent said police were unprepared for the violence .
The protesters promised to remain on the streets until their concerns are addressed .
One protester , 32 - year - old Paris Kyriakides , said : " Speaking as an anarchist , we want to create those social conditions that will generate more uprisings and to get more people out in the streets to demand their rights .
" In the end , the violence that we use is minimal in comparison to the violence the system uses , like the banks . "

12 Cycling Myths , Exposed !
Myth # 1 : Biking requires too much gear .
Reality :
The basic necessities for cycling are just you , a bike and a helmet .
While other gear is nice to have , it can come later .
Just get on a bike and go .
Myth # 2 : It 's costly to buy a bike and cycling gear .
Reality : Maybe , but it's far cheaper than buying and operating a car .
Per a 2013 AAA study , a car costs an average of $ 9,122 per year to operate ( based on 15,000 miles ) .
Bikes , on the other hand , do n't need gas and are free to park .
They have fewer components and require less - expensive maintenance .
Myth # 3 : Only expensive bikes are any good .
Reality :
While pricey bikes can be " nicer " to ride , almost any bike in good working condition can get you to where you want to go .
It may take you longer or not have gears for uphills , but you will get there .
Myth # 4 : Biking takes too much time .
Reality :
It usually requires extra planning and riding time , but , depending on the distance and traffic , it might actually take less time to bike than it does to drive .
Plus , you burn calories and can run errands while you ride .
Myth # 5 : Bicycling is too dangerous .
Reality : Most cyclists ride for many years without mishap .
Acting like a driver , being predictable , wearing bright clothing , being aware of your surroundings , anticipating driver behavior , making eye contact with drivers , having hands ready on brakes , watching for car doors opening , following traffic rules and claiming your lane will help improve your safety .
For details , see the REI Expert Advice article , Riding Your Bike in Traffic .
Myth # 6 : Bike seats are uncomfortable .
Reality : Bikes usually come with a generic , unisex saddle .
If yours feels uncomfortable , try upgrading to one with gel padding or one that 's gender specific .
Bike seats also come in different sizes and shapes , such as cutaway models .
For details , see the REI Expert Advice article , Bike Saddles : How to Choose .
Myth # 7 : I 'm clueless about how to maintain my bike .
Reality : That 's OK ; it 's easy to learn the basics .
Sign up for a class at your local REI store or take advantage of our online how - to videos and articles .
Or , if bike - maintenance is really not your thing , there 's no shame in taking your ride to your REI Bike Shop for a professional tune - up or repair .
Myth # 8 : I 'm too out of shape to ride .
Reality : Riding your bike will help you get back into shape .
In the beginning , do n't be afraid to stop and walk — especially on a hill .
The more you bike , the easier it will get .
Of course , if you have a serious health condition , check with your doctor before riding .
Myth # 9 : You can't carry much stuff on a bike .
Reality : You'd be surprised how many groceries or work items you can bring on a bike .
Start by wearing a daypack or messenger bag , or add a rack and carry your things in panniers or attachable bags .
For even bigger loads , consider a bike trailer .
Myth # 10 : It 's too far for me to commute to work .
Reality :
You can always ride just part of the way or only one way .
Drive to a different starting point to reduce the distance .
Catch a ride to work with someone and bike home .
Or take the bus — most have a rack in front for bicycles .
Myth # 11 : I 'll get sweaty .
Reality : Sometimes this can be difficult to avoid , but you can always just ride casually to avoid too much exertion .
If possible , ride in the morning when it 's cooler .
Remember , when you 're cycling you will usually catch a breeze to help cool off .
Myth # 12 : My work clothes will get wrinkled .
Reality :
If you decide to ride to work , pack along work clothes with fabrics that are less prone to wrinkles when packed , or use packing folders and cubes to reduce wrinkles .
On those days when you 're driving or going by bus , bring clothes for your bike - riding days so you do n't have to carry them when you ride .
Before You Ride
Bike Maintenance
A bike that is in shape makes the ride much more enjoyable .
If your bike has n't been used in a long time or you 've noticed a specific problem , take it to your local REI Bike Shop or independent bike shop for a tune - up .
If you want to do the tune - up yourself , read our Expert Advice article on bike maintenance , take a class or get a book that teaches the basics of bike maintenance .
Video : Pre-ride Inspection
Before taking your bike out for a spin , make sure it 's comfortable , safe and ready to go .
Our video demonstrates some of the pointers explained below :
Size :
Does the bike fit you ?
There should be at least 1 " - 2 " of clearance between you and the top tube ( bar ) on a road bike and at least 2 " - 4 " on a mountain bike .

Seat height :
Check that the saddle ( seat ) is adjusted at the right height for you .
Personal preference determines whether the saddle should be tipped forward , level or backward .
Having the saddle at the right height and forward / aft position for pedaling is important to your knees .
The correct position is achieved when , with your leg extended in the 6 o'clock position , your knee is just slightly bent .
Check that the saddle ( seat ) is adjusted at the right height for you .
Wheels :
Make sure the quick - release levers ( or bolts on older bikes ) are fully secured .

Chain :
Make sure it is lubricated .
Rotate the crank backwards and look for hitches in the movement .
Fit Your Helmet
A helmet can only work if you wear it .
In fact , helmets are 85 % - 88 % effective in preventing head and brain injuries .
( Source : The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration , www.nhtsa.gov.)
Also , some state or local laws require a helmet , and you could even get a ticket if you do n't wear one .
Tip :
For your state and selected international info , visit the Bicycle Helmet Safety Institute 's Web site , www.helmets.org/mandator.htm.
It 's also important to have it fit properly .
Heads come in different sizes and so do helmets , so get the right size .
For tip on adjusting the fit , watch our helmet - fitting video above .
Here are the basic steps :
Adjust the fit dial or cinching mechanism ( or add / remove interior pads if provided ) so the helmet fits snugly , but comfortably .
The helmet should be level on your head , about 1 or 2 finger - widths above the eyebrow .
If it falls below the eyebrows , it is too big .
If it does not reach to just above the eyebrows , it is too small .
Where the straps form a " Y , " make sure the slider is just under the earlobe .
A buckled chinstrap should be snug with no more than 1 or 2 fingers width space between the chin and the strap .
Final checks :
Shake your head .
If the helmet moves to a different position , readjust so it 's more secure .
You should be able to open your mouth wide without the chinstrap pulling the helmet down .
In the United States , helmets must meet the standards of the Consumer Product Safety Commission ( CSPC ) .
A CSPC label may be found inside the helmet or on the packaging .
Tip :
For children , do n't buy a helmet " to grow into . "
Get one that fits right for proper protection .
Pick a Safe Route
It may be a no - brainer on which route you want to take , but if you 're not sure :
Ask a fellow cyclist :
If there is a friend or coworker who already bikes to work , talk to him or her .
Contact a local biking club or bike shop .
Sometimes they will have local insights you can't find online .
Go online : Check the websites of local biking clubs , city transportation departments or your state 's Department of Transportation .
Message boards can be helpful , too .
Ones in your area can assist you with routes or answer questions you might have .
When selecting your route , consider road construction , heavy traffic , crime problem areas , dogs , hills and whether or not the streets have a bike lane or shoulder .
Tip : Try Google 's directions at maps.google.com , zoom into your area then type your start and end address .
Click and drag on it to change routes .
You get a route and mileage totals , too .
Take a Practice Spin
To ride a bike , you just need to know how to pedal , steer and stop .
Get reacquainted the fundamentals of controlling your momentum .
Remember to always follow the rules of the road and be aware of your surroundings .
If it has been a while since you last saddled up , here are a few tips for your first time out :
Find a vacant parking lot , sidewalk or paved biking trail that is not crowded .
Get a feel for the brakes — squeeze the levers slowly and gently .
When braking , squeeze the rear brake first and then the front brake .
Stopping quickly with the front brake only can cause the front tire to lock and the rear tire to rise up .
And that means you could go over the handlebar !
Coast with your feet in the air and get a feel of steering and balance .
Next try using the pedals , steering and then the brakes .
Avoid braking and steering at the same time , especially with the front brake .
If using clip - in pedals , practice clipping in and unclipping , releasing and stopping .
Before going on the road and in traffic , practice starting and stopping uphill and downhill .
For more details on riding uphill see climbing hills .
For more info on riding downhill , see riding downhill .
Tip : Keep the pedals in a horizontal position when braking .
This helps provide more braking power and keeps your feet away from any road hazards .
Riding Tips
Next , get on your bike and go .
Go to a store for an errand , bike to a friend 's house or meet someone for coffee .
Give yourself a goal .
On weekends , you might want to bike to your workplace to get a feel for what it would be commuting during the week ( remember , traffic will most likely be heavier when biking during commute hours ) .
If you do want to cycle to work , consider just trying it one - way in the beginning .
Take the bus or have someone drop you and your bike at work in the morning , and then try biking home when you do n't have the pressure of getting to work on time .
Tip : Find a friend or coworker who can be a mentor .
Or consider a basic road biking class with the REI Outdoor School .
Shifting Gears
Shifting at the optimum times will make your ride easier .
You do n't want to be pedaling in a high gear when going uphill ; you 'll be exhausted .
You want to use a lower gear so you are n't pushing on the pedals so hard .
You 'll also have more fun when cruising on the downhill in a high gear at a fast speed .
The easier it is to pedal , the more you can shift up .
Or , you can take the downhill slowly and pump the brakes to decease speed .
Whatever gear combination you 're using , try to keep the chain so it is not being stretched diagonally .
For instance , avoid being on a high chainring and first gear .
This approach encourages a longer chainring life .
If you have a bike computer on your bike , you can check the cadence ( the number of times your pedals go around per minute ) .
The most efficient cadence , or pedaling rate , is between 70 to 90 revolutions per minute .
Riding in Traffic
Maybe you 're one of the lucky ones who have a designated bike path to use or a marked bike lane .
But at some time or some place , you 'll probably have to ride in traffic .
It 's really not that scary .
In general , bicyclists follow the same rules of the road as car drivers .
Just pretend you 're driving your car instead of your bike .
In this way , drivers know what to expect , and it 's safer for everyone .
Riding guidelines :
Go with traffic , not against it .
Follow traffic signals , signs and pavement markings .
Yield to pedestrians and other vehicles .
Get off of the road when you 're not moving .
Do n't pass on the right .
Watch what is happening behind you .
To make this easier , consider wearing a helmet - mounted or eyeglass - mounted mirror .
If there are more than 5 cars behind you , pull over and let them pass .
Ride straight , and do n't swerve in and out of traffic .
When turning , slowing or stopping , use hand signals to let others know what you are doing .
Look back over your shoulder , especially when changing lanes or making a turn .
Wear something bright ; do n't expect drivers to see you .
Watch for vehicles coming out of alleys , they may not see you .
Make noise — use a horn , bell or whistle or yell .
Semi -trucks have a blind spot when turning ; stay out of this blind spot .
If a vehicle blocks your view , move to the side or slow down to see around it .
Be ready to brake , keeping your hands near or on the brake levers so you can stop fast .
To see hazards , keep at least 4 feet of distance between you and any vehicle .
Pedal strong when going through intersections .
Watch for drivers who forget to signal .
Be predictable .
Tip : Just because you 're on a bike , does n't mean you can't be cited for a traffic violation .
Follow the rules of the road .

Lane Position
This is a common discussion among cyclists , especially those of us who ride only occasionally .
Our thoughts :
Stay to the right when lanes are wide and there is lots of room .
This allows vehicles to pass you most easily .
Claim the lane ( i.e. , ride in the center of the lane ) in these situations :
Where roads are too narrow for cars to safely pass
You 're in a tunnel , underpass or dark area
When a parked car 's doors are opening
Where there are sewer grates , uneven shoulders and debris
If you 're moving at the same speed as the traffic .
This makes you more visible and more likely to be passed only when there is enough room .
Riding Hazards
Do not use headphones .
Listen to your surroundings .
Watch and listen for car doors opening .
Do n't ride closer than 4 feet to a car , and listen for hints of movement .
Watch for ground hazards like drain grates that can catch your tire .
Do n't follow a vehicle so closely that you have a blind spot .
You may not see a hazard ( e.g. , a pothole ) until it 's too late .
Watch for debris or rough roadways .
Try to cross railroad tracks at a 90 - degree angle to avoid catching a tire .
When riding on a highway and being passed by a large truck or bus , be prepared to be pulled to the left from the vehicle 's wake .
When passing other cyclists or walkers , ring a bell or announce " on your left " so they do n't swerve into you .
Keep space between you and other cyclists .
Darkness and Bad Weather
You want to see and be seen when visibility is poor :
Use a white front light and a red , flashing rear light .
Consider a headlamp or helmet - mounted headlight to give you more light and to help gain a driver 's attention .
Have reflectors on both the front and rear of your bike .
New bikes come with them , but you may want to add more for extra visibility .
Increase visibility by adding reflectors or reflective tape on moving parts of your bike .
Wear bright clothing .
Wear a reflective vest , jacket , wristbands and / or leg bands .
In wet or cold weather :
Give yourself extra room in rain , ice , frost , snow or fog .
When it is wet , the pavement will be oily and slippery .
Your brakes will be wet , too .
Bridges and overpasses will be icier than roads .
The Bus and the Biker
Some bike commuters do a combination of cycling and taking a bus .
Depending on where you live , buses may offer a front rack to hold bicycles .
While there are usually instructions printed on the bike rack , it is up to you to load your bike properly .
Bikes with child carriers or no - spoke wheels usually cannot be put on the rack .
Some bikes with wide handlebars or long wheelbases might not fit .
Prepare the bike for loading before the bus arrives .
Remove all loose items ( pumps , helmets , water bottles , etc. ) .
Do not step in front of the bus until the driver sees you .
Load your bike in the spot farthest from the bus or in the next open position .
Lift the support arm and hook it over the front tire .
Make sure the support arm clamps the tire , not the frame or fender .
At your stop , remind the driver you will be unloading your bike before you exit .
Remove the support arm , lower it into place and remove your bike .
Fold the rack up if it is empty .
Step onto the sidewalk and wait for the bus to leave .
If you 're just riding to the park - and - ride , look for a secure way to store your bike there after you hop a bus or do a carpool or vanpool .
Some transit facilities have lockers for this purpose .
Parking and Locking Your Bike
No matter where you ride , it 's a good idea to secure your bike .
If commuting , try to keep your bike in your office or other secured area .
If you are parking outside , use a bike rack or some other secure , unmovable object and ideally lock BOTH wheels and the frame to it .
Most bikes offer a quick - release front tire to facilitate this effort .
Always lock it to something — do n't lock just the bike — as it is easy to pick up and carry away .
Remember , aluminum or wooden posts , trees or to chain link fences might look secure , but they can be cut by determined thieves .
Check with the local police department for rules on where bikes can be parked and locked .
Some places may be illegal .
Use either a cable lock , a U - lock , one of each , 2 U - locks and / or a combo lock .
The more time and trouble it takes a thief to attack your bike lock , the less likely it is will be taken .
See the REI Expert Advice article , Bike Locks : How to Choose for details .
Try to lock it in a well - lighted , well - traveled location .
Some parking lots offer a place for bikes at a reduced parking rate .
Unfasten and carry with you any parts that can be easily removed — bike bag , pump , computer , lights or quick - release seat .
Tips :
Register your bike 's serial number with the National Bike Registry ( www.nationalbikeregistry.com).
If your bike gets stolen and is later recovered , no matter where , it can be returned to you .
Even if you do n't need a lock during the workday , have one with you in case you stop somewhere along your route .
Do not use a lock larger than you really need .
A tight - fitting lock makes it more difficult for thieves to get their tools into position to try breaking the lock .
If you have a tubular pin-tumbler - style lock made in 2004 or earlier , you should replace it .
Thieves have figured out how to disable these locks .

Arriving at Work or Your Destination
Cleaning Up :
If you 're fortunate enough to have showers at your workplace , you have it easy .
If not , you 're not completely out of luck .
Try these suggestions :
The " birdbath " option : Just use a washcloth , small towel and a bathroom sink to freshen up .
Pre-moistened towelettes can work in a pinch .
Join a nearby gym .
Some gyms will even sell you a " shower only " membership at a reduced rate .
Keep your cleaning and primping supplies at the workplace or gym so you do not have to carry them on the commute , too .
If you can't wash up as much as you 'd like , consider taking your bike on the bus with you in the morning , and then bike home after work when it does n't matter if you get sweaty .
Dressing Up :
You can either carry your work clothes with you , or you can shuttle a supply of fresh clothes to your workplace on a non-biking day .
If you do not have a locker room , try your desk , a closet , behind a door or even between partitions for storage .
Try to use clothing that is less likely to wrinkle .
Keep extra shoes at the workplace .
Keep a set of clean undies , socks and accessories at the workplace in case you forget one day .
