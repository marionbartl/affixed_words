Michael Rubin :
If Obama decides it is in America ’s interest to make an example of Israel after the Gaza flotilla incident in order to win goodwill in Cairo , Beirut , Tehran , and Ankara , then he must also recognize that the leadership in Jerusalem is going to conclude that it cannot trust the United States to safeguard its security , and that therefore it must take matters into its own hands on any number of issues , not the least of which is Iran ’s nuclear program .
In effect , if the White House decides to come down hard on Israel now , it is the same as giving a green light for Israel to strike Iran .
Rubin quickly claims that he is not engaging in “ advocacy ” for an Israeli strike on Iran , just as he claims to be opposed to military against Iran in general .
( The real question , of course , is not whether bombing Iran would be his first choice but whether he prefers war to containment and deterrence as a last resort ) .
But the threat is clear : keep quiet on the flotilla attack , or Israel starts a war with Iran — thereby destabilizing the region and jeopardizing the U.S. military efforts in Iraq and Afghanistan .
The obvious word for this is “ blackmail ” .
The way things are going , we can expect global warming to wipe out humanity in the next few years .
Or never , it 's not completely clear .
So why dwell on negatives like drowning deaths and widespread panic ?
There 's a bright side of our impending doom to look forward to and plenty of good things catastrophic climate change may bring to you ( and the environment ) .
6 It Could Delay a Far Worse Ice Age
Continue Reading Below Advertisement
In general , humans do better in extreme heat than extreme cold -- a lot more of us live around the warm equator than the frigid poles .
So it makes sense that global warming would n't be nearly the disaster that , say , a new Ice Age would be .
Especially when you take into account the fact that we 've yet to find crops that like to grow under three feet of ice .
A new Ice Age is n't the stuff of science fiction , either .
These cooling periods have happened at least four times that we know about , caused by slight changes in the Earth 's orbit around the Sun that happen from time to time .
It 's a regular cycle .
Our current warming is not , however , part of that cycle .
Right now we should be cooling down , but thanks to those brave souls who refuse to give up Hummers , make margaritas with diesel - powered blenders and drive their hovercrafts to get the daily mail , we 're not .
This may not be all bad news , if the warming will wind up delaying or blunting the effects of the next Ice Age , as some experts think it will .
Maybe it will at least stop this one .

On the Other Hand ...
Of course , some might call this a draw as we may be trading an Ice Age for living on an overheated desert planet where everyone has to wear suits that make us drink our recycled pee and take sandworms to commute to work in the Spice mines where our boss is Sting in a Diaper .

In other words , the Earth does n't have a thermostat that we can adjust up or down one or two degrees to keep us comfortable .
What we humans need is as little change as possible , and we could be setting up a situation where we spend the next few centuries adapting to a warmer world and cutting greenhouse emissions , only to then get sucker punched by the next Ice Age when it eventually arrives .

A new Israeli military policy could see tens of thousands of people living in the occupied West Bank without permits deported or facing criminal charges , Israel ’s Haaretz newspaper said on Sunday .
The military , however , insisted the new orders merely formalized existing procedures and said there would be no new wave of deportations from the territory .

Haaretz said amendments to an existing order on preventing infiltration could apply to Palestinians living in the West Bank without official ID cards issued by Israel , as well as to Israelis and foreigners working in areas under limited Palestinian control .
“ The order ’s language is both general and ambiguous , stipulating that the term infiltrator will also be applied to Palestinian residents of Jerusalem , citizens of countries with which Israel has friendly ties ( such as the United States ) and Israeli citizens , whether Arab or Jewish , ” the newspaper said .
“ All this depends on the judgement of Israel defense forces commanders in the field . ”
The military insisted the amendments merely formalize the military advocate ’s oversight of the deportation process and did not change the criteria by which it judges illegal residency .
“ The order is the same as that which has always existed regarding Palestinians residing illegally in the Judaea and Samaria area , ” military spokeswoman Avital Leibovitz said , using the biblical name for the West Bank .

“ There is really nothing major here . ”
Haaretz said the new order would probably be used first against Palestinians with Gaza ID cards and the foreign spouses of Palestinians living in the territory .
It said that until now Israeli civil courts have generally prevented such expulsions but that the amended order would grant the military full jurisdiction over the matter .

Hamoked , an Israeli rights group focused on freedom of movement , called on the military to rescind the orders because they “ do not define what Israel considers a valid permit . ”
“ The definition of ‘ infiltrator , ’ which exposes a person to a prison term of three to seven years could , in principle , be applied to any person the military commander wishes ill , including Israeli and international citizens , ” it said .

Israel seized the West Bank including east Jerusalem in the 1967 Six Day War .
It is expected to form the main part of the Palestinians ’ promised future state .
The Israeli military can issue its own orders in the West Bank , but these can be overturned by the government or by Israeli courts .
The legal problems of the film director Roman Polanski , who is currently under house arrest in his Swiss chateau awaiting extradition to the US charged with raping a 13 - year - old girl three decades ago , thickened yesterday when a British actor claimed he had sexually abused her in the 1980s when she was 16 years old .
Charlotte Lewis , now 42 , appeared at the office of her lawyer , Gloria Allred , in Los Angeles to put to reporters the allegation that Polanski had abused her " in the worst possible way " in Paris .
She gave no details , and no evidence was provided to support the accusation .
But Allred said that her client wanted to present the allegations in order to show the US courts that the charges Polanski is currently facing – that he drugged and raped a 13 - year - old girl in Jack Nicholson 's house in LA in 1977 – were not isolated .
Lewis , who appeared in Polanski's film Pirates in 1986 – four years after the alleged assault was alleged to have taken place – read a statement at a news conference and refused to answer questions .
" He took advantage of me and I have lived with the effects of his behaviour ever since it occurred .
All I want is justice , " she said .
LA police confirmed to Associated Press that Lewis had been interviewed by their department , though no formal investigation has yet begun .
Polanski , the director of such Hollywood classics as Chinatown and Rosemary 's Baby , has been in legal limbo since September when a US warrant for his arrest was issued after he travelled to Switzerland to receive an award at a film festival .
He faces charges that he gave Quaaludes and champagne to the 13 - year - old in 1977 then raped her , having pleaded guilty to unlawful sexual intercourse with a minor .
But he fled before sentencing .
This week the LA judge who is hearing the Polanski case turned down a request from his lawyers to publish secret testimony in the case .
The defence said that would show misconduct by the judge , now dead , who had handled the case .
Polanski's legal team said they were unaware of the allegations from Lewis .
Lewis also appeared in the 1986 movie The Golden Child and had small roles in other films and television shows .
Allred is known for taking on controversial cases .
She recently represented Rachel Uchitel , one of the women involved with the golfer Tiger Woods .
At the Cannes film festival yesterday , the actor Michael Douglas said he would not sign a petition in support of Polanski – posted on a website overseen by French philosopher Bernard - Henri Levy – because Polanski " did break the law " .
USA to lead the way on goal - line technology
The head of the U.S. Soccer Federation , Sunil Gulati , said Monday that he is willing to have Major League Soccer experiment with technology to help reduce on - field official errors .
After the weekends two controversial calls , and the U.S. suffering two disallowed goals of it ’s own , the USSF has made a clear stance .
“ Referees have n’t gotten worse ; technology has gotten a lot better , ” Gulati said .
Almost every other sport in the world has adopted changes in relation to technology .
Grand Slam tennis tournaments use Hawk - eye , a high - speed camera system , for line calls , the National Football League lets coaches request a limited number of video reviews , the National Hockey League uses replays to asses disputed goals , the NBA uses replays to determine if a last - second shot was made before the buzzer and even Major League Baseball , which has been notably resistant of technology , has allowed limited use of replays to asses borderline homeruns .
With every other sport realizing the importance of technology , at least in regards to scoring , FIFA has had quite a lot to defend in the last few days for their steadfast refusal to even consider the addition of goal - line technology .
" We obviously will not open any debate .
This is obviously not the place for this , " FIFA spokesman , Nicolas Maingot , told a large and hostile group of journalists at the daily tournament briefing Monday .
But even before these recent errors FIFA had shunned any sort of progress when it came to updating the officiating capabilities of the game .
" Let 's leave football with errors , " Blatter said in 2008 when experiments with goal - line technology and video replay were halted by FIFA 's rules panel , the International Football Association Board .
If MLS ’s experiments with new technologies have a positive affect on the game it will only be a matter of time before other leagues such as the English Premier League , La Liga and FIFA will have to come around .

Yesterday , at a corporate gathering in New York City , Panasonic showed off their latest plasma 3 - D television –the biggest in the world , weighing in at 1,500 pounds and measuring 152 inches , crushing the last record the company held of 103 inches .
But why stop at that monstrous size ?
According to Jim Noecker , head of Panasonic ’s business development for professional displays , it ’s because this was the largest size that would n’t require multiple glass panels to cover the screen .
And with its insane resolution of 4 k by 2 k , the TV is the equivalent of nine 50 - inch displays , says Noecker .
“ If you lay it on its back , you could probably see it from space , ” he joked .
Hopefully that ’s worth the half - a- million dollar price tag , as it also sets a record for being one of the most expensive televisions in the world , walloping the $ 140,000 Yalos diamond - encrusted 46 ″ TV , but trailing the $ 2.26 million Stuart Hughes ’ PrestigeHD–which is coated in 28 kilograms of 18 k rose gold , embossed with diamonds , and hand - sewn with alligator skin ( i.e. , not exactly a fair comparison ) .
While the displays are largely built - to - order , it ’s unclear whether or not the television ’s never - absent bodyguard ( seen below and above ) is included in the price .
About elfres
As a seasoned user of the terminal , the issue of an application having an icon embedded into it is something that I did n't even notice until I started converting others to Ubuntu .
I propose adding a non -obtrusive section to ELF applications that provides this functionality and can be accessed through GNOME 's thumbnail capability .
This idea is meant to compliment the icons provided through the package manager and take advantage of the extensibility of the ELF specification .
Many users expect applications that they 've downloaded to have recognizable icons , this icon is usually something familiar from visiting the website for the program .
A good example of an application that 's not already included in the Ubuntu repo is " songbird " , which has a large egg right next to the download link and for its Windows icon .
In addition , provided that this technology is adopted by different segments of the development community ( GNOME , automake , and developers ) then icon handling will no - longer require any action for packagers .
GNOME could easily check the ELF binary for an icon , so no configuration file would be necessary for the appropriate icon to appear .
By storing a GUID in the binary it would also be possible to theme icons for all system applications ( over - riding the icon stored in the binary ) by using the GUID as a unique id for matching the application with an icon stored in a theme .
To discuss this topic please visit http://brainstorm.ubuntu.com/idea/5744/
Launchpad spec : https://blueprints.edge.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+spec/elficon
NOTE : This project is a technology demonstration for implementing this functionality .
This implementation should not be considered a spec , a discussion of what is appropriate and what is needed should be made before locking down how ELF icons should be handled .
Downloads
I now have an Ubuntu PPA setup , so if you 're running 9.10 or later you can add ppa:ehoover / compholio to your Software Sources to automatically obtain updates and download the software .
The easiest way to do this ( for recent debian - based distributions ) is to run the following at the command - line :
sudo apt - add - repository ppa:ehoover / compholio ; sudo apt - get install gnome - elf - thumbnailer ;
Living in a Sci-Fi Novel What Do We Do Now , Cory Doctorow ?
Setting aside the embarrassing lack of jetpacks , there can be no doubt that we live in a science - fiction future .
It 's become almost a cliché to say that , but just because a truth is universally accepted does n't make it any less true .
One of the most discussed product debuts of the last few months is a glass screen , 10 inches tall and half an inch thick , that enables you to contact almost anyone on the planet via text communications , watch movies , read virtually any book ever published , and play games with people on other continents .
We live in some author 's paperback science - fiction novel .
What nobody thinks to ask is this :
What kind of a science - fiction novel are we living in ?
We have no privacy ( and , hell , most people do n't even care that they have no privacy ) ; our economy is held hostage by a handful of aging corporate entities that , dinosaur - like , ca n't respond to change until it's way too late ; half the population seems to be rejecting intelligence as some kind of sin ; even our best , brightest hope — a world leader who appears to have been handpicked from central casting to represent a futuristic , more hopeful America — ca n't seem to conceive of a way out of our current financial disaster without propping up the old institutions that are too big to fail and too anachronistic to live ; and we 're choking the skies and the seas to death with our combustion - engine addiction .
The dream of walking into any one of thousands of restaurants and , within milliseconds of ordering , getting the same identical hamburger anywhere on the planet for a few pennies has come true , and we can see now that it was a stupid dream , and not one worth fighting for .
We 're living in a dystopian future , we 're a populace in need of saving , and the logical next question is :
What do we do now ?
For the last hundred years , we 've looked to our science - fiction authors for the answer .
What do we do now , H. G. Wells ?
( We should envision scientific exploration as an adventure , of course , while we make sure to treasure our humanity as the sacred thing that it is . )
What do we do now , Kurt Vonnegut ?
( We should remember our past but still recognize that we are ridiculous , tiny specks on an insignificant ball of mud , and , despite that , we should be kind to one another . )
What do we do now , William Gibson ?
( We should break free from the constraints of laziness and struggle to find our identity , even if that identity does n't fit in the strict marketing demographic we 've been assigned . )
The scope of science fiction 's answers have gotten smaller and more personal over time ; now they 're so insignificant as to be nearly irrelevant .
Modern mainstream science fiction seems almost unwilling to answer the question of what to do now ; at readings and conventions , sci - fi authors talk openly of their attempts to " launch " a " franchise , " as though they are marketers and not authors , when what we need , anyway , are prophets .
Instead of imagining new ways for us to imagine ourselves , they slice their markets up into smaller and smaller niches — steampunk , the New Weird , historical zombie adventure — and keep zapping the same atrophying pleasure centers over and over again , expecting the same orgasmic returns every time .
Cowardly , they have given up telling us what we should be , and they have started giving us what we want .
Here 's the thing :
Even if you do n't realize it while you 're reading it , all good science fiction is political .
And that means that one of the only great science - fiction writers in the world today — one of the only writers who bothers to ask , " What do we do now ? " — is Cory Doctorow .
He 's one of the few modern science - fiction authors who 's completely unafraid to offend his audience by taking tough , uncompromising stands on political issues .
His three most recent novels — released over the last two years , in chronological order : Little Brother , Makers , and For the Win— read like a slow - motion video of an explosion , each one reaching out dramatically further in scope , impulsive energy , and authorial intent .
Little Brother is a guidebook about civil disobedience in the digital age disguised as a novel for young readers .
The narrative contains brief , friendly lessons about blocking your ISP address or using cryptography to conceal activities and information , and the story , about a young man in San Francisco who is mistakenly labeled a terrorist , explains why you would want to conceal some activity in the first place .
( A common refrain on comment threads about internet privacy goes along the lines of " Why would you want to keep your web browsing secret ?
What have you got to hide ? "
It 's the good science - fiction author 's job to demonstrate why this is important . )
The opening pages of Makers attacks the very idea of corporatism :
Capitalism is eating itself .
The market works , and when it works , it commodifies or obsoletes everything ... money wo n't come from a single , monolithic product line ... the money on the table is like krill : a billion little entrepreneurial opportunities that can be discovered and exploited by smart , creative people .
The rest of the book imagines what that post - corporate - behemoth world would look like , a world where the Disney corporation — the last flailing mammoth on the plain — will do anything , even kill , to keep from going extinct .
Doctorow fires off new ideas at a staggering pace : Inventors find a way to make packs of surplus Elmo dolls salvaged from the garbage ( dolls that , to meet the demands of increasingly elaborate Christmastime fads , have evolved into simplistic robots ) drive cars and perform other complex tasks ; tiny robots build even tinier robots that can skitter around and improvise the construction of a useful tool .
In the middle of an argument about obesity , one character reframes an entire modern - day debate : " We did n't get less willful in the last fifty years .
Might as well say that all those people who died of the plague lacked the willpower to keep their houses free of rats .
Fat is n't moral , it 's epidemiological . "
And Doctorow 's latest novel , For the Win , broadens his scope to a global scale .
It 's an economic primer disguised as a political thriller about third - world children who are paid paltry wages to " mine " gold in massive multiplayer online games so that their bosses can sell the virtual gold to wealthy players who do n't have the patience to work their way up through the game .
( This is a real , modern - day phenomenon , and Doctorow points out that it's not as absurd an idea as it originally sounds ; after all , the entire economy of the planet Earth runs , basically , on an irrational confidence in the idea of gold . )
Characters smuggle themselves on freighters delivering tons of plastic crap from China to the United States , they hijack abandoned blog comment forums to use as message boards , and they struggle to find the identity that they want in a multicultural world , picking and choosing from a seemingly infinite palette of names , beliefs , and concepts .
But more than that , For the Win suggests that it would be easy , with ever - present access to communication , for these gold miners to organize , to form a union , and to strike .
He refocuses old ideas into something clever and new ( in a nod to the Pacific Northwest 's rich history of organized workers , union members in For the Win refer to themselves as " webblies , " and they call their union the IWWWW — the International Workers of the World Wide Web ) .
To publish a book for young readers that is so plainspoken about the importance of unions feels like an act of political bravery ; you wo n't find that in the newest Neil Gaiman book .
So , Cory Doctorow , what do we do now ?
The future that he maps for us is n't one of dramatic change — most of his novels end with modest , reasonable political advances toward the better — but he does suggest that for the first time in history , communication technology and human intelligence have increased to the point where we can devise and sustain a more complex , and more just , way of governing ourselves .
His books suggest a world where we finally listen to one another , and recognize ourselves in others , and start the slow , messy process of working to make things better .
After BP announced yesterday that its Tony Hayward would give up day to day oversight of the Glf cleanup operations , the embattled CEO wasted not time getting his life back .
-------------
AP : LONDON – BP chief executive Tony Hayward , often criticized for being tone - deaf to U.S. concerns about the worst oil spill in history , took time off Saturday to attend a glitzy yacht race off England 's Isle of Wight .
Spokeswoman Sheila Williams said Hayward took a break from overseeing BP efforts to stem the undersea gusher in Gulf of Mexico to watch his boat " Bob " participate in the J.P. Morgan Asset Management Round the Island Race .
The one - day yacht race is one of the world 's largest , attracting hundreds of boats and thousands of sailors .
In a statement , BP described Hayward 's break as " a rare moment of private time " and said that " no matter where he is , he is always in touch with what is happening within BP " and can direct recovery operations if required .
That is likely to be a hard sell in the slick - hit Gulf states struggling to deal with the up to 120 million gallons of oil that have escaped since April 20 from a blown - out undersea well operated by Hayward 's company .
It was not clear whether Hayward actually took part in the race or attended as a spectator .
Williams refused to comment beyond saying that the embattled chief executive was there with his son .
Peta Stuart - Hunt , a press officer for the event , said Hayward " was n't listed on any of the crew list . "
" If he is on the boat , he 's in contravention of the rules , " she said .
Whatever the case , Hayward 's appearance at the race is likely to draw outrage in the United States , where he has already been criticized for failing to answer questions from U.S. lawmakers .
Did you know that in 1993 the US beat England in the US Open Cup in Foxboro Stadium ?
Did you know that 2 US goals came from Thomas Dooley and Alexi Lalas ?
Did you know that Alexi was paid a whopping $ 250 bucks for his role as a sub in that match ?
Should the US beat England again , and go on to win the 2010 World Cup , the 23 man roster will split a $ 20,000,000 players purse from US Soccer , that is about $ 895,000 per player .
The funny part is that I have no issue with that payday what - so - ever , I think it is fair .
The amount is larger than any other nation is offering it's team but then again US Soccer is a money making machine and has been since hosting the World Cup in 1994 .
I will offer some details on how the pay scale for the US is designed later in this post .
The changes in the soccer landscape have been drastic over the last 17 years , one only has to look at the coverage of the World Cup in the US ( time.com did a huge special on it , the USMNT are again on the cover of SI 's World Cup Preview issue , I have seen at least 3 different types of World Cup Special editions or guides from various publishers .
SB Nation even has dedicated numerous resources in addition to their normal soccer bloggers for the event , and of course US Soccer 's coverage is better than ever before .
There are more places hosting World Cup viewing parties , there are more places to buy World Cup related stuff , and of course Nike 's " Write the Future " ad has been a huge hit , the 3 minute plus full version has over 13 million views on youtube .
more after the jump :
Of course if you ask a soccer fan in the US , they will tell you that the sport is incredibility popular , there are still the realities of that fact that the numbers seem small , in 2006 just 9 % of men and 3 % of women followed the World Cup closely ccording to Rasmussen , but now :
But think about that for a second , that is one out of 5 people , that represents 58 million people , or almost the entire population of the UK , more than the population of Spain , Canada , or South Africa .
This is great for the future of the sport in the US , but it is a shame that most of these people will pay little attention to MLS or WPS for that matter .
A great article on this is available at socceramerica.com
Perhaps no change has made a bigger difference than Major League Soccer , that team in 1993 did n't have the advantage of MLS , in fact several players were n't even employed as soccer players at the time of that tournament .
Now if you look at the USMNT roster , the majority do n't play in MLS at this time , but a majority of them have at sometime played in the league .
With new teams joining the league , a new pay scale for players , and the overall growth of the sport , times should only get better .
So while the paydays have changed , let 's hope the result does n't and that the US can once again upset England 2 - 0 , this time if they do the payout will be more than just the pride and honor that would go with such a victory , this time there will be some actually financial rewards for the players , here are the details of the US World Cup payout :
If the USA do n't gain a single point , each player will still pick up $ 78,447 ( £ 54,102 ) in agreed bonus money from the US Soccer Federation .
This will come from a pot of $ 1.5 m set aside by US Soccer for qualifying for the finals , plus an appearance fee of $ 4,410 per man per game in South Africa , regardless of whether they actually play .
Collectively the squad will receive an extra $ 180,000 per point won in the group stage , to a maximum of $ 1.6 m for nine points for games against England , Slovenia and Algeria .
Qualifying from the group will trigger an extra squad payment of $ 2.85 m .
Reaching the quarter - finals will earn $ 3.4 m more .
Reaching the semi-finals will be worth another $ 2.7 m .
Winning the semi-final then losing the final will be worth another $ 6.9 m , while winning the semi-final and final will earn the squad pot another $ 7.8 m .
A pot of appearance money set aside by US Soccer is worth a maximum of $ 710,010 , or $ 4,410 per man for up to seven games .
That makes the total potential bonus pot $ 20.6 m , or $ 895,131 per man .
from sportingintelligence.com
For many players , this type of potential payout is life changing .
Think about Stuart Holden , who last year in MLS made $ 34,000 , or RSL 's Robbie Findley who made $ 72,000 last year and has been offered a huge pay increase as part of a new contract by his team , but his agent is also shopping him around European leagues .
So the payday could be two fold for many players who could not only earn a nice check for doing well in the World Cup , but could easily see their overall earning potential go up .
I believe that as youth players begin to understand that there is money to be made as a professional soccer player , that more will stay dedicated to the sport and give the pro game both here and abroad a chance .
Anyhow , I thought it would be fun to share some of the details about how much the last 17 years have made in the lives of soccer players who wear the colors of the USMNT .

If you are a freelance writer / blogger , your copyright is quite literally your livelihood .
After all , if you lose the ability to sell and trade on your work , you lose your revenue stream .
However , many freelance writers are woefully unaware of the copyright issues that surround their craft , either finding the issues too confusing or relying instead on misinformation and bad advice .
If you make your living selling your work , no matter what the content is , you owe it to yourself and your future to understand the laws that surround your craft and that is a big part of what Plagiarism Today is about .
However , for freelance writers , here are a few specific tips and points to be aware of in copyright law .
Needless to say , this is n’t a thorough overview of all the issues you need to be aware of , but rather , just a few of the finer points that are often misunderstood .
1. Work for Hire May Not Apply
Work for hire law ( PDF ) is a sticky issue but , for most freelance writers , it does n’t apply .
If you are not an actual employee of the company that you ’re writing for , which a freelancer generally would n’t be , then for a work to be considered a work for hire it has to meet two conditions :
(1 ) it comes within one of the nine categories of works listed in part 2 of the definition and ( 2 ) there is a written agreement between the parties specifying that the work is a work made for hire .
The nine categories referenced in that paragraph are as follow :
(1 ) a contribution to a collective work , ( 2 ) a part of a motion picture or other audiovisual work , ( 3 ) a translation , ( 4 ) a supplementary work , ( 5 ) a compilation , ( 6 ) an instructional text , ( 7 ) a test , ( 8 ) answer material for a test , ( 9 ) an atlas ;
Clearly , a freelance writing project does not fit neatly into any of those nine categories though it may be considered a contribution to a compilation sometimes .
What this means is that , in many cases , though paid for their work , a freelance author has the copyright in it and can do with it what they please .
This includes reselling the work to others , stopping infringement and so forth .
The question then becomes can an author demand removal of a work that has been paid for ?
The answer is less clear .
When you sell a work or write it for a site , there is at least an implied license to allow the customer to use it ( what else did they pay for ? ) but how long the terms last and how other changes in the situation affect it remain unclear .
This is why it is best to get a contract with every project though , bear in mind , buyers can protect themselves with contracts to , mandating exclusivity for example .
2. No Registration , No Lawsuit
Though you have copyright protection in a work the moment it is fixed into a tangible medium of expression , to enforce those rights you need to have a registration on file with the U.S. Copyright Office and , ideally , you need to have done so either within three months of publication or before the infringement took place .
Without a registration , there is no means of filing a lawsuit in the U.S. , unless you are a foreign copyright holder , and without a timely registration there is no way to collect statutory damages or attorney ’s fees , which makes a suit impractical in most cases ( this is true for both U.S. citizens and foreign copyright holders ) .
If you ’re serious about enforcing your legal rights , you need to regularly register your work and maintain those registrations .
Without them , though you can file takedown notices and take other action , you can not take the case before a court .
3. Attribution Not Always Required
Though some freelancers ghostwrite content by choice , and are paid well for it hopefully , others do not and are upset when they do n’t receive attribution for their work .
Unfortunately , in the U.S. , there is no protection for moral rights , at least not for writers and non-visual artists .
as such , Attribution is usually not a requirement for such content use , unless it is stipulated in the contract .
This is an area where the U.S. deviates sharply from other countries , which usually have a very robust protection for moral rights and mandate that attribution be included , even when the copyright in the work has been sold .
However , even in countries with moral rights , authors can often times sign away their right to enforce them , which effectively negates them and such clauses are common .
4. Copyright Transfer Requires a Signed Contract
This is a related issue to the work for hire one mentioned above , but it is important to note that the law very explicitly states that , without a written and signed contract ( at least one signed by the original rights holder ) , a transfer of copyright can not take place .
According to the law , copyright is very much like any other piece of property you have in that you can sell it , lease it , rent it or give it away .
However , you can not transfer a copyright without a signed agreement , meaning that oral agreements and “ handshake deals ” are not valid .
In short , if you have not signed over the copyright to your work , you have n’t given up your copyright .
That being said , in many cases , as with the terms of service on various sites , you may grant licenses of use that can , in some cases , behave much like a transfer of copyright .
It is a situation similar to being the owner of a car but not being able to drive or otherwise use it as those rights are assigned to someone else .
5 . The Messy World of Joint Authorship
Under copyright law , the copyright of a work almost always transfers directly to the creator of it .
But what happens if more than one person collaborate on a work ?
Things often get messy .
Joint authorship is a very confusing and difficult area of copyright law but the fundamentals are pretty easy .
First , all authors have an equal share of the work , regardless of the size of their contribution , and all can independently , without the agreement of the other parties , enter into non-exclusive license arrangements ( though revenue earned has to be shared equally ) .
However , exclusive licenses require the input of all authors .
Second , each author can do what they want with their portion of the copyright , including selling it , leasing it , etc .
The exact same with any other copyright they hold .
Finally , the authors are all given an undivided share , meaning that they own part of other ’s contributions as well as their own .
However , a work only qualifies as a joint authorship when the authors work together “ with the intention that their contributions be merged into inseparable or interdependent parts of a unitary whole . ”
In short , if the contributions can be easily separated , such as separate chapters in a book , joint authorship does n’t apply .
Enter into joint authorships at your own risk and , if you do , always have a clear contract and clear understanding of what the rules are before going in .
Joint authorships have destroyed many good friendships and partnerships over the years .
Bottom Line
If you do n’t understand what your rights are in your works , you can not enforce them or exploit them and , if you ’re a freelancer , that can have a very negative impact on your business .
The same as construction companies need to know building codes and delivery companies traffic laws , it is important for freelance writers to understand copyright law .
Once again , this is not meant to be a thorough overview of copyright law for freelancers , but rather , an overview of some of the most commonly misunderstood points of the law that relates to them .
Any freelance writer would do well to visit the U.S. Copyright Office site and learn more about the law if they do n’t know it well already .
A few hours of education can save you tons of money and tons of headaches down the road .
It is a worthwhile investment for every freelance writer .

Every few years , as if on cue , a Phoenix - based hunting cabal launches a ham - fisted power grab .
Back in 2000 , under the name Arizonans for Wildlife Conservation , the group unsuccessfully pushed a ballot measure aimed at squashing the public 's ability to enact hunting restrictions .
The goal ?
To block a replay of 1994 , when a voters ' initiative outlawed the medieval practice of catching animals in leg - hold traps .
In 2006 , many of the same players — this time under the name Arizona Sportsmen for Wildlife — outdid themselves trying to block the appointment of Jennifer Martin to the Arizona Game and Fish Commission .
Why ?
For one thing , Martin was n't a hunter .
On top of that , she 's a bona fide biologist .
That 's a huge rarity on the rod -and - gun - dominated commission , and raises the threat that actual science might influence wildlife policy .
Now this advocacy group , composed of big - game hunters and professional guides , is trying to stack the commission with its hand - picked candidates .
The goal ?
To keep moderate eggheads like Martin from gaining more of a foothold .
After all , it 's hard to be a good ol ' boy when you 're a mom with a college degree .
Unlike the 2000 ballot measure and the assault on Martin 's appointment , this latest skullduggery just may succeed .
With help from the right - wingers running the Legislature , the hunters are pushing a remarkably noxious bill — known as HB 2189 and SB 1200 — through the Arizona Senate and House of Representatives .
At the time of this writing , it seems destined for the desk of Gov. Jan Brewer .
Brewer has so far been mum on the measure , and her aides have declined to comment .
If you 're getting the impression that these sportsmen are more about shooting wildlife than conserving it , you 'd be right .
But their perspective holds huge sway among Phoenix powerbrokers .
They 're quite skilled at working inside channels , and even get their own folks on the commission from time to time .
Consider Hays Gilstrap , an insurance executive seated on the body in the late 1990s by then - Gov. Jane Hull .
While serving as its chairman in 1999 , the white haired commissioner — dubbed the " Silver Fox " by activist critics — was well known for his backroom efforts on behalf of the failed ballot proposition in 2000 .
Meanwhile , his wife , Suzanne Gilstrap , lobbied for the measure on behalf of Arizonans for Wildlife Conservation .
That work earned her consulting firm nearly $ 18,000 .
It 's unclear how much Mrs. Gilstrap has earned lobbying for this latest measure ; she did n't return several phone calls or an e-mail seeking comment .
If enacted , the bill would create a board to screen candidates for the AGF commission .
Those vetted candidates would then be forwarded to the governor .
But here 's the rub :
According to the legislation , this five - member board would include at least three members who seem suspiciously like folks belonging to Arizona Sportsmen for Wildlife .
For instance , the House version of the bill mandates that one member would come from an established nonprofit organization " whose membership consists of a significant cross-section of wildlife conservation and sportsmen organizations from throughout the state , that does not have an affiliation or charter with a national wildlife conservation or sportsman 's organization and that has been in existence for at least five years . "
Another provision , more to the point , requires that one more appointee would come from an organization whose mission is to " increase , sustain or otherwise conserve " specified animals .
Could that possibly include hunting clubs such as the Arizona Desert Bighorn Sheep Society , the Arizona Antelope Foundation , or Arizona Predator Callers — all of which belong to Arizona Sportsmen ?
You bet , says Randy Serraglio , conservation advocate with the Center for Biological Diversity ( and a Weekly contributor ) .
The Game and Fish Department is already dominated by hunters , he says , and the bill pushed by Arizona Sportsmen " would just lock that in , from the Legislature 's perspective .
That 's exactly what we 're afraid of .
It suits their agenda .
They 're not interested in protecting wildlife beyond making hunters happy .
That 's pretty clear . "
These days , Jennifer Martin chairs the Game and Fish Commission .
She has her own take on the bill forwarded by the same folks who tried to sink her nomination .
" The intent behind that measure is to create a commission composed entirely of people who come from similar backgrounds , and have similar views and intentions for the direction of the ( Game and Fish ) Department , " she says .
" And that agenda would be the Arizona Sportsmen for Wildlife agenda , because they are the impetus behind it .
" If you look at the ( proposed ) board and the seats that are described , the first three seats of that five - person board are essentially Sportsmen for Wildlife seats . "
Arizona Sportsmen has argued that it deserves a leading role , since its members purchase a large share of hunting permits .
Those fees help support the Game and Fish Department .
But Martin calls that a smokescreen .
" They 'll tell you that sportsmen 's dollars make up 60 percent of the Game and Fish budget ; therefore , they should have 60 percent representation on this board that selects commissioners , " she says .
" The problem is , if you give yourself three out of five votes on a voting body , you 're not giving yourself 60 percent representation .
You 're giving yourself complete control .
And the department is responsible for managing all the wildlife in the state , in the public trust for 6 1/ 2 million Arizonans , not for the relatively small number of Arizonans who are in these clubs .
" It 's debatable , " she says , " whether these clubs even represent the majority of hunters and anglers . "
But according to Sandy Bahr , director of the Sierra Club 's Grand Canyon Chapter , there 's no room for debate .
She says Suzanne Gilstrap pegged Arizona Sportsmen membership at around 6,000 .
" But there are nearly 400,000 people with hunting and fishing licenses in Arizona , " Bahr says .
" I 'm actually one of them , and they do n't represent me .
My husband has a fishing license , and they do n't represent him .
" Arizona 's wildlife is not private property , " she says .
" It does not just belong to a few people .
It 's held in trust for the public .
It belongs to the public and to future generations . "
The Hershey Bears completed the comeback on Monday night , repeating as American Hockey League champions with a 4 - 0 home victory over the Texas Stars .
The Bears won the series in six games to take the Calder Cup for the 11th time in franchise history .
Hershey has won three times in the last five years and became the first repeat winner since 1991 .
While Hershey is a frequent winner , it was the first time in 30 years a Bears team was able to seal the championship in its own rink .
Over 11,000 attended at Giant Center .
It was also the only game in the series in which the home team won .
Hershey , the affiliate of the Washington Capitals , lost its first two games at home .
The comfortable margin was a rarity for the Bears , who won half of their 16 playoff games in overtime .
All of Hershey 's goals in the finale came from defencemen .
John Carlson got the Bears on the board with a power - play goal at 12:29 of the first and less than two minutes later , Karl Alzner added another .
Patrick McNeill scored in each of the last two periods and Michael Neuvirth earned the shutout for the Bears with 22 saves .
Alexandre Giroux registered two assists to finish in a tie with teammate Chris Bourque atop the AHL playoff scoring race with 27 points .
The son of NHL legend Ray Bourque won the Jack A. Butterfield Trophy as the most valuable player for the playoffs .
Brent Krahn was in net for the visitors , the affiliate of the Dallas Stars , making 32 stops .
* Updated the headline : I originally wrote that Rand Paul said the following statement .
It was actually his equally oblivious father , Ron .
The rest of the article is really about Rand ’s previous statements that illustrated how disengaged he is from average Americans , and his sense of entitlement that probably comes from his awful dad , whose terribleness is demonstrated in the quote .
—
At this point , I would n’t be surprised if Rand Paul turned out to be a DNC plant .
BP ’s $ 20 billion escrow fund is a “ PR stunt ” that came about through a “ suspicious ” process , Rep. Ron Paul ( R - Texas ) said Tuesday night .
Though Paul did n’t go as far as fellow Texan Rep. Joe Barton ( R ) , who called the fund a “ shakedown , ” he nevertheless said the “ process is sort of suspicious . ”
“ They have agreed to this and this is sort of a PR stunt as far as I ’m concerned , ” Paul told Fox News .
“ BP had already been making a lot of payments to people who had been injured . ”
He said this … on television … while the crisis is still happening .
This follows Rand ’s comments about unemployed people being a bunch of lazy shit sacks , who are too “ picky ” and insist on passing up all kinds of sweet , sweet employment opportunities ( like the jobs that do n’t offer benefits or a living wage ) .
Rand casually drops these ignorance bombs in a way only a legacy appointment can .
He is the son of millionaire Ron Paul , who has been a Texas Congressman for over three decades .
The reason Rand thinks poor people “ just do n’t work hard enough , ” and compensating victims of gross corporate negligence is a “ PR stunt ” is because he ’s a rich selfish asshole , who has been handed everything in his life .
I wish someone would ask him about William Kruse , the despondent boat captain , later hired by BP for the Gulf cleanup , who recently committed suicide .
Kruse was reportedly upset about the oil leak , the cleanup efforts , and his lost income .
He was wondering how he would be paid for taking part in the Vessel of Opportunity program .
Maybe Rand would dismiss
Kruse blowing his head off as a “ PR stunt , ” too .
What a drama queen !
Rand would probably say there are hundreds of thousands of other victims who have n’t checked out early over a little “ environmental calamity . ”
It ’s a shame old Willy could n’t handle his share of hard knocks , but two tears in a bucket , let ’s move on , Free Market , blah blah blah my dad is Ron Paul .
As for other issues ( doctors pleading with Obama that respirators be issued to cleanup workers and numerous health complaints , ) I ’m sure Rand ’s solution will be the only solution he seems capable of yelping : “ deregulation ! ”
Because — and this ca n’t be repeated enough — the Libertarian solution to this crisis is to let private business regulate itself .
Yet , because of the woeful ineptitude of the MMS , that ’s essentially what BP got to do for all these years — “ regulate ” their own industry .
And here we are .
The self - regulation stuff does n’t work .
For years , the US government has strayed to the right as part of a quest to be pro-business , and to secure corporate dollars .
Part of that journey entailed adopting Randian principles ( the Rand and Ayn kind ) of deregulation , which is why the MMS behaved more as extension of the oil industry than an aggressive check on its power .
We have no idea what the ultimate cost of the BP disaster will ultimately be .
However , we do know that the effects of environmental disaster linger , extend for decades , and create generational ruin .
Take , for example the Exxon catastrophe :
After more than 20 years , the fishermen affected by the Exxon Valdez spill settled for less than 10 % of the damages sought .
Divided among them , assuming all of them survived to finally be compensated , it amounts to about $ 192,307 and some change to compensate for all that was lost to the Exxon Valdez disaster .
Three years after the 11 million - gallon spill in Prince William Sound blackened 1,500 miles of Alaska coastline , the herring on which he and other Cordova fishermen heavily relied disappeared from the area .
Platt and some others stuck around , fishing for salmon and hoping things would improve .
The herring never returned to Cordova .
Platt ’s income plummeted , severely straining his marriage and psyche .
He dipped into his sons ’ college funds to support his family .
“ People ’s lives were ruined , ” Platt said .
“ There were damn good fishermen here in the Sound , and they just said , ‘ Screw it ’ and left , and tried to make a living elsewhere . ”
As for Platt , who stayed : “ I wasted 20 years of my life , ” he said .
Platt and other people in the Alaskan village of about 2,500 people say they still are suffering economically and emotionally 21 years after the oil disaster .
About 3,400 miles away , an oil leak that started last month in the Gulf of Mexico is threatening the Gulf Coast .
“ Here we go again , ” Platt said of the oil leak in the Gulf .
“ I feel real bad for the people who are going to potentially go through what we did here . ”
The CNN article quoted above says that the herring loss alone cost the region $ 400 million in the last 21 years .
The average fisherman lost 30 % of his income , while those who specialized in herring lost everything .
A fifth of the fishermen suffer from anxiety and 40 % from severe depression .
Man , those PR stunts are everywhere .
You ’d think ruined Alaskan fisherman would be too cold / clinically depressed to become master media manipulators , but I guess I ’m just more naive than the astute Mr. Paul .
Luckily , the gubment did n’t buy into the whole “ wah wah , we ’re ruined ” story , and left communities that were ruined — forever — by Exxon , with around $ 190,000 each .
That ’s less than $ 200 K for their obliterated industry , the former lifelines of many communities , their permanently poisoned environment ( 18 years later , Exxon oil was still showing up in ocean samples , ) and medical bills .
The toll of the 1989 Exxon Valdez oil spill is a sadly familiar one : 250,000 dead birds , 2,800 sea otters , 300 harbor seals–all victims of the oil tanker that ran over a reef late one April night and drained 11 million gallons of oil into Prince William Sound .
There are others whom almost no one talks about , although unlike the birds , most of them are still alive .
They are the people who scraped oil off the beaches , skimmed it off the top of the water , hosed it off rocks .
Workers who stood in the brown foam 18 hours a day , who came back to their sleeping barges with oil matted in their hair , ate sandwiches speckled with oil , steered boats through a brown hydrocarbon haze that looked like the smog from hell .
After that summer , some found oil traces in their lungs , in their blood cells , in the fatty tissue of their buttocks .
They got treated for headaches , nausea , chemical burns and breathing problems , and went home .
But some never got well .
Steve Cruikshank of Wasilla , Alaska , has headaches that go on for days .
Two years ago , he was hospitalized when his lungs nearly stopped working .
“ The doctor said , ‘ I ’m going to give you the strongest antibiotic known to man , and you ’re either going to survive or not survive .
I do n’t know what ’s wrong with you . ’
What ’s wrong is , I have n’t felt right since that oil spill . ”
Predicting the reach of the “ worst case scenario ” is impossible for Gulf residents .
Even with the knowledge of the Exxon legacy firmly imbedded in our collective memories , there ’s no way to understand the BP oil volcano ’s detriment .
This is the worst environmental disaster in the country ’s history .
Ballparking a compensation figure is plain stupid , but saying attempting to try and form some kind of estimate damages is a “ PR stunt ” is simply evil .
None of this should surprise anyone , though .
This is the Randian solution to everything :
You ’re on your own .
That ’s a fine belief to have , but not if you ’re a politician in a democracy .
We elect officials to serve the people – not to abandon them in their hour of need .
( CNN ) --
A single mother who chose taking care of her infant over deploying to Afghanistan has been discharged , the Army said in a statement .
When her unit deployed to Afghanistan in November , Alexis Hutchinson was missing from the plane .
Her lawyer said she refused to go because there was no one to take care of her then 10 - month - old son , Kamani , and she feared he would be placed in foster care .
But the Army contended that the young mother and now former Army specialist had plenty of time to sort out family issues and said she could face court - martial .
The issue was resolved this week , the Army said in a statement Thursday from Fort Stewart in Georgia , where Hutchinson was training .
" The soldier will not be tried by court - martial and therefore is not at risk of receiving a federal conviction , " the statement said . "
She is , however , reduced to the lowest enlisted rank , private , and subject to losing other military benefits from the Army and the Department of Veterans Affairs to which soldiers who serve honorably are entitled . "
Before shipping overseas , every soldier must sign military Form D - A 53 - 05 , which states that failure to maintain a family care plan could result in disciplinary action .
Hutchinson 's attorney , Rai Sue Sussman , said the soldier informed the Army that her family care plan had fallen through and that there was no one to take care of her son .
She was granted a 30 - day extension to deal with the issue but still was not ready to deploy after the extension had expired , the Army said .
" The investigation revealed evidence , from both other soldiers and from Private Hutchinson herself , that she did n't intend to deploy to Afghanistan with her unit and deliberately sought ways out of the deployment , " the Army statement said .
Hutchinson could not be immediately reached for comment .

Born on Third Base

Barry Switzer , the former head coach at the University of Oklahoma , once said " Some people are born on third base , and go through life thinking they 've hit a triple . "
Among the fascinating aspects of the recent economic " recovery , " probably the greatest is the failure of analysts to understand that this growth is none of the private sector 's doing .
Wall Street seems to have no concept at all that every bit of growth we 've observed over the past year can be traced to government deficit spending , with zero private sector expansion when those deficits are factored out .
As I noted last week , if one removes the impact of deficit spending , " the economy has recovered to the point where the year - over - year growth rate since early 2009 now matches the worst performance of any of the 50 years preceding the recent downturn . "
In effect , Wall Street 's is seeing " legs " where the economy is in fact walking on nothing but crutches .
Similarly , it is apalling that Ben Bernanke can say with a straight face that many of the " investments " made by the Fed have been repaid " and some have even made a profit , " without immediately noting that the two primary sources of these repayments have been , directly or indirectly , the U.S. Treasury , and savers who are receiving near - zero interest on bank deposit instruments .
If we fail to recognize that the " good news " reported over the past year is due not to a recovery in intrinsic economic activity , but instead to massive government intervention , we risk being blindsided as those synthetic effects gradually erode .
On that point , it is notable that the Economic Cycle Research Institute ( ECRI ) reported Friday that its Weekly Leading Index has slumped to the lowest level in 44 weeks , and has now gone to a negative reading .
Chart thanks to Mike " Mish " Shedlock www.globaleconomicanalysis.blogspot.com
ECRI head Lakshman Achuthan is quick to point out that the downtrend in the WLI is not ( yet ) sustained enough to indicate an oncoming double dip .
Then again , it 's important to recognize how quickly the ECRI is likely to shift its position if we observe further deterioration .
The WLI also moved to negative readings in 2007 , but the ECRI cautiously avoided interpreting it as a recession warning until a few weeks later when the deterioration was sufficiently persistent .
John Markman , writing for MarketWatch , reports " Looking out over the horizon using his longer - term leading indexes , Achuthan sees a ' strong chance ' of more frequent recessions in the coming decade than at any time since the 1970s .
If that occurs , then he points out there will be major constraints on politicians ' counter - cyclical response that did not exist in 2008 .
That 's because the next recession will begin with unemployment not at 4.5 % , as the last one did , but in the high 8 % range .
Also policy makers wo n't be able to cut rates as they are likely to still be near zero , and fiscal spending will be a problem due to all of the borrowed stimulus already fired off .
" A lot of people are going to wonder , Achuthan says , how this could happen again so soon after the last crisis .
And he points out that the ' great moderation ' in economic growth from 1985 to 2007 -- when recessions seem to have been ironed out of the system -- is over .
That was an anomaly .
The new reality will be a return to sharp cyclicality with a vengeance "
From my perspective , the evidence is n't yet sufficient , from a probability standpoint , to firmly anticipate a double dip .
But it is notable how close the evidence is to locking in on that conclusion .
The following is our refined set of " Aunt Minnie " criteria for identifying oncoming recessions .
See the November 12 , 2007 comment Expecting a Recession for details .
In every instance we 've observed these conditions , the U.S. economy has either already been in a recession , or has been within a few weeks of what turned out in hindsight to be the official beginning of a recession .
There have been no false signals .
1 : Widening credit spreads :
An increase over the past 6 months in either the spread between commercial paper and 3 - month Treasury yields , or between the Dow Corporate Bond Index yield and 10 - year Treasury yields .
This criterion is currently in place .
2 : Moderate or flat yield curve : A yield spread between the 10 - year Treasury yield and the 3 - month Treasury yield of anything less than 3.1 % .
As of last week , the 10 - year Treasury yield was 3.22 % .
The 3 - month Treasury bill yield was 0.08 % .
So virtually any decline in the 10 - year yield from here will put this criterion in place .
3 : Falling stock prices : S&P 500 below its level of 6 months earlier .
This is not terribly unusual by itself , which is why people say that market declines have called 11 of the past 6 recessions , but falling stock prices are very important as part of the broader syndrome .
This criterion is currently in place .
4 : Moderating ISM and employment growth : Manufacturing PMI ( at or ) below 54 , coupled with either total nonfarm employment growth below 1.3 % over the preceding year ( this is a figure that Marty Zweig noted in a Barron 's piece years ago ) , or an unemployment rate up 0.4 % or more from its 12 - month low .
At present , both of the employment measures are in place .
Last month , the ISM PMI dropped from 60.4 to 59.7 .
For all intents and purposes , unless the credit spreads , the S&P 500 , or the yield curve reverse , a further decline in the Purchasing Managers Index to 54 or below would be sufficient to confirm a " double - dip recession . "
Note that by itself , such a level might not be particularly troublesome .
But in concert with the other evidence we observe , it would be sufficient to complete the syndrome of risk factors .
The historical recession signals based on the foregoing criteria are depicted in blue in the chart below .
Actual recessions are depicted in red .
The chart reflects the widely held assumption that the recent recession ended in June 2009 , though it is not clear that this assumption is appropriate .
Given that the economy has not recovered to anywhere near its previous peak , a second downturn would most probably be viewed by the NBER as a continuation of the recent recession rather than a separate event .
In short , it is small relief that neither the ECRI Weekly Leading Index nor our recession risk Aunt Minnie have provided confirming evidence of a double dip , because both would require rather minimal extensions of their recent deterioration to go to a hard warning .
Market Climate
As of last week , the Market Climate for stocks remained characterized by unfavorable valuations and unfavorable market action , holding the Strategic Growth Fund to a fully hedged investment stance .
In this position ( provided that our long - put / short - call index option combinations have identical strike prices and expirations ) , the primary source of day - to - day fluctuations in the Fund is the difference in performance between the stocks held by the Fund and the indices we use to hedge ( the S&P 500 , Russell 2000 and Nasdaq 100 ) .
The somewhat oversold condition of the market on a short - term basis may soften the impression that there is any urgency to risk management here .
I think that could be a mistake .
It 's worth repeating that if you are following a disciplined investment program and your asset allocation is constructed to weather a wide range of potential risks , I would prefer that you ignore my views and do nothing .
But if your investment security or future plans would be unacceptably affected by a further , possibly substantial market loss , and particularly if you 'll need the funds in a short number of years , I would suggest getting your risk exposure to the point where you can tolerate negative market outcomes .
Randall Forsyth offered the following nugget in Barron 's last week , with which I can't disagree : According to Bespoke Investment Group , there have been 58 " corrections " of 10 % or more in the Standard & Poor 's 500 since 1927 .
In 33 cases , the corrections stopped short of the 20 % bear market threshold and the market went on to higher highs , while 25 times they grew into a full - grown grizzly .
But in the 32 instances when the market has dropped as much as this one has -- 14.4 % from the April 23 peak through Monday -- the outcome has been heavily weighted to the losing side .
Only seven times drops of that size stopped short of the 20 % bear mark .
In the 25 other times the decline extended to 20 % , the average bear market decline was 35.5 % .
As with our own work , we 've observed fairly benign market outcomes from similar conditions about 20 % of the time .
The remaining 80 % of the time has been characterized by more pointed losses .
The probability mix is not good , particularly because that 80 % group has several " fat tail " events featuring deep market plunges .
Keep in mind that after a clear break of major support levels , markets often recover back to that previous support , which can create a feeling of " all clear " complacency .
Be careful - as I 've noted many times over the years , the steepest losses in a market downturn typically follow the " fast , furious , prone - to - failure " rallies that clear an oversold condition .
In bonds , the Market Climate remained characterized last week by moderately unfavorable yield levels and favorable yield pressures .
Credit spreads continue to reflect concern about default risk that tends to benefit default - free securities , particularly U.S. Treasuries .
Yield levels are not compelling on the basis of holding to maturity , so Treasuries are not long - term values .
We have to recognize that the merit of U.S. Treasuries is essentially based on " speculative " factors relating to further credit strains .
For that reason , I expect that we will clip our duration in Treasuries ( now less than 4 years , mostly in intermediate term notes ) , in response to a significant further retreat in yields .
My views relating to inflation hedges such as TIPS and precious metals shares still hold - while I strongly expect inflation pressures in the second half of this decade , it is very difficult for investors to maintain that sort of thesis in the face of contradictory short - term evidence .
As further credit strains are likely to prompt fears of deflation , I expect that our heaviest positioning in investments like TIPS and precious metals shares will be in response to price weakness on those fears .
We 've got enough exposure in Strategic Total Return that we would be comfortable with a sustained advance in these investment classes , but again , my expectation is that we 'll see opportunities in the quarters ahead to establish larger positions on weakness rather than strength .

GULFPORT , Miss . --
After a three - hour flight over the Gulf of Mexico to survey the oil spill , U.S. Rep .
Gene Taylor concluded , " This is n't Armageddon . "
Taylor , D - Bay St. Louis , said he spoke with friends in the morning who " think this is the end of the world . "
" I believe , having gone through Katrina , this is n't Katrina , " he continued .
" It is obviously something that none of us wish had happened , but it is not Armageddon . "
Taylor and Rep. Jo Bonner , R- Mobile , flew over the oil slick in a Coast Guard airplane on Saturday afternoon .
" The oil is naturally breaking up as it gets closer to shore , " he said .
Taylor described some areas containing crude oil looking like " chocolate milk . "
" The good news is that the farther you get from the site where the rig had been it is naturally dispersing between the sunlight and waves , " said Taylor .
Taylor said he did n't see any oil in marsh areas during the flight that was about 1,000 feet in altitude .

Taylor said he thinks a team effort is the best method for a cleanup , when asked if authority over the spill should be nationalized .
Earlier Saturday , U.S. Sen. Roger Wicker , R - Tupelo , said at a news conference in Fountainbleu that once the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico is under control , and wildlife and wetlands are secure , the federal government will be asking BP Plc some tough questions .
" Clearly , they have n't gotten the job done , but I do n't want to point fingers , " Wicker said .
" I think it 's important that we take this like Mississippians do -- analytically and responsibly with resolve , purpose and determination .
There are some allegations on a Washington level that the response was n't quick enough .
I 'm not ready to say that .
At this point , I want to get the flow of the oil stopped and keep it away from the shorelines .
There will be a time for the serious questions . "
BP operated the Transocean Deepwater Horizon drilling rig that suffered a catastrophic failure , burst into flames and sank April 20 , about 100 miles south of Pascagoula .
Wicker said federal officials had been led to believe that this type of failure could not happen .
" It 's a realization that even with safeguards , things can go wrong , " Wicker said .
" There will be questions asked of the industry , the federal officials who were supposed to be inspecting the rig , and of those involved in the recovery effort .
" Clearly , they have n't gotten the job done , but I do n't want to point fingers .
I think it 's important that we take this like Mississippians do -- analytically and responsibly with resolve , purpose and determination .
There are some allegations on a Washington level that the response was n't quick enough .
I 'm not ready to say that .
At this point , I want to get the flow of the oil stopped and keep it away from the shorelines .
There will be a time for the serious questions . "
-- U.S. Sen. Roger Wicker , R- Tupelo
" Clearly , it is a major environmental disaster and we 've been told it 's the worst oil spill in decades . "
Wicker said if offshore drilling ceases , " oil prices will go up and we 'll have to import more oil . "
Meanwhile , Bill Brown with the Mississippi Emergency Management Agency said MEMA is watching the spill closely and is coordinating with the state departments of Environmental Quality and Marine Resources , and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers .
" Right now , we 're trying to get some of the sensitive areas protected and we 're working to coordinate those efforts with the state and local levels , " Brown said .
" Otherwise , we really just do n't know what we need , yet . "
Brown said if oil does impact Mississippi shorelines , the agency 's role could change .
" We could then be a provider to bring in federal help , " Brown said .
" If the disaster is large enough , then we could get a presidential disaster declaration through the governor 's office .
That opens the pipeline to the federal resources .
For right now , we just have to wait and see what happens . "
BOSTON ( MarketWatch ) --
The news on jobs is n't as bad as it seemed on Friday .
It 's worse .
President Obama and Treasury Secretary Geithner were trying to putting on a happy face , but the markets were n't buying .
They have tumbled worldwide since the latest payroll data .
But instead of overreacting , the markets may only just be waking up to the real bad news .
1. Look out ahead .
We already know that when you strip out the short - term Census jobs , May 's jobs growth was a pitiful 41,000 .
But what people have n't realized is that the leading indicators for June are even worse .
TrimTabs Investment Research Inc. tracks the real - time jobs picture by monitoring income tax deposits at the Treasury .
And these have suddenly started falling .
Based on the latest data , the firm predicts the economy will actually lose up to 200,000 jobs , net , in June .
" The big news is that we have a job loss of about 200,000 coming in June , " says Trim Tabs ' Madeline Schnapp , " and the market is n't ready for it . "
How the World Cup can help you score in the market
It 's not just the stock market .
You can bet that the administration -- and the country -- is n't ready either .
Remember , we need to create about 100,000 just to keep up with population growth .
2 . One and a half million people have ' disappeared ' ?
The government says the unemployment rate " edged down " to 9.7 % -- keeping it below the politically sensitive 10 % level .
Read more jobs coverage .
But that 's only because about one and a half million people have just , miraculously " disappeared " from the official labor force .
A million and a half people disappearing ?
It sounds like a crazy conspiracy theory .
But there it is , buried in the fine print of the government 's own data .
From May 2009 to May 2010 , the U.S. " civilian non-institutional population " of prime working age -- 20 to 64 -- expanded by one and a half million , 180.5 million to 182 million .
Yet over the same period the official tally of the labor force over age 20 held steady at just 148 million .
What happened to those extra people ?
The Bureau of Labor Statistics does n't have a full explanation .
" We do n't have direct questions ( in the survey ) addressing that fact , " said a spokeswoman .
But many of the disappeared are " unemployed who have decided not to look for work any more , " or who have n't looked for work recently .
Anyone who has n't actively sought a job in the last four weeks vanishes from the rolls .
People dropping out completely are not a bullish sign -- unless , perhaps , one is measuring the unemployment figures for the government .
3 . Some of the new " jobs " may not even exist
That 's because they 're being counted by the Federal Department of Guesswork .
Ever since 1994 , say economists , Uncle Sam has been using some statistical , er , " adjustments " to the core jobs data to come up with the , er , " true " picture .
It will surprise no one that these " adjustments " make the data look better , rather than worse .
The government makes estimates about new companies being started up as well as jobs being lost .
Those adjustments may be adding as many as half a million extra " jobs " to the core figure , says independent economist John Williams at Shadow Government Statistics .
In previous recessions , these adjustments may have had some justifications , because new companies formed very quickly in the recovery .
But this recession has been unlike any other in our lifetimes , because it was caused by too much debt rather than economic overheating .
So the recovery has been different as well .
The slump in bank lending and the money supply in the past year suggest new companies are probably being formed far more slowly than in past recoveries , if at all .
Bottom line : many of those jobs may not exist .
4 . The private sector picture may still be in recession
Some recovery :
The number employed in the private sector is still about 900,000 below where it was even a year ago , and about 8 million below where it was in 2007 .
And remember , it has to keep growing just to stand still , because the population is growing .
" There 's practically no growth in private sector employment , " says Gluskin Sheff strategist David Rosenberg .
Jobs growth was anemic even in the parts of the economy allegedly leading the recovery , such as manufacturing .
And now , he says , many leading economic indicators have started to turn down again .
The jobs growth is so slow , Rosenberg says , that by his calculations " it is going to take years , probably five to seven years , before we recoup the employment ( lost ) from the Great Recession , " he says .
Five to seven years ?
" There 's a significant chance , " he adds , " that for the first time ever we will go into the next recession without having seen a new peak in employment . "
5 . And as for earnings ...
In the quest for some more cheerful news , the government said for those who do have jobs , average hourly earnings were up 1.9 % from a year ago .
Good , yes ?
Er , not really .
The government also reported that those workers produced 2.8 % more goods and services per hour .
So they actually got paid about 1 % less for each widget they made , TV they sold , or meal they served .
Oh , and over the same period consumer prices rose 2.2 % .
So even those lucky enough to be working have gone backwards -- before taxes .
It 's hard to recall now the excitement generated by David Lynch 's Twin Peaks when it first aired on British television back in 1990 .
But it managed to make staying in seem urgent and exhilarating .
There were Twin Peaks evenings , at which fans gathered in each other 's houses to watch this revolutionary entertainment , a sort of surreal soap - cum - murder - mystery .
Offices practically had to install water - coolers just so their staff could stand around them and speculate on who killed Laura Palmer .
It was one of those moments when American popular culture reminded us just how cool it could be .
It also marked a decisive turning point in US television drama .
Before Twin
Peaks there was plenty of well - made American TV , though it was mostly generic and limited in ambition .
But Lynch , a cinema auteur , tore up conventions and almost single - handedly reinvented TV drama .
The standard narrative arc went out of the window , and in its place came idiosyncratic character studies , an elliptical plot , dialogue that brought the bizarre and the banal together in a captivating verbal marriage , and imagery quite unlike anything seen on the small screen .
There was also , of course , the haunting theme music by Angelo Badalamenti that seemed to plug directly into the eerier quarters of the subconscious .
The audience was not just hooked but enthralled , beguiled and bewildered .
Suddenly television was full of possibilities .
Five years earlier , the high - water mark of innovation had been reached in British television with The Singing Detective , but thereafter the British model struggled to develop and thrive .
By contrast , American TV has n't looked back .
It would be wrong to attribute all that 's since taken place to the creative impact of Twin Peaks but Lynch 's legacy can nonetheless be seen in dramas in a whole range of recent TV shows .
For a start , Lynch helped make television attractive to film stars .
Kyle MacLachlan , who played the other - worldly Special Agent Dale Cooper , had been the lead in Blue Velvet .
The message was that television was no longer a Hollywood ghetto .
Without Agent Cooper perhaps there would have been no Jack Bauer .
Similarly , it 's hard to imagine that JJ Abrams 's high - concept genre - mashing with Lost would have happened if Lynch had n't pioneered the way .
And in David Chase 's casting in The Sopranos it 's possible to see the influence of Lynch , who used almost forgotten character actors like Richard Beymer .
In the end , Twin Peaks did n't quite deliver on its fabulous promise , trailing off in its second series into paranormal confusion .
But by then it had already worked its magic .
" That 's a damn fine cup of coffee , " Agent Cooper liked to say .
One way or another , American TV woke up and smelt it .
Lara Flynn Boyle
The break - out star of the show , who played Donna Hayward , enjoyed a patchy career in film ( Wayne 's World , Men in Black II ) , later returning to TV to appear in long - running legal drama The Practice , as well as Las Vegas and Huff .

Twin Peaks gave me everything I have as an actor .
It put me where I am now because it was so beautifully soulful , and I think it just brought out the best of the actors .
There was no acting going on – we were living on Twin Peaks .
It gave me my career .
Me and the cast just went along for the ride .
David created such an atmosphere of fantastic strangeness .
I remember , in the pilot , I did a very long scene that we had to shoot 30 or 40 times .
David came up to me and said quietly , in my ear : " Think of how gently a deer has to move in the snow … "
It was strange direction .
But that 's what I thought of , and it worked .
We were at the helm of a piece of heaven on Twin Peaks and we just went where David Lynch told us .
That might sound very obscure but it really is true .
How he sees the world is how we should all see the world .
The show 's explosion in popularity was , from the inside , very strange .
I do n't think many of us had a clue what to do .
I did n't know it was odd that people were playing the music from Twin Peaks in their cars .
I did n't know that it was odd to be on the cover of Rolling Stone at 20 years old .
The show could have gone on as long as David wanted it to – but it was an appropriate time to let it stop when it did .
To this day , I have people come up to me in airports and the grocery store and quote lines I said in the show .
I do n't even know what they 're talking about .
At the Emmys every year they show clips of shows that are well remembered .
They never show clips of Twin Peaks !
I 'm always going on at the producers about that .
It was great TV that we created .
Incredibly brave stuff .
It 's been copied but I do n't think anybody 's grabbed the legacy of it just yet .
Sheryl Lee
Cast to play a dead girl ( Laura Palmer ) , Sheryl Lee impressed creators David Lynch and Mark Frost to such an extent that she was given a broader ( speaking ) part to play .
Lee went on to star in Backbeat and have a recurring part in recent TV series Dirty Sexy Money .

It was a great learning experience playing a corpse .
I got to be a sponge and soak up everything .
In the famous shot of me , dead , David hand - placed those granules of sand on my face , and played with the plastic as if it were a bouquet of flowers .
Once they shot the pilot in Washington , they all went back to LA .
But I stayed behind because that 's where I was living at the time – I was a theatre actress .
Months later , David called me and asked how I would feel about coming back on the show .
I pointed out I was dead .
He said : " I 'll figure that out , " like it was the least of the problems .
I returned as Laura 's cousin , Maddy .
There was no way to be prepared for the overnight success of the show , to go all of a sudden from being completely anonymous to recognisable .
It was strange , surreal and scary .
There 's no handbook for how to manoeuvre your way gracefully through it .
Laura Palmer opened doors for me .
But that character was so specific , and had such a strong identity , that to this day , after a 20 - year career , it 's still the thing that people remember me for .
It 's hard to shake that .
Kimmy Robertson
The distinctively squeakily voiced actor Kimmy Robertson played sheriff 's department receptionist Lucy Moran .
She went on to work primarily as a voice artist , appearing in Beauty and the Beast and The Simpsons .

It did n't make much sense to me when I read the script but I knew it was by David Lynch , so I loved it .
When I first met him for my audition we spoke for a long time about how people who live in the wilderness ( like the characters in Twin Peaks ) are usually meaner than those who live in cities .
It was an esoteric conversation , and the strangest way I 'd ever got a part .
When he directed us it was different to anybody I 'd ever worked with before or since .
He'd get us into a circle and ask us questions – it was like he was hypnotising us .
There 's a scene where Kyle had to throw a rock and hit a glass bottle .
He sat us down and told Kyle he was going to hit the bottle – and that bottle was freaking far away .
Kyle hit it , and everybody freaked out .
It was like David used the power of the universe to make Twin Peaks .
When the show was broadcast , the publicist had the cast watch it in a sports bar .
None of us wanted to , but it gave us a chance to see people 's reactions .
They all seemed to love it .
I was proud to be in it .
It was the only thing I 'd ever seen me in when I did n't leave before the lights came up .
I was stuck in my seat with my mouth hanging open .
It was ridiculous to reveal Laura 's killer in the second season , though .
It was obvious that it was pressure from the TV execs who do n't know their ass from a hole in the ground .
Laura 's killer was the perfect carrot to dangle , reeling people in like they do in Lost now .
I know [ Lost creator ] JJ Abrams and he loved Twin Peaks .
I 'm sure we inspired JJ – he 's a smart man .
Kyle MacLachlan
After playing the esoteric FBI agent Dale Cooper , around whom Twin Peaks was based , Kyle MacLachlan featured in two poorly received films , Showgirls and The Flintstones .
He went on to win plaudits for roles in Sex and the City and Desperate Housewives .

Making the pilot episode , we knew we were doing something different , must - see TV , but I do n't think anyone involved thought it was going to continue past a one - off .
David Lynch comes to television ?
The inmates are going to take over the asylum !
The plan was to make a movie of the week and then go home .
But then it was screened – and everybody was stunned at how good it was .
Suddenly I went from cold property to hot property .
It 's a very interesting little dynamic , how that shifts so quickly in Hollywood .
We all realised pretty quickly that it was going to be this long , meandering story .
The writers always pretended they knew what they were doing but in fact I think that the hand had come off the tiller , so to speak , and we were just on a wild adventure .
Creatively , I was spoiled , working with David on my first major project .
David is one of a kind .
His pure pleasure in film - making is infectious .
After the series finished I was reluctant to return for the Twin Peaks film .
I was pretty naive about it .
At the time I felt like I was trapped in this stale role , but looking back , Dale Cooper was one of the best things that happened to me .
I went on to make some film choices that were rather strange – made with the best intentions , but not necessarily coming out the way I wanted them to .
I certainly can't pretend that I did n't do Showgirls ...
But I 've been around for a while now , I 'm of a certain age and I 'm still doing what I love to do .
There 's some good work in there and there 's some work that 's questionable .
I think Twin Peaks gave a real jolt to television .
Creative people felt the freedom to explore different themes .
Atypical shows came out of it : initially things like Wild Palms – eccentric for eccentricity 's sake and not really making sense – but then quirky shows that were good too , like Northern Exposure and even The X Files .
It showed people who make the decisions about what goes on air and what does n't that the audience were open to trying something less traditional .
Mark Frost
The co-creator and screenwriter of Twin Peaks went on to enjoy a varied writing career , producing three novels , two sports books , a sitcom and a superhero film ( Fantastic Four : Rise of the Silver Surfer ) .

David and I did n't worry whether the viewers would " get " Twin Peaks .
We decided that we had a break to daylight here ; a chance from the network to go mad , to do whatever we felt like doing .
ABC were so desperate at that point , they had been languishing in third place for God knows how long – so we were able to secure from them unprecedented artistic controls on the show , largely because we told them from the beginning : " You 're not going to be able to understand this , so there 's no way you can hope to guide it . "
And they looked at the pilot and said : " You 're right . "
They gave us notes but I do n't think we paid attention to a single one .
I can't really think of any ideas that David and I considered too " out there " to be included .
Most of them ended up in the show .
David would call up in the middle of shooting – he'd be off doing a movie or something – and say , " Mark , I think there 's a giant in Agent Cooper 's room . "
And I 'd go , " OK … " We 'd explore it – and it would work .
Perhaps there was one idea that threw me for a loop .
During the second season we knew that Joan Chen 's character was going to die .
David , as he was wont to do , called me up and said : " I think she gets stuck in a door handle … "
So we tried to make that work .
It did n't make any sense to me , it still does n't .
ABC were profoundly uncomfortable with this show from the very beginning .
They 'd moved us to a dreadful time slot for the second season – Saturday night at 10 pm when you mostly had the living dead home watching television .
And then there was a hit show called The Gulf War that came on , so everybody kept cutting away from us to live shots of bombs falling in Baghdad .
Twin Peaks finished soon after that .
I think there were shows that came along afterwards that owed a debt to what we 'd done .
The one that meant the most to me was David Chase saying that The Sopranos had been influenced by the show .
He felt it had given him the freedom to go places narratively that he had n't really considered before ( a dream sequence , say ) and the notion that he could have a sprawling cast and still be able to service them all .
His was the last show I watched with enduring interest .
I do n't watch network television any more .
Grace Zabriskie
A character actor also well known for a popular stint on Seinfeld , Grace Zabriskie played Laura Palmer 's mother Sarah Palmer in Twin Peaks .
She currently appears in HBO 's popular polygamy drama , Big Love .
Grace Zabriskie as Sarah Palmer , the mother of the murdered girl , Laura Palmer .
I think most of us were surprised by the show 's sudden popularity .
I certainly was .
I had seriously underestimated the taste and intelligence level out there , and the readiness for something completely different .
But if we had played our roles with this mistrust of the results , instead of taking the ride David offered us , things might not have turned out so well .
I 've never forgotten this lesson .
There was constant speculation among the cast about who killed Laura .
I remember half - hearted attempts to get Mark to talk , but he would n't .
No one would talk .
Probably it was in our interests for the secret to remain a secret as long as possible .
In my opinion , the show could n't survive the unravelling of that central mystery about Laura 's killer .
I said at the time that it would survive , that the show was about so much more than who killed Laura Palmer , that it still had miles to go …
But it started going all over the map , not trusting what had been created , what there was already to build on .
I still suspect it could have survived had the network not insisted the question be answered .
The most interesting thing about what followed the show was that the copycats crashed and burned .
It took some years before a few shows could profit from Twin Peaks ' daring to be original in tone , sensibility and subject matter .
I am still asked about it today .
People still want to talk about it , enjoy contact with someone who reminds them of that time in their lives – even those who are very young and have only recently seen the series .
Twin Peaks Season 2 and the Twin Peaks Definitive Gold Box Edition are both available on DVD from 22 March
OTTAWA — The details of a plan to launch a conservative television network will finally be revealed after much talk about what it could mean for political journalism in this country .
Pierre Karl Péladeau , the billionaire media tycoon who heads Quebecor Inc. and its subsidiaries , is expected to unveil his plans Tuesday for what the competition has already dubbed ‘ Fox News North ’ , an English - language 24 - hour all - news network modelled after the provocative ratings success below the border .
The press release for the announcement at the Toronto Sun building in Toronto Tuesday refers only to a “ new investment in Canadian media , ” but details of the reportedly $ 100 million venture by Quebecor Media Inc. and Sun Media Corporation have been leaking out in dribs and drabs for the past week .
Quebecor Media Inc. filed an application for a “ must - carry ” licence with the Canadian Radio - television and Telecommunications Commission earlier this month and the company has already announced some high - profile new hires , including Kory Teneycke , the former chief spokesman for Prime Minister Stephen Harper , as vice - president of development .
Teneycke had been working on contract for Quebecor for several months after leaving his PMO job last July , simultaneously appearing as a conservative pundit on CBC television , where he went after EKOS pollster Frank Graves by accusing him of Liberal partisan bias .
Luc Lavoie , a former spokesman for Brian Mulroney , will be helping out .
There is plenty of speculation about who else might be poached away from their current posts , including controversial CBC television reporter Krista Erickson .
Teneycke has long talked about a television network that would cater to a conservative - minded audience , and has already come out swinging against naysayers in the established media .
When retired CBC personality Don Newman wrote a blog post calling the proposed network “ the absolute last thing this country needs , ” Teneycke shot back through his Twitter account by calling Newman “ Canada ’s answer to Helen Thomas ” , the 89 - year - old White House correspondent who recently resigned in the wake of controversial remarks about Israel .
Teneycke defended that online barb — and his vision for the “ hard news and straight talk ” network — in an interview Monday .
“ It ’s not surprising that incumbent players — competitors — are not that interested in seeing more people on the playing field and for those who think the media is only for . . . people they agree with , ” Teneycke said .
“ I think they ’re wrong .
It is for a whole diversity of voices and the public is free to make up their own minds what they read and what they watch on TV . ”
Jonathan Malloy , an associate professor of political science at Carleton University , said he is less concerned about the network giving voice to right - wing views ( which he believes would create healthy competition ) than the idea that it would adopt the polarizing tone Fox News has brought to political journalism .
“ The Fox network is not a good model to replicate , ” Malloy said Monday .
“ The Fox network is remarkably biased , I think , by any standard and helped make American politics even more combative and even less substantive than before and I do n’t want to see that model replicated in Canada . ”
The company also brought in David Akin , most recently a political reporter for Canwest News Service , to be Ottawa bureau chief and Brian Lilley from private broadcasting giant Astral Media Radio , is also officially on board .
Erickson , who has raised eyebrows for being the girlfriend of Conservative MP Lee Richardson ( Calgary Centre ) and got into trouble for feeding questions to a Liberal MP during committee hearings into the business relationship between Mulroney and Karlheinz Schreiber , is also rumoured to be joining the network .

Erickson sent an email to her colleagues at CBC on Monday morning to announce her departure but declined to comment on her future and referred all questions to her Toronto - based lawyer , Chris Taylor .
“ At this point we are not commenting on where Krista will land but should have an announcement in that regard shortly , ” Taylor wrote in an email .

ANN ARBOR —
In the ruins of a city that was once Rome ’s neighbor , archaeologists last summer found a 1,000 - pound lead coffin .
Who or what is inside is still a mystery , said Nicola Terrenato , the University of Michigan professor of classical studies who leads the project ?
the largest American dig in Italy in the past 50 years .
The sarcophagus will soon be transported to the American Academy in Rome , where engineers will use heating techniques and tiny cameras in an effort to gain insights about the contents without breaking the coffin itself .
“ We ’re very excited about this find , ” Terrenato said .
“ Romans as a rule were not buried in coffins to begin with and when they did use coffins , they were mostly wooden .
There are only a handful of other examples from Italy of lead coffins from this age ?
the second , third or fourth century A.D.
We know of virtually no others in this region . ”
This one is especially unusual because of its size .
“ It ’s a sheet of lead folded onto itself an inch thick , ” he said .
“ A thousand pounds of metal is an enormous amount of wealth in this era .
To waste so much of it in a burial is pretty unusual . ”
Was the deceased a soldier ?
A gladiator ?
A bishop ?
All are possibilities , some more remote than others , Terrenato said .
Researchers will do their best to examine the bones and any “ grave goods ” or Christian symbols inside the container in an effort to make a determination .
“ It ’s hard to predict what ’s inside , because it ’s the only example of its kind in the area , ” Terrenato said .
“ I ’m trying to keep my hopes within reason . ”
Human remains encased in lead coffins tend to be well preserved , if difficult to get to .
Researchers want to avoid breaking into the coffin .
The amount of force necessary to break through the lead would likely damage the contents .
Instead , they will first use thermography and endoscopy .
Thermography involves heating the coffin by a few degrees and monitoring the thermal response .
Bones and any artifacts buried with them would have different thermal responses , Terrenato said .
Endoscopy involves inserting a small camera into the coffin .
But how well that works depends on how much dirt has found its way into the container over the centuries .
If these approaches fail , the researchers could turn to an MRI scan ?
an expensive option that would involve hauling the half - ton casket to a hospital .
The dig that unearthed this find started in summer 2009 and continues through 2013 .
Each year , around 75 researchers from around the nation and world , including a dozen U - M undergraduate students , spend two months on the project at the ancient city of Gabii ( pronounced “ gabby ” ) .
The site of Gabii , situated on undeveloped land 11 miles east of Rome in modern - day Lazio , was a major city that pre-dates Rome but seems to have waned as the Roman Empire grew .
Studying Gabii gives researchers a glimpse into pre-Roman life and offers clues to how early Italian cities formed .
It also allows them broader access to more substantial archaeological layers or strata .
In Rome , layers of civilization were built on top of each other , and archaeologists are not able or allowed to disturb them .
“ In Rome , so often , there ’s something in the way , so we have to get lucky , ” Terrenato said .
“ In Gabii , they should all be lucky spots because there ’s nothing in the way . ”
Indeed , Terrenato and others were surprised to find something as significant as this coffin so soon .
“ The finding of the lead coffin was exhilarating , ” said Allison Zarbo , a senior art history major who graduates this spring .
Zarbo did n’t mind that after the researchers dug up the coffin once , they had to pile the dirt back on to hide it from looters overnight .
“ The fact that we had to fill the hole was not so much of a burden as a relief ! ” Zarbo said .
“ For academia to lose priceless artifacts that have been found fully in context would be very damaging to our potential knowledge . ”
Students spent most of their time pick - axing , shoveling , and manning the wheelbarrows , said Bailey Benson , a junior who is double majoring in classical archaeology and art history .
“ By the end of the day , not even a 20 - minute shower can remove all the dirt and grime you get covered in , ” Benson said .
“ It ’s hard but satisfying work .
How many people can say they uncovered an ancient burial ? ”
This research is funded in part by the National Geographic Society .
The managing director of the project is Jeffrey Becker , assistant professor of classics at McMaster University .
The field director leading the coffin studies is independent researcher Anna Gallone .
The Italian State Archaeological Service ( Soprintendenza di Roma ) is authorizing and facilitating the project .
Just to cap off a huge weekend for the Senator and future President , Obama wins a Grammy for the audio version of “ Audacity of Hope ” .
Add that to his sweep yesterday and his stunning upset victory in Maine today and you do n’t get much more momentum than that .

According to reports in South Africa , 36 female Dutch fans were ejected from the Netherlands - Denmark World Cup 2010 match at Soccer City on Monday and questioned by FIFA regarding alleged ‘ ambush marketing ’ .
South African newspaper
The Star claimed that the women were all dressed in orange mini-dresses that were part of a Bavaria beer promotion campaign back in the Netherlands .
FIFA does n’t allow ambush marketing , a term that describes the promotional efforts of a company at an event at which it is not an official sponsor .
A spokesman from the company denied the charges and told the Johannesburg publication that the women had been held in a FIFA office for hours .
" It 's a nice dress .
Very fashionable , ” Peer Swinkels , who pointed that there was no branding on the dress , told The Star .
" In my opinion , people should have the right to wear whatever they want .
We launched the orange item on April 30 on the queen 's birthday , which we call Queen 's Day .
The Dutch people are a little crazy about orange and we wear it on public holidays and events like the World Cup . "
One of the dress - wearers , Barbara Kastein , told the newspaper her story .
" We were sitting near the front , making a lot of noise , and the cameras kept focusing on us , " Kastein said .
" We were singing songs and having a good time .
" In the second half , about 40 stewards surrounded us and forced us to leave the stadium .
They pushed us up the stairs , and one of the girls fell . "
Kastein said that the girls were questioned by FIFA and then the police .
" The police came and kept on asking us the same questions over and over , asking if we worked for Bavaria .
They said we were ambush - marketing and it was against the law in South Africa .
They said we would be arrested and would stay in jail for six months .
Girls were crying .
It was bad .
" A police van took us back to our hotel and they wanted my passport .
They made a copy and said they would investigate .
They said they would sue me .
All of this for wearing an orange dress . "
Bavaria beer has made headlines in the past .
At the 2006 World Cup , fans who wore Bavaria - branded lederhosen at a game were told to remove their pants before entering the stadium .
" This time we put no branding on the dress , " said Swinkels .
" And FIFA do n't have a monopoly over orange . "
According to The Star , FIFA said there were no arrests and that " several young South African women were used by a large Dutch brewery as an instrument for an ambush - marketing campaign " .

A onetime professional dancer is suing food giant Cargill , Inc. , claiming that she was paralyzed by a contaminated hamburger produced by the company .
Twenty - two - year - old Stephanie Smith first became sick three years ago , after eating a hamburger contaminated with E. coli .
Her illness progressed from simple food poisoning into constant seizures , and doctors were forced to put her into an induced coma for three months .
She had suffered so much brain and kidney damage that she had to be kept alive on a ventilator and dialysis .
Smith stayed in the hospital for nine months and has undergone two years of rehabilitative therapy since then .
Even so , she still requires constant care and can only move around by wheelchair .
" I have handled food borne illness cases since the Jack in the Box outbreak nearly seventeen years ago , and I have never seen someone so severely injured survive , " Smith 's attorney Bill Marler said .
" She has lost the ability to walk , to dance , to have a family , to work or care for herself .
I do n't think it 's possible to adequately convey in a sentence or two the massive challenges Stephanie has faced and continues to face .
" Smith 's medical bills to date add up to more than $ 2 million .
When the hamburger that made her ill was traced back to Cargill , she approached the company for financial assistance .
A Cargill representative claims that the company has " advanced " her funds , but Smith and the company have been unable to reach a mediated settlement to her claim .
A front - pagestory about Smith in October sparked U.S. Rep. Rosa DeLaura , chair of the House Appropriations Subcommittee on Agriculture , to demand that the U.S. Department of Agriculture ( USDA ) make big slaughterhouses more accountable for the safety of their meat .
" I am writing to strongly urge the [ USDA ] and Food Safety and Inspection Service ( FSIS ) to investigate the disturbing allegations that were revealed in [ the ] article about the beef inspection process , " she wrote in a letter to Secretary of Agriculture Tom Vilsack .

President Obama has endorsed a compromise to pave the way for the repeal of Do n't Ask , Do n't Tell .
Under the deal , lawmakers could vote soon to repeal the contentious 17 - year - old policy , which bars gay men and lesbians from serving openly in the armed services ; the House Democratic leaders are considering taking up the measure as soon as this week .
But the policy would not change until sometime after Dec. 1 , when the Pentagon completes a review of its readiness to deal with the new policy .
President Obama would also be required to certify that repeal would not harm military readiness .
If it passed , the measure could clear the way for gay men and lesbians to serve openly in the military as early next year , ending a policy that Mr. Obama , Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates and Adm .

Financial abuses of deadbeat parents
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
For parents who 've wrecked their own credit rating , cashing in on junior 's clean financial history is increasingly tempting .
Children make easy targets for identity thieves because they do n't use their own credit and likely would n't notice any discrepancies until they reach adulthood .
And when a parent uses his or her own child , the risk of prosecution is lower because of the family ties .
It 's not easy to turn in mom and dad , especially if they were simply trying to provide for the family .
" The parent is saying , ' I have to keep the lights on and water running , ' " said Adam Levin , co-founder of Identity Theft 911 and CEO of Credit.com .
" But unfortunately , they often fall behind on payments and in the end , they 've just put their child behind the 8 - ball . "
If parents have a child 's social security number , they can do almost anything -- no matter how young the child is -- because a credit check does not verify a person 's age , said Robert Siciliano , CEO of IDTheftSecurity.com .
Here are several ways parents can damage their children 's financial reputation before they even finish school :
Taking out loans :
With access to every piece of their child 's financial identity , it 's easy for parents to take out a loan in their son's or daughter 's names .
One college senior from the D.C. metro area , who spoke to CNNMoney.com on the condition of anonymity , did n't find out that her father had taken out education loans in her name until she went to open her first credit card and was denied .
" I never thought he would ever do something like this to me , " she said .
" It 's really manipulative to do that to your kids because you know you have that power over them . "
Not only is she now stuck paying back the loans -- plus interest -- but her credit is shot .
" My credit is really bad now , " she said .
" I 've had to have a co-signer for every apartment I 've ever had , I can't get a credit card and getting any other loans or even a car is going to be very hard . "
But she said she would rather put up with the financial pain than turn her father in to the authorities .
" It 's just not worth the emotional turmoil , " she said .
" But every once in a while I do get so frustrated that I almost go ahead and do it . "
Opening credit cards :
When their own cards are maxed out , parents can easily apply for new cards in a child 's name .
" Some parents will do this because they still want to buy the things they can't afford , " said Linda Foley , founder of the Identity Theft Resource Center .
" And the easiest opportunity to do this for someone who is really desperate is to use their own family members . "
Alex , a 28 year old from Ann Arbor , Mich. , said his father opened three credit cards in his name while he was in college .
After Alex received packages containing items that his father had ordered online , his dad admitted to activating a credit card in Alex 's name because he desperately needed the money .
" He said a card had come in the mail so he activated it , that it was n't a big deal and he would pay it off , and I had no reason not to trust him . " said Alex .
" But once I got a credit report and found out there were a bunch of them and they had n't been paid off , that 's when I got angry . "
Two of the credit cards
Alex 's dad opened had been maxed out and all three were past due on payments .
As a result , Alex 's credit score dropped by about 150 to 200 points .
Creating new accounts :
Opening a utility or phone account in a child 's name is another common offense , said Siciliano of IDTheftSecurity.com .
Because of the availability of personal information to close family members , more than half of identity theft cases are typically committed by parents , he said .
" Parents who are compromising their child 's identity are generally doing it because of a need , like a single mom whose electric bill is too high and the lights get turned off , so the path of least resistance is putting it under the baby 's name , " said Siciliano .
" But then a light bulb goes off in her head and she opens a mobile phone account , and the next thing you know she has a credit card under her kid's name or gets a car loan , " he said .
Co-signing a lease :
It 's not just underage children who are being targeted .
More parents with subpar credit are turning to their adult kids for help .
The number of children between 21 to 28 years old agreeing to become co-signers of a parent 's auto lease has jumped nearly 30 % over the last two years at LeaseTrader.com , an auto lease transfer marketplace .
" You used to rely on your parents to help you out or co-sign something , " said John Sternal , vice president of marketing and communications at LeaseTrader.com .
" Today it 's a little bit of the opposite , since kids often have credit situations that have n't been tarnished as much as their parents ' . "
If payments are made , co-signing a lease for a parent can actually benefit a child by helping him or her to establish credit .
But many young adults do n't realize the responsibility they are taking on and how important their credit is , said Sternal .
" Credit is the life - blood for everything today , so you want to do everything you can to protect your credit going forward , " said Sternal .

& What Have You
While the improving economy is good news for everyone , some employers are getting slightly nervous as they ask themselves a difficult question :
Will workers leave en mass once they see greener grass elsewhere ?
The recession prompted many workplaces to slash their work force , resulting in remaining workers being saddled with more responsibilities — often without extra compensation .
In some cases , employees took on more work while having their pay or benefits cut .
So as business conditions improve , employers have real concerns that these key workers , who have kept them thriving in tough times , will jump at the chance to start fresh somewhere else .
Retaining key workers could be a problem not only because workers feel overwhelmed , but because employees in many companies have a lingering sense of discontent about the way leadership operates .
For example , a recent Right Management survey found 19 % of employees " rarely " trust their managers to make the best decisions .
" There is a bit of fear on the horizon that as we come out of this recession those employees who have been mistreated — we will see the loss of those people , " says Dave Ulrich , a University of Michigan business professor .
" We think there 's a real crisis around employee engagement . "
Wendy Ulrich , a psychologist and Dave 's wife , says that in the past year many employees have been grateful to have a job — no matter what the conditions .
But that attitude probably will start to change as the economy improves and more workers begin to look for something more in their jobs .
She says that many will search for " meaning " and for company cultures that show appreciation and respect for their work .
If they can't find that in current positions , she says , it could lead them to look for jobs elsewhere .
In Dave and Wendy 's Ulrich 's new book , The Why of Work ( McGraw - Hill , $ 27.95 ) , the authors say that while managers within some companies fear that employees will jump ship at a critical time , the upper ranks are n't necessarily feeling this same concern .
They say that many top leaders are ignoring the issue , which is why in their book they seek to point out that a lack of employee engagement can have bottom - line consequences for businesses .
From 1998 to 2008 what they call the " best companies to work for " had a 6.8 % stock appreciation compared to 1 % for a typical company , they say .
And disengaged employees are 10 times more likely to quit their jobs within a year , they point out .
" If you do n't engage people 's hearts and souls , they 're going to go elsewhere , " Wendy Ulrich says .
She argues that these kinds of numbers prove that leaders can't use old - school management practices any more if they want to compete in a global marketplace .
" A lot of us are used to management by control and demand .
But the carrot and the stick only go so far , " she says .
" When people are in jobs they do n't like , they are going to be giving less than their best effort .
They 're going to just be going through the motions , and they 'll be less productive . "
Dave Ulrich says that as people spend more time at work , they seem to be seeking more meaning in their jobs , a message that employers must heed if they want to survive .
" If employees find meaning in what they do , they can tell themselves that yes , it 's hard , yes , it 's work , but they have found meaning , " he says .
Employers need to begin a new phase of how they operate — one that relies on engaging workers as partners and collaborators to achieve success for both the company and for individuals — the authors say .
To help employees find meaning in their work , employers should take certain steps : 1 . Helping employees develop and use abilities they consider important , such as leadership , integrity and kindness .
2 . Enabling those employees to understand how their efforts directly affect something they care about .
For example , leaders could let workers know how the production of widgets is then used to build products that help the environment .
3 . Promoting a positive work environment by displaying kindness , humility and civility .
" The companies that convey a sense of meaning and purpose to their workers will win , " Wendy Ulrich says .
" This is an economic gain , not an emotional gain . "

If you 're familiar with the Clojure programming language , then you might know that at its heart lays a powerful set of immutable , persistent , collection types .
In this article we will talk a bit about the underpinnings of these collection types including a deep dive into a couple of them ; namely its vectors and maps .
Finally , we 'll wrap up by presenting an example of how viewing a problem through the lens of the Clojure way we can vastly simply our design .
On Immutability
Why was Clojure designed and implemented with immutability as a cornerstone principle ?
While certainly no panacea , fostering immutability at the language level solves many difficult problems right out of the box , while at the same time simplifying many others .
Coming from a language background where mutability interwoven with imperative programming methods reign , it often requires a significant conceptual leap to twist one 's mind to accept and utilize immutability and functional programming .
In many cases , purists see the essence of immutability as a precondition for any given language to fall into the category of functional programming .
While we are certainly not willing to set hard and fast definitions of such nebulous topics , we will say that data structure immutability and functional programming do indeed complement one another quite well .
In this section we 'll build a conceptual basis for immutability as it relates to Clojure 's underlying philosophy as well as why you should work to foster immutability even when outside the warming confines of Clojure proper .
Defining Immutability
Related Sponsored Content Demystifying Microservices for Jakarta EE & Java EE Developers
When using the word immutability in the context of Clojure , we will more often than not refer strictly to its core data types .
However , the larger picture of immutability can be extended beyond the strict ecosystem of data structures alone and instead encompass any object that adheres to the notion of immutability .
In many cases , when talking specifically about Clojure 's immutable data structures we could in fact be talking about the broader category of immutable objects without loss of meaning .
However , in order to make this case we should probably set down some conditions defining just what we mean by immutability .
Every Day is Like Sunday
There is an entire branch of philosophy named predestination devoted to exploring the notion that there is no such thing as freewill , but instead , everything that we are or ever will be is determined beforehand .
While this possibility for our own lives may seem bleak , the very notion does nicely encapsulate the first principle of object immutability .
That is , all of the possible properties of immutable objects are defined at the time of their construction and can not be changed thereafter .
Immutability Exists Through Convention
There is nothing magical about immutable objects .
That is , computer systems are in many ways open systems , providing the keys to the vault if one is so inclined to grab them .
However , in order to foster an air of immutability in our own systems it is of the utmost importance to crate a facade of immutability .
In other words , immutability requires that we layer over and abstract the parts of our system that provide unrestrained mutability .
For example , creating immutable classes in Java requires us to do this in a number of ways .
First , a class itself and all of its fields should be labeled as final .
Next , in no way should an objects 's this reference escape during construction .
And finally , any internal mutable objects should originate , either whole - cloth or through a copy , within the class itself and thus never escape .
Obviously we 're simplifying in order to illustrate as there are finer details to this recipe for Java immutability , but for now these simplified highlights serve to show that by observing convention , even an inherently mutable language such as Java can be made to be immutable .
In languages like Java , immutability is not directly supported and requires some gymnastics in order to achieve while Clojure directly supports immutability as a language feature with its core data structures .
By providing immutable data structures as a primary language feature Clojure separates the complexity of working with immutable structures from the complexities of their implementation .
Of course the parts defining immutable objects as outlined above are meant to be viewed agnostic to any specific programming language .
However , by providing immutability either as a core language feature or through convention , you can buy yourself enormous benefits .
The Benefits of Immutability
Clojure 's immutable data structures are not bolted on to the language as an after - thought or as a choice in an ala - carte menu .
Instead , their inclusion in the language runs deep to its philosophical core .
Invariants
Invariant - based programming involves the definition of constraints on classes and function in order to provide assurances that if its instances enter into certain states assertion errors will arise .
Providing invariants within a mutable system requires a fair amount of assertion weaving within the methods of any given class .
However , by observing a practice of immutability , invariants are defined solely within the construction mechanism and can never be violated thereafter .
Reasoning
In the face of mutability , passing any object to any function works to obliterates the possibility of tracking the changes in its properties .
However , because the life of an immutable object is one of pre-destiny , the matter of reasoning about its possible states becomes a trivial matter .
It therefore follows that the act of testing such a system is simplified in that set of the possible states and transitions is constrained .
Equality Has Meaning
Equality in the presence of mutability has no meaning .
Equality in the face of mutability and concurrency is utter lunacy .
That is , if any two objects resolve as being equal now , then there is absolutely no guarantee that they will a moment from now .
And if two objects are not equal forever , then they are technically never equal .
Providing immutable objects once again assigns meaning to equality in that if two object are equal now then they will always be so .
Sharing is Cheap
If you are certain that an object will never change , then sharing said object becomes a simple matter of providing a reference to it .
In Java to do so often requires a lot of defensive copying .
Along this vein , because we can freely share references for immutable objects we can likewise intern them for free .
Flattening the Levels of Indirection
There is a marked difference between a mutable object and a mutable reference .
The default in Java is that there are mutable references that contain mutable data .
However , in Clojure there are only mutable references .
This may seem like a minor detail , but it certainly works to reduce unnecessary complexities .
Why else is there a proliferation of final in next - generation Java programming styles ?
Of course , in a concurrency - oriented programming language like Clojure , the primary benefit of immutability is that the core types can be shared freely among separate threads without fear .
In the next section we will discuss this particular benefit in more detail .
Immutability Fosters Concurrent Programming
Immutable objects are always thread safe -- Brian Goetz , Java Concurrency in Practice
If an object cannot change it follows that it can be shared freely between different threads of execution without fear of concurrent modification .
There can be very little debate about this particular point , but that fact does not answer the question of just how mutation occurs .
Without delving into the specifics , you likely already know that Clojure isolates mutation to its reference types while the data wrapped with them is left unchanged .
It 's enough to leave this well enough alone for now since we will devote chapter 9 to this and related topics .
Designing a Persistent Toy
We will not go into terrible detail about the internals of Clojure 's persistent data structures -- we 'll leave that to others .
But we do want to explore the notion of structural sharing .
Our example will be highly simplified compared to Clojure 's implementations , but it should help clarify some of the techniques used .
The simplest shared - structure type is the list .
Two different items can be added to the front of the same list , producing two new lists which share their next parts .
Lets try this out by actually creating a base list and then two new lists from that same base :
( def baselist ( list : barnabas : adam ) ) ( def lst1 ( cons : willie baselist ) ) ( def lst2 ( cons : phoenix baselist ) ) lst1 ;=> ( : willie : barnabas : adam ) lst2 ;= > ( : phoenix : barnabas : adam )
We can think of baselist as a historical version of both lst1 and lst2 .
But it 's also the shared part of both lists .
More than being equal , the next parts of both lists are identical -- the very same instance :
(= ( next lst1 ) ( next lst2 ) ) ; => gt ; true ( identical ? ( next lst1 ) ( next lst2 ) ) ;=> gt ; true
So that 's not too complicated , right ?
But the features supported by lists are also pretty limited .
Clojure 's vectors and maps also provide structural sharing , while allowing you to change values anywhere in the collection , not just on one end .
The key is the tree structure each of these uses internally .
To help demonstrate how a tree can allow interior changes and maintain shared structure at the same time , let 's build one of our own .
Each node of our tree will have 3 fields : a value , a left branch , and a right branch .
We 'll just put them in a map , like this :
{:val 5 , :l nil , :r nil}
That 's the simplest possible tree -- a single node holding the value 5 , with empty left and right branches .
This is exactly the kind of tree we want to return when a single item is added to an empty tree .
To represent an empty tree , we 'll just use nil .
Let 's write our own conj function to build up our tree , starting with just the code for this initial case :
( defn xconj [t v ] ( cond ( nil ? t ) {:val v , :l nil , :r nil} ) ) ( xconj nil 5 ) {:val 5 , :l nil , :r nil}
Hey , it works !
Not too impressive yet though , so we need to handle the case where an item is being added to a non-empty tree .
Lets keep our tree in order by putting values less than a node 's :val in the left branch , and other values in the right branch .
That means we need a test like :
(< v ( : val t ) )
When that 's true , we need our new value v to go into the left branch , ( :l t ) .
If this were a mutable tree , we 'd change the value of :l to be our new node .
Instead , let 's build a new node , copying in the parts of the old node that do n't need to change .
Something like :
{:val ( : val t ) , :l ( insert - new - val - here ) , :r ( : r t ) }
This will be our new root node .
Now we just need to figure out what to put for insert - new - val - here .
If the old value of :l is nil , we simply need a new single - node tree -- we even have code for that already , so could use ( xconj nil v ) .
But what if :l is not nil ?
In that case we just want to insert v in its proper place within whatever tree :l is pointing to , so ( :l t ) instead of nil in that xconj expression .
That gives us a new xconj that looks like this :
( defn xconj [t v ] ( cond ( nil ? t ) {:val v , :l nil , :r nil} (
There , it 's working .
At least it seems to be -- there 's a lot of noise in that output making it difficult to read .
Here 's a little function to traverse the tree in sorted order , converting it to a seq that will print more succinctly :
( defn xseq [ t ] ( when t ( concat ( xseq ( :l t ) ) [ ( :val t ) ] ( xseq ( : r t ) ) ) ) ) ( xseq tree1 ) ;=>gt ; ( 2 3 5 )
Lookin ' good .
Now we just need a final condition for handling the insertion of values that are not less than the node value :
( defn xconj [t v ] ( cond ( nil ? t ) {:val v , :l nil , :r nil} (
Now that we 've got the thing built , hopefully you understand well enough how it 's put together that this demonstration of the shared structure will be unsurprising :
( def tree2 ( xconj tree1 7 ) ) ( xseq tree2 ) ;=>gt ; ( 2 3 5 7 ) ( identical ? ( :l tree1 ) ( :l tree2 ) ) ;=> gt ; true
Think about that for a moment .
No matter how big the left side of a tree 's root node is , something can be inserted on the right side without copying , changing , or even examining the left side .
All those values will be included in the new tree , along with the inserted value .
Thus this toy example demonstrates several features that it has in common with all of Clojure 's persistent collections :
Every " change " creates at least a new root node , plus new nodes as needed in the path through the tree to where the new value is being inserted .
Values and unchanged branches are never copied , but references to them are copied from nodes in the old tree to nodes in the new one .
This implementation is completely thread - safe in a way that 's easy to check -- no object that existed before a call to xconj is changed in any way , and newly created nodes are in their final state before being returned .
There is simply no way for any other thread , or even any other functions in the same thread , to see anything in an inconsistent state .
There are a few ways our example falls down though , when compared to Clojure 's rather more production - quality code .
This toy :
Is just a binary tree
Can only store numbers
Will overflow the stack if the tree gets too deep
Produces ( via xseq ) a non-lazy seq that will contain a whole copy of the tree .
) a non-lazy seq that will contain a whole copy of the tree .
Can create unbalanced trees that will have very bad " worst case " algorithmic complexity .
While structural sharing as described using xconj as a basis example can reduce the memory footprint of persistent data structures , it alone is insufficient .
Instead , Clojure leans heavily on the notion of lazy sequences to further reduce its memory footprint as we explore further in our book , The Joy of Clojure .
Having touch on the basics of structural sharing that is analogous to Clojure 's collection types , let 's spend some time talking about the two most ubiquitous collection types in Clojure : vectors and maps .
Vectors : Creating and Using All Their Varieties
A vector stores zero or more values sequentially indexed by number , a bit like an array , but are of course immutable and persistent .
They are versatile and make efficient use of memory and processor resources at both small and large sizes .
Vectors are probably the most frequently used collection type in Clojure code .
They 're used as literals for argument lists and let bindings , for holding large amounts of application data , as stacks , and as map entries .
We 'll examine all of these facets , and finish with an examination of cases where vectors do not work well .
Building Vectors
Vectors can be built using the literal square - bracket syntax [ 1 2 3 ] .
This syntax , compared to lists ' round parenthesis , is one reason you might choose to use a vector over a list .
For example , the let form would work perfectly well , and with a nearly identical implementation , if it took a literal list of bindings instead of a literal vector .
However the square brackets are visually different from the round parenthesis surrounding the let form itself as well as the likely function calls in the body of the let form , and this is quite useful for us humans .
Using vectors to indicate bindings for let , with - open , fn and such is idiomatic in Clojure and is a pattern you are encouraged to follow in any similar macros you write yourself .
The most common way to create a vector is with the literal syntax described above .
But in many cases you want to create a vector out of the contents of some other kind of collection .
For this there is the function vec :
( range 10 ) ;=> gt ; ( 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 ) ( vec ( range 10 ) ) ;=>gt ; [ 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 ]
Note the round parens on the result from range , compared to the square brackets on the result from vec .
This is our hint that range returned a seq , while vec returned a vector filled with the values from the seq .
If you already have a vector but want to concatenate several values to it , into is your friend :
( let [ my - vector [ : a :b : c ] ] ( into my - vector ( range 10 ) ) ) ;=> [ :a :b :c 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 ]
If you want it to return a vector , the first argument to into must be a vector , as we have above .
The second arg however can be any sequence , such as what range returns , or anything else that works with seq function .
The values from the seq are " poured into " the supplied vector .
Because vectors themselves work with seq , you can use into to concatenating two vectors together :
( into [ : a :b : c ] [ :x :y :z ] ) ;=>gt ; [ : a :b :c :x :y :z ]
But be aware this is treating the second vector just as a seq , so it 's an essentially linear - time operation based on the size of the second vector .
That 's really all you need to know about building vectors , though just for completeness we 'll show you the rarely - used vector function , which builds a vector from of the arguments you give it instead of from a seq :
( vector 1 2 3 ) ;= > [ 1 2 3 ]
There 's hardly ever a good reason to use vector instead of a literal vector .
This is more true of vectors than it is of lists , but that 's getting ahead of ourselves .
Using vec and into , it 's easy to build vectors much larger than are usually built using vector literals .
Once you 've got a large vector like that , what are you doing to do with it ?
Let 's look at that next .
Large Vectors
When collections are small , the performance differences between vectors and lists hardly matters at all .
But as they get larger , each becomes dramatically slower at operations the other can still perform efficiently .
Vectors are particularly efficient at three things relative to lists : adding or removing things from the right - hand end of the collection , accessing or changing items in the interior of the collection by numeric index , and walking in reverse order .
Adding and removing from the end is done by treating the vector as a stack -- we 'll cover that a bit later .
Any item in a vector can be accessed by its index number from 0 up to but not including ( count my - vector ) in essentially constant time .
This can be done using the function nth ; the function get , essentially treating the vector like a map ; or by simply invoking the vector itself as a function .
Let 's look at each of these as applied to this example vector :
( def some - chars ( vec ( map char ( range 65 75 ) ) ) ) some - chars ; =>gt ; [ \ A \B \C \D \E \F \G \ H \ I \J ]
All three of these do the same work and each returns \E :
( nth some - chars 4 ) ( get some - chars 4 ) ( some - chars 4 ) ; vector as a function
Which to use is a judgement call , so here are some things you might consider when choosing :
nth get vector as function Vector is nil returns nil returns nil throws exception Index out of range throws exception returns nil throws exception Supports
Ònot foundÓ yes yes no
Because vectors are indexed , they can be efficiently walked in either direction , left - to - right or right - to - left .
The seq and rseq functions return sequences that do exactly that :
( seq some - chars ) ;=>gt ; ( \A \B \C \D \E \F \G \ H \ I \ J ) ( rseq some - chars ) ;=>gt ; ( \J \I \H \G \F \E \D \ C \ B \A )
Any item in a vector can be " changed " using the assoc function .
Of course since vectors are immutable it is n't actually changed -- assoc returns a new vector that is exactly like the old one except for the updated value .
Clojure does this in essentially constant time using structural sharing between the old and new vectors as we described at the beginning of this article .
( assoc some - chars 4 " no longer E " ) ;= > [ \ A \B \C \D " no longer E " \ F \ G \ H \ I \J ]
Note that the value of some - chars has n't changed at all .
The REPL just printed a new vector that is almost but not quite entirely like some - chars .
The assoc function for vectors only works on indices that already exist in the vector or , as a special case , exactly one step past the end .
In this latter case , the returned vector will be one item larger than the input vector .
More frequently however vectors are " grown " using the conj function as we 'll see in the next section .
There are a few higher - powered functions provided that use assoc internally .
For example , the replace function works on both seqs and vectors , but when given a vector it uses assoc to fix up and return a new vector :
( replace { 2 :a , 4 :b} [ 1 2 3 2 3 4 ] ) ;= > [ 1 :a 3 :a 3 :b ]
The functions assoc-in and update - in are for working with nested structures of vectors and / or maps , like this one :
( def matrix
( def matrix [ [ 1 2 3 ] [ 3 4 5 ] [ 5 6 7 ] ] )
Both assoc-in and update - in take a series of indices to pick items from each more deeply nested level .
For a vector arranged like the matrix example above , this amounts to row and column coordinates :
( assoc - in matrix [ 1 2 ] 'x ) ;= > [ [ 1 2 3 ] [ 3 4 x ] [ 5 6 7 ] ]
The update - in function works the same way , but instead of taking a value to overwrite an exiting value , it takes a function to apply to an existing value .
It will replace the value at the given coordinates with the return value of the function you give :
( update - in matrix [ 1 2 ] * 10 ) ;= > [ [ 1 2 3 ] [ 3 4 50 ] [ 5 6 7 ] ]
The coordinates refer to the value 5 , and the function given above is * so the value 5 will be replaced by the return value of (* 5 10 ) .
The trailing 10 there comes from the extra argument given to update - in -- any number of arguments may be given to be appended to the function applied .
So far we 've not changed the size of any of the vectors we 've looked at , just looked things up and changed items in place .
Next we 'll look at growing and shrinking vectors -- treating them like stacks .
Vectors as Stacks
Classic mutable stacks have at least two operations , push and pop .
These also work work on vectors , though they 're called conj and pop respectively , by adding and removing things from the right - hand end .
Because vectors are immutable , pop returns a new vector with the right - most item dropped -- this is a bit different from the many mutable stack APIs which generally return the dropped item .
Consequently , peek becomes more important as the primary way to get item from the top of the stack .
Enough talking -- let 's do some doing .
( def my - stack [ 1 2 3 ] ) ( peek [ 1 2 3 ] ) ;=> gt ; 3 ( pop [ 1 2 3 ] ) ;=>gt ; [ 1 2 ] ( conj my - stack 4 ) ; =>gt ; [ 1 2 3 4 ] ( -> gt ; my - stack ( conj 4 ) ( conj 5 ) pop ( conj 6 ) ) ;=>gt ; [ 1 2 3 4 6 ]
Each of these operations completes in essentially constant time .
Most of the time , a vector that 's used as a stack is used that way throughout its life .
It 's helpful to future readers of your code to keep this is mind and use the stack operations consistently , even when other functions might work .
For example , last on a vector returns the same thing as peek , but besides being slower it leads to unnecessary confusion about how the collection is being used .
If the algorithm involved calls for a stack , use conj not assoc for growing the vector , peek not last , and pop not dissoc for shrinking it .
If conj and pop are n't fast enough for you , faster equivalents are available for vectors that support transient which we will cover in our book .
The functions conj , pop , and peek work on any object that implements clojure.lang.IPersistentStack [ 11 ] .
Besides vectors , Clojure lists also implement this interface , but the functions operate on the left - hand side of lists instead of the right - hand side as with vectors .
Using Vectors instead of ' reverse '
The ability of vectors to grow efficiently on the right - hand end , and then be walked left - to - right produces a noteworthy emergent behavior : idiomatic Clojure code very rarely uses the reverse function .
This is quite different from most Lisps and Schemes , so if you 're familiar with one of those , we can take a short look at how this works out .
If you do n't care about Lisps other than Clojure ( and why would you , really ) , feel free to skip on down to " Vectors as Stacks " .
When processing a list , it is pretty common to want to produce a new list in the same order .
However if all you 've got are classic Lisp lists , often the most natural algorithm leaves you with a backwards list that needs to be reversed .
Here 's an example of a function a bit like Clojure 's map , but strict instead of lazy :
( defn strict - map1 [f coll ] ( loop [ coll coll , acc nil ] ( if ( empty ? coll ) ( reverse acc ) ( recur ( next coll ) ( cons ( f ( first coll ) ) a cc ) ) ) ) ) ( strict - map1 odd ? ( range 5 ) ) ; => gt ; ( false true false true false )
This is perfectly good , idiomatic Clojure code , except for that glaring reverse of the final return value .
After the entire list has been walked once to produce the desired values , reverse walks it again to get them in the right order .
This is both inefficient and non-idiomatic .
One way to get rid of the reverse is to use a vector instead of a list as the accumulator :
( defn strict - map2 [f coll ] ( loop [ coll coll , acc [ ] ] ( if ( empty ? coll ) acc ( recur ( next coll ) ( conj acc ( f ( first coll ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ( strict - map2 odd ? ( range 5 ) ) ; => gt ; [ false true false true false ]
A small change , but the code is now a touch cleaner and a bit faster .
It does return a vector instead of a list , but this is rarely a problem as any client code that wants to treat this as a seq can usually do so automatically .
On occasion , though , it may be appropriate to return ( seq acc ) instead of just acc .
By the way , another way to get rid of a reverse is to build a lazy sequence instead of a strict collection .
In fact , this is how Clojure 's own map function is implemented .
We cover that and much more about lazy seqs in chapter 5 of our book .
The term " vector " in Clojure is actually a colloquial description of any object that implements clojure.lang .IPersistentVector .
There are a few concrete classes that act as vectors : PersistentVector , SubVector , and MapEntry
So far the examples we 've seen have all been plain PersistentVectors , though they would have worked for any of these types .
But lets turn now to the special features of these other vector types , starting with SubVector .
SubVectors
Although items cannot be removed efficiently from a vector ( except the right - most item ) , SubVectors provide a very fast way to take a slice of an existing vector based on start and end indexes .
They are created using the subvec function .
Let 's use the some - chars vector we defined earlier :
some - chars ; =>gt ; [ \ A \B \C \D \E \F \G \ H \ I \J ]
The subvec takes a start and end index and returns a new vector :
( subvec some - chars 3 6 ) ; =>gt ; [ \ D \E \F ]
The first index given to subvec is inclusive ( starts at index 3 ) but the second is exclusive ( ends before index 6 ) .
But the really interesting thing is that this new vector internally hangs onto the entire original some - chars vector .
Each lookup we do on the new vector causes the SubVector to do a little offset math and then lookup in the original vector .
This makes creating a SubVector very fast .
If either the SubVector or its underlying vector were mutable , you could detect this fact by making a change to one and observing the effect in the other .
But since both are immutable , SubVector can be treated exactly the same as any other vector .
You can use subvec on any kind of vector and it'll work fine .
But it has special logic for taking a subvec of a subvec , in which case the newest SubVector keeps a reference to the original vector , not the intermediate SubVector .
This prevents SubVectors - of - SubVectors from stacking up needlessly , and keeps both the creation and use of the sub -subvecs fast .
Vectors as MapEntries
Clojure 's hash - map , just like hash tables or dictionaries in many other languages , has a mechanism to iterate through the entire collection .
Clojure 's solution for this iterator is , unsurprisingly , a seq .
Each item of this seq needs to include both the key and the value , so they 're wrapped in a MapEntry .
When printed , each entry looks like a vector :
( first {: width 10 , : height 20 , : depth 15} ) ; =>gt ; [ : width 10 ]
But not only does a MapEntry look like a vector , it really is one :
( vector ? ( first {: width 10 , : height 20 , : depth 15} ) ) ;=> true
This means we can use all the regular vector functions on it : conj , get , and so on .
It even supports destructuring , which can be very handy .
For example , the locals dimension and amount below will take on the value of each key / value pair in turn :
( doseq [ [ dimension amount ] {: width 10 , : height 20 , : depth 15} ] ( println ( str ( name dimension ) " : " ) amount " inches " ) ) ; width : 10 inches ; height : 20 inches ; depth : 15 inches ; => gt ; nil
Two - element vectors , whether they are MapEntries or not , can also be used to add values to a hash - map or sorted - map , if you prefer to use conj instead of assoc :
( conj {} [ :a 1 ] [ :b 2 ] ) ;=> {:b 2 , :a 1}
But a MapEntry is its own type and supports a couple extra functions for retrieving its contents : key and val , which do exactly the same thing as ( nth my - map 0 ) and ( nth my - map 1 ) , respectively .
These are sometimes useful for the clarity they can bring to your code , but quite frequently destructuring is used instead as it's just so darned handy .
So now you know what vectors are , what specific kinds of vectors are included in Clojure , and some of the things that they 're good at doing .
To round out our understanding of vectors , let 's conclude with a brief look at things that vectors are bad at doing .
What Vectors Are Not
Vectors are quite versatile , but there are some commonly desired patterns where they might seem like a good solution but in fact are not .
While we prefer to focus on the positive , hopefully a few negative examples will help you escape from using the wrong tool for the job .
Vectors are not sparse
If you have a vector of length n , the only position where you can insert a value is at index n , that is appending to the far right - hand end .
You can't skip some indexes and insert at a higher index number .
If you want a collection indexed by non-sequential numbers , consider a hash - map or sorted - map .
Although you can replace values within a vector , you can't insert or delete items such that indexes for the subsequent items would have to be adjusted .
Clojure does n't currently have a native persistent collection that supports this kind of operation , but finger trees may help for some use cases .
If you always will be wanting to prepend things at the left - hand end of a sequential collection , instead of the right - hand end the way vectors do , you might have found a good opportunity to use a PersistentList .
Vectors are not queues
Some people have tried to use vectors as queues .
One approach would be to push onto the right - hand end of the vector using conj and then to pop items off the left using rest or next .
The problem with this is that rest and next returns seqs , not vectors , so subsequent conj operations would not behave as desired .
Using into to convert the seq back into a vector is O (n ) which is less than ideal for every " pop " .
Another approach is to use subvec as a " pop " , leaving off the left - most item .
Since subvec does return a vector , subsequent conj operations will push onto the right - hand end as desired .
However , as we described above , subseq maintains a reference to the entire underlying vector , so none of the items being " popped " this way will ever be garbage collected .
Also less than ideal .
So what would be the ideal way to do queue operations on a persistent collection ?
Why , use a PersistentQueue , of course , which Clojure provides .
Vectors cannot contain primitives
Java primitives like int and byte take less memory and are often much faster to process than their boxed counterparts Integer and Byte .
Unfortunately , none of Clojure 's persistent collections support primitives yet .
Any attempt to put a primitive into a vector will result in auto - boxing of the item , and any value retrieved from a vector will similarly be an Object .
Although there are plans for Clojure vectors to eventually support primitives , that 's a ways off yet .
If you really need the memory or performance benefits of primitives in a collection , for now your only choice is to use a Java array .
Vectors are not sets
If you want to find out if a vector contains a particular value , you might be tempted to use the contains ?
function , but you'd be disappointed by the results .
contains ?
is for asking whether a particular key , not value , is in a collection , which is rarely useful for a vector .
Vector objects do have a contains method that you can call via Java interop that will give the results you want , but Clojure offers something much better -- a real set collection .
See section 6 of this chapter for details on sets .
Well there , that was certainly enough detail about vectors .
We saw how to create them using literal syntax or by building them up programmatically .
We looked at how to push them , pop them , slice them , and stuff them into maps .
We also looked at some of the things vectors can't do well .
One of these was adding and removing items from the left - hand side ; though vectors can't do this , lists can .
Let 's look at those next .
Map Varieties and How to Use Them
Compared to the other composite data types Clojure provides , it seems that its map should be unambiguous in its use cases .
While this is certainly true in many cases , there are some points to be made concerning the differing flavors of map provided .
Additionally , we will make a small point about using maps in many instances where you might be tempted to use other structures .
However , in general a simple rule applies : maps should be used in any case where your data structure requires a logical mapping of keys to values .
It 's very difficult to write a program of any significant size without the need for a map of some sort .
The use of maps are ubiquitous in writing software because frankly it 's difficult to imagine a more robust data structure .
However , we as programmers tend to view maps as a special case structure outside of the normal exaltations bestowed upon classes .
That is , the object - oriented school of thought has relegated the map as a supporting player in favor of the class .
We 're not going to talk about the merits , or lack thereof , for this relegation here , but throughout our book we discuss moving away from thinking in classes and instead thinking in sequence abstractions , maps , sets , and types .
Having said all of that , it need hardly be mentioned that maps should be used to store named values .
However , there are times when you may wish to use positional elements within a sequence to represent some structure .
This approach tends to be brittle and can often be better served by using maps instead because they are self organizing through the use of named values .
Clojure 's maps support an arbitrarily complex nesting of persistent types for both keys and values , so if you want a map that has vectors of maps as its keys , that 's perfectly okay .
Let 's talk about each form of map that Clojure provides and the tradeoffs surrounding each .
Hash Maps
Arguably , the most ubiquitous form of map found in Clojure programs is the hash map which provides an unsorted key - value associative structure .
In addition to the literal syntax touched on in chapter 1 , hash maps can be created using the hash - map function which likewise takes alternating key / value pairs , with or without commas :
( hash - map :a 1 , :b 2 , :c 3 , :d 4 , :e 5 )
The difference in results between the literal form and construction function is that the latter will always provide a hash map while the former could at times provide an array map .
The reason for this incongruity is not important at the moment , but will be discussed in the upcoming section about array maps .
Clojure hash maps support heterogeneous keys , meaning that they can be of any type and each key can be of a differing type .
( let [m {:a 1 , 1 :b , [ 1 2 3 ] " 4 5 6 " } ] [ ( get m : a ) ( get m [ 1 2 3 ] ) ] ) ;=>gt ; [ 1 " 4 5 6 " ]
As we previously mentioned in the beginning of this chapter , many of Clojure 's composite types can be used as functions and in the case of maps they are functions of their keys .
Using maps in this way will act the same as the use of the get function in the previous code sample .
( let [m {:a 1 , 1 :b , [ 1 2 3 ] " 4 5 6 " } ] [ ( m : a ) ( m [ 1 2 3 ] ) ] ) ;=>gt ; [ 1 " 4 5 6 " ]
Providing a map to the seq function will return a sequence of map entries :
( seq {:a 1 , :b 2} ) ;=>gt ; ( [ :a 1 ] [ :b 2 ] )
Of course , the sequence above appears to be composed of the sets of key / value pairs contained in vectors and for all practical purposes should be treated as such .
In fact , a new hash map can be created idiomatically using this precise structure :
( into {} ( list [ : a 1 ] [ : b 2 ] ) ) ;=> gt ; {:a 1 , :b 2}
Even if your embedded pairs are not vectors they can be made to be for building a new map :
( into {} ( map vec '( ( :a 1 ) ( :b 2 ) ) ) ) ;=> gt ; {:a 1 , :b 2}
In fact , your pairs do not have to be explicitly grouped as you can use apply to create a hash map given that the key / value pairs are laid out in a sequence consecutively .
( apply hash - map [ :a 1 :b 2 ] ) ;=> gt ; {:a 1 , :b 2}
You can also use apply in this way with sorted - map and array - map .
Another idiomatic way to build a map is to use zipmap to " zip " together two sequences , the first of which contains the desired keys and the second their corresponding values :
( zipmap [ : a :b ] ' ( 1 2 ) ) ;=> gt ; {:b 2 , :a 1}
Our use of zipmap illustrates nicely the final property of hash maps .
That is , hash maps in Clojure have no order guarantees .
If you do require ordering , then you should use sorted maps , discussed next .
Keeping Your Keys in Order With Sorted Maps
There is one potential downside to using maps in place of other common structures such as lists and vectors ; order agnosticism .
That is , it 's impossible rely on a specific ordering of the key values pairs for a standard Clojure map because there are no order guarantees at all .
Should the ordering of a map 's entries be important for your applications , then Clojure has two map implementations providing order assurances .
The first of these , which we will talk about is the sorted map which can be constructed using one of a pair of functions : sorted - map and sorted - map -by .
By default , the function sorted - map will build a map sorted by the comparison of its keys :
( sorted - map : thx 1138 :r2d 2 ) ;=>gt ; {:r2d 2 , : thx 1138}
However , you may require an alternative key ordering or perhaps for keys not normally comparable , say for non-trivial keys .
In these cases you must use sorted - map - by which takes an additional comparison function :
function : ( sorted - map " bac " 2 " abc " 9 ) ; => gt ; { " abc " 9 , " bac " 2} ( sorted - map - by #( compare ( subs % 1 1 ) ( subs % 2 1 ) ) " bac " 2 " abc " 9 ) ;=>gt ; { " bac " 2 , " abc " 9}
This means that sorted maps do not generally support heterogeneous keys the way hash - maps do , although it depends on the comparison function provided , for example the one above assumes all keys are strings .
The default sorted - map comparison function supports maps whose keys are all Numbers or are Comparable with each other .
Attempts to use keys that are n't supported by whichever comparison function you 're using will generally result in a class cast exception :
( sorted - map :a 1 , " b " 2 ) ;=>gt ; java.lang.ClassCastException : clojure.lang .
Keyword cannot be cast to java.lang .
String
One unique feature supported by sorted maps ( and also sorted sets ) is the ability to jump efficiently to a particular key and walk forward or backward from there through the collection .
This is done with the subseq and rsubseq functions for forward and backward respectively .
Even if you do n't know the exact key you want , these functions can be used to " round up " the next closest key that exists .
Another way that sorted maps and hash maps differ is in their handling of numeric keys .
A number of a given magnitude can be represented by many different types , for example 42 can be a long , int , float , etc .
Hash maps would treat each of these different objects as different , while a sorted map would treat them as the same .
You can see the contrast in this example , where the hash map keeps both keys while the sorted map keeps just one :
( assoc { 1 :int} 1.0 : float ) ;=>gt ; { 1.0 : float , 1 :int} ( assoc ( sorted - map 1 :int ) 1.0 : float ) ;=>gt ; { 1 : float}
Sorted maps will otherwise work just like a hash map and can be used interchangeably .
You should use sorted maps if you need to specify or guarantee a specific key ordering .
On the other hand , if you need to maintain insertion ordering , then the use of array maps are required as we will see currently .
Keeping Your Insertions in Order With Array Maps
When dealing with map literals in Clojure you might be surprised by the following :
{:x 1 :x 2 :x 3} ;= > {:x 1 , :x 2 , :x 3} ( : x {:x 1 :x 2 :x 3} ) ;=> 1
It seems counter to logic that a map could allow duplicate keys .
While this is certainly true , this is a side - effect of Clojure 's current implementation of map literals .
That is , in order to build map literals as quickly as possible Clojure uses an array map to store its instances .
An array map in turn stores its key value pairs as alternating elements within a flat array which can be populated very quickly by ignoring the form of the key values pairs and blindly copying them into place .
Of course , this condition refers to the current implementation of Clojure literal maps as array maps , which could conceivably change at any moment .
However , there is an important lesson to learn from this regardless : sometimes your best choice for a map is not a map at all .
You 've probably heard many times ( including our book ) that when searching for elements , arrays and lists are O( n ) , or proportional to the number of total elements , and maps are O ( 1 ) , or constant .
Big - O notation refers to a relative measure of significant algorithmic complexity and ignores tangential costs such as hash calculation , index manipulation , and the like .
However , in practice it turns out that these tangential costs have an impact when dealing with sizes below a small threshold .
That is , for structures sized below a certain count , the cost associated with map lookup bridges the gap between a linear search through an equally sized array or list .
That 's not to say that the map will be slower , instead , it allows the map and linear implementations to be comparable .
The advantage of maintaining an insertion order by using a linear structure like array map can at times outweigh the slight slowdown .
Therefore , it 's sometimes useful to design your programs to take into account for the possibility of pointed tradeoff such as using lists or vectors in place of maps for sizes smaller than a pre-determined threshold .
You can work to ensure robustness in the face of these scenarios by not presupposing a map vs. linear structure at all , but instead working against the sequence abstraction whenever possible .
Where have we heard that before ?
( defn raw [ n ] ( map keyword ( map str ( map char ( range 97 (+ 97 n ) ) ) ) ) ) ( defn mk - lin [ n ] ( interleave ( raw n ) ( range n ) ) ) ( defn mk - map [ n ] ( apply hash - map ( mk- lin n ) ) ) ( defn lhas [k s ] ( some #{k} s ) ) ( defn mhas [k s ] ( s k ) ) ( defn churn [ lookup maker n ] ( let [ks ( raw n ) elems ( maker n ) ] ( dotimes [ i 100000 ] ( doseq [k ks ] ( lookup k elems ) ) ) ) ) ( time ( churn lhas mk - lin 5 ) ) ; " Elapsed time : 998.997 msecs " ( time ( churn mhas mk - map 5 ) ) ; " Elapsed time : 133.133 msecs "
As we can see above , for very small sizes , the linear version is about 7.5 times slower than the version using maps which is not terribly bad .
Not only does the linear map implementation provide comparable speeds at small sizes , it has the added advantage of maintaining key insertion ordering ; and that truly is the sweet spot of Clojure 's array maps .
However , when we increase the number of elements for churn to process , the picture suddenly spoils :
( time ( churn lhas mk - lin 10 ) ) ; " Elapsed time : 3282.077 msecs " ( time ( churn mhas mk- map 10 ) ) ; " Elapsed time : 172.579 msecs "
Doubling the size of the structures now widens the divide in execution times between the linear and map implementations .
Further increasing the sizes will eventually lead to pauses worthy of taking in a movie .
It might be worth trying it yourself if for no other reason than it nicely shows that the size of your data structures will highlight the differences in their orders of magnitude .
Thinking in Maps -- A Fluent Builder for Chess Moves
People have been known to say that Java is an exceptionally verbose programming language .
While this may be true when compared to the Lisp family of languages , there has been considerable mindshare devoted to devising ways to mitigate Java 's verbosity .
One popular technique is known as the fluent builder and can be summed up as the chaining of Java methods to form a more readable , and agile , instance construction technique .
In this section we will show a simple example of a fluent builder supporting the construction of chess move descriptions .
We will then explain how such a technique is unneeded within Clojure and instead present an alternative approach that is simpler , concise , and more extensible .
We will leverage Clojure 's maps in the final solution illustrating that Java 's class - based paradigm is counter to Clojure 's basic principles ; and often overkill for Java programs .
Imagine that we wish to represent a chess move in Java .
Typically , the first approach would be to identify all of the component parts of our Move class including : from and to squares , a flag indicating if the move is a castling move , and perhaps also the desired promotion piece if applicable .
Of course , there are other possible elements that might be applicable , but in order to constrain the problem we will limit our idea of a Move to those elements listed above .
Of course , the next step would be to create a simple class with its properties and a set of constructors , each taking some combination of the expected properties .
We would then generate a set of accessors for the properties , but not their corresponding mutators as it's probably best for the move instances to be immutable .
Having created this simple class and rolled it out to the customers of our chess move API we begin to notice that our users are sending into the constructor the to string before the from string , which is sometimes placed after the promotion string , and so on .
However , thanks to a design pattern called a fluent builder we can instead make the chess move API simpler to read , unambiguous , and operation order independent .
After some months of intense design and weeks of development and testing we release the following elided chess move class :
public class FluentMove { String from , to , promotion = " " ; boolean castlep ; public static MoveBuilder desc ( ) { return new MoveBuilder ( ) ; } public String toString ( ) { return " Move " + from + " to " + to + ( castlep ? " castle " : " " ) + ( promotion.length ( ) != 0 ? " promote to " + promotion : " " ) ; } public static final class MoveBuilder { FluentMove move = new FluentMove ( ) ; public MoveBuilder from ( String from ) { move .
from = from ; return this ; } public MoveBuilder to ( String to ) { move .
to = to ; return this ; } public MoveBuilder castle ( ) { move .
castlep = true ; return this ; } public MoveBuilder promoteTo( String promotion ) { move .
promotion = promotion ; return this ; } public FluentMove build ( ) { return move ; } } }
Obviously for brevity 's sake our code has a lot of holes such as missing checks for fence posting errors , null , empty strings , and invariants ; however it does allow us to illustrate that the code provides a fluent builder given the following main method :
public static void main ( String [ ] args ) { FluentMove move = FluentMove.desc ( ) . from ( " e2 " ) .to ( " e4 " ) .build ( ) ; System.out.println(move ) ; move = FluentMove.desc ( ) . from ( " a1 " ) .to ( " c1 " ) .castle ( ) .build ( ) ; System.out.println(move ) ; move = FluentMove.desc ( ) . from ( " a7 " ) .to ( " a8 " ) .promoteTo ( " Q " ) .build ( ) ; System.out.println ( move ) ; } /* prints the following : Move e2 to e4 Move a 1 to c1 castle Move a 7 to a8 promote to Q */
Our constructor ambiguities have disappeared with the only trade - off being a slight increase in complexity of the implementation and the breaking of the common Java getter / setter idioms -- both of which we are wiling to deal with .
However , if we had started our chess move API as a Clojure project , the code would likely be a very different experience for the end -user .
A Clojure Chess Move
To start building our chess move structure for Clojure we may make a common assumption that we need a Move class for representation .
However , as we have been talking about throughout this chapter , Clojure provides a core set of composite data types and as you can guess from the title of this section , its map type is a perfect candidate for our move representation .
{ :from " e7 " , : to " e8 " , : castle ?
false , : promotion \Q}
Simple no ?
Coming from a background in object - oriented methodologies , we have a tendency to view problems through the lens of cumbersome class hierarchies .
However , Clojure prefers simplification , providing a set of composite types perfect for representing most categories of problems typically handled by class systems .
If you take a step back and think about the class hierarchies that you 've built or dealt with in the past , how many of the constituent classes could have been replaced with a simple map ?
If your past projects are anything like ours , it 's likely that the number is significant .
In a language like Java it is common to represent every entity as a class , and in fact to do otherwise is either not efficiently supported , non-idiomatic , or outright taboo .
However , to be a good Clojure citizen it is advisable to attempt to leverage its composite types for one very simple reason : existing functions , built on a sequence abstraction , just work .
( defn build - move [ & pieces ] ( apply hash - map pieces ) ) ( build - move : from " e7 " : to " e8 " : promotion \ Q ) ; => gt ; {: from " e2 " , : to " e4 " , : promotion \Q}
In two lines , we 've effectively replaced the Java implementation above with an analogous , yet more flexible representation .
The term domain specific language ( DSL ) is often thrown around to describe code like build - move , but to Clojure ( and Lisps in general ) the line between DSL and API is blurred .
The function above makes a lot of assumptions about the form of the move pieces supplied , but it 's implications can not be denied .
In our original FluentMove class we required a cornucopia of code in order to ensure the API was agnostic of the ordering of move elements ; using a map we get that for free .
Additionally , FluentMove , while relatively concise , was still bound by fundamental Java syntactical and semantic constraints .
The Clojure build - move function on the other hand was artificially constrained as requiring alternating key - value pairs for brevity 's sake .
If we had instead written build - move as a macro , then there is virtually no limitation to the form that our move description might have taken ; leaning closer toward the classic notion of a DSL .
Finally , as author Rich Hickey himself proclaimed , any new class in general is itself an island ; unusable by any existing code written by anyone , anywhere .
So our point is this -- consider throwing the baby out with the bath water .
Separation of Concerns
Before we end this section we'd like to address an issue with both implementations that until now we 've been ignoring : verification .
Both FluentMove and build - move make enormous assumptions about the form of the data supplied to them and do no validation of the input .
For FluentMove object - oriented principles dictate that the validation of a well - formed move ( not a legal move mind you ) should be determined by the class itself .
There are a number of problems with this approach the most obvious being that in order for FluentMove to determine if it is a well - formed move it needs some information about the rules of chess ; for example , a move cannot be both a castle and a piece promotion .
We can certainly rewrite FluentMove to throw an exception to prevent such a case from being entered , but the root problem still remains -- FluentMove instances are too smart .
Conversely , you could take the opposite extreme and require the client to check the validity of the moves , but if they could do that in the first place , then they likely would n't need your code at all .
Perhaps you do n't see this as a problem , but if we were to extend our API to include other aspects of the game of chess , then we 'll find that using this approach requires that little bits of overlapping chess rules need to be scattered throughout your class hierarchy .
Really what we wanted from the start is for our move representation to be a value , devoid of associated validation behavior .
By viewing the move structure as a simple value map , our Clojure code provides some freedom in the implementation of a total solution .
That is , we decouple the value and its validation behavior allowing for the latter to be composed from numerous function , each swapped in and out as necessary .
We have covered the basics of Clojure maps in this section including common usage and construction techniques .
Clojure maps , minus a couple implementation details , should not be surprising to anyone .
It will take some time to grow accustomed to dealing with immutable maps , but in time even this nuance will become second nature .
Clojure favors simplicity in the face of growing software complexity .
If our problems are easy solved by sequential and collection abstractions then it is those exact abstractions that should be used .
Much of the problems of software can indeed be modeled on such simple abstractions , yet we continue to build monolithic class hierarchies in attempts to deceive ourselves into believing that we 're mirroring the " real world " -- whatever that means .
Perhaps it 's time to realize that we no longer need to layer our self - imposed complexities on top of software solutions that are already inherently complex .
Not only does Clojure provide the sequential , set , and map types useful for pulling ourselves from the doldrums of software complexity , but it is also optimized for dealing with them .
ModNation Racers is a beautiful , fast - paced take on the kart - racing genre .
Taking away much of the luck of Mario Kart , it adds a much - needed hardcore element to this sort of racing game .
But it also brings loading times ... long , long loading times .
People are mentioning this in reviews , but we wanted to show just how long it takes to get from the home screen to an actual race .
Keep in mind that before we shot this video , we had installed the game to the hard drive .
The loading times in the game are incredibly annoying , and they grind the experience to a halt .
Not only does it happen before races , it occurs even when simply exploring the content - creation tools .
The review code given to us was n't from a retail copy of the game , but after looking through the notes there is no mention of loading times being improved for launch ; odds are this is how the game will act for everyone else .
We 'll have a full review of the title before its release , but this is one aspect of the game that needs to be pointed out .
Load times this long really hurt the experience of playing the game , especially one that seems like it would be perfect for a few quick races here and there .
Disappointing .

Recently we became aware that some Android applications were not visible on the Android Market .
While we were internally troubleshooting and qualifying the fix and communicating with our hardware partners , developers were trying hard to get our help through various technical support sites .
Regrettably , we fell short of our own standard for customer support by not communicating the issue to our developers and how we were working to resolve it .
We ’re pleased to say that the issue looks to be resolved with a patch , and to our best knowledge , all apps that were previously impacted are up and visible again .
Again , apologies for the delay and inconvenience this created .
For the last 40 days my work routine was completely messed up .
Some of you noticed it by the number of guest posts on the blog , which was really high lately ( and for that I am thankful to all my dear friends and contributors here ) .
Some of you noticed it by my ( highly unusual ) low presence on social media , on twitter and facebook .
And some of you noticed it when I kindly asked you a small favor : helping me test one of the most interesting things I done lately : an iPhone app based on my Assess – Decide – Do life management framework .
Why iPhone Programming ?
I can hear you , guys .
Loud and clear : “ what are you trying to prove with this iPhone stuff ?
I mean this is hundreds of miles away from being a blogger .
I ’m confused : what are you ?
What do you do ? ”
Well , I can understand your confusion .
It may sound a little bit off the track , but it is n’t .
This whole 40 days trial had very serious reasons .
Here they are :
1. I Love To Make My Ideas Real
Number one reason is : making my ideas come true is one of my biggest sources of fulfillment .
I live for this .
I do n’t have any other satisfaction bigger than that .
I mean we all have brilliant ideas .
I know some people who can have at least 6 brilliant ideas before breakfast ( that would be a hook to a very interesting book , let me know in the comments if you guessed what ’s the book I ’m hinting at ) .
But an idea is just an idea , an exercise of the brain .
Putting all the pieces together , making it all work in the real life , just in front of your eyes , here ’s from where the real satisfaction comes .
2. Self - Improvement Is Not About Writing A Self - Improvement Blog
Self - Improvement is about getting better and better at what you choose to do .
Writing a blog about it can make a you a very respected blogger but it wo n’t automatically make you a better person .
There are certain skills required to create and maintain a successful blog , I agree , but that has little to do with self - improvement .
It ’s just a blog .
Self - improvement means challenging yourself into more and more difficult ventures , and overcome all the obstacles .
This is where the real fun is .
3. I Truly Believe in My Life Management Framework
It ’s been almost a year since the first draft of my ADD life management framework .
A lot of stuff happened since them .
I wrote 4 ebooks ( all of them with printed versions published on Amazon too ) and started 2 live workshops , one on online business and the other one in professional blogging .
None of this could happen if I did n’t consciously apply all the rules in my life management framework .
In other words : this just works .
It made me far more productive than I was even when I had my online publishing company ( and I was somehow forced to be productive ) .
So , knowing that the system has been tested for almost a year on my self , I had no reason NOT to make it available to a wider audience .
The Whole Picture
But wait , there ’s more .
Yes , of course if is 🙂
The iPhone app is just a part .
The product I ’ve been working on includes much more than that .
I already have an ebook describing the ADD life management framework in a very advanced stage .
I hope it will be ready by the end of this month .
Think at the ebook as of a companion for the iPhone app ( there will be a whole chapter dedicated to it anyway ) .
And there will also be a series of podcasts on how to use this life management framework , along with the iPhone app ( or even separately , if you want , ADD is a very flexible framework , it downs’t tie you down to a certain setup ) .
So , please keep in mind there will be some buzz again on this blog and make sure you subscribe , because in the next few weeks I ’ll be writing far more than usual .
Or at least in a different manner than you ’re used to .
But until then , here are a few screenshots of the iPhone app .
The interface may change a little bit in the near future , but basically this is how it looks :
The Growing Process
After 40 days of totally immersing in a completely new area , I feel incredibly fresh .
Yes , there were a lot of roadblocks and frustrations along the way .
At some points I felt lost .
I also felt like I was going nowhere : what am I doing here in the middle of the night trying to understand a stupid thing like a UIPickerDateDelegate ?
Why am I doing this instead of sleeping or staying in the backyard listening to some music or just going out to some party ?
Well , I did it because this is what I usually do : I try to get better at stuff .
I try to overcome my own limitations .
I try to discover new things .
And I enjoy this far more than sitting outside in the backyard doing nothing or banging my head at some dull party .
I love to be challenged .
And learning Objective C from scratch in one month looked like one hell of a challenge .
Now , do n’t get too excited .
Learning Objective C in one month if you ’ve never been exposed to programming might be almost impossible .
I do n’t claim I did this .
I am a seasoned programmer ( I think I wrote more than 100.000 lines of PHP code back while I had my online publishing company ) .
And I also did something to soften a potential crash : a dry run using a low effort project , just to get a glimpse of what should I expect .
It was what I call “ calibration ” : do something small just to see exactly what steps do you have to take .
So , three months ago I created a small game using a third party SDK , Corona , which allows you to build iPhone , iPad and Android apps .
It did n’t took me more than a week .
The game , called iFlipEm Lite , was written in lua , a very easy to learn programming language .
iFlipEm Lite ( iTunes link ) is in the AppStore for more than 2 months now and it had around 1000 downloads .
Not to mention the Android version which had around 100 installations .
Once I understood the whole process of app submission and logistic requirements for deploying an iPhone app at a more professional level , I totally immersed into it .
I started to daily log my progress ( or , for what it matters , my frustrations ) and I committed to it totally .
I plan to write a very detailed post on how to tackle such a job so for those of you keen on technical details maybe there will be something more .
Now , this whole adventure backfired at me in a number of ways .
First of all , the blog suffered a little bit .
I did n’t wrote as much as I usually do and I did n’t promote it ( or engage in cross- promotions ) as often as I usually do .
I ran much more guest posts than usual .
The subscribers number remained basically the same but the in the blog business , if you do n’t grow , you do n’t exist .
Just being there means nothing , you gotta move .
So , my blog was stalled for a little while .
But while my blog was stalled , something else was growing : my personal experience in implementing an iPhone app , based on my own ideas .
And even if this was n’t very obvious ( or at least very public ) it counts .
And it counts a lot .
Maybe some of my readers got a little bit confused by the fact I did n’t wrote as often as I usually do .
They should n’t .
It ’s normal .
I ’m not a writing machine , nor do I intend to become one .
I ’m enjoying the process as much ( if not more ) as I enjoy the destination .
So every detour on my road is part of the journey .
And I enjoy it a lot .
Now , since everybody knows now what I was doing lately , a short explanation of the title .
Inhale .
Exhale
Every time we ’re immersing in something new , we ’re inhaling .
We ’re incorporating skills , information , knowledge , experience .
We ’re totally immersed in this process .
And this is how it should be , anyway .
And every time we ’re sharing or applying what we learned , we ’re exhaling .
We ’re pushing away our know - how , enriched with our personal experience .
Our entire life process is unfolding like this .
There is this game of pushing back and forth that makes the journey worthwhile .
If we ’re too much into inhaling ( acquiring skills , knowledge or money ) we ’re going to implode , sooner or later .
If we ’re too much into exhaling ( sharing skills or knowledge ) we ’re going to dry ourselves out : we ’re going to run out of experiences to share .
So , the growth process is nothing more than this simple , fundamental process of respiration .
Inhale .
Exhale .
In findings that should finally put to rest a decade of controversy in the field of neurobiology , a team at The Scripps Research Institute has found decisive evidence that a specific neurotransmitter system -- the endocannabinoid system -- is active in a brain region known to play a key role in the processing of memory , emotional reactions , and addiction formation .
The new study also shows that this system can dampen the effects of alcohol , suggesting an avenue for the development of drugs to combat alcohol addiction .
The research was published in the journal Neuropsychopharmacology on May 12 .
" This study will change a lot in the field , " said Scripps Research Associate Professor Marisa Roberto , who was first author of the paper .
" I 'm confident it will have a big impact . "
" This is very new , " said Paul Schweitzer , associate professor of the neurobiology of addiction at Scripps Research and corresponding author of the paper .
" It is the first time a study has shown a direct cellular interaction between endocannabinoids and alcohol in the brain . "
The Missing Link ?
The new research overturns the conclusions of a paper published by a European group in the Journal of Neuroscience in 2001 .
This paper claimed that endocannabinoid receptors , in particular the most common type called CB1 , did not exist in the brain region called the central amygdala .
advertisement
" Yet CB1 receptors are very abundant , " said Schweitzer .
" They are almost everywhere in the brain and there are lots of them .
The endocannabinoid system acts on appetite , mood , memory -- and addiction .
Addiction is why we started to study it in the central amygdala . "
The Scripps Research scientists began to suspect that the 2001 study , whose conclusions had been widely accepted in the field , might have missed the CB1 receptors in the brain 's central amygdala .
Indirect evidence from a number of subsequent studies -- including one by Scripps Research Associate Professor Loren " Larry " Parsons -- had suggested that the endocannabinoid system ( and by implication its receptors ) were indeed active in this brain region .
The Scripps Research team decided to take a fresh look at the whole question , and set out to conduct a new physiological study specifically looking for signs of the missing CB1 receptors in the central amygdala .
" There was n't much physiology done before this , " said Roberto .
" There were a lot of behavioral studies , but very few on physiology and , aside from the 2001 study , none on the physiology in the central amygdala -- this brain region that is so important for drugs of abuse . "
Back on Track
Using electrophysiological techniques in brain slices to test the response of brain cells from the rat central amygdala , the scientists indeed found compelling evidence that CB1 receptors were active there .

The cells responded to a substance ( agonist ) mimicking the action of endocannabinoids in the brain .
Up to a point , the more of the agonist the scientists applied , the bigger the effect .
An inhibitor ( antagonist ) reversed this response .
" We saw a big and consistent physiological effect , " said Roberto .
" It was beautiful .
The receptor had to be there or otherwise it would n't have worked . "
With this major milestone achieved , the researchers extended their investigation to their primary area of interest -- the brain 's response to alcohol .
Alcohol abuse can lead to devastating consequences for individuals and families .
It is also associated with direct and indirect public health costs estimated to be in the hundreds of billions of dollars yearly in the United States alone .
To learn more about the effect of alcohol on the biology of the brain , the scientists focused on the transmission of one particular neurotransmitter called gamma amino butyric acid ( GABA ) .
GABA is the main inhibitory neurotransmitter in the brain , and neurons in every brain region use GABA to fine - tune signaling throughout the nervous system .
Previous studies by the Scripps Research scientists indicated that GABA plays a critical role in alcohol dependence and other addictions .
" We knew ethanol in these neurons increase GABA transmission , and that cannabinoids decrease GABA transmission , " said Roberto .
" So the question was what happens if we activate the cannabinoid system and we put ethanol on it . "
When the scientists first applied the CB1 agonist on cells from the central amygdala , it decreased GABA transmission ; when the scientists proceeded to put ethanol on top , the effect of ethanol was abolished .
When the team reversed the order of application , GABA transmission first went up with the application of ethanol , then down with the application of the CB1 agonist .
" Alcohol and CB1 agonists have opposing effects on GABA , " summarized Schweitzer .
" Our feeling is that since the CB1 system is so widely expressed , there 's a big role there in dampening the effect of alcohol . "
While the team 's research points to the endocannibinoid system as a potential target in the development of drugs to treat alcoholism , Schweitzer notes there are still many questions to be answered :
Do CB1 agonists work the same way in brains that have become addicted to alcohol ?
What is the mechanism for this action ?
Can the effects of CB1 on alcohol metabolism be separated from its many other effects on mood , appetite , and memory ?
Schweitzer also cautions against equating CB1 agonists and cannabis in interpreting the study 's results .
" This study does not have to do with marijuana , but the endocannabinoid system , " he said .
" On this level of analysis , the two do n't have much in common . "
The work was supported by National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism of the National Institutes of Health .

Glenn
Beck took another ride on the race train tonight when on his Fox News program he claimed that President Obama wo n’t meet with BP CEO Tony Hayward because he is white .
Beck said , “ What is it that the crazy guy in Iran has in the credibility have that the CEO does n’t have ?
… He ’s a white CEO .
Maybe that ’s it . ”
Here is the video courtesy of Media Matters :
Beck asked , “ What is it that Barack Obama knows that he wo n’t even bother to meet with the guy to hear him out , well you know until he changed his mind a couple of days later .
What is it that the dictator of Iran , the crazy guy in Iran has in the credibility department that the CEO of BP does n’t have ?
What is it ?
Tell me , I ’d like to know .
Does the fact that BP ’s CEO is a capitalist , is that what does it ?
You know when I meet with those capitalists .
He ’s a white CEO , maybe that ’s it .
He ’s a white CEO .
Advertisements
Beck then played a 15 year old clip of Obama talking about corporate responsibility as his “ evidence . ”
Obama said , “ And I really want to emphasize the word responsibility .
I think that whether you are a white executive living out in the suburbs who does n’t want to pay taxes to inner-city children to — for them to go to school . ”
Glenn than used this as evidence that Obama is a racist , “ I know .
Man , all those white executives , what racists they are .
They ’re all alike , you know .
Oh , they just hate those inner-city kids .
Wow .
Inner -city kids — that ’s not code language , is it ?
And gee , all those white executives that do n’t want to pay their taxes , have to go to — that sounds an awful lot like profiling …
It ’s almost like he ’s generalizing , profiling , and stereotyping . ”
The problem is that Beck played a heavily edited audio clip .
Here is the full quote courtesy of Media Matters , “ Right .
And I think that is going to be happening , and we ca n’t ignore it .
I think whether or not my children or your children will have to struggle with these same issues depends on what we do and whether we take some mutual responsibility for bridging the divisions that exist right now .
And I really want to emphasize the word “ responsibility . ”
I think that whether you are a white executive living out in the suburbs who does n’t want to pay taxes to inner-city children to — for them to go to school or you are a inner-city child who does n’t want to take responsibility for keeping your street safe and clean , both of those groups have to take some responsibility if we ’re going to get beyond the kinds of divisions that we face right now . ”
Imagine that , when you read the whole transcript you discover that Obama was n’t singling out white CEOs at all .
He was discussing the divisions that the country faces and the need to get past them .
When you see the whole text , it becomes clear who the real racist is , and it is n’t President Barack Obama .
Once again , Glenn Beck jumps head first into the cesspool that is race based politics , and he hopes that his audience and the rest of America is too dumb to notice his obvious distortions .
His desperate cry for attention today is even more evidence that his show is sinking fast and that Beck is now truly desperate .
( Escondido , CA ) – Stone Brewing has announced what its 14th Anniversary Ale will be : Emperial IPA .
The duo in the video above describe it as an English IPA with East Kent Goldings , Target and Boadicea hops .
Though most should be familiar with EKG , some may be unfamiliar with the latter two .
Of the hops reportedly used by U.S. brewers in a 2009 survey , Target ranks 3rd to last out of over 90 varietals ( The New Brewer ) .
Here is a list of beers with Target hops .
The Boadicea variety is also seldom used here in the U.S. I wrote about them a bit in my story on Left Hand 400 Pound Monkey .
A list of beers with Boadicea hops .
According to the Stone website , Emperial IPA will be available on June 21st though that date is “ tentative and subject to change . ”
On a related note , the website is up for the Stone 14th Anniversary party though tickets are not yet available .
It takes place on August 21st .

The Albany County Legislature voted Monday night to approve a proposed $ 1.6 million dollar bond to improve the Times Union Center , which would clear the path for the Devils to move their AHL affiliate back to New York ’s capital .
The bond , which included funding for a new scoreboard and rink - side advertising , was approved by a 35 - 2 vote .
The Devils , in their desire to move their affiliate back to Albany , stipulated that the improvements were necessary to facilitate the move .
The Devils , who submitted a letter of intent for a five - year lease , expect to announce the move soon .
The organization ’s AHL affiliate played in the Tsongas Arena in Lowell , Massachusetts for the past for seasons , but the lease ends June 30 .
The Devils ’ AHL team played in Albany from 1993 - 1994 and 2005 - 2006 .
Last season , Albany hosted the Carolina Hurricanes ’ AHL affiliate .
The team will move to Charlottesville , North Carolina for next season .
Amitai Etzioni , professor of International Relations at George Washington University in Washington , D.C. , believes the only option available to contain Iran 's atomic ambitions is a series of assaults on its non-nuclear facilities .
He maintains that President Obama 's attempts at dialogue have failed , and drastic steps must be taken to prevent the U.S. losing its Middle East dominance to Tehran .
Writing in the U.S. Army 's " Military Review " journal , Etzioni lists four possible responses to Iran 's nuclear program - engagement , sanctions , military strikes and deterrence .
He concludes that engagement has failed , sanctions are not likely to work , military strikes on Iran 's suspected nuclear sites are unlikely to be effective either and might only delay the program ( Defense Secretary Robert Gates believes this would probably be by one to three years ) , and deterrence works with rational actors , but its a gamble to rely on it with non-rational actors .
This , he hypothesizes , leaves strikes on Iranian infrastructure that is not necessarily related to its nuclear program .
Speaking to Haaretz on Wednesday , Etzioni concedes that such a move could be interpreted by Iran as a declaration of full - scale war .
Thats a fair point , " he says , " but whats the alternative ?
The best way will be to sit at the table and solve all our problems peacefully .
I was in war , I was in the Palmach [ the pre-state Jewish fighting units that became the basis for the Israel Defense Forces ] , and I dont like shooting anybody .
It comes to the declaration that there are no other alternatives .
Sanctions are not going to work , everybody knows that .
Assuming that if they have nuclear weapons we are going to contain them – its a very risky assumption .
This option is not mentioned in the mainstream discourse .
But it was published in the official U.S. army publication as a cover story .
It says something , no ?
Its not simply what a professor says .
I agree that the White House is far from it , but somebody considered it worth discussing .
You must assume that the military option covers several options .
One of the strategic assets of Israel today vis-à - vis Iran is the fact that the Arab countries are on its side .
Would n't that vanish in the event of such an attack ?
We do not want Iran to have a nuclear weapon and there is no way you can damage nuclear sites sufficiently by attacking them .
There is only one alternative left .
I should hasten to add – its not a policy Israel has to follow , its a policy the U.S. can follow because there are too many missions involved .
Some people say Israel should do it and then the U.S. can enter under the excuse that its its ally , and some people think coalition is better .
Coalition is always better , but in this case its very unlikely that many other nations would like to join the Administration .

Whats happening in the Middle East is that the countries are assuming that the U.S. is going to fold and retreat .
Its obviously going to get out of Iraq .
The Pakistanis are very suspicious of the US commitments .
Syria is moving toward Iran , Turkey is moving toward Iran .
So the underlying text in the Middle East is that the next superpower in the Middle East is Iran .
So even if you for a moment put aside the nuclear issue – to keep the U.S. credibility to protects its resources and oil , the issue will not be settled in Afghanistan and Iraq , it will finally come down to the confrontation between the U.S. and Iran .
So maybe the U.S. should get out of Afghanistan , because its not the real war anymore .
But if the U.S. is going to let Iran to become a nuclear power – all the other countries , including the Sunni ones , will run to it .
The U.S. will have to confront Iran or give up the Middle East .
So the hope that the Iranian opposition might still bring an inner change is lost ?
I think by now the tyrannical regime succeeded in suppressing the opposition .
And another point - I was their guest in Iran in 2002 , of the Center for Dialogue Among Civilizations .
And I met many leaders in this movement .
They were the first to start the nuclear program .
They are against religious domination , but there is not a slightest hint that they will stop the nuclear program if they come back to power .
Democracy might be wonderful , but even though they are anti-clerical , they are very nationalistic .
We have the cliché that the clock is ticking .
What kind of timetable did you assume while writing this article ?
I dont have any other information than everybody else has .
But there is a rule in decision making – its extremely simplistic but very true – its better be safe than sorry .
So if the option is to hit them one month too early or 10 days after they have a nuclear weapon – Id rather take the first option .
And obviously there is not much time left .
President Obama offered to the world dialogue as a new paradigm , wouldnt it shatter this premise ?
The time for engagement has run out .
Obama tried it , offered to meet them any time , any place , with no conditions – and they spit in his face .
So its not going anyplace , its not working .
The Arab world is moving away from him , Turkey is moving away from him .
The notion of engagement and turning another cheek is a wonderful idea , its just not working .
But the damage of throwing it away after a year and a half might cause more damage and erase any credibility left .
Then going back to torture sounds fine as well .
Its a good point .
They should never torture and of course they shouldnt go back to business as usual .
But you cannot conduct international relations [ on ] goodwill only .
And Iran is a very good test of that .
Maybe 50 years from now this strategy will win , but in the short term its giving up on the Middle East .
The U.S. army is exhausted and overstretched , thats why I think they should get out of Afghanistan .
And second , I think its an air force job and not an army job .
There should be no boots on the ground .
Thats what the Israeli high command thought at the beginning of the second war in Lebanon - that they could bomb some strategic sites and Hezbollah would fold .
It didnt happen .
True , there are many studies showing that the air attacks are not as effective as people think they are .
But we always come back to the question - if we might try and fail , should we not try ?
We are talking about the U.S. credibility as an international power .
People might think :
Iran is not going to attack the U.S. , so let them create the bomb and if they get nasty we will drop a nuclear bomb on them .
That is a logical position .
But you cannot remain in the Middle East as a superpower unless you deal with Iran one way or another .

Stuart revealed the injury following his team 's 2 - 1 loss in Game 5 to the San Jose Sharks .
It happened less than six minutes into Game 4 on a collision with Rob Blake .
Stuart left that game and was n't sure about his status for Saturday until game time .
“ It was n’t bad , took some good pain - killers , '' Stuart said .
" I just felt a step slow , was n’t quite as strong as normal . ’’
The injury does n't require surgery , just some treatment and a few weeks of rest .
Coach Mike Babcock dressed seven defensemen , inserting Brett Lebda into the lineup in place of forward Mattias Ritola , just in case Stuart 's knee flared up .
" Stewie 's as tough as they come , but we were scared if we ended up with five D after five shifts we ’d be in trouble , '' Babcock said .
" We would n’t have played him normally , but we were up against it .
" We knew it was going to be a three - line game , it ’s been a three - line game the whole serires , so I do n’t know if that affected us in any way .
I thought Stewie was fantastic .
Really competed .
He ’ll be a sore guy tomorrow . ’’

El bulto , Rafael Ochoa , parodia a la profesora .
Educación que no importa a nadie ; pura demagogia .
Martes 20 de abril de 2010
Cuando la calidad de la educación pública en México vive su peor momento , la profesora Elba Esther Gordillo se aventó la puntada — en el clímax del cinismo — , de retar a instituciones y personas a demostrar lo que todos saben ; que la corrupta camarilla sindical es responsable de la crisis en la educación .
¿ De veras seguirá viviendo Gordillo en la época del T - Rex ?
Parece que sí .
Pero no fue todo , en conferencia de prensa , además de la propietaria del SNTE habló el dirigente de palo ; el bulto Rafael Ochoa — al que adorna el cargo de secretario general — , quien acuñó una frase para la historia .
Dijo : “ no somos un gremio de insaciables sino de trabajadores que se comprometen a elevar la calidad y la eficiencia ” .
¿ Se habrá dado cuenta Rafael Ochoa que parodió el mejor diagnóstico la realidad de esa mafia que es la dirigencia del SNTE ?
Y es que si a nadie se le había ocurrido , Ochoa explicó puntual el diagnóstico que hacen miles sobre el SNTE ; “ gremio de insaciables ” .
¿ A poco no le queda como anillo al dedo la parodia a la gestión de la profesora Gordillo ?
No son un gremio de insaciables , pero en la más reciente negociación salarial lograron 4.9 % de incremento salarial , 1.5 % de prestaciones 15 % para la Compensación Provisional Compactable , 490 millones para formación y capacitación , 750 millones de pesos para nuevas plazas , 150 millones de pesos para tecnología , 100 millones para vivienda 350 millones para infraestructura , la creación de cinco centros regionales de excelencia académica , becas para estudiar en el extranjero y — por si hiciera falta — , todo el apoyo del gobierno de Felipe Calderón .
Pero los logros alcanzados en la más reciente negociación salarial , son nada frente a otros signos de lo “ insaciable ” de la camarilla que jefatura la profesora Gordillo .
Como todos saben , el SNTE es no sólo un poderoso monopolio del sistema nacional de educación pública , sino que resultó intocable en la iniciativa de Reforma Laboral que presentó al Congreso el secretario del Trabajo , Javier Lozano .
A pesar de eso , la señora Gordillo decretó que esa reforma está muerta .
La alianza electoral del SNTE y de la profesora Elba Esther con el entonces candidato presidencial , Felipe Calderón , le valió a la due ña del sindicato magisterial ocupar importantes posiciones en la propia SEP , en donde impuso no sólo su opinión para nombrar a la titular y luego al titular del ramo — Josefina Vázquez Mota y luego Alonso Lujambio — , sino que se despachó con la cuchara grande al imponer a su yerno como subsecretario .
Todo ello sin contar otros jugosos puestos políticos , como el ISSSTE .
Pero tampoco ahí termina lo insaciable del humilde gremio de trabajadores de la educación .
Vale recordar que el gobierno de Vicente
Fox le regaló a su aliada y promotora — la señora Gordillo fue clave para hacer de Vicente Fox el fenómeno político electoral que fue , y artífice del voto ú til — , la franquicia del Partido Nueva Alianza ( Panal ) .
Pues bien , el Panal es hoy uno de los partidos emergentes más importantes .
En elecciones como las de julio próximo — en muchas de las cuales el ganador surgirá de un resultado muy cerrado — , los partidos emergentes como el PT , Convergencia , PVEM y Panal , serán determinantes .
Harán la diferencia .
Pues bien , la señora Gordillo vende la franquicia de su partido político — que detrás tiene todo el aparato del magisterio y del SNTE — , al mejor postor .
Los votos van a la urna del partido o candidato que decida la señora presidenta vitalicia del SNTE .
Y claro , en términos generales se mueve en dirección a su aliado natural , el PAN y el gobierno de Calderón , y va contra sus adversarios del PRI .
La señora Gordillo está llamada a jugar un papel importante en la elección de julio próximo — donde se renovarán 12 gobiernos estatales — , pero su verdadera fuerza la veremos en la contienda presidencial de 2012 .
Y no , que nadie se equivoque , para entonces ya no estará con el PAN .
Lo más probable es que le apueste al regreso de una de las dos versiones del PRI ; la de Marcelo Ebrard , el candidato presidencial de la señora Gordillo , quien pondrá al servicio del jefe de gobierno del Distrito Federal , esa mina de oro político y económico que el SNTE , y su brazo electoral , que se llama Partido Nueva Alianza .
¿ Y la educación ?
Señores , eso no le importa a nadie de la camarilla de la señora Gordillo .
¿ Cuando un sindicato , del gremio que guste o mande , ha servido para beneficiar a sus trabajadores y — en el caso del gremio educativo — , a servido a su razón de ser , que es la enseñanza ?
Los poderosos sindicatos del sector público sirven para apuntalar el poder .
Lo demás es demagogia .
Por eso es un tiro de precisión el de Rafael Ochoa .
¿ De veras el SNTE no es un gremio de insaciables ?
¿ Hasta cuándo ?

Iranian Nuclear Defector Mess : Kidnapped Or Happy To Be In US ?
In dueling videos , Shahram Amiri says CIA kidnapped him , then says he 's ' free . '
June 8 , 2010  --
In a battle of the videos , an Iranian nuclear scientist claims on a segment posted on - line by Iranian television that he was drugged and kidnapped by the CIA -- but in a second video , posted on YouTube , says he is safe and happy to be in the United States .
Shahram Amiri , 32 , has been at the center of a mystery since his disappearance on a pilgrimage to Saudi Arabia last year .
ABC
News reported exclusively on March 30 that he had defected to the US and was providing information about Iran 's secret nuclear program , citing current and former CIA officials .
In the video posted on - line by Iranian television , with English subtitles , Amiri claimed he had been drugged and kidnapped and was living in Tucson , Arizona .
" Since I was abducted and brought to the US , I was heavily tortured and pressured by US intelligence , " Amiri says in Farsi .
" When I became conscious , I found myself in a plane on the way to the US , " he says .
He claims that he was forced to lie and pretend that he had top secret information on the Iranian nuclear program so the U.S. could put " pollitical pressure " on Iran , and then asks international human rights organizations to help free him from captivity in the U.S .
Amiri , unshaven and wearing headphones , appears to be talking through a computer phone hook - up , which he says on the tape was made on April 5 , one week after ABC News first reported his alleged defection to the US .
At almost the same time the first video was posted on line by Iranian television , a second video was posted on YouTube late Monday night in which Amiri appears in a professionally lit setting and says he is safe and happy to be in the United States .
It is not clear who produced or posted the second video .
" I am free here and I assure everyone I am safe , " he says .
" My purpose in today 's conversation is to put an end to all the rumors that have been leveled at me over the past year .
I am Iranian and I have not taken any steps against my homeland , " he says , and then asserts that his purpose in being in the US is to get a doctorate in radiation health " in order to upgrade the level of healthcare in my country and my world . "
Amiri adds that he would like to share the results of his education with his people " provided that I have a chance to go back home safely . "
He talks about missing his son and wife , denies that he abandoned them , and says , " I have confidence that the government of Iran will protect and watch over my family . "
US officials consider Amiri's defection an " intelligence coup " in its continuing efforts to undermine Iran 's nuclear program .
CIA officials declined to publicly comment on any aspect of the case but a senior US intelligence official said " it 's ridiculous to think the United States would have to compel anyone to defect and then force them to stay in this country . "
Intelligence officials asked if the scientist was being held against his will , how did he have access to the internet to call Iran ?
It is not uncommon for defectors to go through " psychological issues , " according to an intelligence official familiar with the case .
The Iranian government says the initial video of Amiri is evidence that the United States is holding the scientist against his will .

After his disappearance , the Iranian foreign minister , Manoucher Mottaki , and Amiri 's family blamed the US for kidnapping the scientist .
His family had protested outside the Saudi embassy in Tehran , claiming the Saudis had played a role in Amiri's " abduction . "

The Chinese working class emerges
5 June 2010
The emergence of struggles by workers in China over the past few weeks is of enormous significance for the working class internationally .
Against those who wrote off the proletariat as a revolutionary social force and declared the class struggle to be old hat , the first outbursts of the working class in China , following on from the strikes in Greece , are sending tremors through global ruling elites .
The international financial press has followed with considerable concern the strike by workers in Honda ’s transmission plant in South China , which paralysed the corporation ’s production for almost two weeks .
The mainly young workers defied government intimidation , the state - run trade unions and management , and only returned to work this week after being granted a significant wage rise .
Major corporations such as Honda now depend heavily on the super - profits extracted from cheap , regimented labour in China .
The reliance of international capital on China has been magnified by the global financial crisis that erupted in 2007 - 08 .
Any upsurge of the multi-millioned working class in China not only directly threatens corporate profits , but would inevitably reverberate throughout the world economy and financial system .
The vast scale of production in China was underscored by the media spotlight on the wave of suicides at the Foxconn plant , which manufactures electronic goods for major global corporations such as Dell and Apple .
The plant , where 400,000 people work , constitutes a city in itself — huge , alienating and run like a military camp .
One comment on a Chinese online forum declared : “ When I look at Foxconn , I feel reminded of Charlie Chaplin ’s Modern Times .
They show a world in which human beings are being degraded to gearwheels in a huge machine . ”
The Foxconn sweatshop has provided images and put faces to the explosive development of the Chinese working class , which has swelled from 120 million to more than 400 million over the past three decades .
Shenzhen , where Foxconn is located , was a fishing village in the early 1980s and is now an industrial centre of 12 million people .
While Foxconn is one of the country ’s largest plants , there are others of similar size and countless smaller ones .
In eastern China , entire cities have been turned over to the manufacture of a single product , creating “ sock ” towns , “ zipper ” towns and “ air conditioner ” towns , involving millions of workers .
Instinctively , workers sense the necessity for international class unity .
The youthful workforces at places like Honda have grown up with the Internet and mobile phones .
They are well aware that their low wages are the source of immense profits for international corporations .
When the strikers sang the Internationale , it was a recognition that they are in the same boat as workers around the world , facing similar problems and common corporate enemies .
There is no denying the determination and courage of young workers at Honda , but that will not spontaneously resolve the complex political issues they confront .
The Chinese Communist Party ( CCP ) regime might make a few temporary concessions , but it is organically hostile to the working class and rests on a police - state apparatus , which it has never hesitated to use .
The CCP ’s first actions in seizing power in 1949 , at the head of peasant armies , were to suppress workers in the major centres .
Yesterday marked the 21st anniversary of the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre , when tanks and soldiers were sent to crush workers and students in Beijing and other cities demanding democratic rights and decent living standards .
For all their crocodile tears , governments and corporations around the world understood that Beijing was willing to go to any lengths to prevent unrest by workers .
Billions of dollars in foreign investment flooded into the country .
The CCP regime is acutely sensitive to the social time bomb on which it rests .
Having all but abandoned its previous socialist phrase mongering , it has , like its counterparts in other countries , promoted crass nationalism in an effort to create a base among middle class layers and to divide workers .
Harking back to China ’s past as an oppressed semi-colonial country , the CCP argues that China should now take its place among the world ’s great capitalist powers .
It has deliberately fostered and encouraged anti-Japanese racism in particular .
The working class can only go forward by rejecting all forms of nationalism and racism and consciously unifying its struggles internationally .
The Honda strikers in China face conditions no different from the millions of young “ freeters ” in Japan , who make up the bulk of that country ’s large casualised , temporary workforce .
With the onset of the global financial crisis , they were laid off in their thousands from auto and electronics plants in Japan as exports slumped .
It is not just the CCP that Chinese workers confront .
The greater political danger comes from those who claim to support workers and oppose the regime in Beijing , but seek to block any independent political movement of the working class .
In this regard , the comments of Han Dongfang , the exiled leader of the Beijing Workers Autonomous Federation , are significant and were highlighted in the Financial Times .
Han played a prominent role in the 1989 Tiananmen protests and was influential among layers of workers who joined the students to demand decent living standards as well as democratic rights .
Han ’s perspective was never to overthrow capitalism and the Chinese regime but to reform them .
In the wake of the latest strike , he emphasised to the media that labour rights and political rights had to be separated .
“ I am doing my best to depoliticise the labour movement in China , ” he said .
To depoliticise the working class means to politically disarm it .
In the American media in particular , comparisons have been made between the Honda strike in China and the sit - down strikes of US autoworkers in the 1930s .
That movement of the American working class graphically illustrated the consequences of separating the defence of labour rights from a political struggle .
The AFL - CIO union bureaucracy , which purged socialists in the 1950s and subordinated workers to the Democratic Party , functions today as the open agent of the corporations in imposing their dictates on workers .
The task facing workers in China , as in other countries , is to learn the essential political lessons of the key strategic experiences of the working class internationally over the past century .
In particular , that means a careful study of protracted struggle of the international Trotskyist movement for genuine Marxism against its polar opposite — Stalinism and Maoism .
That is the first step toward the building of a Chinese section of the International Committee of the Fourth International as the necessary revolutionary leadership for the emerging movement of the working class .

After a quote from Steve Jobs , and a statement from Apple attempted to gloss over the antenna reception issue plaguing the iPhone 4 launch as a " non-issue " , it seems that Apple may actually be treating it as a real issue -- at least internally .
There are reports that an update to the iOS 4 firmware could come as early as next week to address the problem .
Rumors are circulating that an IOS update was confirmed in the Apple tech support forums -- but all traces of it are gone now .
According to a post on AppleInsider " Readers report that Apple 's tech support forums originally confirmed that a iOS 4.0.1 software fix addressing the issue would ship early next week ( as early as Monday ) , before the comments were subsequently taken down along with all the other related discussion about the matter . "
I have an iPhone 4 .
Pre-ordered it before the onslaught of pre-orders crippled the system .
Ordered it early enough that I was one of the lucky few who received it on Wednesday - - a day before the official launch .
I took it out of the box , and activated it .
I synced it up with my iTunes to get all of my apps and music installed .
All the while , it had a full five bars of 3G signal .
It was a beautiful thing .
Then , a call came in .
I picked up the phone and said " hello " .... then nothing .
Apparently , I missed the memo that if you hold the iPhone 4 the way you would hold any other smartphone -- including the iPhone 3GS I just deactivated -- it actually becomes an iPod Touch .
Maybe that 's a feature rather than a bug from Apple 's perspective , but they should at least include a little memo when you open the box explaining the precise manner you must hold the iPhone 4 in order for it to function as a phone .
After reading reports identifying the issue , I was able to recreate the attenuation problem myself .
Holding iPhone 4 gripped in my palm -- no signal .
Holding iPhone 4 daintily between fingers , avoiding the lower - left corner of the metal casing -- five bars of signal .
What I also noticed , though , is the lag .
It takes about ten seconds for the signal to completely disappear when I touch the lower - left corner of the case , and another ten seconds for the five bars of signal to return and establish contact with the 3G network once I stop touching the lower - left corner .
Based on that observation , the rumors of the iOS 4 fix actually make sense to me .
The AppleInsider post explains that " The fix is expected to address a [ sic ] issue in iOS 4 related to radio frequency calibration of the baseband .
Readers who saw the original forum discussions say that the issue is believed to occur when switching frequencies ; because the lag is allegedly not calibrated correctly , it results in the device reporting " no service " rather than switching to the frequency with the best signal to noise ratio . "
Yes , it is true from a technical perspective that the mechanics of antenna signal reception will be impacted any time the device comes into contact with human flesh -- or many other things for that matter .
The length of the antenna is a factor in receiving on a given frequency , and coming into contact with another conductive material can significantly alter the functional length of the antenna .
However , Apple can't simply call it a " non-issue " and ignore the fact that every other device out there -- including their own previous iPhone models -- have managed to compensate and overcome this physical hurdle without providing users with instructions to hold the device differently .
Apple sold an estimated 1.5 million iPhone 4s on launch day .
Four days later , that number might be north of two million at this point .
Apple has an obligation to address the issue and resolve the problem rather than trying to convince two million customers that the problem is their fault .
The Android - based HTC EVO 4G experienced a number of launch - day issues as well -- but at least it could make and receive phone calls .
More importantly , Sprint and HTC acted quickly to acknowledge and address the issues rather than issuing statements and platitudes in an attempt to brush the issue aside .
Hopefully the Apple tech support forums thread -- which no longer exists -- is correct , and Apple is hard at work on the firmware update that will solve the problem for real and at least make reception on the iPhone 4 only as dysfunctional as it is on every other comparable smartphone when held the normal way .
I guess we 'll find out this week .

i heard you try to develop your own style above all else so i find this pretty interesting .
you share your own knowledge on your personally designed builds and your playstyle .
if i was terran i would subscribe .
and a question : how long do you plan on not watching other peoples replays ?
i guess there are always things one ' forgets ' or has n't thought of that one could learn from other peoples play .

Woot , i tried to " steal " your TvP build from watching your replays / vods but i ended up butchering it .

Works now :-) i dled it and it comes up with the whole episode ...
I think the 4shared might work , it 's just you have to dl it and now watch it on their website as they probably do n't allow and episode to go for 30 ++ minutes I am Unheard Change
disformation Profile Joined July 2009 Germany 8256 Posts # 16 Okay , watched the whole thing now .
Volume was very low , so I had to set my vlc to 200 % and use an amplifier option .
So it would be cool , if you could increase the volume for the next episodes .
On the build : ( I am only ~#30 on Gold and no T , so the following stuff could be nonsense . )
You rely a lot on Marines , so would it not make sense to research Shields , after you got an appropriate amount ( around 4 from what I have seen ) of Ghosts ?
I noticed you did n't need that upgrade to win ( and it is neither that good nor cheap ) , but in my little clown brain it would make sense to get it , once the game approaches mid game .
Also , I am not that sure , if that build is that good against Storm , mid-game .
But I have no idea how Ghosts vs HT does work out .
Depends on who player will get of EMP / Feedbacks first , I 'd guess ?
On the other hand , you have a lot more flexibility with your build , to prepare for the HT .
I definitely would like to see a game , where you use that opening and the P goes Storms later on .
Otherwise the episode was very educational and I will watch the following ones as well .
Maybe I 'll offrace as T a bit .

Not the real Ashley Johnson AP : CHARLOTTE , N.C. - A North Carolina waitress is out of a job after griping on her Facebook page about the $ 5 tip she got from a couple who sat at their table for three hours .
The waitress says the customers kept her at work an hour after she was supposed to clock out .
The Charlotte Observer reported Monday that 22 - year - old Ashley Johnson felt slighted after waiting on the couple at Brixx Pizza .
So she blasted the couple on Facebook , calling them cheap and mentioning the restaurant by name .
Brixx officials told Johnson a couple of days later that she was being fired because she violated a company policy banning workers from speaking disparagingly about customers and casting the restaurant in a bad light on a social network .
Johnson says she has apologized to Brixx and is looking for a new job .
Brixx 's decision to fire Johnson over the Facebook offense did n't seem to be winning them any fans .
All of the comments by users on the company 's Facebook page are negative .
The critical comments appeared on Brixx 's account soon after The Charlotte Observer published a story about Johnson 's dismissal .

Nazi war criminals were given safety in Ireland after the war and lived here under assumed names sanctioned by Eamon de Valera 's government .
The killers , responsible for some of the worst ethnic cleansing atrocities of the Second World War , were told that Ireland would welcome them as they fled from the allies .
The sensational claims will be made in a new two - part documentary by veteran broadcaster and former RAF fighter Cathal O'Shannon , who says that Ireland shunned the Jewish victims of the war while protecting the ruthless anti-Semites .
Newly - discovered archive documents show how the US was worried that Ireland would become a haven for war criminals and believed our position of neutrality had jeopardised the war effort .
In a letter to de Valera in 1944 the then US Representative in Ireland , David Gray , demanded that Ireland refuse entry to any Nazi war criminals who sought refuge here .
But de Valera , who did n't get on with Gray , was furious and saw the demands as America trying to tamper with Ireland 's new sovereignty .
That , coupled with his belief that the Nazi movement was a nationalist force just like Ireland 's republican movement , urged him to open our doors to Hitler 's top soldiers .
" Because de Valera had been challenged on that very issue of asylum he would ensure that post - war asylum policy would be handled by the Irish Government and not dictated by any other power , " says Professor Dan Leach of the University of Melbourne .
Prof Brian Girvan says that de Valera was well aware of the extermination of Jews by Nazis during the war but still identified with Hitler 's army .
" " He saw the Nazi regime as a nationalist regime that represented the German people to a certain extent .
" His stance does n't make him pro-Nazi but he was very narrow in his focus on them .
" There was also , in Ireland , a scepticism about the right of the Allies to accuse anyone of being a war criminal .
" And so it was that if someone did arrive in Ireland the Irish government would n't arrest and expel them from the country . "
Although the Irish response baffled the Allies , word soon travelled quickly across Europe that de Valera would not shut the door on those accused of war crimes .
O'Shannon says that one of the first to take advantage of the soft approach of the Irish Government was Andrija Artukovic - responsible for the death of one million men , women and children in Croatia .
He was believed to be particularly cruel opting to slowly kill the victims in his camps through hard labour , starvation and poisoning .
O'Shannon says that while making his expose he discovered that a file still exists on Artukovic in the Department of Foreign Affairs - but his request for it to be released was refused .
Artukovic worked for Hitler as the Minister for the Interior in Croatia but in 1947 he arrived in Ireland after being referred here by a Franciscan Church in Switzerland and lived under the assumed name Alois Annick in leafy Rathgar in south Dublin .
According to O'Shannon little is known about his time in Ireland but he did attend church every day .
After gaining an Irish identity card he left for the US in 1948 and settled in California where he worked as a book - keeper .
" He kept a low profile here and did n't draw attention to himself .
" In Rathgar he was saved from Allied vengeance and prosecution .
" I think it is strange that a man responsible for a million deaths could live quietly here with nobody asking who he is or how he got here , " saysO 'Shannon .
" I have discovered there is a file on this man in the Department of Foreign Affairs but the Irish Government have refused my request to release it . "
In the Fifties Yugoslavia demanded his extradition and after 30 years of legal wrangling he was eventually sent back to his homeland where he was sentenced to death for his crimes .
He died in 1988 in his prison cell .
Another notorious war criminal welcomed into Ireland was Celestine Laine , leader of the Bezen Perrot , a Waffen SS unit responsible for the torture and murder of civilians in occupied Brittany .
Laine , a French extremist , joined the SS when the Germans recruited local help and took command of the region where he had grown up , ordering the torture of countless resistance fighters who once lived alongside him .
His favoured method was to take young men and women into the forests at night to torture and then execute them .
Today , mass graves are scattered all over Brittany as a testament to the cruelty of his unit .
In 1944 as the Allies liberated Brittany , many collaborators fled France and among them was Laine and most of his followers .
Some who were recaptured were found in the possession of letters of recommendation written in English and addressed to the Irish consulate in Paris .
In 1947 word reached Laine that he could escape to Ireland where the Irish Government were prepared to grant him asylum .
In Ireland , Laine kept a low profile .
Former anarchist Jean Pierre La Mat met him in Ireland during the Seventies and says that Laine and associates had been welcomed to safety .
" What I do know is that they were welcomed to Ireland but they were not helped .
When I met him he was living very poorly , first in Coolock in Dublin and after that in Oranmore , near Galway . "
Laine died in Dublin in 1983 but was not the last Nazi to be protected here .
During the Seventies it emerged that Dutchman Pieter Menten , responsible for the deaths of hundreds of Jews in Poland , was dividing his time between Holland and Waterford where he had a large country home at Mahon Bridge .
O'Shannon 's investigation has also found that as the Allies crossed Europe and discovered the horrors of the Nazi regime , Ireland refused to offer asylum to the countless victims of the war .
While the Red Cross struggled to find temporary homes in Europe for many victims of the concentration camps , Ireland refused to help .
Author Dr Bryan Fanning says that Ireland 's actions exposed it as an anti-Semitic country .
" After the war there was a widespread view in Government that a Liberal policy towards Jews would not be taken .
" There was a strong view that they did n't fit in and would n't become part of our society , " he says .

( Washington , DC ) – A letter from 68 Senators to President Barack Obama expressing strong support for a ban on antipersonnel mines should spur the administration to decide to join the Mine Ban Treaty this year , Human Rights Watch said .
The letter , made public today , will be formally sent next week , along with an identical letter from members of the House of Representatives .
In late 2009 , Obama initiated a comprehensive review of US landmine policy .
The congressional letters express “ strong support ” for the decision to conduct a review and state , “ We are confident that …the Administration can identify any obstacles to joining the [ Mine Ban ] Convention and develop a plan to overcome them as soon as possible . ”
“ More than two - thirds of the Senate and many in the House have now told the president that the US should join the Mine Ban Treaty , and that it can do so without endangering US national security , ” said Steve Goose , Arms Division director at Human Rights Watch .
“ Joining the treaty is the right thing to do from both a humanitarian and a military perspective . ”
In order for the US to join , two - thirds of the Senate must approve .
The Senate letter was organized by Senators Patrick Leahy ( D–VT ) and George Voinovich ( R–OH ) , while the House letter was organized by Representatives Jim McGovern ( D–MA ) and Darrell Issa ( R–CA ) .
These came on the heels of a letter sent to Obama on March 22 by 65 nongovernmental organizations , including Human Rights Watch , urging a decision at the conclusion of the policy review to join the 1997 Mine Ban Treaty .
The letter also urged Obama to submit the treaty to the Senate before the end of the year .
In 1994 , the United States was the first nation to call for the “ eventual elimination ” of all antipersonnel mines , and the Clinton administration in 1998 set the objective of joining the treaty in 2006 .
But the Bush administration reversed course in 2004 and announced that it did not intend to join .
A total of 158 nations have joined the Mine Ban Treaty , which comprehensively bans antipersonnel mines , requires destruction of stockpiled mines within four years , and urges extensive programs to assist the victims of landmines .
The letters note that the treaty “ has led to a dramatic decline in the use , production , and export of antipersonnel mines . ”
The United States and nearly all of the 36 other states that have not joined the treaty are in de facto compliance with most of its core prohibitions .
The United States has not used antipersonnel mines since 1991 , exported them since 1992 , or produced them since 1997 .
The congressional letters express concern at the potential harm to civilians from the indiscriminate nature of antipersonnel mines , including so - called “ smart ” or “ non-persistent ” mines that are designed to blow themselves up after a period of time .
Under current US policy , set by the Bush administration , the United States will not use or retain non-self - destructing antipersonnel mines by the end of 2010 , but self - destructing mines are still permitted indefinitely .
The Mine Ban Treaty prohibits all antipersonnel mines , regardless of whether they self - destruct .
“ Joining the Mine Ban Treaty would be a concrete and powerful example of the stated commitment of the US military to safeguard civilian lives during armed conflict , ” said Goose .
The letters addressed two issues raised over the years by those who were hesitant to join the treaty .
One is whether landmines would have to be removed from the Korean Demilitarized Zone ( DMZ ) .
The letters note that the antipersonnel mines there are the responsibility of South Korea , not the United States .
If the United States joins the treaty , mines in the DMZ would not be affected .
The United States would be able to maintain its military relationship with , and troop deployment in , South Korea , though it would not be able to assist South Korea with the use , production , stockpiling , or transfer of antipersonnel mines .
The other issue is whether the mines would have to be replaced with some other weapon .
The letters note that “ our NATO allies have addressed their force protection needs in accordance with their obligations under the Convention . ”
US military allies that joined the Mine Ban Treaty did not find it necessary to develop new weapons as alternatives to mines , but instead made changes in doctrine and tactics .
The United States should do the same .
“ The US has already gone without using these weapons for almost two decades , ” Goose said .
“ It is time to make a commitment never to use them again . ”

Bangarang .
Ten years since the release of their one and only album , the Avalanches ' follow - up to Since I Left
You may finally see the light of day .
A spokesperson for the notoriously secretive band has revealed that the long - awaited LP will be " finished " once guest vocals by chillwave crooner Ariel Pink have been recorded .
Fans of the Avalanches have been exceedingly patient .
Rumours of a second album have been circulating for more than five years , with little news from the Australian group .
After reports of a " downbeat " album and then , later , a " hip - hop party " album , Modular Records 's owner claimed the Avalanches were due to deliver the " really , really good " new LP " to my little grotty hands " by Christmas 2008 .
A year and a half later , nothing has emerged .
The delay may be down to clearing samples .
For Since I Left
You , the Avalanches reportedly had to clear more than 3,500 vinyl clips .
Since the new album has been germinating even longer than the first , the amount of licensing may be monumental .
" Sorry about the long wait and lack of info , " the group 's webmaster said last spring .
" Things are still moving forward with the album , but unfortunately there 's been setbacks during the final stages due to illness ( plus sample clearance can take an awful long time with these guys , as you know ) . "
In May 2009 , the Avalanches posted an image on their MySpace page – sending fans into a tizzy .
The drawing of a rainbow falling into a dustbin had the brief heading , " Clearing samples " .
That drawing was the only news until this week 's comment about Ariel Pink .
Once again , the source is Clint , the Avalanches ' web developer .
" I hear Ariel Pink is recording some guest vocals for it and once those are done , the album will be finished (! ) , " he wrote yesterday .
Under that MySpace dustbin image , the " samples " comment has disappeared .
Ariel Pink , leader of the LA lo-fi band Haunted Graffiti , is a relatively leftfield choice for the Avalanches , who have previously collaborated with Belle and Sebastian , Franz Ferdinand and Manic Street Preachers .
But we wo n't question their judgment .

Drug abuse blights modern societies .
That is why many governments are focused on tackling addiction , preventing drug - related crimes and ultimately protecting their populations .
Singapore 's tough stand and use of strict laws and stiff penalties against those involved in the drug trade , including capital punishment , have sometimes come under criticism .
The comment by Patrick Gallahue and Rick Lines of the International Harm Reduction Association prompted by the trial of a drug trafficker , Yong Vui Kong , and the imposition of the death penalty on him , is a recent instance .
Singapore pursues a comprehensive national strategy to combat the scourge of drugs , comprising a high - profile public education campaign , treatment and rehabilitation of drug offenders , as well as strict laws and stiff penalties against those involved in the drug trade .
Public education against drug abuse starts in schools .
For abusers , our approach is to try hard to wean them off drugs and deter them from relapsing .
They are given two chances in a drug rehabilitation centre .
If they go through counselling , kick their drug habit and return to society with useful skills , they will not have any criminal record .
Those who are still addicted go to prison , where they are put on general rehabilitation programmes to help them reintegrate into the community .
Strong community support against drug abuse has been critical to our fight against drugs .
Singapore society resolutely rejects drug abuse .
Several voluntary welfare organisations run halfway houses to help recovering addicts adjust back into society .
Many employers also come forward to offer reformed drug addicts employment opportunities .
Drug traffickers are a major part of the problem on the supply side .
They make drugs available in our communities and profit from the human misery they help create .
This is why tough laws and penalties are needed , including capital punishment for trafficking in significant amounts of the most harmful drugs .
This sends a strong deterrent signal to would - be traffickers .
But unfortunately , attracted by the lucrative payoffs , some still traffic in drugs knowing full well the penalty if they get caught .
With all these efforts , Singapore has one of the lowest prevalence of drug abuse worldwide , even though it has not been entirely eliminated .
Over two decades , the number of drug abusers arrested each year has declined by two - thirds , from over 6,000 in the early 1990s to about 2,000 last year .
Fewer than two in 10 abusers released from prison or drug rehabilitation centres relapse within two years .
We do not have traffickers pushing drugs openly in the streets , nor do we need to run needle exchange centres .
Because of our strict laws , Singapore does not have to contend with major drug syndicates linked to organised crime , unlike some other countries .
According to the 2008 World Drug Report by the United Nations office on drugs and crime 8.2 % of the UK population are cannabis abusers ; in Singapore it is 0.005 % .
For ecstasy , the figures are 1.8 % for the UK and 0.003 % for Singapore ; and for opiates – such as heroin , opium and morphine – 0.9 % for the UK and 0.005 % for Singapore .
Singapore 's use of capital punishment has come under criticism .
However , contrary to the assertions of anti-death penalty campaigners like Gallahue and Lines , Singapore laws that specify the death penalty for certain drug offences do not contravene international law .
Notably , at the United Nations general assembly in 2008 , 46 countries , including some of the world 's largest democracies , voted against a draft resolution proposing a moratorium on the death penalty .
Another 34 countries abstained .
In the recent case of Yong Vui Kong , the court of appeal acknowledged that the mandatory death penalty is constitutional , and the high court expressly found that Yong Vui Kong knew he was carrying the drugs .
Every society strikes its own balance between the rights of the individual and the rights of society .
Capital punishment is an integral part of our successful comprehensive anti-drug strategy .
Our tough stance against drugs has saved tens of thousands of lives from the drug menace .
It is therefore not surprising that the majority of Singaporeans continue to support the death penalty .
For many years , critics of the suburban lifestyles that most Americans ( not to mention Europeans , Japanese , Canadians and Australians ) prefer have claimed that high - density housing is under - supplied by the market .
This based on an implication that the people increasingly seek to abandon detached suburban housing for higher density multi-family housing .
The Suburbs : Slums of the Future ?
The University of Utah's Arthur C. ( Chris ) Nelson , indicated in an article ( entitled " Leadership in a New Era " ) in the Journal of the American Planning Association .
that in 2003 , 75 % of the housing stock was detached and 25 % was attached , including townhouses , apartments , and condominiums .
By 2025 he predicts that only 62 % of consumer will favor detached homes , ( Note 1 ) .
He also predicts a major shift in consumer preferences from housing on large lots ( defined as greater than 1/6th of an acre ) to smaller lots ( Note 2 ) .
This , he suggests , would create a surplus of 22 million detached houses on large lots .
This predication is largely made on the basis of " stated preference " surveys which the author , Dr. Emil Malizia of the University of North Carolina ( commenting on the article in the same issue ) , and others indicate may not accurately reflect the choices that consumers will actually make .
Dr. Nelson 's article has been widely quoted , both in the popular press and in academic circles .
It has led some well - respected figures such as urbanist and developer Christopher Leinberger to suggest in an Atlantic Monthly article that " many low - density suburbs and McMansion subdivisions , including some that are lovely and affluent today , may become what inner cities became in the 1960s and ’ 70s — slums characterized by poverty , crime , and decay . "
The Condo Market Goes Crazy
Misleading ideas sometimes have bad consequences .
The notion that suburbanites were afflicted with urban envy led many developers to throw up high - rise condominiums in urban districts across the country .
Sadly for these developers , the Suburban Exodus never materialized , never occurred .
As a result , developers have lost hundreds of millions , if not billions of dollars and taxpayers or holders of publicly issued bonds could be left " holding the bag " ( see discussion of Portland , below ) .
This weakness has been seen even in the nation 's strongest condominium market , New York City , where one developer offered to pay purchaser 's mortgages , condominium fees and real estate taxes for a year as well as closing costs .
But the damage is arguably worse in other major markets which lack the amenities and advantages of New York .
Take , for example , Raleigh ( North Carolina ) , where low density living is the rule ( the Raleigh urban area is less dense than Atlanta ) .
The News and Observer reports that the largest downtown condominium building ( the Hue ) " considered a bold symbol of downtown Raleigh 's revitalization , " has closed its sales office and halted all marketing efforts .
The development ’s offer of a free washing machine , dryer , refrigerator , and parking space were not enough to entice suburbanites away from the neighborhoods they were said to be so eager to leave .
This is not an isolated instance .
Around the nation , condominium prices have been reduced steeply to attract buyers .
New buildings have gone rental , because no one wanted to buy them .
Other buildings have been foreclosed upon by banks ; and units have been auctioned .
Planned developments have been put on indefinite hold or cancelled .
Miami : Of Little Dubai and Cadavers
Miami ’s core neighborhood ( downtown and Brickell , immediately to the south ) has experienced one of the nation 's most robust condominium building booms .
More than 22,000 condominium high rise units were built between 2003 and 2008 .
Miami could well have more 50 - plus story condominium towers than any place outside Dubai .
As a result , Miami has suffered perhaps the most severe condominium bust in the nation .
According to National Association of Realtors data , the median condominium price in the Miami metropolitan area has dropped 75 % from peak levels ( 2007 , 2nd Quarter ) .
By comparison , the detached housing decline in the metropolitan area was 50 % ; the greatest detached housing price decreases among major metropolitan areas were from 52 % to 58 % ( Riverside - San Bernardino , Sacramento , San Francisco and Phoenix ) .
The most recent report by the Miami Downtown Development Authority indicates that 7,000 units still remain unsold .
The Brickell area is home to the greatest concentration and largest buildings and has the highest ratio of unsold units at 40 % .
Icon Brickell ( see photograph above ) may be the largest development in the core .
Icon Brickell consists of three towers , at 58 , 58 and 50 floors and a total of nearly 1,800 units .
Despite opening in 2008 and offering discounts of up to 50 % , barely one - third ( approximately 620 ) of the units have been sold , according to the Daily Business Review , which also reported on May 13 that the developer had transferred control of two of the towers to construction lenders .
One building , Paramount Bay , was referred to by The New York Times as a " 47 - story steel and glass cadaver " with a lobby " like a mortuary . "
A real estate site indicates that only one of the buildings 350 units has been sold .
More recently sales have inched up in the core but due not to any suburban exodus .
According to The Miami Herald , huge discounts that have lured Europeans , Canadians , and Latin Americans to the core .
The real estate and consulting firm Condo Vultures notes that more than 1,000 of the sales are to a few bulk buyers , a market segment some might refer to as " speculators . "
The latest data from the US Bureau of the Census confirms that there is no fundamental shift away from detached housing in the Miami area , as housing trends point toward more detached housing .
In 2000 , 48.1 % of residents in the Miami metropolitan area lived in detached housing .
By 2008 , the figure had risen to 49.2 % ( Figure 1 ) .
Essentially , the Suburban Exodus remains a mirage .
Portland : Gift Certificates for Distressed Developers
If developer greed was the motive in Miami , government subsidies have been the driving force in Portland .
The city of Portland will soon have issued nearly $ 450 million in urban renewal bonds , provides 10 - year tax property tax forgiveness , and reduced development fees , which the Portland Development Commission ( PDC ) has called " gift certificates " for developers ( Note 3 ) .
Gift certificates have not been enough to cure Portland 's sickly downtown condominium market .
The Oregonian reported that prices were down , on average , 30 % over the year ended the first quarter of 2010 .
Remarkably prices in the much ballyhooed Pearl District are plummeting even more than those in the rest of the Portland area .
According to DQ
News , the median sale price of a house in the Pearl District dropped four times the average in Multnomah County and an even greater six times decline relative to suburban counties over the past year .
There is more .
Just this year , the Pearl District has seen its Eddie Bauer , Adidas , and Puma stores close .
One condominium building the Encore , is reported to have sold only 17 of 177 units .
A recent auction of units at the largest building in the city , the John Ross brought prices " far below the replacement cost " according to The Oregonian 's Ryan Frank , who noted that " it will likely be years before there ’s a new high - rise condo built . "
Late last year , the Pearl District 's Waterfront Pearl was reported to have sold only 31 % of its units and had not sold a unit for a year .
The Portland Development Commission itself has become part of the condominium bust story .
PDC had indicated it was considering relocating its offices to a new 32 - story mixed use tower ( Park Avenue West ) , which was to have included condominiums , offices , and retail stores .
For more than a year , the proposed 32 - story tower has been an unsightly hole in the ground , with construction suspended .
PDC decided to stay put in its older , less expensive offices .
Even before PDC decided not to locate in Park Avenue West , the developers eliminated the plans for 10 floors of condominiums , doubtless because it made no economic sense to add to an already flooded market .
In Portland , like in Miami , the fact remains that suburbia has not been abandoned .
Despite the high density over - building in the Pearl District and elsewhere in the core , detached housing has become even more popular in the region .
According to data from the Bureau of the Census , the share of households living in detached housing in the Portland metropolitan area rose from 63.7 % in 2000 to 64.5 % in 2008 ( Figure 2 ) .
High - Rise Condos : Slums of the Future ?
To say that the high - rise condominium market has fallen on hard times would be an understatement .
The condo bust in New York has become so acute that Right to the City , a coalition of community organizations has called upon " the City to acquire the tax delinquent buildings through tax foreclosure and convert vacant units into permanently affordable housing for low - income New Yorkers . "
In a report entitled People without Homes and Homes without People : A Count of Vacant Condos in Select NYC Neighborhoods , Right to the City points out that there are more than 4,000 empty condo units in 138 buildings , with owners delinquent on nearly $ 4 million in taxes to the city .
Owners of new condominiums around the nation who paid pre-bust prices for their units may not be inclined to stay around if they are surrounded by less affluent renters who have been attracted by desperate building owners and lenders .
Are these dark towers of discounting the slums of tomorrow ?
Only the data and time will tell and it's too early to know , but preliminary findings show little of the predicted shift toward higher density living ( Figure 3 ) .
Certainly national data indicates , if anything , a slightly strengthening market for detached , rather than attached housing ( Figure 4 ) .
• Between 2000 and 2008 , the share of households living in detached housing rose from 61.4 % to 63.5 % .
• A similar trend is shown by the national building permits data .
Between 2000 and 2009 , 75.2 % of residential building permits in the United States were for detached housing .
This is up strongly from 69.6 % in the 1990s and nearly equals the highest on record ( the 1960s ) , when 77.7 % of residential building permits ( housing units ) were detached houses .
Looking at the data , there remains little evidence that the stated preferences on which the predictions relied have been translated into the reality of a shift in preferences toward smaller lots in cores or inner ring suburbs .
Domestic migration continues to be strongly away from core counties to more suburban counties .
Core cities are growing less quickly than suburban areas .
Exurban areas are growing faster than central areas , including inner suburbs .
Clearly , the Suburban Exodus has not begun and there is little reason to believe that it will anytime soon .
Note 1 : In estimating the 2003 share of detached housing ( 75 % ) , Dr. Nelson uses " one-unit structures " data from the 2003 American Housing Survey Table 2 - 3 .
US
Bureau of the Census American Housing Survey personnel responded to my request for clarification , indicating that " one-unit structures " includes ... single detached housing units , mobile homes , and single attached housing units ( such as a townhouse ) . "
Thus the 75 % detached estimate is high because it includes mobile homes and single attached housing .
As is indicated above , data from the US Bureau of the Census data indicates that the share of detached housing of detached plus attached housing in 2000 was 61.4 % .
This figure , coincidentally , is virtually the same as the 62 % Dr. Nelson predicts for 2025 .
Note 2 : The assumption that consumers prefer small lot detached housing may not be sufficiently robust and may even be exaggerated .
Dr. Nelson appears to principally rely on research by Myers and Gearin ( 2001 ) ( in the journal Housing Policy Debate ) for concluding that consumers prefer small lot rather than larger lot detached housing , defining small lot development as 1/6th of an acre or less or less than 7,000 square feet .
Yet neither figure appears in Myers and Gearin .
Moreover , a National Association of Home Builders commenter ( also in Housing Policy Debate ) questions how its data was characterized by Myers and Gearin in justifying a finding of preference for smaller lots ( the survey is unpublished ) .
Without access to the original surveys referenced in Myers and Gearin , it is impossible to judge what respondents may have had in mind as the dividing line between large lots and small lots .
Note 3 : This characterization was on the Portland Development Commission website ( accessed January 2 , 2007 ) .
It was cited in our report , Zero Sum Game : The Austin Streetcar and Development and subsequently removed from the website .
A large share of Portland 's urban renewal bonds are insured by Ambac Financial Corporation , which has reported losses exceeding $ 1 billion in the last two quarters .
Ambac indicated that it has " insufficient capital to finance its debt service and operating expense requirements beyond the second quarter of 2011 and may need to seek bankruptcy protection . "
Ambac was the insurer of State of Nevada bonds to build the Las Vegas Monorail , which has already entered bankruptcy and is unable to pay its bonds .

BP ’s Effort to Plug Oil Leak Suspended a Second Time
Well ...
Glad the Media is catching up .
via NYT
In an operation known as a “ junk shot , ” BP engineers poured pieces of rubber , golf balls and other materials into the crippled blowout preventer , trying to clog the device that sits atop the wellhead .
The maneuver was designed to work in conjunction with the continuing “ top kill ” operation , in which heavy drilling liquids are pumped into the well to counteract the pressure of the gushing oil .
If the efforts succeeded , officials intended to pump cement into the well to seal it .
But the company suspended pumping operations at 2:30 a.m.
Friday after two junk shot attempts , said the technician , who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak publicly about the efforts .
The suspension of the effort was not announced , and appeared to again contradict statements by company and government officials that suggested the top kill procedure was progressing Friday .

They appear to be doing rigging and prepwork to cut the top off of the BOP for the installation of the LMRP Cap .
BP's Kent Wells told us that that would be the next operation if the Top Kill failed .

* Mud pumping started , suspended and now restarted ( Adds comments from BP chief operating officer )
By Kristen Hays
HOUSTON , May 27 ( Reuters ) - More than 24 hours into its crucial " top kill " plan , London - based BP Plc ( BP.L ) said on Thursday it was still too early to access the success or failure of its best short - term hope of plugging a blown - out well in the Gulf of Mexico .
When it began the operation to pump thousands of barrels of heavy drilling mud down the well on Wednesday , it said results could be clear in 24 hours .
On Thursday , an executive who has overseen the plug efforts for weeks said it would be another day or more .
" We 're going to do the job as best we can , " said Doug Suttles , BP 's chief operating officer .
" If it takes more than 24 hours , it takes more than 24 hours . "
Pressure is mounting for the company to fix the leak .
U.S. Interior Secretary Ken Salazar also has scolded the company for missing previous deadlines .
BP wants to set realistic expectations on a critical procedure , said Dan Pickering , co-president of Tudor Pickering Holt & Co energy investment and merchant banking in Houston .
" Going slow and being successful is better than going fast and / or jumping to conclusions , " Pickering said .
After other efforts to stem or corral the leak failed , the stakes are climbing fast , he said .
" BP has indicated this has a 60 percent to 70 percent probability of working .
If it does n't , their credibility is weak and they 're going to have a lot of very disappointed people , " Pickering said .
The top kill is BP 's latest effort to choke off the leak that threatens much of the Gulf Coast .
The leak was discovered after a blowout preventer at the seabed failed on April 20 and the Deepwater Horizon drilling rig later exploded and sank , killing 11 workers .
OBJECTIVE 'NOT YET ACHIEVED '
The bigger of two leaks comes from the end of a broken pipe that had connected the well to the rig .
A smaller leak continues from the bent pipe on top of the blowout preventer .
The top kill involves pumping drilling " mud , " or fluids heavier than oil , into the failed blowout preventer and then down the well .
The intent is for the fluid to overcome the flow of oil and " kill " the well .
Suttles said mud was pumped into the blowout preventer for about 10 hours on Wednesday , then suspended so scientists could study pressures to gauge whether the effort was working .
If pressure is high , oil and gas is still leaking .
Lower pressure indicates the mud is smothering the flow , he said .
He said some on BP 's team saw improvement , while others were more skeptical .
While mud is pumped into the blowout preventer , some can go down into the well , while some go up and then out of a broken pipe atop the blowout preventer , where oil and gas are leaking .
" We have not stopped the flow , so the operation has not yet achieved its objective , " Suttles said .
Mud pumping restarted on Thursday .
Suttles said BP also would pump in " bridging agents , " or more solid materials , to help block the leak .
BP also may inject a " junk shot " of shredded rubber , golf balls and other materials to add more weight to push back the leak , Suttles said .
Pumping may stop again to allow more evaluation of pressures , he said .
" Nothing has actually gone wrong .
This is a dynamic kill , " he said .
Nothing has actually gone wrong , but then , nothing at all has gone right , so I guess it 's moot .
Meantime , it 's just as bad , and they 've dumped hundreds of thousands of gallons more extremely toxic shit into the ocean .

To Top Of Main Page I am pretty convinced that the Methane pouring out at a 3000:1 ratio versus Oil is the real problem at the moment .
It seems to be pushing a column through the mud , allowing the Oil to follow .
After they stopped the pumping , the gush started turning more brown within a couple of hours .
What they were hoping to see : Nothing has actually gone wrong , but then , nothing at all has gone right , so I guess it 's moot .
Meantime , it 's just as bad , and they 've dumped hundreds of thousands of gallons more extremely toxic shit into the ocean .

The Effects of Discharges of Drilling Fluid Additives
According to Patin , ferro - chrome lignosulfonate , a common drilling mud additive used as a thinner and deflocculant , has reported effects on survival and physiological responses of fish eggs and fry ; the filtration control additive CMC ( carboxy - methyl - cellulose ) can cause death in fish fry at high concentrations ( 1,000 - 2,000 mg/l ) and physiological changes at 12 - 50 mg/l , whereas at the low concentrations ( 1 - 20 mg / l ) used in standard chronic tests it has no observed effects .
Other additives used as defoamers , descalers , thinners , viscosifiers , lubricants , stabilisers , surfactants and corrosion inhibitors all have reported effects on marine organisms , ranging from minor physiological changes to reduced fertility , lower feeding rates and higher mortality , depending on the concentrations .
Some of the corrosion inhibitors , for example phosphoxit - 7 , EKB - 2 - 2 and EKB - 6 - 2 , are " characterised not only by high toxicity ... but by their ability to cause genetic and teratogenic damages as well ( Petukhova , G. A. , Tupitsina , L. S. , Bulovatskaya , S. E. and Gerasimova , E. L. 1991 .
The Assessment of the Genetic Toxicity of Corrosion Inhibitors .
In Theses of the Second All - Union Conference on Fisheries Toxicology , 2 : 97-98 ) .
Such properties were also revealed for a number of surface - active substances ( surfactants ) from a group of neonols - AF9 - 6 , AF9 - 10 , and others ( Migalovski , I. P. , Migalovskaya , V. N. , Kosheleva , V. V. and Kasatkina , S. V. 1991 .

I 'f your not watching SpillCam , your missing all the fun .
Monitoring continues at the BOP and Riser End , while the " mud , " actually an extra-dense Petroleum - based drilling compound , is pumped at high - velocity through the BOP and down the casing to the deposit .
It seems that the abundance of Methane Gas pouring out is the stickler .
They need to pump " mud " until the gas is tamped down .
I believe that this is what they are looking to see ( click for big ) :

BP's Kent Wells Explains The Top Kill ...
Apparently " Top Kill " Is Getting Underway ...
A new disclaimer !
via BP Live SpillCam
Throughout the extended top kill procedure – which may take up to two days to complete - very significant changes in the appearance of the flows at the seabed may be expected .
These will not provide a reliable indicator of the overall progress , or success or failure , of the top kill operation as a whole .
BP will report on the progress of the operation as appropriate and on its outcome when complete .
Maybe if you were showing us what you were DOING at the BOP , and properly communicating with the American people , making effective use of this wonderful American trifle we like to call the News Media , there would be less need for speculation .
That said , good luck BP Brain Trust .
We 're all counting on you .

Like I said -- they are either prepping the BOP for the Top - Kill , and moving the riser , or something unexpected , and not good at all is happening .
That is an enormous , pent - up Methane release .
UPDATE 9:23 pm CDT : The Dispersant Dispenser / RITT Controller ( ??? ) appears to have finally given out after a lot of abuse over the weekend .
Last evening , a bot had to hold the pipes in place for hours .
The box lasted 10 whole days !
Bravo , BP Brain Trust .
wink
Keep in mind --
We 're trusting the same people who made the metal box to save the world with an unprecedented DEEPWATER " Top - Kill " attempt -- Pass / EPIC Fail. 60 - 70 % chance of success .
I 'm no betting man , but I know a Hitting Average when I see it .
Now , I 've seen some power hitters with surprisingly low averages .
BP has n't hit one out of the park , yet .
they are running a non -stop series of strike - outs , bawks , and errors .
That said , let us all send best wishes , prayers , energy , whatever you do , out there to the crew that has to do the operation .
I do n't envy them in the least .

Event ...
I have a friend , who is Bat Shit Crazy .
No. Really .
He 's brilliant -- never mind that -- just looky here .
Fortunately for you and me , and ironically enough , BP decided to run a repeat of the afternoon eruption i the late night , when they figured no one would notice .
Our absolutely brilliant friend ( did I mention he 's a Mac User ? ) , who is Bat Shit Crazy had it in him to record , and make a screengrab contact sheet of the event .
Below , you see the Riser pipe end , and a whole lot of the landscape blowing out .
It spun Our Favorite Disaster Bot at least 360 - degrees , before it recovered .
Somewhere after the third blowout of the day , BP hauled it up .
The ascent video is posted just below .
It 's clear that something went crazy along what is left of the pipeline from the Casings through BOP to the terminal Riser end -- the Poster Child of the disaster .

Ascent Through The Plume ...
After the Saturday Afternoon Eruption , Our Favorite Disaster Bot needed to go to the surface for a window cleaning , and delousing .
This is a ten - minute long video , but DO take the time to watch what it saw on it 's 5000 - foot rise to the surface .
Plumes of enormous magnitude .
Some answers seem to be falling into place , as to what we saw happen yesterday .
This is one of the easier answers .
Everyone watching wanted to know what was happening to Our Favorite Disaster Bot , not to mention the poor Eels .
After about an hour of chaos , just as visibility was settling in again , OFDB was thrust back into the dark murk .
Now , we know that it just needed an oil change and the windshields cleaned .
It 's clear that the ground around the riser pipe settled dramatically .
It 's clear that a little , leaky hole in the seabed turned into an erupting hole at least 12 " across .
I believe that something big happened ~ 8 am CDT , and again in the early afternoon .
Some of the other , later events may have easy answers , and I am giving folks way smarter than me some time to pick at what we saw .
What we DO know , and there are screengrabs to prove it , is that after the big events , and the pulling of Our Favorite Bot , switched to a mix of previously recorded " loop " and live footage , basically randomly distributed to the various authorized feeds .
Throwing chaff .
It would seem that BP just can't help their PR deception ...
BP -- look at it this way :

Major Change Down Below ...
Pat Robertson , the prominent co-founder of the Christian coalition and conservative television evangelist , has some advice for women : stay pretty .
In response to a caller Thursday who asked what she could do to stop her flirting husband who “ loves to talk with other women he finds attractive , ” the 80 - year - old minister advised the woman to make herself “ as attractive as possible . ”
ADVERTISEMENT
The liberal blog ThinkProgress notes that Robertson frequently stresses the importance of monogamy .
CO - HOST : Pat , this is from Anne who says , Ã¢â‚ ¬ Å“ My husband has always been a flirt and loves to talk with other women he finds attractive .
He says he would never cheat on me but his actions are starting to get to me .
What should I do ?
Ã¢â‚ ¬Â ROBERTSON : Anne , first thing is you need to make yourself as attractive as possible and donÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢t hassle him about it .
And why is he doing this ?
Well , heÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s doing it because he wants affirmation that he is still a man , that he is attractive Ã¢â‚¬â€  and he gets an affirmation of himself .
That means heÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s got an inferiority complex that Ã¢â‚¬â „ ¢s coming out .
And heÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s not gonna cheat on you .
HeÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s just playing .
But you need to not drive him away or start hassling and hounding on him , but make yourself as beautiful as you can , as fun as you can , and say letÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s go out here , letÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s go there , letÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s go to the other thing .
Robertson ’s comment is n’t that out of character — he ’s routinely been critical of women , and feminism in particular .
“ The feminist agenda is not about equal rights for women , ” he declared in a 1992 fundraising letter slamming a proposed Iowa equal rights amendment .
“ It is about a socialist , anti-family political movement that encourages women to leave their husbands , kill their children , practice witchcraft , destroy capitalism and become lesbians . ”
The Thursday quote was first caught by Media Matters .
When launched back in 2008 , Acer 's Predator desktop was a mean gaming rig -- and we do n't just mean because it had a tendency to actually set things on fire .
We 're pretty sure the new , just announced revision of the desktop wo n't suffer the same ailment , a non-customizable update that sports a 2.8 GHz Core i7 930 CPU , an NVIDIA GeForce GTX 470 GPU , 1.5TB of storage , 12GB of DDR3 RAM , and an asking price of one buck under $ 2,000 .
That 's a solid deal , and the new black and orange case design looks solid too , every bit as loud as old orange and black one .
It 's just perfect for showing your opponents just how serious you are about your gaming , though we 're thinking it might have been even more popular if the Stanley Cup had gone the other way .
When I was starting out in science journalism in the early 1980s , a writer had three choices to begin reporting a story .
You could go to your publication ’s wall of dusty encyclopedias of professional and scientific associations , phone directories and other reference tomes lining the walls ( in my case , at Science Digest magazine ) .
You could raid a more experienced colleague ’s Rolodex .
Or you could call the Scientists Institute for Public Information , S.I.P.I , a nonprofit group founded in 1963 and mainly paid for by media companies and foundations to provide , in essence , directory assistance for journalists seeking scientists .
These days , a journalist , or anyone else , can in seconds find heaps of scientists studying glaciology or marine mammal endocrinology or the toxicity of petroleum with a mouse click .
But finding someone who ’s reliable and appropriate for a particular piece is a tougher challenge .
Avoiding getting an expert more interested in making a policy point than explaining the science is a tough challenge , as well .
That was the logic behind the much - discussed paper in this weeks ’ edition of the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences that aimed in part to clarify which publishing climate scientists are most credible .
Today , the American Geophysical Union announced that it will try to help fill the source gap on climate science .
The details are below .
It ’s great to see any scientific institution these days recognize the importance of deeper involvement in helping foster informed public discourse .
As I ’ve said a lot lately , traditional journalism , and particularly specialized journalism , is a shrinking wedge of a fast - growing pie of communication .
If academic and professional institutions with lots of expertise on scientific issues of great import shy away from the public arena , they leave that space to other groups that may put some background agenda ahead of accuracy .
Note that the geophysical union is offering up experts expressly in climate science , not policy , which is outside the research focus of its members for the most part .
Here ’s the group ’s news release :
THEY could challenge the South American piranha for viciousness and they can make sharks look positively docile .
A small , innocuous - looking fish called a chinaman leatherjacket is swarming in Sydney waters , attacking and eating anything that moves , from bare fishing hooks to large marlin .
From 10 cm to about 40 cm long , the yellow and black striped leatherjackets look nothing like the popular perception of a marine predator , having tiny beak - like mouths a few centimetres wide .
But inside is a set of teeth like razor - sharp chisels .
Anglers complain of leatherjackets biting straight through fishing hooks .
Geoff Somerville , who operates Ibex deep sea fishing charters out of Botany Bay , said that the chinaman leatherjackets had returned to Sydney waters in the past few weeks after several months of making life hell for fishermen on the South Coast .
" They are back in plague proportions , the numbers are unbelievable , " Mr Somerville said .
" They have been stripping the bottom of the ocean of food in some places .
The desirable fish like snapper leave because there 's nothing left for them to eat .
" If you do manage to hook a desirable fish and do n't bring it to the boat quickly enough , all you 'll reel in is a head or a skeleton .
" The jackets just strip the fish bare of flesh .
They 'll follow a fish up to the boat and then swarms of them will just sit under the boat and it becomes impossible to fish . "
The leatherjackets ' aggression and gang attack behaviour has been revealed in a stunning video shot at the scallop beds in Jervis Bay a few weeks ago , which showed leatherjackets attacking a large octopus .
The Daily Telegraph columnist and Modern Fishing magazine writer Al McGlashan said that on some days the fish were so aggressive he feared what would happen if someone fell in the water .
" I 've caught and seen mako sharks , tiger sharks , all manner of sharks and fish like barracuda - but leatherjackets are the most vicious fish I 've ever seen , " he said .
" Sharks can actually be quite shy and wary , but they [ the leatherjackets ] will eat anything and they are n't afraid of anything . "
Mick Collins from Otto's Tackle World at Drummoyne said there were reports a pack of 40 cm leatherjackets had attacked a 2.5 m marlin as it was being brought in to a boat during a tournament at Port Stephens last month .
" We are getting guys who have lost hundreds of dollars worth of tackle in a day because the jackets bite off anything put in the water .
They are losing $ 30 lures one after another , " he said .
" Smaller ones of 10 cm to 15 cm long have come into the Harbour in the past few weeks and it can be actually impossible to fish . "
Industry and Investment NSW Researcher Marcus Miller said the earliest known catch record in NSW is from 1883 , when an annual report to NSW Fisheries identified leatherjackets as " troublesome to schnapper fishers " .
Mr Miller said that they are one of the most important species in the NSW commercial trap and trawl fisheries .
Long considered a " royal delicacy " in Cambodia , the Batagur turtle has been hunted to near extinction throughout Southeast Asia .
Today the turtle is critically endangered and it is unclear where wild Batagurs still live .
With the hatching of two baby Batagurs at Vienna 's Schoenbrunn Zoo last week , the total number of this rare species in captivity climbs to 20 .
To breed the rare turtles , a father and son team of herpetology experts , Peter and Reinger Praschag , were brought in to recreate just the right natural environment for egg laying .

HOUSTON : In a coup likely to shift what millions of American children learn at school , a clutch of Christian evangelicals and social conservatives who have grasped control of the Texas Board of Education are expected to force through a new state curriculum this week .
The board is to vote on a purge of alleged liberal bias in Texas school books in favour of what board member Cynthia Dunbar says really matters : a belief in America as a nation chosen by God as a beacon to the world .
'' We are fighting for our children 's education and our nation 's future , '' Ms Dunbar said .
'' In Texas we have certain statutory obligations to promote patriotism and to promote the free enterprise system .
'' There seems to have been a move away from a patriotic ideology .
There seems to be a denial that this was a nation founded under God .
We had to go back and make some corrections . ''
Those corrections prompted a blizzard of accusations of rewriting history and indoctrinating children by promoting right - wing views on religion , economics and guns while diminishing the science of evolution , the civil rights movement and the horrors of slavery .
In the three - plus years since its painstaking installation at the Institute of Contemporary Art , Cornelia Parker ’s “ Hanging Fire ( Suspected Arson ) ’’ has become one of the most popular pieces of contemporary art on view in this city .
Parker , an English artist in her 50s , salvaged these charred and desiccated pieces of wood from the scene of a suspicious fire at a woodshop on the outskirts of London .
Burnt and brittle , they ’re evidence of disaster , wrong - doing , undoing .
In the natural order of things we’d be seeing them collapsed in an abject pile on the ground , surrounded by rubble , awaiting the final chapter of their fate : dust , decay , dissolution .
But Parker proposes a different fate .
From chaos , she creates order .
From collapse , she creates effortless ascension .
And from confusion ( who did it , and how ? ) , she creates transparency ( I did it , and you can easily see how ) .
Cunningly , the work floats a few inches off the floor , echoing the beloved “ reveal ’ ’ of contemporary architects like Renzo Piano — a slight gap where walls and pedestals do not meet the floor , creating an illusion of zero gravity .
In defiance of another fundamental law , the piece seems to reverse time ’s arrow .
Almost insouciantly , it restores the rectilinear elevation of the building that burned down .
There ’s something cinematic about the result , like the frozen frame of a film played in reverse .
But the work ’s air of brainy calculation is really a cloak behind which primal urges pulse : the desire to be salvaged , to be weightless , to be restored to order .
Beauty from ugliness .
Hope from defeat .
Order from chaos :
These are the things , when all is said and done , we yearn for , we ’re on our knees for .
And yet , stubbornly , they elude us .
If religions are good at promising us what we ’ll never get , art performs the more modest task of reminding us what we do n’t have .
And indeed , the irony of this particular work of art is that , even as it seems to defy gravity , it relies on it .
And even as it suggests a phoenix rising from the ashes , there ’s really nothing supernatural in sight : just another dumb smattering of detritus rearranged into the form of a box .

Here 's Limor " Adafruit " Friend and Make editor Phil Torrone presenting a quick Ignite talk on the growth of open - source hardware businesses , including the remarkable revelation that there are 13 companies turning over $ 1 million or more per year making hardware that anyone can copy and improve upon .
Many are based on the Arduino , but the biggest ( by an order of magnitude ) , SparkFun , is a kind of toolsmith that makes bits and pieces to plug into your other projects .
I saw Limor and Phil give this presentation earlier this month at FOO East in Cambridge Mass and have n't been able to to get it out of my head — so glad that someone got it on video !

As Andrew Wakefield states in his prologue , “ If autism does not affect your family now , it will .
If something does not change — and change soon — this is almost a mathematical certainty .
This book affects you also .
It is not a parochial look at a trivial medical spat in the United Kingdom , but dispatches from the battlefront in a major confrontation — a struggle against compromise in medicine , corruption of science , and a real and present threat to children in the interests of policy and profit .
It is a story of how ‘ the system ’ deals with dissent among its doctors and scientists . ”
In the pursuit of possible links between childhood vaccines , intestinal inflammation , and neurologic injury in children , Wakefield lost his job in London ’s Royal Free Hospital , his country of birth , his career , and his medical license .
A recent General Medical Council ruling stated that he was “ dishonest , irresponsible and showed callous disregard for the distress and pain of children . ”
Maligned by the medical establishment and mainstream media , Wakefield endeavors to set the record straight in Callous Disregard .
While explaining what really happened , he calls out the organizations and individuals that are acting not for the sake of children affected by autism , but in their own self - interests .

( AP ) -- Federal regulators are endorsing Hollywood 's efforts to let cable and satellite TV companies turn off output connections on the back of set - top boxes to prevent illegal copying of movies .
The decision by the Federal Communications Commission , announced late Friday , is intended to encourage studios to make movies available for home viewing on demand soon after they hit theaters or even at the same time .
Bob Pisano , head of the Motion Picture Association of America , said the FCC 's action will give consumers " far greater access to see recent high - definition movies in their homes . "
But critics warned that the FCC order could prevent 20 million Americans with older , analog TVs from seeing these new - release movies at all .
That 's because the order allows the studios to limit delivery of new movies to only those households with newer digital sets .
In addition , critics say the blocking technology could prohibit legal recordings on some video recorders and other devices with analog connections .
" We are unsure when the FCC has ever before given private entities the right to disable consumers ' products in their homes , " the Consumer Electronics Association said in a statement .
" The fact that the motion picture studios want to create a new business model does not mean that functioning products should be disabled by them . "
Public Knowledge , a public interest group , said the FCC " has succumbed to the special - interest pleadings of the big media companies . "
The FCC prohibits the use of so - called " selectable output control " technology , which encodes video programming with a signal to remotely disable set - top box output connections .
The FCC granted a waiver from those rules on Friday at the request of the MPAA .
Allowing movie studios to temporarily prevent recording from TVs could pave the way for movies to be released to homes sooner than they are today .
The FCC said the waiver is therefore in the public interest , because the studios are unlikely to offer new movies so soon after their theatrical release without such controls .
Companies such as The Walt Disney Co. have been trying to shorten the time between theatrical and home video releases , partly to benefit from one round of marketing buzz and partly to head off piracy .
With DVD sales declining , studios are looking for new ways to deliver their content securely while still making money .
In its decision Friday , the agency stressed that its waiver includes several important conditions , including limits on how long studios can use the blocking technology .
The FCC said the technology cannot be used on a particular movie once it is out on DVD or Blu - Ray , or after 90 days from the time it is first used on that movie , whichever comes first .

Streit der Woche : Wählen ab 16 – Keine gute Idee
Das Wahlalter sollte auf sechzehn gesenkt werden , sagt Jugendforscher Klaus Hurrelmann .
Falsch findet das der Berliner SPD - Politiker Fritz Felgentreu .
Der Sozialwissenschaftler Klaus Hurrelmann fordert eine Senkung des Wahlalters auf sechzehn Jahre .
Es sei für Jugendliche „ spätestens mit vierzehn Jahren ohne Einschränkungen möglich “ , den Wahlvorgang zu begreifen , schreibt der Leiter der jüngsten Shell - Jugendstudien im Streit der Woche in der sonntaz .
Die nötigen Kompetenzen würden durch Schule und Medien heute früh genug vermittelt , außerdem setze die Pubertät inzwischen früher ein .
Die Kindheit ende nicht mehr mit fünfzehn bis sechzehn , sondern mit zwölf bis dreizehn Jahren .
„ Ein Mindestwahlalter von sechzehn Jahren würde der veränderten Lage endlich Rechnung tragen “ , schreibt Hurrelmann .
Als der Bundestag vor 40 Jahren das aktive Wahlalter von 21 auf achtzehn senkte , setzte er damit auch eine langfristige Entwicklung in Richtung Jugendwahlrecht in Gang .
Inzwischen können Sechzehnjährige in fast der Hälfte der Bundesländer bei Kommunalwahlen ihr Kreuz machen , in jüngster Zeit werden auch auf Landesebene Reformen in Angriff genommen :
In Bremen etwa wählen Jugendliche im Frühjahr 2011 erstmals ein Landesparlament , in Berlin steht in den nächsten Wochen eine Entscheidung darüber an .
Während Berliner Grüne und Linkspartei eine Änderung der Landesverfassung wollen , ist die SPD uneins .
Fritz Felgentreu , Vize - Chef der SPD - Fraktion im Berliner Landesparlament , lehnt eine Senkung des Wahlalters in der sonntaz ab : „ Wahlalter sechzehn – eine sympathische , aber keine gute Idee “ , schreibt der rechtspolitische Sprecher der Fraktion .
Die Argumente der Befürworter seien beliebig .
Dagegen habe sich die bisherige Regelung , erst Achtzehnjährige zu Landtags - und Bundestagswahlen zuzulassen , bewährt .
Die Jugendlichen könnten so in Verantwortung hineinwachsen : „ Durch Religionsmündigkeit mit vierzehn , kommunale Mündigkeit mit sechzehn und Gesetzgebungsmündigkeit mit achtzehn “ .
Als „ überfällig “ bezeichnet Christian Berg , Landesvorsitzender der Jusos Berlin , das Wahlrecht für Sechzehnjährige .
„ Ihnen das Wahlrecht vorzuenthalten ist ein Armutszeugnis “ , äußerte sich Berg gegenüber taz.de : „ Jugendliche haben eigene politische Interessen – etwa wenn es um Schul - und Ausbildungspolitik oder die Ausgestaltung von Jugendeinrichtungen geht “ .
Die Erfahrungen aus Österreich , wo Jugendliche ab sechzehn bereits generell wählen dürfen , hätten das Verantwortungsbewusstsein der Jungwähler gezeigt .
Im Streit der Woche äußern sich zudem Renate Köcher , Geschäftsführerin des Allensbach - Instituts für Meinungsforschung , Maria Dragus , Schauspielerin in „ Das weiße Band “ , Clara Herrmann , Grünen - Abgeordnete im Berliner Landesparlament sowie taz.de - Leser Andreas Hasenkopf .
This week Microsoft will take its Office 2010 suite out of beta .
If you ’re considering upgrading Office with Office , we ’d encourage you to consider an alternative : upgrading Office with Google Docs .
If you choose this path , upgrade means what it ’s supposed to mean : effortless , affordable , and delivering a remarkable increase in employee productivity .
This is a refreshing alternative to the expensive and laborious upgrades to which IT professionals have become accustomed .
Google Docs has been providing rich real - time collaboration to millions of users for nearly four years .
It lets employees edit and share documents , spreadsheets , and presentations in the browser from anywhere in the world .
We recently made tremendous strides in improving Google Docs formatting , speed and functionality , and a growing number of companies are now using it as their primary productivity software .
Of course , you probably already own Office 2003 or 2007 ( or maybe Office 2000 ? ) , and there ’s no need to uninstall them .
Fortunately , Google Docs also makes Office 2003 and 2007 better .
For example , you can store any file – including Microsoft Office documents – in Google ’s cloud and share them in their original format ( protected , naturally by Google ’s synchronous replication across datacenters ) .
Plus , in the coming months , Google will enable real - time collaboration directly in Office 2003 and 2007 , as you can see here .
Google Docs represents a real alternative for companies : a chance to get the collaboration features you need today and end the endless cycle of “ upgrades ” .
For more information on the choices available to you , check out the summary below .
But do n’t take our word for it – you can try Google Docs and the rest of the Google Apps suite for free .
The only thing you have to lose is a server or two .
Eric
Illsley will appear before magistrates next month MP Eric Illsley has been charged with false accounting over his expenses and suspended by the Labour Party .
He is accused of dishonestly claiming £ 20,000 in council tax and other bills on his second home in London .
The Barnsley Central MP will appear at City of Westminster Magistrates ' Court on 17 June .
Three former Labour MPs and an ex Tory peer have already been charged under the Theft Act over their expenses claims - all deny wrongdoing .
Announcing Mr Illsley 's suspension from the Labour Party , a spokesman said : " The Labour Party 's general secretary has issued Eric Illsley with a suspension following the CPS 's announcement of criminal charges against him .
" As a result , Eric Illsley has been suspended from the Whip and cannot attend any Labour Party meeting .
This was felt necessary in light of the criminal charges . "
Decision
In a statement , Director of Public Prosecutions Keir Starmer said : " Having thoroughly reviewed a file of evidence we received from the Metropolitan Police on 30 March this year , we concluded that there is sufficient evidence and it is in the public interest to bring criminal charges against Eric Illsley MP . "
He said Mr Illsley faced three charges under section 17 of the Theft Act 1968 for false accounting .
" The first charge alleges that Mr Illsley dishonestly claimed expenses in relation to council tax , service and maintenance charges , repairs and insurance charges , and utilities and communications charges for his second home in Renfrew Road , London , between May 2005 and April 2006 .
" The second charge relates to the same claims between May 2006 and April 2007 , and the third charge relates to the same claims between May 2007 and April 2008 .
" In total the charges allege a sum in excess of £ 20,000 was dishonestly claimed over this three year period . "
Evidence files on eight politicians have now been handed to the Crown Prosecution Service for a decision to be made on whether to charge them .
Five people have been charged , two cases have been dropped and one further file is still under consideration by the CPS .
Prosecutors have said a decision will be made on the the one outstanding case " in due course " .
Mr Starmer added : " Mr Illsley now stands charged with criminal offences and has the right to a fair trial .
" It is extremely important that nothing should be reported which could prejudice his trial . "
All the men charged in relation to expenses have denied wrongdoing .

The World ’s Top Dissidents
Democracy .
Women ’s rights .
Freedom of the press .
The rule of law .
From Afghanistan to Zimbabwe , China to Peru , dissidents are working tirelessly for the liberties so many take for granted .
Their fight is n’t an easy one — dissidents often pay a price for their work in the form of surveillance , kidnappings , beatings , assassinations , arrests , and torture .
FP ‘s May / June issue featured the story of one such dissident , the jailed Russian billionaire Mikhail Khodorkovsky .
But it is only the lucky few whose cases echo around the world — Burma ’s Aung San Suu Kyi , for example , or Tibet ’s Dalai Lama .
Meanwhile , innumerable people are caught up in the same battle .
Here are just a few .
Garry Kasparov in 2008 .
Russia
Lyudmila M. Alexeyeva : A tiny , frail woman of 82 years , Alexeyeva has protested Russian repression for more than 40 years — dating back to Leonid Brezhnev ’s premiership of the former Soviet Union .
She was first reported to Soviet authorities at age 19 for reading banned poetry .
Today , she can be found leading protests on street corners and in prominent plazas , most recently on New Year ’s Eve , when she was arrested for leading an unauthorized protest .
In January , she told the New York Times that Soviet repression was easier to fight than it is in Vladimir Putin ’s era : “ There were rules then .
They were idiotic rules , but there were rules , and if you knew them you could defend yourself . ”
She has been attacked by pro-Kremlin supporters in recent months , prompting members of the European Parliament to express their concern and award her the body ’s 2009 Sakharov human rights prize , named for famed Soviet dissident Andrei Sakharov .
Garry Kasparov : Arguably the world ’s greatest chess player , Kasparov ’s political career has not been nearly as successful .
Founder of the United Civil Front and a leader of the loose opposition coalition the “ Other Russia , ” Kasparov planned to challenge then - President Vladimir Putin ’s handpicked successor , Dmitry Medvedev , in the 2008 Russian presidential election .
But he was forced to withdraw in the face of a campaign of harassment that he says was directed by the Kremlin .
Kasparov , like many other Putin - era Russian dissidents , has proved much more popular in the West than in Russia .
And Putin , now a very powerful prime minister , has proved to be an even tougher opponent than Deep Blue .
( Check out FP ‘s 2008 interview with Kasparov here and here . )
Libya
Abdelnasser al - Rabbasi : Arrested by plainclothes officers in 2003 , after he submitted a short story , “ Chaos , Corruption and the Suicide of the Mind in Libya , ” to the Arab Times , Rabbasi was sentenced to 15 years in prison .
The writer is a relentless critic of the country ’s mercurial leader , Muammar al - Qaddafi .
The country ’s People ’s Court accused Rabbasi in 2003 of “ dishonoring the guide of the revolution , ” aka Qaddafi .
But Rabbasi told Human Rights
Watch he was imprisoned for “ criticizing the situation in my country , ” just as Qaddafi now does .
“ So I do n’t know why I was imprisoned .
I did not carry a gun ; I carried a pen . ”

Ayman Nour in 2005 .
Tunisia
Mohammed Abbou :
A prominent Tunisian lawyer , Abbou was arrested in May 2005 for penning an article slamming the country ’s president , Zine el - Abidine Ben Ali , and the torture to which prisoners are often subjected .
Abbou ’s trial took place the following month , and he was convicted , both for denouncing torture and allegedly assaulting a female colleague in 2002 .
Amnesty International designated Abbou a prisoner of conscience until his release two years later as part of a presidential pardon marking Tunisia ’s 50 years of independence .
He remains subject to a travel ban .
Egypt
Ayman Nour : Egypt ’s most prominent dissident , Nour is a liberal reformer who calls for an opening of Egypt ’s rigid , authoritarian political regime .
He challenged President Hosni Mubarak in the 2005 presidential election and won 8 percent of the vote , despite widespread irregularities and allegations of fraud .
Before the campaign , he was charged by the state with registering forged signatures to get El Ghad , his party , on the ballot .
But following U.S. pressure , Mubarak allowed him to stand .
Nour lost his parliamentary seat in November of that year , however , and he was quickly put on trial , where he received a five - year prison sentence .
In February 2009 , he was unexpectedly released , ostensibly for health reasons ; he is still subject to a travel ban , however .
Nour is believed to be considering another presidential bid in 2011 , though under current Egyptian law he would be ineligible to run .
Syria
Riad al - Turk :
The old man of the Syrian opposition , as he is called , Turk was first arrested in 1952 and has served more than 20 years of his life in prison .
Over the past half - century , the 80 - year - old has formed a broad coalition , which includes the Muslim Brotherhood , to call for free and fair elections .
Turk played a prominent role during the so - called Damascus Spring of 2000 , a period of hope for Syrian political liberalization following President Hafez al - Assad ’s death .
The spring did not last long , however , and Turk was arrested in 2001 after a memorable Al Jazeera interview in which he proclaimed of Assad , “ The dictator has died . ”
Turk was the longtime secretary - general of the Syrian Communist Party , and despite giving up his leadership post in recent years , he remains very active in the organization .

Shirin Ebadi in 2009 .
Azerbaijan
Eynulla Fatullayev : Fatullayev , a journalist for Monitor magazine , first caught his government ’s attention in 2007 when he published a controversial article implicating the government in the murder of a colleague , Elmar Huseynov .
A few months later , after a blog comment was falsely attributed to him , Fatullayev was charged with terrorism and the incitement of ethnic hatred and sentenced to 10 years in prison .
Last December , while in jail , he was hit with a new count of possession of heroin , which he claims was planted on him by prison guards , a tactic used frequently by Azerbaijani authorities , according to the Committee to Protect Journalists .
Iran
Shirin Ebadi :
The most famous Iranian dissident , Ebadi is the founder of the Defenders of Human Rights Center and the winner of the 2003 Nobel Peace Prize “ for her efforts for democracy and human rights . ”
In 1975 , in the beginning of her storied career , Ebadi was the first Iranian woman to serve as a judge .
She lost her judgeship , however , after the 1979 Islamic Revolution , when she was relegated to administrative duties .
A noted human rights lawyer , she has defended numerous clients who were unfairly prosecuted by the state over the last 30 years , including dozens of women who had been arrested for protesting discriminatory gender laws .
Ebadi has been consistently targeted by the Iranian government throughout her career and is an avid supporter of the green movement , a position that sent her into self - imposed exile in Britain following last year ’s disputed presidential election .
( Check out FP ‘s 2009 interview with Ebadi . )
Akbar Ganji :
Once described as the Iranian Vaclav Havel by British human rights group Article 19 , journalist Ganji was imprisoned from 2001 to 2006 for exposing state involvement in the killings of jailed Iranian dissidents — now known as the “ Chain Murders . ”
He served in the Iranian Ministry of Culture and Islamic Guidance in the 1980s , but his disillusionment with the Islamic Revolution ’s path transformed him into Iran ’s preeminent investigative journalist .
A champion of secular , liberal democracy , Ganji left Iran after his release from prison in 2006 .

Hina Jilani in 2007 .
Uzbekistan
Yusuf Jumaev : Jumaev is a well - known Uzbek poet who was arrested on charges of “ insult ” and “ resisting arrest ” after he called for President Islam Karimov ’s resignation before the December 2007 presidential election .
He was sentenced to five years in prison and has already faced torture by prison guards .
Originally held in a minimum - security facility , he was transferred to the notorious Jaslyk Prison in July 2008 .
Kazakhstan
Yevgeny Zhovtis :
The founding director of the Kazakhstan International Bureau for Human Rights and the Rule of Law , Zhovtis has fervently advocated for freedom of religion and assembly , as well as democratic reform .
He was convicted of manslaughter in September in what international observers saw as a farcical trial :
His lawyer was not permitted to enter any evidence or call witnesses to testify on Zhovtis ’s behalf .
He was sentenced to four years in prison .
Pakistan
Hina Jilani : Jilani and her sister Asma Jahangir have been warriors for human rights in Pakistan since the 1980s when they were arrested for protesting gender - discriminatory legislation .
Jilani , an advocate of the Supreme Court of Pakistan , has warned that a return to military rule could start a process of Balkanization in Pakistan .
During her career , she has held numerous positions with international organizations and served as the U.N. secretary - general ’s special representative on the situation of human rights defenders from 2000 to 2008 .

Poster of Liu Xiaobo , 2010 .
China
Liu Xiaobo :
One of the most famous Chinese human rights activists , Liu began his dissent when , after spending much of the 1980s lecturing at Beijing Normal University , he participated in the march on Tiananmen Square .
Liu was punished with a 21 - month prison sentence for that first offense .
More recently , in December 2008 , Liu signed Charter 08 , a democratic manifesto that China ’s liberal intelligentsia was preparing to submit to the government in Beijing .
Two days before the manifesto ’s Dec. 10 release — selected to coincide with the 60th anniversary of the U.N. Universal Declaration of Human Rights — Chinese police detained and later arrested Liu on suspicion of “ inciting subversion of state power . ”
A Chinese court convicted him and laid down an 11 - year prison sentence on Christmas Day , 2008 .
Gao Zhisheng : The New York Times recently described Gao as “ one of China ’s most high - profile human rights lawyers ” — a surprising appellation for someone China ’s Justice Ministry had honored just nine years earlier as one of the country ’s 10 best lawyers .
In the decade since that pronouncement , Gao has defended many prominent human rights activists in court .
Such activities soon earned him the ire of the Chinese government , which took to harassing him with the same vigor it had previously reserved for his clients .
In 2006 , Gao evaded what Amnesty International believes to have been a government - sponsored assassination attempt .
After the botched hit , the Chinese police repeatedly detained and arrested Gao until February 2009 , when he disappeared .
Gao resurfaced recently , but seemed a broken man .
In an interview this month , he announced that he would be abandoning any future political activity .
Others of note : Hu Jia , a Beijing - based writer whose criticism of Chinese human rights abuses , detailed in “ The Real China and the Olympics , ” earned him a 3 ½ year prison sentence in April 2009 ; Dhondup Wangchen , a Tibetan filmmaker who was arrested in March 2008 ; and Tan Zuoren , a writer whom Beijing arrested and sentenced to five years in prison for attempting to conduct an independent investigation into the collapse of poorly built government schools during the 2008 Sichuan earthquake .

Burma
Aung San Suu Kyi :
Few global dissidents are as well known as Aung San Suu Kyi , a Nobel Peace Prize recipient whose long and storied career as a democratic activist in Burma has inspired thousands to support her in solidarity .
After participating in a massive street protest of students against the dictatorship on Aug. 8 , 1988 , Aung San Suu Kyi went on to found Burma ’s National League for Democracy ( NLD ) party , which won the 1990 general election with 82 percent of the vote .
Before Aung San Suu Kyi could assume the premiership , however , the Burmese junta nullified the election results and placed her under house arrest , where she has more or less been ever since .
Recently , Aung San Suu Kyi and other senior NLD leaders decided to boycott the first round of Burma ’s general election — the first to be held in decades — citing an unjust electoral process .
Paw Oo Tun : Popularly known as , Min Ko Naing , a nom de guerre meaning “ conqueror of kings , ” Paw Oo Tun is one of Burma ’s longest - fighting dissidents .
He rose to prominence in 1988 when he founded the All Burma Federation of Student Unions , a Burmese student group dedicated to the overthrow of the military junta .
That same year , Paw Oo Tun was jailed for 15 years after being arrested by Burmese police for participating in the 1988 uprising .
Three years after his 2004 release , Paw was again arrested for politically subversive activities .
This time , however , he received a sentence of 65 years in solitary confinement .
He is serving out his sentence in Shan state ’s Kengtung prison .
Afghanistan
Sima Samar : A physician by training — and the first ethnically Hazara woman to become one — Samar has been a tireless champion of women ’s rights and women ’s health for the last quarter - century .
After her husband was arrested by the Afghan communist regime in 1984 , Samar fled to Pakistan , where she founded the Shuhada Organization , an NGO that works to increase Afghan women ’s access to health care and improve the state of medical knowledge in Afghanistan .
Despite receiving death threats from the Taliban , she returned to Afghanistan in 2002 as the minister for women ’s affairs .
Unfortunately , her time in that post was short - lived ; she was forced to resign after her liberal gender policies were met with resistance from her conservative male colleagues .
Currently , Samar chairs the Afghanistan Independent Human Rights Commission , where she continues to work on women ’s as well as more general human rights issues .

Anwar Ibrahim in 2009 .
Zimbabwe
Arnold Tsunga : Despite constant harassment from the police , which has included multiple kidnappings and beatings , Tsunga has made a career fighting against the regime of Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe .
A highly respected lawyer and human rights advocate , Tsunga formerly served as the executive director of the Zimbabwe Lawyers for Human Rights , an NGO that seeks to ensure free and fair elections , freedom of speech , and the protection of constitutionally enshrined rights in Zimbabwe .
He serves as a trustee for Voice of the People , a broadcasting trust that seeks to expose government corruption and illegal activity , and also heads the International Commission of Jurists ’ Africa program .
Singapore
Gopalan Nair : Nair , a former opposition politician , is known throughout Singapore ’s embattled blogosphere for his fierce promotion of human rights and blunt criticism of founding leader and current “ minister mentor ” Lee Kuan Yew .
In September 2008 , Nair was sentenced to three months in jail for defaming a judge in a blog entry .
On March 6 , he published a hoax post on his blog indicating that Lee had suffered a heart attack and had been brought to Singapore General Hospital .
Nair ’s motive ?
It was , he says , “ a deliberate attempt to highlight how tenuous Singapore really is , with all power in the island vested in one man , and the dire consequences to the island of his parting .
And especially so as [ Lee ] is 87 . ”
Nair lives in California and has been a U.S. citizen since 2004 .
Malaysia
Anwar Ibrahim : Anwar is one of the country ’s most famous and controversial politicians .
Once a protégé of former Prime Minister Mahathir bin Mohamad , the two had a falling out in the late 1990s , and Anwar emerged as leader of the Malaysian opposition .
In this capacity , he has continuously pressed the Malaysian government to become more democratic and combat corruption .
Throughout the past decade , Anwar has pushed for improvements in governance - related issues , especially the need for a more independent judiciary .
In 1998 and again in 2008 , Anwar was arrested and charged with what are widely seen as bogus sodomy crimes invented by the government to silence him .
( Check out FP ‘s 2008 interview with Anwar . )
Zainah Anwar : Zainah has gained fame in Malaysia for her leadership of NGOs focused on promoting women ’s rights .
The daughter of Anwar bin Abdul Malik , a well - known Malaysian politician , she rose to prominence in 1990s when she assumed the leadership of Sisters in Islam , a Malaysian organization of Muslim women that promotes women ’s rights under sharia .
Although she has since relinquished that role , she continues to work to expand women ’s rights in Islamic society by speaking out around the world .

Yoani Sánchez in 2008 .
Cuba
Yoani Sánchez : Born in Havana in 1975 , Sánchez is best known for Generación Y , a blog she writes about daily life under the political oppression of the Cuban government .
She evades the censorship of Raúl Castro ’s government by emailing her entries to friends and associates outside the country , who then post them online .
Although Sánchez has suffered harassment and intimidation by the Cuban government — she described a 2009 episode in which she claims to have been abducted and beaten by government thugs — she nevertheless continues to write , drawing attention to the political plight of Cubans living under the Castro regime .
Peru
Francisco Soberón : Soberón is most famous in Peru for his 1985 founding of the Asociación Pro Derechos Humanos , a human rights NGO headquartered in Lima .
The organization ’s initial purpose was to curb abuses by the Peruvian military and various insurgent groups during the country ’s civil war .
Today , it has embraced the broader agenda of improving Peru ’s judicial system and improving the poor ’s knowledge of their rights .
In 2008 , Soberón accused President Alan García ’s government of manipulating public opinion by denouncing organizations as diverse as labor unions and environmental NGOs as terrorist groups in an effort to stigmatize them and muffle dissent .
García has n’t taken such accusations lightly , calling Soberón a traitor , according to Reuters .
Guatemala
Frank La Rue :
The founder of one of Guatemala ’s first human rights NGOs , the Center for Legal Action on Human Rights ( CALDH ) , La Rue is among Guatemala ’s most impassioned human rights activists .
La Rue and CALDH provide technical legal advice to the many Guatemalan communities that brought cases in 2001 against former presidents Gen. Romeo Lucas García and Gen. Efraín Ríos Montt , both of whom were implicitly found guilty of committing genocide by Guatemala ’s Historical Clarification Commission .

Guillermo Zuloaga in 2009 .
Venezuela
Guillermo Zuloaga : Zuloaga , owner of Globovisión , one the few independent television news stations still operating in Venezuela , has long been known as a vocal critic of President Hugo Chávez and his authoritarian tendencies .
Since 2002 , when Zuloaga refused to show images of pro-Chávez demonstrators protesting against Pedro Carmona ’s short - lived coup ( Chávez retook power two days later ) , tension between Zuloaga and Chávez has been palpable .
Zuloaga ’s station regularly reports on government corruption and attempts to clamp down on media freedom .
In return , government regulatory agencies have repeatedly filed complaints against Globovisión .
On March 25 , Chávez took the extraordinary step of ordering military intelligence officials to arrest Zuloaga .
He has since been freed , but remains unable to leave the country until an investigation into critical remarks he made about Chávez ’s attempts to stifle media freedom have concluded .
Belarus
Iryna Vidanava : Some former Soviet republics have made modest strides in liberalizing their political culture , but Belarus is not one of them .
Minsk is infamous for its harassment and intimidation of local media and curtailing freedom of speech — both areas in which Vidanava has fought back forcefully .
Vidanava is the founder and editor in chief of 34 Multimedia Magazine , a publication aimed at promoting creativity , dissent , and democratic values in Belarusian young adults .
( See here for a sample of her work . )
It ’s tough going : After years of police harassment , in 2005 Minsk finally decided to simply shut down 34 Multimedia Magazine .
Yet Vidanava perseveres .
In 2007 , she founded CDMAG , a multimedia youth magazine published on compact disc that won the 2007 Gerd Bucerius Prize for press freedom in Eastern Europe .
Vietnam
Le Cong Dinh : Vietnamese lawyer
Dinh has spent much of the past decade running a private law practice and defending prominent Vietnamese political dissidents and humans rights activists .
His clients have included other human rights lawyers , such as Nguyen Van Dai and Le Thi Cong Nhan , as well as dissident journalists like blogger Nguyen Van Hai .
In 2007 , Dinh landed himself in hot water with the Vietnamese authorities when he argued before a court that Article 88 of the Vietnamese penal code — which effectively criminalizes peaceful political dissent and allows state prosecutors to charge dissidents with “ conducting propaganda against the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam ” — was unconstitutional and violated international human rights treaties .
Ironically , it was this very provision of the penal code that the Vietnamese government used in 2009 to arrest , try , and convict Dinh , who is now serving a five - year prison sentence .

J.S. Tissainayagam in 2009 .
Indonesia
Kamala Chandrakirana :
In 1998 , Chandrakirana set up the National Commission on Violence Against Women , an NGO meant to improve women ’s status in Indonesian society .
She has since founded the Indonesian Working Group for the Eradication of Structural Poverty as well as JARI Indonesia , an NGO that fights government graft .
Sri Lanka
J.S. Tissainayagam :
This provocative Sri Lankan journalist has been an active critic of his government ’s policy toward Tamil citizens , arousing considerable domestic controversy .
After publishing a pair of articles in 2006 that accused the Sri Lankan government of withholding food and other critical supplies from endangered Tamil populations , Tissainayagam was arrested in March 2008 and charged with attempting to incite violence and accepting funding from the Tamil Tigers , a separatist insurgent group later put down by a no-holds - barred military offensive in 2009 .
Last August , Tissainayagam was convicted and sentenced to 20 years in jail , but after filing an appeal , he was released on bail in January .
Tissainayagam was pardoned just last week , though its unknown what restrictions remain on his freedom of speech and movement .
Eritrea
Mesfin Hagos : First a member of the Eritrean Liberation Front and later a founding member of the Eritrean People ’s Liberation Front , Hagos has played a major role in Eritrean politics for much of the second half of the 20th century .
Hagos was a close friend and political ally of President Isaias Afewerki for a time , but the two had a falling out in 2001 when Hagos joined G - 15 , an Eritrean political group vocally opposed to Afewerki ’s postponing of elections , disregard for the Eritrean Constitution , and handling of the Eritrean - Ethiopian War .
In response to threats of arrest against G - 15 members , Hagos fled Eritrea and currently lives in exile in Britain , where he remains an active member of the opposition in exile .

Pas touche à leur Johnny national ... ni à son dossier médical .
A l’intiative de l'élue ( UMP ) des Alpes- maritimes , Muriel Marland - Militello , 25 députés , tous de la majorité présidentielle , ont adressé une lettre ouverte au directeur de la rédaction de L’Express , Christophe Barbier , pour se plaindre de la divulgation par l’hebdomadaire d’éléments sur la santé du chanteur issus du document de la clinique californienne où il a été hospitalisé en décembre .
Barbier , qui leur a répondu , rappelle que le principe du secret médical ne s’applique pas aux journalistes , chargés , eux , cite - t - il , de « lever le voile » sur les faits , selon l’expression de Françoise Giroud .
« Nous , parlementaires français , souhaitons vous faire part de notre indignation » , commencent - ils , jugeant le scoop de L’Express ( dans son édition du 26 mai ) , « contraire à » leur conception « du métier de journaliste » .
« Dérive inacceptable »
Le petit groupe de députés , brandissant le « respect du secret médical et de la vie privée dans les médias » , s’élève contre ce qu’ils qualifient de « dérive inacceptable dont le seul but est de faire du sensationnalisme aux dépens de l’intimité de la vie privée » .
« Nous sommes choqués que des personnes du corps médical aient pu trahir ce secret professionnel » , poursuivent - ils .
Avant de sermonner Barbier : « Comment voulez - vous que , nous , parlementaires , puissions , au quotidien , défendre et promouvoir la presse et la liberté de la presse si certains titres ayant pourtant pignon sur rue s’abaissent à ce genre de procédés ? »
Ils exigent , en conclusion , du directeur de la rédaction du magazine « une prise de position claire et officielle » .
Le dossier médical d'Hallyday à la clinique Cedars - Sinai de Los Angeles confirmait deux points : l’alcoolisation du chanteur à l’origine de sa mise en coma artificiel , et l’existence d’une infection postopératoire qui aurait pu être grave .
« La recherche de la vérité »
« Le secret médical , très important , concerne les membres des professions médicales , engagés par leur serment .
Journalistes , nous relevons d’une déontologie qui a pour fondement la recherche de la vérité , par - delà toutes les tentations pour l’escamoter , à chaque fois que l’intérêt de nos lecteurs nous semble justifier cette quête » , réplique Barbier dans un courrier publié en réponse sur le site lexpress .fr .
Il rappelle le contexte de l’hospitalisation du chanteur , selon lui , «une exceptionnelle opération de communication de la part de son entourage , à une bataille autour d’évidents intérêts financiers et une série d’accusations et de contre - attaques entre un proche de l’artiste et le chirurgien qui l’avait opéré » .
Allusion à la bataille judiciaire qui oppose Hallyday au Dr Stéphane Delajoux , qui avait mené son opération de la hernie discale .
« Ne pas contribuer à révéler la vérité sur ce qui s’est passé à l’hôpital Cedars Sinaï reviendrait à ê tre complice de ces manoeuvres » , estime Barbier .
Hi all ,
The darcs team would like to announce the immediate availability of darcs 2.4.4 .

February 27 , 2010 - The darcs team is proud to announce the immediate availability of darcs 2.4. darcs 2.4 contains many improvements and bugfixes compared to darcs 2.3.1 .
Highlights are the faster operation of record , revert and related commands , and the experimental interactive hunk editing .
The easiest way to install darcs is using the Haskell Platform 1 .
If you have installed the Haskell Platform or cabal - install , you can install this beta release by doing :
$ cabal update $ cabal install -- reinstall darcs
Alternatively , you can download the tarball from http://darcs.net/releases/darcs-2.4.tar.gz, and build it by hand as explained in the README file .
To try out interactive hunk editing , press ‘ e ’ when you are prompted with a hunk patch by ‘ darcs record ’ .
You will then be shown an editor screen in which you can edit the state you want to record between the last two ruler lines .
You can find more information about the hunk editing feature on the hunk editor wiki page .
darcs in its current form does not perform very well on huge repositories .
In order to systematically address this issue , and to catch performance regressions , we have started a darcs benchmarking project .
You can find benchmarks of darcs performance in many different situations on the benchmarks wiki page .
On this other wiki page , you will find graphs of the benchmark results on a Windows Vista machine .
On that page , you will also find instructions on how to run your own darcs benchmarks .
If you have an issue with darcs 2.4 , you can report it via the web on http://bugs.darcs.net/ .
You can also report bugs by email to bugs@darcs.net .

MADMIKESAMERICA HOMEPAGE
When I was young I tinkered with radios , record players and just about anything I cold take apart .
I even started an electronics club at school , persuading a teacher to campaign with the faculty to buy some basic components and soldering irons .
Our school had a single BBC computer between 1000 pupils which I managed to view from a distance .
When I first went to technical college after school , we spent a year theorising , flowcharting & programming computers without actually using one .
The net effect of this was I became disillusioned with computing , my school boy dream of becoming a robotisist was more or less scuppered by lack of hands on experience , in short I lost my way .
Later I revived my interest at a second college in London , it was very hands on affair with electronics .
We built stuff like bistable and astables from scratch and programmed a microprocessor ( 6502 ) motherboard using a hex keypad and 7 segment LED displays .
After this I attended university , focusing on Electronics Systems Engineering which was electronics with computing ( analog and digital ) .
We did things like analog control systems using analog computing blocks to create PID based control systems .
One example I remember fondly machine having a dial that controlled via a motor another replica dial , the object was to get the replica dial to follow the movements you initiated on the control dial .
This kind of problem sounds simple until you actually try to do it – Thats when you learn about dynamics , thats when engineering control and real world reveal themselves via experimentation .
You take those tools that you learnt in Maths class and actually apply them to physically controlling something , its a real eye opener .
Once you have been there its difficult to get the same satisfaction from any theory or algorithm .
Doing stuff that has physical results is deeply satisfying and incredibly rewarding .
Fast forward to today with the rise of making and hacking , I think this is why folks like to tinker and to hack , its simultaneously a creative , physical and educational exercise using 3 crucial parts of the brain .
Adding opensource to the hardware equation engages a 4th part of the brain – social and community interaction , these in turn feedback , amplify and reinforce those creative juices .
In the earlier days of computing we tinkered and hacked a great deal both with the software and the hardware innards of computers .
Eventually Apple and motorola , Intel and Microsoft came along and began their long journey of unification of computing singularity .
As these companies pushed forward in their singular directions the other ideas and tinkering of computing fell away replaced instead by prescribed de-facto standardisation and convenient monoculture .
I think we lost a great deal on that journey , the train was moving so fast that alternative concepts were simply passed like passenger - less stations on an express line .
so keen were the drivers of these corporations to increase their revenue , that little thought was given to the question of whether it was the right direction or not , we were launched headlong into obscurity , conform or be dammed .
I think now however we are coming to the pinnacle of that ignorance , the train is slowing and the wheels are starting to rattle loose , the energy providing the locomotion is no longer sufficient to provide acceleration , rather we are now experiencing deceleration .
But this is n’t a train wreck its more a darwinian , a fork in computing evolution that leads to a thousand dead ends , some of which will take years maybe decades to fizzle out .
The latest greatest example of this is the iPad a minor fork of a struggling branch , one of the latter attempts to reinvent this evolutionary cul - de-sac .
At the same time the iPad reveals how this once firm evolutionary trunk is beginning to bifurcate , take at look at its innards to reveal ARM based processing from what was an embedded microprocessor IP company , very different from the end to end design and manufacture of Intel and motorola .
yet the iPad is the ultimate in this same trunk of evolution , an inevitable device hatched to be used as an instrument of consumption .
This is not a computer with which you hack or tinker , it is not a device for which you are expected to create , this is a consumption gateway to its vendor , the pinnacle of our computing evolution .
This is what our best minds can come up with , a hands off , narrowly purposed sleek design , disguising the fact that underneath it is just pretty cash register for its manufacturer Apple .
Pretty soon the rest of the herd will follow in their footsteps placing the final nails in the coffin of this popular computing evolution .
Obviously I am little sad to see it decay in this manner , but I am not surprised , it was inevitable , driven by a selfish 20th century industrial strategy , the result of a economic foundation whose days are numbered .
But surely I hear you say “ it has been huge success , look a the proliferation of personal computers , look at how little they cost , look at the bang for buck you get from these prolific PCs . ”
It is true , if population is a measure of success , then they are very successful .
However throughout its ascent I have often wondered about those ideas that have fallen by the wayside , all of those missed opportunities , the many diverse possibilities that could have taken us down different roads .
Maybe just maybe things may have turned out much more different even more successful and much more diverse .
For example if we had taken a more concurrent approach to computing from both a hardware and software perspective rather than being blindly led by Intel ’s clock race we might have ended up with a more evolutionary successful class of computing .
Something much more robust than the current crop of high end PCs and servers , something more creative and enabling than the iPad .
But these are just whimsical what ifs , we cannot change the past , what is done is done .
But we can invent our own brighter innovative future .
This is a good time to reinvent a better more flexible computing , one not tied to clock races , corporate profits and monocultures , rather something more radical , computing that can effectively reinvent , reconfigure and replicate itself on the fly .
Computing that is designed with real world concurrency , responsive , reactive and parallel like the real world , something not hampered by 20th century sequential thinking , a new computing of real and the physical rather than a virtual one .
More importantly I want computing I can tinker and experiment with , something not confined to repetitive recipes , but one with infinitely combinational components with which I can assemble new ideas .
Computing that connects to physical as well as virtual , computing which enables the internet of things , computing that enables me to make new things .
Most of all I want creative , intelligent computing not stupid consumptive computing , I want 21st century computing for everybody and everything and all the things I cannot even envisage yet and I want it open completely open from the bottom up this time .
Who is with me for a better , brighter and more innovative future ..

Do n’t let your seemingly vast experience as an inhabitant of this world fool you .
It ’s easy to be lulled into a false sense of self - importance .
Let me explain .
You likely live in a house or apartment on a street , and in a community that ’s part of some town , maybe even some major urban area .
Your community is likely part of a much larger state or province of one of the nations of Earth — which are themselves nothing more than imaginary constructs of human society .
Your country is also likely assigned to one of the continental masses whose sum total of land area is just 29 % of the planet ’s surface .
You are small and the Earth is seemingly vast , as if we humans to Earth are just so many micro-organisms scurrying about each day ( each rotation of Earth ) , and following rules of social engagement that often defy logic .
It ’s a story that at a most fundamental level defines your address .
It may be all the address you need to ship a package to your friend across the ocean .
But it wo n’t cut it with the intergalactic post office .
As I said , do n’t let your experience and perception fool you .
It ’s the rest of the address of which most Earthlings are unaware .
For so many reasons it ’s also the most important part of the address .
This seemingly vast Earth is but a tiny planet .
( By comparison , over 1,000 Earths fit inside Jupiter . )
Earth is one of eight planets orbiting the Sun — a tiny star by star standards — as part of a planetary System called the Solar System .
The Sun resides in the Solar Neighborhood of stars , a small smattering of stars found in the Orion Spur — a nondescript little corner of the Milky Way galaxy .
The Milky Way is a vast city of stars , with enough stars to give 50 to every human on Earth .
Right now , you , your family , and the rest of your race are orbiting just one of those stars .
The Milky Way is one of two large galaxies in the Local Group of 25 - 30 galaxies .
The other large one , Andromeda , is on a collision course with ours .
And the cosmic debris - field that is the Local Group of galaxies resides not too far cosmically speaking from the Virgo Cluster of 1,300 to 2,000 galaxies .
The Local Group and Virgo Cluster are just two of the 100 to 200 or so groups and clusters of galaxies making up the Local Supercluster of more than 50,000 galaxies .
The Local Supercluster — a small supercluster — is one of MILLIONS of superclusters that are woven together to form the largest structures ever seen — Galactic Filaments .
And all this comprises the Observable Universe — what we believe is a remarkably insignificant portion of the Universe that nature , by law , allows us to see .
Beyond what is observable , the Universe may truly be infinite .
So using myself to summarize —
I live in a house on a street in a town in the State of Maryland , just outside of Washington , DC , in the USA , in North America , on Earth , in the Solar System , in the Solar Neighborhood , in the Orion Spur of the Milky Way Galaxy , in the Local Group of Galaxies , near the Virgo Cluster of galaxies , in the Local Supercluster of galaxies in the tiny corner of the Universe we like to call the Observable Universe .
That is our address .
It makes the often human perception of our reality as the center of cosmic activity …. just laughable .
You always know the most about your own neighborhood .
But that also leads you to conclude your neighborhood is somehow important .
In truth , it is only important because YOU live there .
And YOU obviously think YOU are important .
So please think about this … for vast numbers of humans , our perception , our daily life , is driven by self - importance , a remarkable lack of humility , ignorance of — even disinterest in — a greater context of existence which our machines of exploration have brought into crisp focus , and for many , a sense that embracing God is the righteous and comforting thing to do — but does not require taking time to look at the majesty beyond Earth .
And while we burn precious , non-renewable calories watching “ reality ” television , following the lives of the rich and famous , acquiring lots of things , deciding which of us is better or more deserving or more moral , and buying into the distorted views of what our societies have our children embrace as heroes and role models , our world — the spaceship that affords us the view of majesty — is coming under attack .
The microbes called human kill one another because each group , each ( bacterial ) culture , thinks they are more important than the other .
It is self - importance taken to the extreme .
Their self - serving technology is modifying the environment of the planet , not only threatening their existence for generations to come ( how do they do that to their children ? ) , but puts at grave risk countless species that do n’t have the gift of recognizing the majesty of the cosmos .
Is n’t it ironic that the only species on Earth that does possess the gifts of intelligence and tool - making , does not collectively care about its world , and collectively squanders these gifts ?
So watch the movie above , taken by the MESSENGER spacecraft as it flew by in 2005 .
Watch as the Earth recedes into the cold , black void of space .
Imagine the nearly 7 billion humans scurrying around on its surface .
How many of them recognize that the remarkable spaceship they are on is NOT owned by them ?
It never was .
But because of their technology , they are now , by natural decree , stewards of this spaceship for good or ill .
Do they understand their responsibilities to the spaceship , to all its occupants , and to themselves ?
For if this tiny blue world is laid to waste , the geologic Age of Self - Importance will be over , the rest of the Universe will surely not care … and I fear God will not come to the rescue .
A penny for your thoughts …..

The old reptilian brain is the snake ; it is the brain of the instinctive , the unconscious , the depository of millions of years of evolution .
The second brain is the limbic ring , the mammalian brain of “ fight or flight , ” of emotion and a highly developed olfactory sense as a way of perceiving the environment .
This limbic ring is the nest of the bird , the phoenix or quetzal .
The third brain , the neo-cortex , is the bird , the creature of the higher realms of thought .
The twin hemispheres of this brain are the two wings at the top of the cadaceus , the sign we still see today as an emblem of the medical profession .
Now the reason these three brains are symbolically emphasized in various esoteric schools of religion is that as soon as one moves out of the conventional life of society into the mysteries of the temple , he or she undergoes a spiritual evolution in which the evolution of the nervous system is re-experienced in a form of recapitulation .
When consciousness is focused with unwavering attention , the body responds .
In the first stage of tantric practice , the instinctive life is energized and one feels an enormous amount of physical and sexual vitality .
During this stage of earthly energizing , the practitioner is counseled not to identify with or act out of these sexual energies .
Celibacy is the rule .
If the rule is followed , and if the contemplative practice is continued , then the serpent begins to climb the tree of the spinal column .
In this second stage , the second brain , the mammalian brain , is energized .
It is a time of raw emotion and ancient senses .
One ’s passions begin to be wildly intense , fits of crying take one over without obvious cause .
Long buried and repressed childhood emotions explode to the surface , and the sense of smell begins to challenge the supremacy of sight as a way of interpreting the world .
One begins to smell “ auras ” rather than see them .
One begins to know and respond to people instantly , the way a dog would : lovingly wagging one ’s tail at this stranger or barking angrily at another .
And at this stage , too , the student is counseled not to identify with or act out of what he is feeling .
it is a dangerous time , for the physical and psychic energies can make the individual appear to be quite charismatic , but if the individual involves others in his shifting and unstable fantasy life , then great confusion and suffering can be experienced by more people than simply the student .
Jonestown is one of the more extreme examples of the dangers of this second stage .
The third stage is the stage of the bird .
In the place where three brains come together , “ the place where three roads cross , ” is the place of integration , the traditional “ third eye . ”
“ For the eye is the light of the body , and if thine eye be single , then is thy whole body filled with light . ” ( Matthew 6:22 ) After years of focused concentration and visualization practices , the third eye opens and the student shifts upward from a physical body to a body of light .
The mode of thought shifts from a linear one of sequential words and thoughts to a hieroglyphic one of multi-dimensional geometrical figures or crystals that are at once musical and mathematical forms : it is as if two Bach fugues were being played at right angles to one another .
Plato ’s world of form and Sufi angelology begin to take on a whole new level of reality .
Now , just as there is a shadow side to the second stage , a stage that is caricatured in Jonestown , so is there a shadow side to this third stage .
The shadow form could be called “ paranoid - schizophrenic cosmic synthesis . ”
The hieroglyphic mode of thought is isomorphic to , but not identical with , “ schizophrenic word - salad . ”
In these psychotic cases certain traumatic experiences have crushed the ego , and the being is rawly exposed to altered states of consciousness without any yogic training whatsoever .
In other cases , through drugs or moments of evanescent artistic rapture , the individual slips momentarily into another mode of thought .
Shakespeare long ago noticed that “ the lunatic , the lover and the poet are of imagination , all compact . ”
But the difference that makes a difference between the yogi and the lunatic is that the lunatic is in a condition of acute agony , suffering and existential terror , whereas the other is in a condition of stable , balanced and creative joy .
The paranoid organizes his entire universe around his central dread ; his chaos is transformed into one gigantic coherent , and cosmic conspiracy .
He , and only he , has discovered “ the secret . ”
And here too is another aspect of the shadow form of the third stage : the cosmic inflation of the ego .
A contemplative in a monastery or esoteric school knows that he or she is simply one of a long line of contemplative practitioners , stretching back from the present into the mists of prehistory .
And if the monk or nun begins to get a little overenthusiastic about his divine mission in life , the abbot is there to remind him or her to sweep the floor and clean the toilets .
Ultimately , the third stage must be a return to the first .

AT THE end of December 2008 Israel unleashed “ Operation Cast Lead ” , its bombing campaign against Gaza .
Its aim was to counter rocket attacks on Israel by Hamas , which controls Gaza .
Three weeks later some 1,400 Palestinians had died .
“ I personally warned Ehud Barak [ Israel 's defence minister ] that we would react very seriously if Israel did anything in Gaza , ” recalls Ali Babacan , then Turkish foreign minister and now deputy prime minister .
The Gaza war proved to be a turning point in Turkey 's relations with Israel .
A day before Israel attacked , Turkish intermediaries felt they were on the verge of clinching a peace deal between Israel and Syria .
“ The Israelis misled us , ” fumes a Turkish diplomat .
Turkey 's fury became public soon afterwards , when Recep Tayyip Erdogan , the prime minister , stormed off a panel he was sharing with the Israeli president , Shimon Peres , at the Davos World Economic Forum .
“ You Israelis know how to kill , ” he shouted .
In Turkish eyes Israel proved Mr Erdogan right on May 31st when its commandos raided the Mavi Marmara , a Turkish ship leading a civilian flotilla trying to carry aid to Gaza past Israel 's blockade .
Nine Turks were killed in the attack .
Israel claims it acted in self - defence .
It also accuses the organiser of the flotilla , a Turkish charity known as IHH , of being a front for global jihadists .
Turkey denies this and has called for a public apology from Israel and a UN - led investigation .
Unless Israel agrees , the Turks may sever diplomatic ties altogether .
Some Western countries attribute the apparent eastward realignment of Turkish foreign policy in recent years to the Islamist roots of Mr Erdogan 's ruling Justice and Development ( AK ) party .
This week 's Turkish vote in the UN Security Council against sanctions on Iran for its nuclear programme has reinforced this view .
Some fear the West has “ lost ” Turkey ( a view echoed this week by Robert Gates , the American defence secretary , who blamed the European Union for not doing more to encourage Turkish membership ) .
The Mavi Marmara incident is seen as further proof of such a Turkish shift .
Critics claim
Turkey could have done more to stop the flotilla .
Turkey 's protests that it could not interfere with an initiative of a non-governmental organisation ring hollow .
The authorities have often cited “ security concerns ” to stop Kurdish campaigners ( and Turkish troops harass stone - throwing Kurdish youths as much as the Israelis do Palestinians ) .
As for AK 's claims that it was not involved , what about the presence of Murat Mercan , an AK deputy , on board an earlier land convoy to Gaza ?
For the past 90 years Turkey has in fact neglected the Arab lands of the former Ottoman empire and focused on the West .
Turkey concentrated on joining NATO , which it achieved in 1952 , and , more recently , trying to get into the EU .
This is why Turkey forged such strong ties with Israel .
For the secular Turkish elite , friendship with the Jewish state was an antidote to Islamist radicalism .
Security ties with Israel , crowned by a military co-operation agreement , also proved useful in Turkey 's fight against Kurdish PKK militants .
Squeezed between Turkey and Israel , Syria had to boot out the PKK leader , Abdullah Ocalan , who now languishes in a Turkish jail .
Turkish foreign policy may be becoming more assertive , yet EU membership remains the priority .
Mr Erdogan secured the opening of membership talks in October 2005 , and they continue , if fitfully .
The AK government has done more than all its predecessors to reform Turkey .
As EU - inspired reforms kick in , Turkey 's meddlesome generals have come to matter less .
And in place of the old Turkish complaint about living in a bad neighbourhood has come a new policy of “ zero problems with the neighbours ” , masterminded by the foreign minister , Ahmet Davutoglu .
Mr Davutoglu likes to insist that this policy chimes perfectly with Western goals .
This is clearly true in Iraq .
America and Turkey both want the place to remain stable as American troops begin to pull out .
Mr Davutoglu has played a key role ( and , incidentally , blunted Iranian influence ) in forging alliances between Shia and Sunni factions .
He has also courted Turkey 's former foes , the Iraqi Kurds .
Elsewhere , however , Turkey is at odds with America , and not only over Israel .
Iran was a sore point even before this week 's UN vote .
Turkey depends heavily on Iranian gas , and fears that any conflict with Iran might ripple widely .
“ We are no longer puppets , ” declares Mehmet Simsek , Turkey 's finance minister .
Better relations with neighbours have opened up markets for Turkish goods .
A strong economy amid the global financial crisis ( the OECD reckons GDP will grow by almost 7 % this year ) underpins a new confidence .
There is another element to Turkey 's new foreign policy .
Apparent rejection by the EU and the American occupation of Iraq have left Turks in a resentful mood .
Mr Erdogan is wary of providing ammunition to Turkey 's ( admittedly marginal ) Islamist radicals by appearing to pander further to the West .
Indeed , Mr Erdogan 's fierce anti-Israeli rhetoric may be partly calculated to counter the appeal of Saadet , an overtly Islamist party that accuses AK of “ enriching ” its members at the expense of “ the cause . ”
On Israel , though , the government may have gone too far .
Even Fethullah Gulen , Turkey 's most influential Muslim cleric , has lambasted the flotilla organisers .
Mr Erdogan 's fiery support for Hamas and his salvos against Israeli “ state terrorism ” may encourage the radicals rather than appease them .
During the recent protests against Israel some demonstrators brandished posters of Hitler , which hardly makes Turkey seem an attractive prospect for the EU .
What next ?
For all its bluster , the government seems reluctant to sink relations with Israel altogether .
A UN - sponsored commission on the flotilla incident could perhaps buy time ( see article ) .
Mr Babacan argues that relations with Israel will “ never be the same ” .
Yet the cost to Turkey of cutting ties with Israel would be high .
Many Western diplomats argue that it was a mistake for the Turks to get so closely involved in efforts to lift Israel 's blockade of Gaza .
It may go down well in the Arab street , where Mr Erdogan is now a hero , but Turkey is not about to be able to solve the Israel - Palestine problem on its own .
The prevailing wisdom in AK is that its activism in the region makes it more valuable to the EU .
As for America , the hope is that because it needs Turkey in Iraq and Afghanistan , it will put up with a spot of bother .
Israel and Iran will severely test these theories .
AUSTIN – Gov. Rick Perry 's close friend and former chief of staff tried to help Green Party candidates get on the general election ballot this fall as part of a larger effort by outside groups that state District Judge John Dietz declared “ an unauthorized , illegal contribution ” Thursday .
The judge granted the Democratic Party a temporary restraining order to block Green Party candidates from being certified for the November ballot .
Democrats contended that a petition drive to put Green candidates on the ballot was actually an effort to help Perry , a Republican , by diverting votes from his Democratic challenger Bill White .
The Green Party , represented by former Republican state Supreme Court Justice Stephen Smith , plans to appeal to the high court on Monday .
It had struggled earlier to get the required 43,991 petition signatures for its candidates to make the ballot .
At a hearing Thursday , Green Party member Garrett Mize testified that Perry 's former chief of staff , Mike Toomey , paid him about $ 12,000 to convince his party to use out - of - state contributions to help the petition drive .
More for you News Green Party petitions stir up smelly dispute
The Dallas Morning News reported this month that the petition drive cost $ 532,000 and was paid for by an out - of - state corporation with GOP ties .
Democrats said Republican leaders apparently wanted to help Green Party candidates get on the ballot because they normally drain support from Democrats .
“ Mike Toomey 's involvement in this deal is a watershed today , ” said Chad Dunn , a lawyer for the Texas Democratic Party .
“ Rick Perry needs to answer questions about what he knew and when he knew it . ”
Perry campaign spokesman Mark Miner said , “ Our campaign had nothing to do with the Green Party . ”
Toomey and Perry were close friends during their days in the state Legislature a quarter century ago .
Toomey later postponed his lobbying career to lead Perry 's gubernatorial staff from 2002 - 2004 .
Toomey also served as Gov. Bill Clements ' chief of staff in the late 1980s , making him the only person in state history to serve in that capacity for two governors .
Toomey did not return a message left on his cell phone .
Dietz said political parties can use corporate money to help cover normal operating expenses , such as telephone and internet service , utilities , office supplies , clerical expenses and legal and accounting fees , but spending hundreds of thousands of corporate dollars to finance a petition campaign is “ not my definition of normal , ” he said .
Dietz said he could not stop the Green Party 's ballot petition , illegal as it might be , because it has already been delivered to the Secretary of State 's office .
“ The cow 's already out of the barn , ” he said .
But he enjoined the Green Party from certifying its list of candidates , which would bar them from the ballot if the Supreme Court agrees with Dietz 's order .
“ The only effective way I have to stop and prohibit the harm and continuing harm to the Democratic Party is to prohibit that action , ” the judge said .
Smith said the Green Party 's appeal will hover around an interpretation of state law and previous court rulings that “ you ca n't take somebody off the ballot without a full trial . ”
A trial on the Green Party case is not scheduled to start until January – two months after the election .
“ There 's no question that certain corporate contributions are allowed , ” Smith said .
Texas Democratic Party Chairman Boyd Richie said the party will continue the lawsuit to discover the source of the Green Party funding .
He said it will be up to Travis County prosecutors to decide whether a criminal investigation is needed .
“ Some of ( Perry 's ) closet and most trusted political advisers have now been implicated in this illegal ballot scheme , ” Richie said .
“ It is incumbent on Rick Perry and his campaign to come clean , just come clean . ”
Richie spoke to reporters while attending a state Democratic Party convention reception at the Texas State Aquarium .
“ Here we are in the aquarium .
Something smells fishy .
It just does n't pass the smell test , ” Richie said .
The Dallas Morning News reported earlier that the Green Party intends to report the signatures as an in - kind contribution from a Missouri company , Take Initiative America , which is headed by Charles Hurth III , a Republican lawyer .
But there is disagreement within the Green Party about the ethical soundness of having a petition drive orchestrated by Republicans .
Texas Green Party chair Christine Morshedi of Tomball said she was not particularly bothered by the GOP help because the 93,000 petition signatures indicated Texas voters want more choices .
“ I want to get our word out – protect our shores and wetlands and marshes and keep the nuclear industry from growing , ” she said .
She conceded the revelation about help from one of Perry 's strongest allies surprised her .
“ I think it was a strange step for them to take , ” Morshedi said .

According to the latest figures from TeleGeography , Skype - to - Skype calls accounted for 54 billion out of a total of 406 billion international call minutes in 2009 .
TeleGeography analyst Stephan Beckert , said that , while international telephone traffic growth had slowed , Skype 's traffic had soared .
" Skype 's on - net international traffic ( between two Skype users ) grew 51 percent in 2008 , and TeleGeography 's estimate for 2009 is 63 percent growth , to 54 billion minutes , " Beckert said In 2008 Tele Geography put Skype 's share of international minutes at 33 billion , eight percent of the total .
" Skype is now the largest provider of cross border communications in the world , by far , " Beckert said .
" The proliferation of alternatives to telephone calls — including Skype for mobile devices , and Google 's gradual entry into the voice market — will present ever greater challenges to international carriers .
" Beckert added : " Over the past 25 years , international call volume from telephones has grown at a compounded annual rate of 15 percent .
In the past two years , however , international telephone traffic annual growth has slowed to only eight percent , growing from 376 billion minutes in 2008 to an estimated 406 billion minutes in 2009 .
The deep recession has had a marked impact on many routes .
Demand for international voice has been remarkably robust , but it 's clearly not recession - proof .
" According to Skype 's chief evangelist , Sten Tamkivi , addressing the Emerging Communications Conference 2009 Europe in Amsterdam in November 2009 , Skype served over one billion call minutes per year , with one third using video .
" Those minutes are generated by about 520 million users that live in 225 countries ... pretty much every single country and territory in the world . "

What do you do after leading one of the oldest guilds in World of Warcraft since ... well , since World of Warcraft was young ?
You write a book detailing the proper way to run a guild .
A dead - tree book .
An honest to goodness physical thing .
Called The Guild Leader 's Handbook : Strategies and Guidance from a Battle - Scarred MMO Veteran , the book is an impressive collection of advice , strategy , and details about what it 's like to lead a guild and what you have to know to be successful in the game .
What 's even harder to believe is that the book is a compelling read , even if you 're not interested in World of Warcraft .
I have yet to install the game , but reading about how to organize a group of personalities , dole out loot in different circumstances , and deal with groups that are into heavy role - playing gives you insight into not only in guild management , but how to handle other relationships in the digital world .
People take World of Warcraft seriously , and leading a successful guild is neither easy nor simple .
My initial reaction was to make light of a work of this complexity about an online game .
Then I remembered that every month I get together with a group of guys and throw dice while pretending to be Dwarves and Elves .
Once that 's a regular part of your life , you lose the ability to look down your nose at just about anything .
Besides , WoW carries a $ 15 per month charge ; those who play with a guild and organize their play are certainly getting their money 's worth .
From giving your guild an identity to determining what kind of guild you want and how you 'd like to play , as well as detailed guides on how to organize and deal with the personalities and situations you may encounter , you can tell author Scott F. Andrews has been through some good ( and bad ) times in his history with the game .
After writing the advice column " Officer 's Quarters " for WoW.com , the Guild Leader 's Handbook is the next logical step , and Andrews speaks with authority .
If you take online gaming seriously — almost too seriously — this is a great read .
There is even a section dealing with addiction , substance abuse , and how to separate your real life and your virtual life .
Even if you do n't want to lead a guild , you 'll learn something here .
BEIJING / WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - China said on Saturday it would gradually make the yuan more flexible , in a gesture that may deflect foreign criticism at next week ’s G20 summit but will not quickly yield a big move by its currency .

President Barack Obama , who prodded China over the yuan in a letter released on Friday , welcomed the news in an indication the danger of a market - roiling confrontation at the Group of 20 meeting in Canada had eased .
“ China ’s decision to increase the flexibility of its exchange rate is a constructive step that can help safeguard the recovery and contribute to a more balanced global economy , ” Obama said in a statement .
Other Western leaders and the International Monetary Fund also voiced encouragement that an important strategic ally was making a concession which improves the chances of success at the June 26 - 27 summit .
But the announcement by China ’s central bank , which strongly suggested it was ready to break the currency ’s 23 - month - old dollar peg , was conditioned by an explicit warning ruling out a one - off revaluation or major yuan appreciation .
“ The basis for large - scale appreciation of the RMB exchange rate does not exist , ” the People ’s Bank of China said .
The yuan is also known as the renminbi , or RMB .
Analysts were broadly positive about the news but cautioned that China , the largest holder of U.S. sovereign debt , may reduce its demand for those securities in the future .
China buys U.S. bonds to manage the yuan ’s peg to the dollar , and greater currency flexibility may dilute that necessity .
The peg , which Beijing defended as a source of stability during the recent global financial crisis , has come under intense criticism from abroad as China ’s export juggernaut roared back to life .
Much of the rest of the global economy remains sluggish and beset by unemployment in the wake of the financial crisis , and China ’s policy is seen as stealing jobs from foreign markets .
In particular , by keeping the yuan artificially cheap against the dollar , China makes its imports more attractive for U.S. consumers while making U.S. exports to China more costly .
That has contributed to a massive surplus in China ’s trade account with the United States , sparking protests that the policy is at the direct expense of American jobs .
TRADE WAR
U.S. patience with Beijing over the yuan has worn thin and lawmakers threaten to penalize it for a strategy they say is unfair and breaks the rules .
Democratic Senator Charles Schumer , a leading critic , said China ’s statement was too vague and pledged to press ahead with legal action to raise trade barriers .
Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner , who has delayed publication of a potentially embarrassing report that could cite China as a currency manipulator , also stressed that China ’s actions would speak louder than words .
“ This is an important step but the test is how far and how fast they let the currency appreciate , ” he said .
The currency report , due on April 15 , was put on the back - burner until after the G20 to give China time to act .
Obama needs China ’s help on a range of other delicate issues , including sanctions against Iran and North Korea for their nuclear programs .
But he must balance quiet diplomacy against an urgent domestic political need to be seen fighting China for U.S. jobs before congressional elections in November .
U.S. businesses must also tread softly with China .
Caterpillar Inc , which sells billions of dollars of earthmoving equipment and other products to China each year , said it was heartened by the decision .
BUBBLE TROUBLE
G20 leaders have promised to tackle so - called global macro imbalances , posed by massive trade surpluses and deficits .
Those are blamed for fostering a bubble in the U.S. housing market in 2008 , and contributing to the recent European sovereign debt crisis .
Economists say such imbalances are not sustainable in the long term , and warn they may trigger another damaging global financial crisis if investors take fright .
Beijing ’s recent insistence that the summit was the wrong place to talk about yuan flexibility could have overshadowed the meeting and damaged trust .
China reduced that risk with Saturday ’s announcement .
“ This is an important move as it signals recognition by Chinese officials that a more flexible exchange rate is in China ’s own interest and also acknowledges its responsibility to the international community , ” said Eswar Prasad , a former head of the International Monetary Fund ’s China division .
China has long said it would not bow to international pressure over its currency , and the central bank went out of its way to dampen expectations for any big yuan rise .
“ We believe this is a positive gesture , suggesting the yuan will soon resume its appreciation against the dollar , ” said Goldman Sachs economists Yu Song and Helen Qiao .
The news could also ease fears of a trade dispute between the United States and China at a delicate time for the world economy and may propel world stocks markets higher on Monday .
It was clear that China intended its announcement -- published in English at around the same time as Chinese , a departure from usual practice -- to mark the end of the yuan ’s de facto peg to the dollar .
That had been defended as a special protection policy during the global financial crisis .
“ The global economy is gradually recovering .
The recovery and upturn of the Chinese economy has become more solid with enhanced economic stability , ” the Chinese central bank said in a statement on its website .
“ It is desirable to proceed further with reform of RMB exchange rate regime and increase the RMB exchange rate flexibility , ” it said .
China has held the yuan at roughly 6.83 to the dollar since July 2008 in an attempt to insulate the fastest - growing major economy from the turmoil sparked by the U.S. credit crunch .
Havana , Cuba ( CNN ) --
" I was caught because I was an illegal , " explained a bicycle taxi driver as he gripped the rusted blue handle - bars of his vehicle in Havana 's Central Park .
" And because I 'd been here several times before , I was deported back . "
But the driver working his trade in the capital city did not arrive in Cuba from another country .
Instead he is among the thousands who have come from rural provinces in search of work and a place to live -- but who have been deported back because of " Decree 217 . "
The 1997 law restricts rural migration and was designed to prevent overcrowding in Havana , a major problem in cities across Latin America .
But it has made this taxi driver an illegal resident in his own capital .
" If you 're illegal you can't be here in Havana , " said the driver , originally from Cuba 's eastern Holguin province .
" You do n't have an address here in Havana . "
The squeaky wheels of bicycle taxis usually make more noise than their drivers when the talk turns controversial in the company of an unfamiliar foreigner .
But the 13 - year old law has this bicycle taxi driver talking .
CNN is not naming the driver due to the sensitive nature of his residency status .
The law 's passage through the island 's rubber - stamp legislature came just six years after the collapse of the Soviet Union and the hardship that brought to Cuba during what it called the " special period . "
Economic conditions were generally worse at the eastern end of the island , according to Cuba analyst Edward Gonzalez , a professor emeritus at the University of California Los Angeles .
" [ The eastern region ] has always been the less affluent , impoverished part of the island , " he said , " heavily dependent upon agriculture , less on tourism , and also happens to be more black and mulatto . "
The effort to keep migrants out and prevent overcrowding in Havana may have resulted in police discrimination against darker - skinned Cubans presumed more likely to be illegal , Gonzalez said .
" The government deported tens of thousands of people or forcibly removed them from Havana to other parts of the island , " said Daniel Wilkinson , America 's deputy director at Human Rights Watch .
" It 's just one in a series of laws that place severe restrictions on Cubans [ and ] how they live , where they live , and where they work . "
The taxi driver said he believes when Havana police check IDs , they " like to pick on black people a little more . "
The Cuban government , which has long touted racial integration as a crowning achievement of a revolution that brought Fidel Castro to power in 1959 , declined to comment on internal migration or the activities of transit police .
Cuba has repeatedly said its policies promote racial equality .
Article 42 of the country 's constitution makes discrimination on the basis of race , sex , or place of origin , a violation of the law .
In practice , transit police check IDs in popular areas like Havana 's Malecon and Central Park , flipping over the ID card to check the address .
" The police sometimes come , ask me why I 'm sitting here if I do n't live close by , " said one man , perched on the Malecon 's famed seawall that lines Havana 's northern rim and practically juts out into the Caribbean .
" I just say the Malecon is a place to sit for every Cuban . "
According to the conventional wisdom , the US is a center - Right country .
But a new poll by Pew casts doubt on that idea .
It shows widespread skepticism about capitalism and hints that support for socialist alternatives is emerging as a majoritarian force in America ’s new generation .
Carried out in late April and published May 4 , 2010 , the Pew poll , arguably by the most respected polling company in the country , asked over 1500 randomly selected Americans to describe their reactions to terms such as “ capitalism , ” “ socialism , ” “ progressive , ” “ libertarian ” and “ militia . ”
The most striking findings concern “ capitalism ” and “ socialism . ”
We can not be sure what people mean by these terms , so the results have to be interpreted cautiously and in the context of more specific attitudes on concrete issues , as discussed later .
Pew summarizes the results in its poll title : “ Socialism not so negative ; capitalism not so positive . ”
This turns out to be an understatement of the drama in some of the underlying data .
Yes , “ capitalism ” is still viewed positively by a majority of Americans .
But it is just by a bare majority .
Only 52 % of all Americans react positively .
Thirty - seven percent say they have a negative reaction and the rest are n’t sure .
A year ago , a Rasmussen poll found similar reactions .
Then , only 53 % of Americans described capitalism as “ superior ” to socialism .
Meanwhile , 29 % in the Pew poll describe “ socialism ” as positive .
This positive percent soars much higher when you look at key sub - groups , as discussed shortly .
A 2010 Gallup poll found 37 % of all Americans preferring socialism as “ superior ” to capitalism .
Keep in mind these findings reflect an overview of the public mind when Right wing views seem at a high point – with the Tea Party often cast as a barometer of American public opinion .
The polls in this era do not suggest a socialist country , but not a capitalist - loving one either .
This is not a “ Center - Right ” America but a populace where almost 50 % are deeply ambivalent or clearly opposed to capitalism .
Republicans and the Tea Party would likely call that a Communist country .
The story gets more interesting when you look at two vital sub -groups .
One is young people , the “ millennial generation ” currently between 18 and 30 .
In the Pew poll , just 43 % of Americans under 30 describe “ capitalism ” as positive .
Even more striking , the same percentage , 43 % , describes “ socialism ” as positive .
In other words , the new generation is equally divided between capitalism and socialism .
The Pew , Gallup and Rasmussen polls come to the same conclusion .
Young people cannot be characterized as a capitalist generation .
They are half capitalist and half socialist .
Since the socialist leaning keeps rising among the young , it suggests — depending on how you interpret “ socialism ” — that we are moving toward an America that is either Center - Left or actually majoritarian socialist .
Turn now to Republicans and Democrats .
Sixty - two percent of Republicans in the Pew poll view capitalism as positive , although 81 % view “ free markets ” as positive , suggesting a sensible distinction in their mind between capitalism and free markets .
Even Republicans prefer small to big business and are divided about big business , which many correctly see as a monopolistic force of capitalism undermining free markets .
The more interesting story , though , is about Democrats .
We hear endlessly about Blue Dog Democrats .
But the Pew poll shows a surprisingly progressive Democratic base .
Democrats are almost equally split in their appraisal of capitalism and socialism .
Forty - seven percent see capitalism as positive but 53 % do not .
And 44 % of Democrats define socialism as positive , linking their negativity about capitalism to a positive affirmation of socialism .
Moreover , many other subgroups react negatively to capitalism .
Less than 50 % of women , low - income groups and less - educated groups describe capitalism as positive .
So much for the view that Obama does not have a strong progressive base to mobilize .
In fact , “ progressive , ’ according to the Pew poll , is one of the most positive terms in the American political lexicon , with a substantial majority of almost all sub - groups defining it as positive .
You may conclude that this all add ups to little , since we ca n’t be clear about how people are defining “ capitalism ” and “ socialism . ”
But in my own research , summarized in recent books such as The New Feminized Majority and Morality Wars , attitudes registered in polls toward concrete issues over the last thirty years support the interpretation of the Pew data , at minimum , as evidence of a Center - Left country .
On nearly every major issue , from support minimum wage and unions , preference for diplomacy over force , deep concern for the environment , belief that big business is corrupting democracy , and support for many major social programs including Social Security and Medicare , the progressive position has been strong and relatively stable .
If “ socialism ” means support for these issues , the interpretation of the Pew poll is a Center - Left country .
If socialism means a search for a genuine systemic alternative , then America , particularly its youth , is emerging as a majoritarian social democracy , or in a majoritarian search for a more cooperativist , green , and more peaceful and socially just order .
Either interpretation is hopeful .
It should give progressives assurance that even in the “ Age of the Tea Party , ” despite great dangers and growing concentrated corporate power and wealth , there is a strong base for progressive politics .
We have to mobilize the majority population to recognize its own possibilities and turn up the heat on the Obama Administration and a demoralized Democratic Party .
If we fail , the Right will take up the slack and impose its monopoly capitalist will on a reluctant populace .
Well , holy crap .
Okay , we do n't know all the details yet , but this is unbelievable .
Not to mention , how many of us could be indicted under these same standards ?
If you did n't already know , I think this proves without a doubt that Jim Bunning is the world 's biggest tool .
I hope a tornado whisks him away to the Land of Oz , where he can frolic with the rest of the flying Republican monkeys :
When Sen. Jim Bunning complained on the Senate floor in February that he'd missed the Kentucky - South Carolina basketball game because of a debate on unemployment benefits -- a debate the Kentucky Republican himself prevented from proceeding to a vote -- Bruce Shore got angry .
" I was livid .
I was just livid , " said Shore , 51 , who watched the floor proceedings on C - SPAN from his home in Philadelphia .
" I 'm on unemployment , so it affects me .
I 'm in shock . "
Instead of just being angry , Shore took action :
He sent several emails to Bunning staffers , blasting the senator for blocking the benefits .
" ARE you 'all insane , " said part of one letter Shore sent on Feb. 26 ( which he shared with HuffPost ) .
" NO checks equal no food for me .
DO YOU GET IT ? ? "
In that letter he signed off as " Brad Shore " from Louisville .
He said he did the same thing in several messages sent via the contact form on Bunning 's website .
" My assumption was that if he gets an email from Philadelphia , who cares ? " he said .
" Why would he even care if a guy from Philadelphia gets upset ? "
Bunning might not have cared , but the FBI did .
Sometime in March , said Shore , agents came calling to ask about the emails .
They read from printouts and asked if Shore was the author , which he readily admitted .
They asked a few questions , and then , according to Shore , they said , " All right , we just wanted to make sure it was n't anything to worry about . "
But on March 13 , U.S. Marshals showed up at Shore 's house with a grand jury indictment .
Now he 's got to appear in federal court in Covington , Ky. on May 28 to answer for felony email harassment .
Specifically , the indictment ( PDF ) says that on Feb. 26 , Shore " did utilize a telecommunications device , that is a computer , whether or not communication ensued , without disclosing his identity and with the intent to annoy , abuse , threaten , and harass any person who received the communication . "
The language of Shore 's indictment is taken directly from the statute -- there 's no description of the actual crime .
The Kentucky U.S. Attorney 's Office declined to comment , but said it 's a typical indictment .
The crime carries a penalty of up to two years in prison and a $ 250,000 maximum fine .
Shore swears he did n't intend to make a threat .
He thought sending angry letters to Congress was a First Amendment thing .
" If I send 50 letters to Congress , is that illegal or is it just me wasting paper ? "
Harvey Silverglate , a prominent civil liberties lawyer and the author of " Three Felonies a Day : How the Feds Target the Innocent " , has long argued that vague laws allow the federal government to prosecute citizens for things most people would n't consider crimes .
( The message of his book 's title is that the average person unintentionally commits three felonies a day .
" Half of the anonymous Internet comments would " be illegal according to the statute used against Shore , said Silverglate . )

New regulatory complex turning on genes
Researchers from the European Molecular Biology Laboratory ( EMBL ) in Heidelberg , Germany , and the Max - Planck Institute of Immunobiology Freiburg have identified a novel protein complex that regulates around 4000 genes in the fruit fly Drosophila and likely plays an important role in mammals , too .
Published today in Molecular Cell , their findings explain how a regulatory protein can lead a double life .
( Molecular Cell , 24 June 2010 )
These microscopy images show that a protein from the NSL complex ( red ) and MOF ( green ) both bind to all chromosomes in female fruit flies - overlap is shown in purple .

" This new complex seems to be one of the major regulatory complexes both in Drosophila and in mammals " , says Asifa Akhtar , former EMBL group leader and now at the Max - Planck Institute of Immunobiology in Freiburg , Germany , who led the study : " Without it , flies die early in embryonic development . "
The absence of the newly found complex causes early embryonic death of both males and females , so Akhtar and colleagues named it Non-Specific Lethal ( NSL ) , in contrast to a previously known complex called Male - Specific Lethal ( MSL ) .
The MSL complex enables males to double the production of mRNAs encoded in their single X chromosome - a process called dosage compensation - by binding to the body of those genes together with a protein called MOF .
Thus , male flies are able to compensate for the fact that they have only one X chromosome , while females have two .
But MOF leads a double life : it also binds to the promoter regions of genes on all chromosomes , in both sexes .
These microscopy images show that a protein from the NSL complex ( red ) and MOF ( green ) both bind to all chromosomes in male fruit flies - overlap is shown in purple .
On the male X chromosome , MOF binds not only to promoter regions but also to the body of the genes , generating a brighter signal ( pink ) .

Akhtar and colleagues discovered that the NSL complex decorates all chromosomes in both sexes .
They also observed that the NSL complex helps MOF to bind to promoters and thereby plays an important role in determining the life MOF will lead .
If it partners up with NSL , MOF turns on genes in all chromosomes .
If it interacts with MSL instead , it binds to genes on the males ’
X chromosome , playing its role in dosage compensation .
Interestingly , NSL indirectly drives this aspect of MOF function too , by acting together with MOF to turn on the genes whose output will then be increased by dosage compensation .
" These proteins have been conserved throughout evolution - they exist not only in fruit flies but in mammals too , meaning that everything we have discovered in flies has implications for humans and other mammals , which we ’d like to investigate next " , Akhtar concludes .
Since MOF is frequently down - regulated in cancers , comparing how the NSL complex behaves in healthy tissues and in tumours is especially relevant .
When people see that I have listed ‘ Republican ’ under my ‘ political views ’ on Facebook , they usually assume I ’m being ironic .
This is understandable , as under ‘ religious views ’
I have listed ‘ Tarvuism ‘ .
However , it is not a joke ( the republicanism , not the Tarvuism ) as I am in fact a registered Republican in the state of New York .
Let me explain .
This decision of mine , to legally proclaim myself to be an idiot ( in the minds of my friends and family ) occurred during the 2008 presidential primaries .
That year , which for many was the year of Obama , was for me the year of Paul .
I became entranced by the candid rationality he brought to politics .
I agreed with him on nearly every issue , something I never thought I ’d be able to say about any politician .
I felt proud to support his campaign , and remain a fan of his to this day .
However , in my state , I was not allowed to support him during the primaries without first registering Republican .
My choice of no affiliation afforded me no voting privilege for any primaries .
Unbeknownst to me at the time I chose no affiliation I was literally announcing to the state that the primaries do n’t matter to me and I want no part of them .
Luckily , I realized this error before the deadline for me to register Republican .
Many people I know were unaware of this deadline , and regrettably could not vote for him .
In the general election , it was down to Obama and McCain , and I was faced with the annoying responsibility of choosing between two people I agreed with on next to nothing , and wholly distrusted .
I ended up choosing Obama , out of respect that he had ran arguably the greatest presidential campaign in U.S. history .
I figured if he could run the country even half as well , we ’d be in good hands .
Though he has yet to do so , I do n’t regret voting for him .
I highly doubt McCain would be doing at all better .
The Republican party is in an interesting state right now , with the tea party movement and all .
I do not support the tea party movement , as I have yet to figure out what the hell the tea - baggers even want , and this is coming from a libertarian .
They are a disorganized mess of a movement with no clear goals or desires , and their stigma hurts the reputation of decent , rational people who happen to support capitalism and small government .
However despite said chicken little craziness of the party on the moment , I remain proud to be registered Republican .
Note that I did not say proud to be a republican , as I do not consider myself one , nor must I .
At the end of the day it ’s just a paper that says I am allowed to vote in Republican primaries .
If I had any desire to do so in the Democrat primaries , I ’d switch over .
Under which party I am registered means nothing to me , and should mean nothing to anyone else .
I have not signed away my brain , or my soul , and I do n’t plan on doing so in this lifetime .
The advice of etiquette experts on dealing with unwanted invitations , or overly demanding requests for favours , has always been the same : just say no .
That may have been a useless mantra in the war on drugs , but in the war on relatives who want to stay for a fortnight , or colleagues trying to get you to do their work , the manners guru Emily Post 's formulation – " I'm afraid that wo n't be possible " – remains the gold standard .
Excuses merely invite negotiation .
The comic retort has its place ( Peter Cook : " Oh dear , I find I 'm watching television that night " ) , and I 'm fond of the tautological non-explanation ( " I can't , because I 'm unable to " ) .
But these are variations on a theme : the best way to say no is to say no .
Then shut up .
This is a lesson we 're unable to learn , however , judging by the scores of books promising to help us .
The Power Of A Positive No , How To Say No Without Feeling Guilty , The Book Of No ...
Publishers , certainly , seem unable to refuse .
( Two recent books addressing the topic are Marshall Goldsmith 's Mojo , and Womenomics , by Claire Shipman and Katty Kay . )
This is the " disease to please " – a phrase that does n't make grammatical sense , but rhymes , giving it instant pop-psychology cachet .
There are certainly profound issues here , of self - esteem , guilt etcetera .
But it 's also worth considering whether part of the problem does n't originate in a simple misunderstanding between two types of people : Askers and Guessers .
This terminology comes from a brilliant web posting by Andrea Donderi that 's achieved minor cult status online .
We are raised , the theory runs , in one of two cultures .
In Ask culture , people grow up believing they can ask for anything – a favour , a pay rise– fully realising the answer may be no .
In Guess culture , by contrast , you avoid " putting a request into words unless you 're pretty sure the answer will be yes …
A key skill is putting out delicate feelers .
If you do this with enough subtlety , you wo n't have to make the request directly ; you 'll get an offer .
Even then , the offer may be genuine or pro forma ; it takes yet more skill and delicacy to discern whether you should accept . "
Neither 's " wrong " , but when an Asker meets a Guesser , unpleasantness results .
An Asker wo n't think it 's rude to request two weeks in your spare room , but a Guess culture person will hear it as presumptuous and resent the agony involved in saying no .
Your boss , asking for a project to be finished early , may be an overdemanding boor – or just an Asker , who 's assuming you might decline .
If you 're a Guesser , you 'll hear it as an expectation .
This is a spectrum , not a dichotomy , and it explains cross-cultural awkwardnesses , too : Brits and Americans get discombobulated doing business in Japan , because it 's a Guess culture , yet experience Russians as rude , because they 're diehard Askers .
Self - help seeks to make us all Askers , training us to both ask and refuse with relish ; the mediation expert William
Ury recommends memorising " anchor phrases " such as " that does n't work for me " .
But Guessers can take solace in logic : in many social situations ( though perhaps not at work ) the very fact that you 're receiving an anxiety - inducing request is proof the person asking is an Asker .
He or she is half - expecting you 'll say no , and has no inkling of the torture you 're experiencing .
So say no , and see what happens .
Nothing will .

Armonk -- - 14 Apr 2010 : SPSS , an IBM ( NYSE : IBM ) Company , today announced that the Florida State Department of Juvenile Justice selected IBM predictive analytics software to reduce recidivism by determining which juveniles are likely to reoffend .
Identified at - risk youth can then be placed in programs specific to the best course of treatment to ensure offenders do not re-enter the juvenile justice system .
More than 85,000 youth enter the juvenile justice system in Florida each year for varying degrees of offenses – from drug abuse to robbery or property crimes .
As each youth enters the system for a different reason and with varying backgrounds , the best program for positive rehabilitation is very specific – what may work for one juvenile may not work for another .
Mark Greenwald , chief of research and planning at the Florida Department of Juvenile Justice , said , “ The State of Florida believes that if youth are rehabilitated with effective prevention , intervention and treatment services early in life , juveniles will not enter the adult corrections system .
Our goal is to ensure juveniles do not return to the system .
IBM SPSS predictive analytics will allow our organization to refine our current practice and better intervene in juvenile lives earlier to help them become — and stay — law abiding citizens . ”
The organization selected IBM predictive analytics to improve its existing screening and placement process .
With the new analytics system in place , Florida Department of Juvenile Justice will analyze key predictors such as past offense history , home life environment , gang affiliation and peer associations to better understand and predict which youths have a higher likelihood to reoffend .
With that information , the organization can more effectively place specific segments of juveniles into the best programs for rehabilitation .
For example , juveniles identified as having a higher likelihood for re-offense can be placed in a more focused program , such as one that addresses issues on substance abuse or mental health , if appropriate to the need .
Additionally , the organization will direct those youth with a lower chance of re-offense to a less restrictive program , again providing services better tailored to meet their rehabilitative needs .
Prior to predictive analytics , the organization used Excel for basic analysis on projections for the number of delinquency cases they would take in , which had limited functionality .
They selected IBM SPSS predictive analytics due to the ease of use and the advanced analytic capabilities .
The organization will now utilize the new predictive analytics system as a component in many of the performance measurement analyses conducted and distributed to agency staff throughout the year .
These reports assess the future of delinquency cases to evaluate what juvenile crime trends may look like in the immediate future .
This information will help the organization to better plan and project staffing and other resource needs .
IBM recently also announced that the Ministry of Justice in the United Kingdom uses predictive analytics to assess the likelihood of prisoners reoffending upon their release to help improve public safety .
With predictive technology from IBM , the Ministry of Justice is analyzing hidden trends and patterns within the data .
IBM SPSS predictive analytics has helped identify whether offenders with specific problems such as drug and alcohol misuse are more likely to reoffend than other prisoners .
Deepak Advani , vice president of predictive analytics at IBM , said , “ Predictive analytics gives government organizations worldwide a highly - sophisticated and intelligent source to create safer communities by identifying , predicting , responding to and preventing criminal activities .
It gives the criminal justice system the ability to draw upon the wealth of data available to detect patterns , make reliable projections and then take the appropriate action in real time to combat crime and protect citizens . ”
IBM has invested more than $ 12 billion to build an analytics portfolio which includes organic innovation and acquisitions .
In addition , IBM has assembled 4,000 analytics consultants with industry expertise , and opened a network of seven analytics centers of excellence .
Today , IBM is working with more than 250,000 clients worldwide on predictive analytics , including 22 of the top 24 global commercial banks , 18 of the world 's top 22 telecommunication carriers and 11 of the top 12 U.S. specialty retailers .

The birth control pill has been called the most important scientific advance of the 20th century , and no wonder .
Fifty years after its approval by the Food and Drug Administration , it is still one of the leading methods of contraception , in the United States and around the world .
Much has been written about how it revolutionized sexual and social relationships , allowing women to defer pregnancy , enter the work force and make life choices their mothers could not — or , if you prefer , spawning promiscuity and undermining the foundations of marriage .
But the pill also led to profound changes in the F.D.A. itself — a revolution in what Dr. Margaret Hamburg , the current food and drug commissioner , calls regulatory science .
Many of the steps that underlie modern drug approvals — extensive clinical trials , routine referrals to panels of outside experts , continuing assessments of a medicine ’s safety , and direct communications between the F.D.A. and patients — were pioneered to deal with evolving concerns about the pill ’s safety .
In regulatory terms , the pill brought about a kind of reformation : just as Martin Luther insisted that individual Christians could communicate directly with God without the mediation of priests , the pill eventually led the F.D.A. to communicate directly with patients without going through doctors .
At first she thought the barely - there stems were worm eggs , however , the next day she discovered that the stems had grown 18 white tiny flowers on top and smelled " fragrant " .
ASUS has unveiled two slate computers called Eee Pads at the Computex 2010 event being held in the Taiwanese capital of Taipei .
Both devices are extremely slim yet have very high performance levels .

The EP121 also has at least one USB port along with a battery stamina of 10 hours .
Another smaller EeePad that has been unveiled by ASUS is the EP101 TC that has a 10 - inch touchscreen and has Windows Embedded Compact 7 as the operating software .
This slate device also offers many cloud computing features and is more compact .
Pricing for the ASUS Eee Pads will be set between $ 399 to $ 499 and will become available for sale from the first quarter of 2011 .
I ’ve found two , made by Blake Sinclair .
Both of these images are everything I thought an animated GIF was not ; subtle , artistic , subdued and beautiful .
I can feel the breeze through the trees and grasses .
These images are a double whammy for RVA , as they ’re a wonderful reinterpretation of a medium usually quantified as cheesy , gaudy , and anything * but * art , and they ’re also of fixed gear bicycles 😛

Nothing stops Russell Pearce .
Not a heart attack .
Not a stroke .
Not a bullet in the chest .
And most certainly not the criticism from opponents who have long accused him of putting politics ahead of facts , pushing too hard and cooperating too little .
Arizona 's foremost foe of illegal immigration is a 62 - year - old former lawman whose barrel - chested build and single - minded determination evoke images of the rodeo bulls he rode as a youth .
Profile : Russell Pearce
That iron will springs from a poverty - stricken Mesa childhood and an almost messianic conviction as to the rightness of his cause .
It was the driving force behind passage of Senate Bill 1070 , which has stirred America 's fiercest immigration debate in decades .
Even before SB 1070 , Pearce had become one of the most polarizing political figures in Arizona history .
Critics have called him short - sighted , intractable , even racist - a charge he vehemently denies .
But Pearce also has steadfast supporters .
He has never lost an election , and polls show widespread public backing for the new immigration law .
Pearce sees his battle against illegal immigration as crucial to the defense of America 's rule of law and way of life .
If he has his way , SB 1070 will be far from his last act on Arizona 's political stage .
And Russell Pearce almost always gets his way .
�� �� ��
By July 2 , 1977 , Pearce had been a sheriff 's deputy for seven years .
It was n't his first career choice .
That was medicine , but with no money for school , he gravitated to law enforcement because of a boyhood admiration for the men who wore a badge .
That afternoon , while patrolling in Guadalupe , he stopped three kids who were drinking .
One sicced his Doberman on Pearce .
Pearce clubbed the animal with his flashlight .
As he struggled with the dog's owner , another kid grabbed Pearce 's .357 Magnum and aimed .
Pearce raised his hand in self - defense , and the bullet blew off his ring finger before slamming into his chest .
He was n't wearing a protective vest .
Still , he wrestled one kid into his squad car .
The kid was covered with blood , and Pearce thought the kid was shot , too - until he saw the gushing stub on his own hand .
That kid stayed put in the car as Pearce called for help .
By then a lot of guys would have called it a day , but not Pearce .
Even though it was becoming hard to breathe , he chased after the other two kids , who still had his gun .
He was n't about to let them get away with shooting him .
Or anybody else .
He did n't give up the chase until backup arrived .
Deputies eventually tracked the kids down .
The 17 - year - old shooter got five years in prison .
His 16 - year - old brother went to jail for six months .
The third youngster was not charged .
Years later , Pearce can joke about it .
" That 's why I'm a Republican today , " he said .
" I owe my life to this party .
If I 'd had a heart , I 'd be dead . "
Even though the youths involved in Pearce 's shooting were Latino , and his son Sean , also a sheriff 's deputy , was shot and almost killed by an illegal immigrant several years ago , Pearce insists neither event shaped his views on immigration .
" I 've never been a hateful guy , " Pearce said in a recent interview .
" It 's disappointing that people would paint you as a hateful guy . . . . Vigilant ?
Absolutely .
Want to step out into the parking lot ?
I 'll do it right now .
But I 'm not hateful .
I just know my duty .
My duty to my country , my God , my family and the rule of law . "
�� �� ��
That almost single - minded obsession with the rule of law has been a constant theme throughout his life .
Pearce stayed with the Maricopa County Sheriff 's Office for more than 20 years , rising to the rank of captain and becoming the sheriff 's lobbyist in the Legislature .
Many of the boating - safety laws he wrote while with the Sheriff 's Office are still on Arizona 's books .
Pearce 's interest in the law and politics stems from boyhood and his Mormon upbringing ; he recalls no particular political epiphany .
But during the 1970s and 1980s , Pearce gravitated toward a right - wing political guru whose teachings served to cement Pearce 's beliefs in law and order and make him even more immovable when it came to defending those beliefs .
W. Cleon Skousen , a former FBI agent , fervent anti-Communist and Mormon political theorist , lectured to large East Valley audiences in the 1980s and early 1990s , and Pearce attended some of those meetings .
Karen Johnson , a former state legislator who has been Pearce 's political colleague and personal friend for more than a quarter of a century , said many East Valley Republicans were followers of Skousen at the time , as was former Gov. Evan Mecham , who was impeached and ousted in 1988 .
Skousen , who died in 2006 at age 92 , saw America not just in political but also in religious terms .
He believed the Founding Fathers were inspired by God when they wrote the Declaration of Independence , revolted from British rule and framed the Constitution .
This is , in every literal sense , God 's country , he believed .
Therefore , there could be no compromise in defending her laws , her values , her position among nations - and her borders .
Pearce said he admires Skousen and has read many of his books .
Indeed , Pearce 's philosophy echoes Skousen 's book " The Five Thousand Year Leap , " which asserts that God inspired the Founders to create a society that has fostered more human progress in 200 years than in all the previous 5,000 years put together .
The book has become a favorite of talk - show host Glenn Beck and others in the " tea party " movement .
Skousen believed in an obscure prophecy attributed to Mormon Church founder Joseph Smith that held that in the final days of the world , the Constitution would be hanging by a thread and would only be rescued by " the elders of Israel " - Mormon men .
While the prophesy is considered outside the mainstream of the church , it resonates in Pearce 's comments .
" I love this country .
I love this republic , " Pearce said .
" I believe it was inspired by God by our Founders to put together the freedom - loving constitutional republic that we have , recognizing certain God - given rights .
I 've believed that from a young age . "
Politically , that translates into Pearce 's reputation as a lawmaker who is a budget hawk , a gun-rights zealot and , most famously , a foe of illegal immigration .
" I 've always been pretty passionate about the rule of law and our sovereign state and our sovereign nation , " he said .
" I believe that you have to have permission to enter this country just like you have to have permission to enter my home .
I believe you can't ignore the damage it costs to American jobs - billions of dollars - or the crime that comes with this tsunami across the border . "
�� �� ��
In 2001 , Pearce had a stroke , which followed an earlier heart attack .
Within days , with his speech slurred , he was back at the Legislature for a debate on emergency health - care funding for illegal immigrants .
A fellow lawmaker told him , " I imagine the doctor told you not to come , and that 's why you 're here . "
That same fall , still walking with a cane and his speech still muddy , Pearce set out on the campaign trail with his personal friend and political soulmate , Matt Salmon , a fellow East Valley Republican who was running for governor and shared Pearce 's fervency for smaller government and reducing taxes .
Salmon crisscrossed the state , setting a brutal campaign pace .
Pearce insisted on keeping up even though " he could barely walk , " Salmon said .
" He has an incredible sense of what is right and what is wrong in his mind , and nobody can shake him off that , " Salmon said .
" He just keeps coming , does n't give up , ever , and he does n't get down even when the odds are stacked on him . "
Pearce 's fellow lawmakers have seen that grit time and again during his more than nine years in the Capitol .
From the moment he set foot there in January 2001 , vowing to become " the John Wayne of the Legislature , " he has loaded its hoppers with dozens of bills designed to frustrate those who cross the border without papers .
Partly because of his experience - writing legislation with the Sheriff 's Office and leading the state Motor Vehicle Department during a previous Republican administration - and partly because of the force of his personality , Pearce quickly assumed powerful committee chairmanships that helped him shape the Legislature 's agenda , though he has not yet campaigned for a leadership position .
Pearce has tried to get elements of SB 1070 passed for at least four years , even as he battled illegal immigration on other legislative fronts .
The law , which ignited a national firestorm over immigration and led to a meeting last week between Gov. Jan Brewer and President Barack Obama , makes it a state crime to be in the country illegally .
It says a police officer engaged in a lawful stop , detention or arrest shall , when practicable , ask about a person 's legal status when reasonable suspicion exists that the person is in the country illegally .
Pearce 's success this year sprang not just from his own persistence but also from political circumstances .
After years of butting heads with Democratic Gov. Janet Napolitano , who in 2006 vetoed a bill similar to 1070 , Pearce now has a political ally in the Republican Brewer .
But beyond that , legislators point to Pearce 's stubbornness , a description he does not dispute .
Senate President Bob Burns said he experienced Pearce 's negotiating tactics a few years ago when he tried to get him to make changes to a bill imposing penalties on employers who knowingly hire illegal immigrants .
Pearce refused to give in , and the two had to bring in a third person to move the discussion forward .
" He 's a tough negotiator , " Burns said .
" I think we ended up both giving some .
But he 's pretty set in how he feels about certain things , and he tries pretty hard to get it done the way he thinks is right . "
Pearce will bend on some things - if it suits his purpose .
Even after SB 1070 passed , he acquiesced in another bill , signed by Brewer , designed to soften language that some critics feared could lead to racial profiling .
While outwardly it was designed to mute critics , it was also a way to protect SB 1070 against potential legal challenges .
�� �� ��
Most of the time with Pearce , politics is pure hardball .
In a March hearing of the House Military Affairs and Public Safety Committee , Rep. Daniel Patterson , D - Tucson , confronted Pearce on his immigration efforts and legislative tactics .
He accused him of not answering questions and of making up crime statistics to suit his needs .
" Your approaches on immigration have failed for years , " Patterson said .
" We do n't get a lot of facts on your bills ; we get a lot of rhetoric .
You 're entitled to your own opinions , but you 're not entitled to your own facts . "
Republican House leaders kicked Patterson off the committee for the comments .
Pearce did not object to the move .
Rep. Kyrsten Sinema , D - Phoenix , is the legislator who this year most often opposed Pearce on various issues , including guns and immigration .
She said Pearce 's influence has increased over the years and described him as " the most powerful person in the Senate . "
" His strategy , as far as I can tell , is , ' If you do n't give me what I want , I 'm going to get my activists , and I 'm going to run somebody against you in the primary election , ' " Sinema said .
Outside the Legislature , one of Pearce 's most strident critics is Alfredo Gutierrez , a former state lawmaker and Hispanic activist who has debated Pearce in several public forums .
" I have a real low opinion of him , " Gutierrez said .
" I find few as deceptive and untruthful as Russell Pearce , and it goes from the personal to wild numerical allegations .
. . .
He simply makes up numbers .
He is quite notorious on that .
He invents them , I think , inside his head . "
The same charge was made by Phoenix Mayor Phil Gordon , who responded with an outraged Arizona Republic op - ed piece a year ago after Pearce wrote that Phoenix was suffering from high crime because it was a " sanctuary city " for illegal immigrants .
" The senator 's own vision is distorted and myopic .
Enough of his reckless misstatements , " Gordon wrote .
" I know how it works for you , senator .
If you told people the real numbers - verified by the FBI - you 'd have no ' hot - button issue ' and would risk losing your political base . "
Pearce has frequently cited a soaring crime rate caused by illegal immigration as one of the reasons for his stance .
However , statistics from the FBI 's Uniform Crime Reports show that violent and property crimes in Phoenix have decreased in the last three years at a rate that is even faster than the nation 's as a whole .
As recently as two months ago , Pearce wrote a constituent that illegal immigrants are responsible for " over 9,000 American deaths every year . "
The number has been attributed to U.S. Rep.
Steve King , R - Iowa , who said he " extrapolated " from a Government Accountability Office study .
The study , however , was on illegal - immigrant prison populations and does not mention that figure .
�� �� ��
While Pearce has vocal critics , there are those who see another side of him .
Roc Arnett , president of the East Valley Partnership , a public - private business - development group , said he has met with the senator informally as they worked on legislative issues .
" He was quite the delightful breakfast companion , " Arnett said , and he was willing to listen to other points of view .
" He 's very dogmatic , he 's very driven with what he is doing , but he is not terribly unreasonable . "
Tom Freestone , a veteran Valley politician , was on the county Board of Supervisors when Pearce was still a sheriff 's captain making budget presentations to the board .
" I found him to be very thorough , very well - studied , " Freestone said .
" He always knew how to present .
He was one of the best presenters I 've ever seen . "
Later , Freestone said , the men crossed paths when Freestone was in the state Senate and Pearce was director of the Motor Vehicle Department .
" He was always very respectful , even if he disagreed , " Freestone said .
" One thing I 've noticed about him , he 's been true to form .
When he gets determined , he gets determined .
He does study his facts well , but when he decides that 's the thing that should be done , you really have a hard time deterring him .
It becomes a quest with him . "
�� �� ��
In the aftermath of SB 1070 's passage , Pearce said he has received many more phone calls and e-mails of support than of condemnation .
The critics , he said , have been vulgar , sometimes threatening violence .
He said the Department of Public Safety has investigated some of the threats and offered to guard his family .
He declined .
" If I need to mow my yard with a .40 - caliber on , I 'll mow my yard .
I do n't need a baby - sitter .
I 'll protect my family . "
But even with the passage of 1070 , Pearce remains as laser - focused as ever on illegal immigration and says there is more to be done .
" The ' anchor baby ' thing needs to be fixed , " he said , referring to children who , despite their parents ' undocumented status , are given automatic citizenship because they are born in the U.S.
" Anchor babies are an unconstitutional declaration of citizenship to those born of non-Americans .
It 's wrong , and it's immoral . "
Pearce also has further political aspirations .
He plans to run next year for president of the Senate , and he has his eyes on the job occupied for nearly two decades by County Sheriff Joe Arpaio , for whom Pearce briefly served as chief deputy in the early 1990s .
" As a young man I 've always thought about running for sheriff , " he said .
" That 's the only political ambition I 've ever had , actually . "
Whether or not that comes to pass , and regardless of what else he adds to his political resume , Pearce believes he already is carving his legacy , that of a man who helped create " a better place for folks who live in America , that love freedom , appreciate the founding principles of this country . "
" The candle of liberty , " he said , " has always been kept lit by a vigilant few . "
Republic reporter Alia Beard Rau contributed to this article .
A recent study of of 8 to 15 - year - olds found that 40 % of girls identified Facebook as one of the most important things in their lives — more influential than TV , magazines and celebrities .
Hmm .

On the upside , Facebook is all about networking and socializing with your friends .
So if these young girls do n't rank celebrities higher than their peers , that could be a positive .
The downside :
You 're not even supposed to be on Facebook unless you 're 13 .
Oops .
Certainly communication is a valuable tool .
In the olden days ( the ' 80s ! ) , kids passed notes in class and talked on the phone after school .
Facebook is the updated version , except more public and more isolating , in a way — you can have exchanges with people without seeing their reaction , hearing their voice and learning to analyze the subtext , tone and expressions humans have during face - to - face contact .

But you know , when it comes right down to it , life is about human interactions .
So if girls were asked for the " most important things " in their lives , and answered , " friends , family and Facebook , " well , perhaps they will grow up to be communicative , empathetic and articulate women .
Unlike the boys , who ranked " money " second , after family and before friends .
Facebook Is A Major Influence On Girls , Says Survey [ BBC News ]
An earthquake of magnitude 7.4 has struck offshore near the Indonesian island of Sumatra , near Aceh province .
The quake struck 214 km ( 133 miles ) south of Aceh 's capital of Banda Aceh , the US Geological Survey ( USGS ) said .
A local tsunami alert was issued and later lifted by the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center .
The site is very near that of 2004's 9.2 magnitude earthquake .
About 220,000 people were killed in the Indian Ocean tsunami the quake triggered .
The epicentre of the latest quake was at a depth of 61.4 km , about 66 km ( 41 miles ) south - west of Meulaboh district , the USGS said .
The district , and other parts of Aceh , were devastated in the 26 December 2004 earthquake .
Ring of Fire
The quake hit at 1259 ( 0559 GMT ) .
Local media reported some houses were damaged and power lines knocked down , Associated Press news agency said .
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center lifted its tsunami watch several hours after the earthquake .
The earthquake caused some panic in parts of Aceh
" Sea level readings indicate that a significant tsunami was not generated , " the Hawaii - based centre said in a statement on its website .
" Therefore , the tsunami watch issued by this center is now cancelled . "
The USGS earlier said it believed there was no threat of a destructive , widespread tsunami but the possibility of a local tsunami existed .
Indonesia is located on the volatile Pacific Ring of Fire , a belt of tectonic activity girdling the Pacific Ocean that triggers earthquakes and volcanic activity .
Aceh is on the north - western tip of Sumatra , one of Indonesia 's main islands , and is frequently rocked by earthquakes .
One last year near Padang in West Sumatra province killed more than 1,000 people .
About 170,000 people were killed in Aceh from the 2004 earthquake and the tsunami it launched .
The waves spread across the Indian Ocean to cause death and destruction as far away as Sri Lanka , Burma and Thailand .

Titanic Facts Infographics
The Titanic Was the Largest Ship of Its Time Titanic facts reveal that the RSM Titanic , as Titanic was officially called , was the world ’s largest passenger ship at the time .
But it was n’t only the largest object at sea ; it was also the largest man-made moving object on Earth in general .
The Titanic , of course , does n’t hold that title any more – the largest passenger vessel at the current moment is the MS Allure of the Seas , measuring 1,187 feet in length .
The Titanic Was Built in Belfast , Ireland Belfast , Ireland was back then a part of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland .
The RMS Titanic was one of the three Olympic - class ocean liners ; the other two vessels were called the RMS Olympic and the HMHS Britannic .
These three were by far the biggest ships owned by the British shipping company White Star Line .
All three ships , including the RMS Titanic , were constructed by Belfast shipbuilders Harland and Wolff .
Since the magnitude of the ships was a much more important factor than the cost , the company received authorization to spend whatever they needed on the ships .

Only 2 People Died during the Construction of the Titanic None would be even better of course , but only two deaths was actually quite an achievement going by the building standards at that time .
Around 3,000 people worked for more than two years to build the Titanic , and , aside from the two deaths , 246 injuries occurred during the construction process .
The Titanic Did Not Have Nearly Enough Lifeboats for All Its Passengers
It is one of the most well - known Titanic facts that the vessel only had enough lifeboats for a small number of the passengers on the ship .
The Titanic only had 20 lifeboats , which was enough to save 1,178 people – that was only about one - third of the passenger capacity on the Titanic .
However , the Titanic actually had more lifeboats than was legally required at that time .
But the number of lifeboats was not the only obstacle when it came to saving people from the sinking ship ; the lifeboats were not filled to their full capacity .
The first lifeboat that left the stricken skip only carried 28 people , but its capacity was 65 people .
If all the lifeboats on the Titanic were filled to capacity , 53 % of all passengers could have been saved , but only 31 % were actually rescued .
The lifeboat drill that was scheduled for April 14 also did not take place , and the reasons for its cancellation are unknown .
Almost Two - Thirds of the People on Board the Titanic Died The majority ( 1,352 ) of all 1,514 victims were men , 109 of them were women and 53 were children .
This is consistent with the fact that lifeboats were primarily filled with women and children , who therefore had a much better chance of survival .
Even though second and third class passengers were hit harder than first class passengers ( there were 528 victims among the third class passengers , 167 victims among the second class passengers and only 123 victims among the first class passengers ) , the group that suffered the most significant losses was the crew .
Of the 908 members of the crew on the Titanic , only 212 of them survived the sinking .
Out of 30 engineers , not a single one made it off the Titanic alive .
Some Titanic Passengers
Made it off the Shipwreck Even though the Titanic took many lives , there were also many survivors who were lucky enough to have made it off the ship alive .
Their stories are very different , but most of them have a happy ending .
The ship ’s baker , Charles Joughnin , was reported have managed to survive in the extremely cold water , which killed most of the passengers ( at the time of the sinking , the sea temperature was only around 28° F ) , because he had drunk enough whiskey to keep him alive .
A Japanese passenger who was lucky enough to survive the accident did not receive a very warm welcome upon his return to Japan .
He was called a coward for not dying with the rest of the passengers .
And the last remaining survivor of the Titanic sinking , Millvina Dean , who was two months old at the time of the disaster , died on May 31 2009 , aged 97 .
Cancellations Saved Many Lives
That Would Have Been Lost on the Titanic Since traveling on the Titanic was one of the most exciting experiences of the era , absolutely everyone wanted to be on it – and therefore probably felt more than a little bad about missing the ship ’s departure .
However , Titanic facts show that those who missed out were actually very lucky .
Among the ticket holders who missed the journey were many famous names , such as Milton S. Hershey , founder of the chocolate firm , Guglielmo Marconi , an Italian inventor and electrical engineer , and Alfred Gwynne Vanderbilt , a businessman and sportsman , who died three years later on the RMS Lusitania .
Just 37 Seconds Passed between the Sighting of the Iceberg and the Collision Even though the sinking of the Titanic was a quite lengthy process , the first part happened rather quickly .
The iceberg was spotted on April 14 1912 at 11.40 PM by the lookout , Frederick Fleet , who yelled : “ Iceberg !
Right ahead ! ”
But it was too late – the ship crashed into the iceberg just 37 seconds later .
The Titanic started sinking , and eventually broke in two around 2.20 AM on April 15 .
It then sunk , sending all the passengers still on the board into the depths of the ocean .
All in all , it took the Titanic about 2 hours and 40 minutes to sink completely .

Both the Ship ’s Captain and First Officer Went Down with the Ship Together with most of the other members of the crew , the ship ’s captain Edward Smith and the first officer William McMaster Murdoch both died on the Titanic .
Smith ’s last words were : “ Well boys , you ’ve done your duty and done it well .
I ask no more of you .
I release you .
You know the rule of the sea .
It ’s every man for himself now , and God bless you . ”
A statue of Smith can be found in Lichfield , Staffordshire , and a memorial to Murdoch is located in his hometown of Dalbeattie , Kirkcudbrightshire , Scotland .
One Conspiracy Theory Claims the Titanic Tragedy Was an Insurance Scam
There are many controversial and mysterious Titanic facts , but the theory of the ship being sunk on purpose is definitely among the most popular ones .
Some people claim that the ship was sunk on purpose as a part of an insurance scam – but that the ship that sank was not the Titanic in the first place .
It was supposed to be in fact Titanic ’s sister ship the Olympic , which was disguised as Titanic .
The Olympic was a bit older than the Titanic , but very similar in appearance , so it could have easily posed as the Titanic .
The plan was supposedly to get rid of the Olympic , which had previously been involved in another accident and had been damaged beyond repair .
Sinking the Olympic and claiming it was the Titanic would have allowed the White Star Line to collect the full insurance value of the brand new vessel .
This means that the infamous Titanic could have been sailing around for years and years after its alleged sinking .
A 30 - Second Delay Was Responsible for the Sinking of Titanic The Titanic was a huge ship , so it was difficult to change its direction quickly – which was also the reason why nothing could have been done once the iceberg had been spotted .
But , as Titanic facts reveal , the difference between safety and disaster was really only a matter of seconds .
Had the iceberg been spotted only 30 seconds earlier , and had the order to change the course been given then , the Titanic could have avoided hitting the iceberg .
However , Titanic facts also suggest that changing the course of the ship at the moment of spotting the iceberg was not the best possible choice .
According to various sources , the Titanic might not have sunk if it hit the iceberg head first , which is what would have happened had the course not have been changed .
The Iceberg That Sank the Titanic Has Been around for about 3,000 Years
The iceberg that sank the Titanic was around 100 feet tall and it had originally been a part of a glacier in Greenland .
It was about 3,000 years old at the time of the accident .
Even though there are many icebergs floating around the oceans , the Titanic is actually the only ocean liner that has ever been sunk by an iceberg .
But that could change any time now , as ships today are more likely to encounter an iceberg than they were during the Titanic era .
A First Class Ticket Would Cost around $ 70,000 Today
The price back then was about $ 4,350 , which would be nearly $ 70,000 today .
This was the amount passengers had to pay for the most expensive first class ticket to New York .
It sounds a lot , but it was not much of a problem for most of the Titanic ’s passengers .
Its wealthiest passenger John Jacob Astor IV , an American businessman , investor and real estate builder , was worth an estimated $ 85 million when he died aboard the Titanic .
The Musicians Played for 2 Hours and 5 Minutes as the Ship Sank Much has been said about the musicians playing without stopping while the Titanic was sinking , and Titanic facts reveal that most of this is true .
The 8 musicians were employed by an agency and travelled on the Titanic as second class passengers .
They all died on the ship and , after the accident , their families were billed by their agency for the cost of the uniforms worn by the band members when they died .
This caused outrage in the media at the time .

The Wreck of the Titanic was Only Discovered in 1985
One of the most surprising Titanic facts reveals that it took 73 years to locate the remains of the once majestic Titanic .
There had been several attempts to find the ship ’s wreckage over the years , but they were unsuccessful .
Finally , the Titanic – or what was left of it – was found 13.2 miles from its last known location , 370 miles off the coast of Newfoundland .
The wreckage lies at around 12,500 feet below the surface of the ocean , but will not be there for much longer – according to scientists , a newly - discovered species of rust - eating bacteria will completely consume the remains of the Titanic in the next 20 years or so .
The Titanic has Inspired Many Movies
There have been hundreds of movies and documentaries about the Titanic ; the first one was called Saved From The Titanic and was released only 29 days after the sinking .
It was co-written by , and starred , a Titanic survivor named Dorothy Gibson .
The most controversial Titanic film was certainly the one commissioned by Joseph Goebbels in 1943 .
The plot of this movie discredited British and American businessmen and celebrated brave German passengers .
But the Titanic movie that has undoubtedly been the most successful is James Cameron ’s Titanic .
The movie , which was released in 1997 , grossed more than $ 2 billion and won 11 Oscars .
The budget for the filming was higher than the budget for building the Titanic itself .
The Titanic ’s Interior Resembled the Ritz Hotel in London Titanic facts reveal that the interior of the vessel was loosely based on the design of the Ritz hotel in London .
But the Titanic took things to the extreme : facilities available on board included luxuries such as a gym , a pool , a Turkish bath , a kennel for first class dogs , two libraries , and a squash court .
The most majestic ship in history even had its own newspaper called the Atlantic Daily Bulletin .
The Titanic Was n’t Very Environmentally Friendly
It was not too much of a concern back then , but the Titanic would be considered extremely eco-unfriendly these days .
The vessel burned around 600 tons of coal each day , which was hand shoveled into the furnaces by a team consisting of 176 men .
As a result of this coal burning , almost 100 tons of ash were released into the sea for every single day of sailing .
However , even though the Titanic burned so much coal , it only had three functioning funnels .
The fourth one was fake , and was only added to make the ship appear more powerful and to make it look symmetrical .
The Sinking of the Titanic Was Predicted 14 Years before It Actually Happened One of the most surprising Titanic facts reveals that the sinking of the Titanic was actually forecasted in advance .
In 1898 , 14 years prior to the sinking , Morgan Robertson wrote a book in which he described an “ unsinkable ” ship called the Titan , which collided with an iceberg and sank .
The Titanic Was Especially Unlucky for Some of Its Passengers
Even though sailing on the world - famous Titanic did not turn out to be a positive experience for any of its passengers , it was even worse for some .
One man who survived the sinking of a ship in 1871 and finally overcame his fears of sailing on a ship decided to give it another try ; tragically , he died in the sinking of the Titanic .

I got in touch with Sterling and asked some questions about cities …
What are some of the cities you find most interesting ?
Why ?
I go for Austin , Belgrade and Turin .
Because I hang out there enough
to have some idea of how they function .
I 'm also keen on the much
bigger cities of Berlin , London , and Mumbai , but in a more detached
way .
I 'm getting very interested in Sao Paolo lately .
What do you see as some of the more valuable aspects of
urbanization and some of the more dangerous ?
Well , the " valuable " aspect , or at least the interesting one , is that
bigger towns are getting much more " urban- informatic " lately .
There 's
a lot of innovation in the urban fabric these days .
Cities also seem
to have political energy in an era when nations are getting weaker
every day .
For instance , the UK is a creaking financial wreck while
Boris Johnson 's London is a freak scene .
The obviously dangerous aspect of modern cities is urban organized
crime , narcoterror , low - intensity warfare , war in urban terrain ,
favela shoot - 'em-ups , whatever faddish name the trouble has this year .
Baghdad , Mogadishu , Grozny .
But I 'd also like to point out that large financial centers in
certain cities around the planet are certainly going to kill millions
of us by destroying our social safety networks in the name of their
imaginary financial efficiency .
You 're a thousand times more likely to
die because of what some urban banker did in 2008 than from what some
Afghan - based terrorist did in 2001 .
* Financiers live in small , panicky urban cloisters , severely detached
from the rest of mankind .
They are living today in rich - guy ghetto
cults .
They are truly dangerous to our well - being , and they are
getting worse and more extremist , not better and more reasonable .
You 're not gonna realize this havoc till you see your elderly Mom
coughing in an emergency ward , but she 's going there for a reason .
Do you think governance can scale with the increasing size
of megacities like Jakarta , Tokyo , Sao Paulo , & New York ?
Or are such
cities doomed to increasing ferality ?
I do n't think urban scale is a truly serious problem .
Tokyo and
Jakarta share the same scale , but not the same problems .
There are
plenty of cities that are getting * smaller * and have some awful
problems , viz Detroit .
There are many cities that have outgrown their old infrastructure and
become huge squatter camps , but that 's not inherently a scaling
problem , it 's a management problem .
How do you think the psychogeography of the city might be
affecting identity and tribalism ?
Do you suspect the trend is more
towards collaboration or fragmentation ?
That word " psychogeography " probably means something , but guys who
use it go out on Situationist drifts and look for urban ley - lines .
I
do a lot of similar activity , but I do n't like to dignify it too much .
Modern large cities are the engines of globalization in the way that
New York used to be an engine of Americanization .
You look at New York
back in the 1800s , obviously collaboration and fragmentation were
going on there at the same time .
Little Italy , Little Ukraine ,
whatever … but those sharp distinctions tended to melt with time .
Cities that segregate their citizens into ghettos tend to go broke .
The infrastructure always ends up shaping people more than they think
it will .
Modern big city people tend to think and act like big-city
people anywhere .
A big-city New York guy sleeping in bus stations is
as poor as his brother , some Deep South sharecropper .
But the social
chasm between those two people is immense .
You talk about the favela chic expressions of the slums .
In
a world of increasing poverty do you see slums as incubators of the
future or more as casualities of the past ?
To tell the truth , the slums are probably just as various as the
cities .
The slums were caused to exist for all kinds of different bad
reasons .
But the slums sure as hell have the birthrate to be the
" incubator of the future . "
The slums are the nurseries of our planet .
Why we allowed ourselves to let that happen , I dunno , but it 's the
truth .
What , to you , are the most interesting possibilities of
augmented reality , good or bad , for life in the city ?
Oh , it 's all about those nifty little navigation apps .
They 've got
the means , motive and opportunity right now .
But you do n't really need
AR to do digital mapping of cities .
AR comes more into its own with
artsy , confrontational , bend - your - reality stuff .
Like the Layar app that " shows " you the Berlin
Wall in its fearsome glory as you are walking thoughtlessly through
modern Berlin .
Or the Museum of London " Streetmuseum "
i Phone app that pastes historic photographs of London over the modern
London you see in your iPhone screen .
Then there 's the chance of turning urban billboards interactive , and
augmenting them .
Not too much of that going on yet , but it 's a
super - interesting idea .
How come billboards are still so print - based
and static ?
With displays as cheap as they are , paper billboards
oughta be dying like newspapers .
Finally , what song or artist comes to mind in your personal
urban soundtrack ?
Two for the price of one : Ladytron , " High Rise " and " Fighting in
Built - Up Areas . "
A pro-Hamas news website reported Tuesday that captive Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit , who was snatched by Gaza militants in a cross - border raid in 2006 , has been watching the FIFA World Cup matches while in captivity in the Gaza Strip .

Shalit has been following the daily matches on the pro-Hamas al - Aqsa satellite channel , al - Resallah news reported .
Hamas and two other minor militant groups kidnapped Shalit in a raid between the southeastern Gaza Strip and Israel in June 2006 .
The report said watching the soccer matches helps Shalit forget his despair " after the Israeli government decided to suspend indirect talks to finalize the swap deal with Hamas . "
The report , which does not quote any sources within Hamas or among Shalit 's captors and reads like propaganda , claims that the abducted soldier is tired of the Israeli politicians ' lies and their false vows to secure his release , and therefore he is focusing on the World Cup games because he understands that the Israeli public is more focused on soccer than on him .
Egypt , and later Germany , had tried to finalize a prisoner exchange deal between Hamas and Israel .
However , the efforts collapsed after Hamas insisted that Israel free 1,000 Palestinian prisoners , including those who were directly involved in terror attacks against Israelis .
The report said Shalit , who holds French nationality , " was very sad when France was defeated by Mexico during the World Cup matches held in South Africa . "
While Microsoft ’s Kin was widely predicted to flop , a rumor is circulating on tech blogs and Twitter that Verizon only moved 500 units of the device in April and May .
All mentions of the rumor link back to one blog , and they do n’t cite a source for the stat , nor do they elaborate on if the figure is meant to be combined for Kin One and Kin Two or a standalone number for either device .
Electronista speculates on why sales figures could be so low for the Kin , if the number is in any way correct :
Unofficially , it ’s speculated that the lack of a smartphone OS but the insistence on charging for smartphone - level plans may have muted interest and driven customers to the Motorola Droid and other phones with now - similar prices but more features .
Most of Verizon ’s marketing is also heavily invested in its Android line .
In turn , Microsoft is focused primarily on shipping Windows Phone 7 for the end of the year .
Steve predicted as much back in May , prognosticating dismal sales figures due to pricey data plans and limited features :
It is a sweet spot that is totally ignored and with Verizon deciding to go for the money rather than the increased number of new ’ social ’ phones that could eventually be graduated up to the full smartphone .
In the process , what may actually have been a great idea from Microsoft , the KIN will be lucky to survive beyond its initial retail launch .
Even Apple and AT&T understood this sweet spot area when it came to the iPad which surprisingly AT&T has kept its promise ( so far ) of an unlimited data plan for a reasonable price .
Verizon on the other handle has basically stabbed Microsoft in the back with its myopic greed .
Microsoft has been mum on sales figures for the Kin One and Kin Two , but there do n’t seem to have been any Apple - like meltdowns in demand for the Kin .
Have you spotted a Kin in the wild ?
Can anyone confirm having purchased the device ?
NASA 's Dawn spacecraft , illustrated in this artist 's concept , is propelled by ion engines .
Image credit : NASA / JPL
( PhysOrg.com ) --
Deep in the heart of the asteroid belt , on its way to the first of the belt 's two most massive inhabitants , NASA 's ion-propelled Dawn spacecraft has eclipsed the record for velocity change produced by a spacecraft 's engines .
The previous standard - bearer for velocity change , NASA 's Deep Space 1 , also impelled by ion propulsion , was the first interplanetary spacecraft to use this technology .
The Deep Space 1 record fell on Saturday , June 5 , when the Dawn spacecraft 's accumulated acceleration over the mission exceeded 4.3 kilometers per second ( 9,600 miles per hour ) .
" We are using this amazing ion-engine technology as a stepping - stone to orbit and explore two of the asteroid belt 's most mysterious objects , Vesta and Ceres , " said Robert Mase , Dawn project manager from NASA 's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena , Calif .
A spacecraft 's change in velocity refers to its ability to change its path through space by using its own rocket engines .
This measurement of change begins only after the spacecraft exits the last stage of the launch vehicle that hurled it into space .
To get to where it is in both the record books and the asteroid belt , the Dawn spacecraft had to fire its three engines - one at a time -- for a cumulative total of 620 days .
In that time , it has used less than 165 kilograms ( 363 pounds ) of xenon propellant .
Over the course of its eight - plus - year mission , Dawn 's three ion engines are expected to accumulate 2,000 days of operation -- 5.5 years of thrusting -- for a total change in velocity of more than 38,620 kilometers per hour ( 24,000 miles per hour ) .
" I am delighted that it will be Dawn that surpasses DS1's record , " said Marc Rayman , chief engineer for the Dawn mission and a previous project manager for Deep Space 1 .
" It is a tribute to all those involved in the design and operations of this remarkable spacecraft . "
At first glance , Dawn 's pedal - to - the - metal performance is a not - so - inspiring 0 - to - 97 kilometers per hour ( 0 - to - 60 miles per hour ) in four days .
But due to its incredible efficiency , it expends only 37 ounces of xenon propellant during that time .
Then take into consideration that after those four days of full - throttle thrusting , it will do another four days , and then another four .
By the end of 12 days , the spacecraft will have increased its velocity by more than 290 kilometers per hour ( 180 miles per hour ) , with more days and weeks and months of continuous thrusting to come .
In one year 's time , Dawn 's ion propulsion system can increase the spacecraft 's speed by 8,850 kilometers per hour ( 5,500 miles per hour ) , while consuming the equivalent of only 16 gallons of fuel .
" This is a special moment for the spacecraft team , " said Dawn 's principal investigator , Chris Russell of the University of California Los Angeles .
" In only 407 days , our minds will be on another set of records , the data records that Dawn will transmit when we enter Vesta orbit . "
Dawn 's 4.8 - billion - kilometer ( 3 - billion - mile ) odyssey includes exploration of asteroid Vesta in 2011 and 2012 , and the dwarf planet Ceres in 2015 .
These two icons of the asteroid belt have been witness to much of our solar system 's history .
By using the same set of instruments at two separate destinations , scientists can more accurately formulate comparisons and contrasts .
Dawn 's science instrument suite will measure shape , surface topography and tectonic history , elemental and mineral composition , as well as seek out water - bearing minerals .
In addition , the way the Dawn spacecraft orbits both Vesta and Ceres will be used to measure the celestial bodies ' masses and gravity fields .
While Dawn surpassed Deep Space 1's record for velocity change , Deep Space 1 will continue to reign as holder for the longest duration of powered spaceflight for another few months .
Dawn is expected to take over that record on about August 10 of this year .

The Royal College of Art 's summer graduate show is a pretty reliable source of new talent .
Last year 's highlights included Min-Kyu Choi 's folding 240V mains plug , which Wired featured last August , and Dominic Hargreaves ' fold - up bicycle -- two radically different but equally smart takes on space - saving foldable product designs .
Last week I had a sneak preview of the graduate show for the design interactions course , in the company of department head Anthony Dunne .
There 's a definite playful vibe this year -- the show is less about tech - driven products designed to be marketed as it is about provoking thoughts , debates and ( very often ) smiles .
And oh boy , there 's material here to smile at .
Some examples :

Hiromi Ozaki has designed a " Menstruation machine " -- a wearable metal suit that allows a boy " to experience the painful bleeding of menstruation " ( video embedded below ) .
Yep , the suit is designed to release blood stored in its reservoir over the course of the cycle .
Hiromi lives her musical life as Sputniko ! – and if you hear her Google Song once , it ’s a certainty that you ’ll be humming it a week later .
Then there 's the Floppy Legs Portable Hard Drive , by James Chambers -- a portable disk drive that stands up if it detects liquids nearby ( it uses an Arduino microcontroller with servo motors ) .
It 's part of Chambers 's project to conceptualise how technology would evolve if in the natural world .
So he 's created The Attenborough Design Group ( named after Sir David ) to develop a bunch of imagined products that would adapt to changing circumstances .
These include the Gesundheit Radio , which sneezes occasionally to expel potentially damaging dust ; and the AntiTouch Lamp , which sways away if you get too close to its delicate halogen bulb .

Other projects on show include Display of Affection , by Helge Fischer , in which a furry camera imposes an image of a woman 's hand stroking people seen through the lens .
Why ?
Some people shy away from social interaction , so this device " lets you virtually caress neighbours or strangers on the street from the safety of your home " .
Oh , and there 's also a Device For Experiencing Lightning Strike , by Andrew Friend ... which does what it says on the box .
These are all conceived as " probable , preferable , plausible and possible futures " , according to Dunne .
" We need to move beyond designing for the way things are now and begin to design for how things could be , imagining alternative possibilities and different ways of being , and giving tangible form to new values and priorities . "

Exemptions
Okay .
So what ?
Do you see the problem with these production bikes ?
See if you can find it before I give it away below the photos .
This belt drive singlespeed from Lynskey , however , is perfectly legit .
This Trek District is also legal .
This Bianchi Pista is probably legal to sell .
Have you spotted the problem , yet ?
In the United States , the Consumer Product Safety Commission produces the regulations for bicycle safety .
Any bike sold here must meet the standards published under the Requirements for Bicycles .
These regulations are the reason every bike must be sold with a spoke protector , reflectors , brakes , instruction manuals , and warning stickers cautioning owners not to overtighten the handlebar stem .
Chainguards are a requirement for " bicycles having a single front sprocket and a single rear sprocket . "
That seems to mean that every singlespeed bike and every bike with internal hub gearing -- including that sweet singlespeed 29er , your urban fixed gear tarck bike , and the very useful Strida folding bike with belt drive -- is required by Federal law to be sold with a chainguard .
This standard dates back 1973 , when the nascent CPSC identified the bicycle as the ) .
If the CPSC narratives can be believed , one problem is the little darlings apparently kept jamming their foot into the chain , wrecking the bike and injuring themselves in the process .
John Forester , among others , has expressed his disdain for CPSC accident investigations
The CPSC only regulates the sale of new bikes .
You can modify it however you want after the sale , which is why so many people remove thespoke protector and reflectors from their derailleur bikes after purchase .
What about the Lynskey , the Trek District , and the Bianchi Pista ?
Why do n't those bikes break the law ?
The Lynskey is a custom made , built to order bicycle .
" One of a kind " bikes like the Lynskey are specifically exempted from CPSC bicycle regulations .
If you look close at Trek 's district , you 'll see a little vestigial chainguard that likely meets the minimal requirements for a chainguard .
Finally , the Bianchi Pista is a real track bike , meant for racing on the velodrome .
" Track bicycles designed and intended for competition that have tubular tires , a single crank –to - wheel ratio and no freewheeling feature are exempt , " according to the CPSC regs .
I put that bike under " maybe " because the Pista is spec'd with clinchers , not tubulars , but the CPSC fails to define " tubular tires " in their regs so maybe Bianchi and every other track bike vendor can get away with this .
This does n't directly affect us as consumers .
The CPSC rules are only for those in the bike supply chain .
If the CPSC ever decides to enforces this chainguard rule , it will increase costs for the bike companies that will probably be passed on to you .
The chance of a product recall affecting singlespeed mountain bikes seems silly , but the CPSC forced Cannondale to issue a recall last year when Cannondale forgot to include spoke protectors on some of their road bikes .
Maybe the bike companies are working behind the scenes to update the CPSC regulations .
When the chainguard requirement was written in 1973 , children bikes were n't equipped with derailluers , while adult bikes generally were .
I imagine the rationale was that adults typically know better than to stick small appendages into moving bike parts .
Simple adult " city " bikes and singlespeed mountain bikes are big categories these days , and the increasing popularity of belt drives reduces much of the need for a chain guard .
What do you think ?
Should the bike industry push the CPSC to modify their regulations ?
Or should they continue to operate on the down low and hope the Feds continue to ignore them ?
British news agency Reuters has cropped out knives and blood traces from at least two photos distributed by the IHH organization and showing the Navy raid on the Gaza - bound Marmara ship , the " Little Green Footballs " blog claimed .
Photos released by Turkish daily Hurriyet were distributed to foreign media by the news agencies .
While Associated Press issued the photos untouched , Reuters cut the pictures thereby concealing the image of one of the boat 's assailants holding a knife as well as a pool of blood .
" That ’s a very interesting way to crop the photo , " the blog stated .
" Most people would consider that knife an important part of the context .
Cropping out a knife , in a picture showing a soldier who ’s apparently been stabbed , seems like a very odd editorial decision .
Unless someone was trying to hide it . "
In a later post , the blog shows a second photo which appeared to have been cropped as well .
In this case too a knife held by one of the attackers was edited out .
" Now we have two pictures from the ' peace activists ' that were cropped by someone at Reuters to remove knives in the hands of the activists , as they attempted to take soldiers hostage , " the blog noted .
In response Reuters stressed that they did not intentionally edit the photos but innocently cut them in way that left the margins out .
The agency also removed the photos from its server and replaced them with the pictures in their original form .
This is not the first instance in which Reuters has been found tampering with pictures .
During the Second Lebanon
War the news agency admitted to graphically editing a picture of Lebanon and adding in smoke above the houses shown .
The Little Green Footballs blog exposed the matter in that case too .
DETROIT -- The Detroit Red Wings ' earliest playoff exit in four years is certain to spawn gloom and doom in a fair amount of stories chronicling the end of an era .
The analyses , which tend to be from national media , will conclude the Red Wings are past their prime .
Too old , too slow , too soft and destined for mediocrity .
How many times has that been written over the years ?
Everyone wants to be the first to document the downfall of the closest thing the NHL has witnessed to a dynasty in the past two decades .
Once again , the reports of their demise will be greatly exaggerated .
The Red Wings were eliminated by a fresher , motivated , well - coached , more disciplined and talented San Jose Sharks club .
The length of the series ( five games ) was deceptive .
Detroit competed and had a chance to win every game in the third period .
But the Sharks delivered in the clutch .
Does it signal a passing of the torch in the Western Conference ?
Perhaps .
The Red Wings might not be the best team in the league next season , but if Nicklas Lidstrom returns , they 'll be Stanley Cup contenders .
" We still got a great team , " defenseman Brad Stuart said .
" One of the good things for this team was some of the younger guys got a chance to play a little more when some guys were injured .
That 'll help their development .
We still got a good outlook here . "
A LOOK AHEAD The Red Wings have 14 players signed for 2010 - 11 at $ 43.6 million .
The salary cap is expected to be roughly $ 58 million .
( Figures listed are cap numbers ) :
FORWARDS
• Pavel Datsyuk ( $ 6.7 million )
• Henrik Zetterberg ( $ 6.083 million )
• Johan Franzen ( $ 3.955 million )
• Valtteri Filppula ( $ 3 million )
• Jiri Hudler ( $ 2.875 million )
• Dan Cleary ( $ 2.8 million )
• Kris Draper ( $ 1.583 million )
DEFENSEMEN
• Brian Rafalski ( $ 6 million )
• Brad Stuart ( $ 3.75 million )
• Niklas Kronwall ( $ 3 million )
• Jonathan Ericsson ( $ 900,000
• Jakub Kindl ( $ 883,333 )
GOALTENDERS
• Chris Osgood ( $ 1.417 million )
• Jimmy Howard ( $ 717,000 )
Restricted free agents : Forwards Justin Abdelkader , Patrick Eaves , Darren Helm , Drew Miller and Mattias Ritola ; defenseman Derek Meech .
Unrestricted free agents : Forwards Todd Bertuzzi , Tomas Holmstrom , Kirk Maltby , Brad May and Jason Williams ; defensemen Doug Janik , Brett Lebda , Andreas Lilja and Nicklas Lidstrom .
The Red Wings have too much talent not to be a top four team in their conference .
If Lidstrom retires , it would be a huge blow .
He is irreplaceable .
But at least the Red Wings would have some money to spend on free agents .
And they still would have enough skill and depth to at least make the playoffs for the 20th consecutive season .
" I believe in this group .
I believe in the management .
We always find a way to have a good team , " center Henrik Zetterberg said .
" We have great owners that really want to have a strong team .
The future still looks good . "
Do n't expect too many offseason changes .
Why overhaul a team that was so dominant when it had all its pieces in place , finishing the regular season on a 17 - 2 - 3 run ?
Their biggest addition might be diminutive forward Jiri Hudler , back from a one - year stint in Russia .
He will bolster their offense .
The Red Wings have 14 players signed for 2010 - 11 at a salary - cap hit of $ 43.6 million , including top defense prospect Jakub Kindl , who will join the team after three seasons with the AHL's Grand Rapids Griffins .
Add to that restricted free agents Darren Helm , Justin Abdelkader , Patrick Eaves , Drew Miller , Derek Meech and Mattias Ritola .
Unrestricted free agent Tomas Holmstrom definitely will be back .
Todd Bertuzzi and Andreas Lilja might be re-signed .
If Lidstrom returns and they do n't trade or waive anybody who already is signed , that 's 24 players , one over the limit .
So this team is sure to have a familiar look next season .
And why not ?
It has a strong core of players still in their prime , including a trio of stars in Zetterberg , Pavel Datsyuk and Johan Franzen .
How many clubs in the West , other than San Jose and Chicago , are that top - heavy ?
Valtteri Filppula has untapped potential .
Holmstrom , even at 37 , will remain one of the top net - front players in the game .
Dan Cleary is capable of returning to his 20 - goal form of 2007 - 08 and ' 08-09 .
If Lidstrom returns , the Red Wings will continue to boast one of the strongest top four on defense in the league , with Brian Rafalski , Niklas Kronwall and Stuart .
Jimmy Howard 's first playoff action was a learning experience .
He was inconsistent at times and allowed some soft goals .
But he also stepped up big at times .
He figures to build on a strong rookie season .
" We had an unbelievable push just to get in the playoffs , " coach Mike Babcock said .
" You got to give our guys credit .
They worked hard .
It was one of those years where we were hurt a lot .
Maybe we have n't had this time to train that other teams have had .
We 'll get that now and we 'll be back trying to battle and get ourselves in a situation so we can win . "
In this age of parity in the NHL , the Red Wings remain ahead of the curve .
Write them off at your own risk .
Shane Bauer and Sarah Shourd , two of the three Americans held in Iran on suspicion of spying , have got engaged to each other in Tehran 's Evin jail and will marry once they are released , their mothers said today .
Bauer , Shourd and Josh Fattal have been jailed since their arrest in July 2009 along Iran 's border with Iraq .
Their families say the three were hiking in Iraq and strayed over the border accidentally .
Iran accuses them of being spies .
Bauer , 27 , proposed to Shourd , 31 , using an improvised ring he wove together with threads from his shirt , the mothers said in a joint statement .
The mothers travelled to Iran last week to visit their adult children for the first time since their arrest .
Fattal , 27 , will serve as best man at the wedding , the mothers said .
" Shane told me that he proposed to Sarah in the yard of Evin prison on 6 January , the very same day that we applied for our visas to go visit them , " Cindy Hickey , Bauer 's mother , said in the statement .
" We 're all so overjoyed at the news but it 's obviously impossible to know when the wedding will take place .
We just hope and pray that Iran will do the right thing and release them so they can get on with their lives , " she added .
Iran 's intelligence minister , Heydar Moslehi , said on Sunday he had no doubt the three were spies and called on the US to propose a prisoner swap to secure their release , the semi-official Fars news agency reported .
Their imprisonment has further complicated relations between the US and Iran over the latter 's nuclear ambitions .
US officials have called the three " innocent tourists " and demanded their release but have said they are not considering any kind of prisoner swap .
The mothers told ABC's Good Morning America programme today it was an enormous relief to see their children but that the three had not been told anything about the status of charges against them .
" They are very unaware of anything going on with their case , " Hickey said on the show .
The women used last week 's visit to plead with the Iranian government to release their children , but they told ABC they did not meet with high - ranking officials , only low - ranking handlers .
The three Americans appeared generally healthy , the mothers said .
Bauer and Fattal share a cell , the mothers said .
Shourd is being held alone , but is able to see the others twice a day for 30 minutes , they added .
“ Single acts of tyranny may be ascribed to the accidental opinion of a day ; but a series of oppressions , begun at a distinguished period , and pursued unalterably thro ’ every change of ministers , too plainly prove a deliberate , systematical plan of reducing us to slavery . ”
~ Thomas Jefferson , 1774
For at least 40 years , modern proponents minarchy and anarchy have argued that we can eliminate many , if not all government functions and replace them with self - governance .
Some do this by appealing to the imagination of their audiences .
Robert Heinlein was particularly good at this .
Some have chronicled current and past attacks on liberty to which government inevitably turns .
A wide variety of proposals have been offered as a means to fashion freer societies including the creation of new political parties .
Some have even acted upon this advice .
The Libertarian , Green , Constitution , Peace and Freedom , Reform and many other parties have been formed over the last 40 years .
Government responded exactly like one should expect .
It crafted laws making it nearly impossible for the new parties to effectively compete .
Some have argued over the very morality of voting .
Some suggest that voting a certain way will promote liberty .
However , very few writers in the modern era have suggested that we may have all of the tools we require to drastically reduce the size and scope of government without ever casting a vote .
Whether or not you are philosophically inclined toward libertarianism or anarchy , it ’s hard not to agree that voting for politicians has been an unmitigated disaster if you measure success by limitations placed on government as a result .
I speak from a particularly American perspective , but I think this statement could apply anywhere .
If it is the U.S. federal government or a particular state , the size and scope of government continues to increase .
Other than the possibility of catastrophic failure , the horizon does not indicate a change in this trend .
The U.S. Debt is now at 94 % of its GDP .
We have witnessed in recent months the growth in anti-government sentiment that even the mainstream media can’t ignore but that our elected officials ignore with apparent impunity .
Voting is the least effective way to affect change .
Legislatures react slowly to objections against tyranny that they have n’t created and even slower to that which they have .
In Texas for instance , the legislature meets only once every other year .
When a bad law is passed , Texans have to wait two years for a repeal , “ reform ” or nullification assuming that elections netted lawmakers inclined to provide relief .
I ’m not sure this has ever happened in Texas ’ history .
In the meantime , several hundred citizens may have been prosecuted and punished while her citizens wait for another election cycle .
The examples are almost too numerous to list where voters have attempted to change policy only to find that the politicians are not so inclined once in office .
1994 , a year that seemed to hold so much promise , proved to be another bait and switch .
It produced a republican majority in the House of Representatives arriving by way of anti-government sentiment prevalent at the time .
But the results were a major disappointment .
Despite promises to balance the budget and reduce spending , government continued to grow at an alarming rate .
Apologies for the negative waves , but the discussion surrounding voting is itself a red herring .
The framers of our government never intended voting to be as important as its modern - day proponents and antagonists suggest .
It is fashionable to say that the Constitution created a government replete with “ checks and balances ” but it is probably better to characterize them as safety valves .
For instance , impeachment .
Ben Franklin described impeachment as a way to prevent assassinations .
Pressure , release .
Each body of government was to have its own distinct duties but in case tyranny were to flourish , safety valves were added to reduce the necessity of violence as remedy .
The 6th amendment to the constitution was one such safety valve .
It states simply :
In all criminal prosecutions , the accused shall enjoy the right to a speedy and public trial , by an impartial jury of the State and district wherein the crime shall have been committed , which district shall have been previously ascertained by law , and to be informed of the nature and cause of the accusation ; to be confronted with the witnesses against him ; to have compulsory process for obtaining witnesses in his favor , and to have the Assistance of Counsel for his defence .
The word jury , at the time this amendment was drafted , had a far different meaning than it is accorded today .
The first instructions given a jury by a Supreme Court of the United States were delivered by then Justice John Jay ( yes , a jury trial in the Supreme Court ) :
“ It is presumed , that juries are the best judges of facts ; it is , on the other hand , presumed that courts are the best judges of law .
But still both objects are within your power of decision … you have a right to take it upon yourselves to judge of both , and to determine the law as well as the fact in controversy . "
~ State of Georgia vs. Brailsford ( 3 Dall 1 ) .
In reading dictionaries of that era , you will find that John Jay was not inventing something out of thin air .
A Jury was defined as a body of men who were expected to judge both the law and the facts in criminal cases .
In fact , by the time that Jay gave these instructions , the jury ’s role as judge of law and fact had already seen it ’s five hundredth birthday come and go .
Rather than leave the citizens naked against legislatures intent on “ reducing us to slavery , " the jury provides an immediate and legal means to strike down unjust laws and repudiate prosecutors and judges who have used just laws to persecute their constituents .
This was deliberate and intentional .
“ I consider trial by jury as the only anchor ever yet imagined by man , by which a government can be held to the principles of its constitution . ” ~ Thomas Jefferson in a letter to Thomas Paine , 1789 .
This speaks directly to just whom is empowered to interpret the constitution .
The jury is not only a wonderful backstop to belligerent legislatures and prosecutors , but also against judges who presume to interpret the constitutions in a way contrary to common sense and reason .
Clearly , Jefferson at least , never intended that the interpretation of our constitutions be limited to judicial review .
Reading the intent any other way is to employ circular reasoning ; the authority to judge the legitimacy of government actions is the sole authority of government itself .
Statists assert that only the Supreme Court and its district subordinates decide what is and is n’t constitutional .
If you thought voting was slow to change government ’s direction , how about waiting up to 12 years as your case travels up the district and circuit court food - chain before it is heard by the SCOTUS ?
And maybe then only to be told that the government is allowed to deny your rights by way of some invented “ compelling interest . "
No .
That was never the intended outcome .
If a juror feels that the statute involved in any criminal offence is unfair , or that it infringes upon the defendant ’s natural god - given unalienable or constitutional rights , then it is his duty to affirm that the offending statute is really no law at all and that the violation of it is no crime at all , for no one is bound to obey an unjust law . ” ~ Chief Justice Harlan F. Stone
Consider that the right to have your case placed in front of a jury is , ipso facto , the right to sit on juries .
Today we tend to dread the summons for jury duty .
It takes time .
Some cases have been known to take months .
In fact , you will see quite a few libertarian types brag that the way to get out of jury duty is to simply declare that you know your rights .
It ’s true .
Judges and prosecutors wither from juries aware of their rights .
And they will do anything , including lying to your face , to prevent you from exercising your prerogative .
From the inception of the United States until 1895 , courts as a routine informed the juries that they had a right and duty to judge the law as well as the facts .
In 1895 , that changed dramatically .
In Sparf and Hansen v. United States , the Supreme Court addressed jury nullification directly for the first and only time .
The court acknowledged that the jury had the right to judge the law , but it also ruled that judges did n’t have to inform them of this right .
And the judges and prosecutors rejoiced .
You see , up until that time , a great number of tyrannical designs had been neutered by juries .
Slavery , prohibition , sedition laws , death penalties ….
all of these and more have been abolished in the jury box .
Where the ballot box created such messes , the jury box cleaned them up .
The ammo box could afford to gather dust a little longer .
There are scholars lately focused on legislative tools , nullification and interposition .
However , these not only rely upon the ballot box , but have also historically been the follow - on to jury nullification rather than a pre-cursor .
The legislative nullification of fugitive slave laws came after juries nullified them , rather than before .
In essence , the legislatures were merely formalizing what had already been accomplished by jurors rather than leading the charge to erase tyranny .
An Essay On The Trial ... Spooner , Lysander Check Amazon for Pricing .
The same can be said of prohibition , nullified even after judges stopped informing juries of their right to judge law .
The final legislative repeal of the 21st amendment was a mere formality .
The government found it virtually impossible to convict and thus it went about saving face while throwing in the towel .
Can you imagine any similar outcome as a result of voting ?
If so you have a vivid imagination because such has never happened in our relatively brief history .
“ For more than six hundred years — that is , since Magna Carta , in 1215 — there has been no clearer principle of English or American constitutional law , than that , in criminal cases , it is not only the right and duty of juries to judge what are the facts , what is the law , and what was the moral intent of the accused ; but that it is also their right , and their primary and paramount duty , to judge the justice of the law , and to hold all laws invalid , that are , in their opinion , unjust or oppressive , and all persons guiltless in violating , or resisting the execution of , such law . ” ~ Lysander Spooner , The Right of Juries
To really understand the principle of individual sovereignty , one only has to examine the history ( pdf ) of jury nullification .
Every principle of self - government is embodied in the act of individuals using common sense and reason to repudiate those who would seek to control them under color of law .
Both civil disobedience and its inextricable mate , jury nullification , are all the individual needs to restore the rightful role of government to protect , rather than destroy an individual ’s liberty .
Those who complain that we have no tools but for voting or revolution are dead wrong and it ’s time to nullify this erroneous thinking .
Rather than take to the streets waving cardboard , seekers of liberty should direct themselves post - haste to their nearest court house and volunteer to sit on a jury .
And make no mistake , if the judges and prosecutors are willing to blatantly lie in order to keep you off of a jury , it is not only moral for you to lie your way onto that jury , but your duty should it be required .
Because they will lie and when the court reviews the judge ’s instructions that a juror may not judge the law , they will not hesitate to find in the judge ’s favor .
Do not fret that you live in a community of people who enjoy servitude .
It only takes one juror to hang a verdict .
If we allow the one effective tool of liberation to be atrophied and marginalized by statists and naysayers , there will be only one option left , and it wo n’t be a voting booth .

MultiMethods for Python
Every once and a while the topic of multimethods ( also known as generic dispatch ) comes up in the Python world ( see here , and here , here too , and finally here , and probably others ) .
For those of you who are n’t familiar with the concept , the idea is that you declare a bunch of functions with the same name , but that take different arguments and the language routes your calls to that function to the correct implementation , based on what types you ’re calling it with .
For example here ’s a C++ example :
# include < iostream > void special ( int k ) { std :: cout << " I AM THE ALLMIGHTY INTEGER " << k << std :: endl ; } void special ( std :: string k ) { std :: cout << " I AM THE ALLMIGHTY STRING " << k << std :: endl ; } int main ( ) { special ( 42 ) ; special ( " magic " ) ; return 0 ; }
As you can probably guess this will print out :
I AM THE ALLMIGHTY INTEGER 3 I AM THE ALLMIGHTY STRING magic
You , the insightful reader , are no doubt fuming in your seats now , “ Alex , you idiot , Python functions do n’t have type signatures , how can we route our calls based on something that does not exist ! " , and right you are .
However , do n’t tell me you ’ve never written a function that looks like :
def my_magic_function ( o ) : if isinstance ( o , basestring ) : return my_magic_function ( int (o ) ) elif isinstance (o , ( int , long ) ) : return cache [ o ] else : return o
Or something like that , the point is you have one function that has a couple of different behaviors based on the type of it ’s parameter .
Perhaps it ’d be nice to separate each of those behaviors into their own function ( or not , I do n’t really care what you do ) .
I was saying that a bunch of people have already implemented these , why am I ?
Mostly for fun ( that ’s still a valid reason , right ? ) , but also because a bunch of the implementations make me sad .
Some of them use crazy hacks ( reading up through stack frames ) , a few of them have global registrys , and all of them rely on the name of the function to identify a single “ function ” to be overloaded .
However , they also all have one good thing in common : decorators , yay !
My implementation is pretty simple , so I ’ll present it , and it ’s test suite without explanation :
class MultiMethod ( object ) : def __init__ ( self ) : self .
_implementations = {} def _get_predicate ( self , o ) : if isinstance ( o , type ) : return lambda x : isinstance( x , o ) assert callable ( o ) return o def register ( self , * args , ** kwargs ) : def inner ( f ) : key = ( args , tuple ( kwargs . items ( ) ) , ) if key in self .
_implementations : raise TypeError ( " Duplicate registration for %r " % key ) self .
_implementations [key ] = f return self return inner def __call__ ( self , * args , ** kwargs ) : for spec , func in self .
_implementations . iteritems ( ) : arg_spec , kwarg_spec = spec kwarg_spec = dict ( kwarg_spec ) if len( args ) != len( arg_spec ) or set ( kwargs ) != set ( kwarg_spec ) : continue if ( all ( self . _get_predicate ( spec ) ( arg ) for spec , arg in zip ( arg_spec , args ) ) and all ( self . _get_predicate ( spec ) ( kwargs[k ] ) for k , spec in kwarg_spec . iteritems ( ) ) ) : return func ( * args , ** kwargs ) raise TypeError ( " No implementation with a spec matching : %r , %r " % ( args , kwargs ) )
And the tests :
import unittest2 as unittest from multimethod import MultiMethod class MultiMethodTestCase ( unittest . TestCase ) : def test_basic ( self ) : items = MultiMethod ( ) @items .
register ( list ) def items ( l ) : return l @items .
register ( dict ) def items ( d ) : return d . items ( ) self . assertEqual ( items ( [ 1 , 2 , 3 ] ) , [ 1 , 2 , 3 ] ) # TODO : dict ordering dependent , 1 item dict ?
self . assertEqual ( items ( { " a " : 1 , " b " : 2 } ) , [ ( " a " , 1 ) , ( " b " , 2 ) ] ) with self . assertRaises ( TypeError ) : items ( xrange ( 3 ) ) def test_duplicate ( self ) : m = MultiMethod ( ) @m.register ( list ) def m ( o ) : return o with self . assertRaises ( TypeError ) : @m.register ( list ) def m ( o ) : return o if __name__ == " __main__ " : unittest . main ( )
Bon appétit .
Petraeus Backs July 2011 Afghanistan Withdrawal Timetable
David Petraeus says he supports the President 's Afghanistan policy , including the withdrawal timetable , but that means less than most people think it does .
Doug Mataconis · · No comments
Just in case there was any doubt where General Petraeus stood on the July 2011 withdrawal date that President Obama had previously announced , he seemed to pretty clearly state he was on board with the idea today :
Washington ( CNN ) — Gen. David Petraeus told CNN on Thursday that he supports President Barack Obama ’s July 2011 deadline to start withdrawing U.S. troops from Afghanistan , a key point of contention between the president and many of his Republican critics in Congress .
Petraeus — tapped to replace Gen. Stanley McChrystal as the U.S. commander in Afghanistan — also expressed his respect and appreciation for McChrystal ’s work and said the circumstances surrounding the change in command are “ sad . ”
Obama relieved McChrystal of his duties Wednesday after the general and his staff made comments in a Rolling Stone magazine article that appear to mock top administration officials .
(…) Petraeus ’ remarks to CNN ’s Dana Bash and Ted Barrett were his first public comments since being chosen as the new U.S. military chief for the Afghan conflict .
The Senate Armed Services Committee is set to begin his confirmation hearings Tuesday morning .
“ I support the president ’s policy , and I will also provide the best professional military advice as we conduct assessments , ” Petraeus said .
The general said it ’s a privilege to serve .
“ It ’s obviously a hugely important mission , ” he said .
Video :
I asked him if he sees himself doing anything to change the 2011 deadline to begin troop withdrawal .
We ’ve heard , already , Republicans are saying that they hope he does away with it .
Democrats are saying , “ No , no , no , we ’ve got to keep it . ”
The answer was , “ No . No .
As I said , I support the president ’s policy and I will also provide the best professional military advice as we conduct assessments . ”
This really should n’t come as surprise because it ’s doubtful that Obama would have appointed a Commanding General who did n’t support his policy on the war .
At the same time , though , it should be remembered that July 2011 is only the beginning of the withdrawal .
Neither Obama , nor McChrystal , nor Petraeus have said anything about how long that withdrawal will take place , or even that it will be a complete withdrawal of all American troops .
If the Pentagon announces in July 2011 that a single brigade is being sent home , then it will have met the President ’s deadline .
Yea , I know it does n’t make any sense , but , as James has detailed in numerous posts here over the past several years , there ’s very little about our current strategy in Afghanistan that makes sense anymore .

The public library is a phenomena that to this day I still ca n’t get over .
Free knowledge , for anyone .
Literally , anyone .
I ca n’t think of an equivalent other than going to a clothing store , “ checking out ” an outfit , wearing the outfit and returning it in four weeks , free of charge .
Except books are so much better than clothes .
Recently I ’ve been on a huge reading kick , checking out anything I can get my hands on in the library .
I ’ve found that no matter what I read , the act of reading every day has helped me in nearly every aspect of my life .
Here are a few of my favorite ways that reading has improved my quality of life , and will definitely improve yours .
1. Enhanced Smarts
Wow , this may be the most obvious statement of the post , right ?
Well , it turns out that reading helps in almost every area of smarts .
Those that read have higher GPA ’s , higher intelligence , and general knowledge than those that do n’t .
In Anne E. Cunningham ’s paper What Reading Does for the Mind ( pdf version ) , she found that reading , in general , makes you smarter , and it keeps you sharp as you age .
No matter what you ’re wanting to do or become , you ca n’t do it without more knowledge .
Reading is an excellent way to get where you ’re wanting to go .
2. Reading reduces stress
When I ’m reading a book , my mind shifts gears .
Where I might have a had a stressful day , a book can easily distract me .
Fiction is fantastic for this .
Reading an awesome fiction book is perfect right before bed time .
Though sometimes it ’s hard to put the book down if it ’s really good .
Still , you ’ll be relaxed ;)

3. Greater tranquility
Reading can soothe like no other .
Given that I ’m a pretty high - energy person , reading forces me to sit and be still .
This daily act of making myself be quiet and still has been nothing short of miraculous for my anxiety and my “ fidgety factor ” .
Lisa
Bu has a fantastic TED talk about how reading can open you mind .
It ’s only 6 minutes and well worth a watch .
4. Improved analytical thinking
That ’s right , ladies and germs .
Cunningham ’s studies have found that analytical thinking is boosted by reading .
Readers improve their general knowledge , and more importantly are able to spot patterns quicker .
If you can spot patterns quicker , your analytical skills receive a boost .
5. Increased vocabulary
Photo by Photo by thejbird
It ’s no secret that reading increases your vocabulary and improves your spelling , but did you know that reading increases your vocabulary more than talking or direct teaching ?
Reading forces us to look at words that we might not have seen or heard recently at the pub .
In fact , language in children ’s books are likely to be more sophisticated than your average conversation .
Increased vocabulary is especially crucial for bloggers or writers .
All successful writers will tell you that in order to write well , you need to read .
Every day .
You ’ll be surprised at the words you start incorporating into your writing .
A beefier vocabulary is n’t just for writers though .
Knowing what other people are saying and using the perfect words to convey your feelings is a critical part of being a better human .
Better listeners are more successful in life .
( Side note :
If you ’re concerned with your well - being at previously mentioned pub , you might lay off the more obnoxious terms you ’ve picked up . )
6. Improved memory
I have an awful memory .
Just ask my fiancee .
I usually ca n’t remember what I ’ve eaten for breakfast , let alone things like names and address .
Yet I ’ve been finding that I can remember stuff much easier when I ’ve been reading consistently .
Do I have any scientific data to match this up ?
Not really .
But I ’d say it ’s a pretty safe bet that reading has somehow given me memory mojo .
7. Improved writing skills
This is n’t much of a stretch , considering that reading improves vocabulary and critical thinking .
I feel like a better writer , as I ’m constantly surrounding myself with works from people who are better than me .
That ’s why English classes in High School make you read “ the classics ” .
That ’s why art students learn to copy masterpieces , so they know what creating something incredible should feel like .
The more you read , the better of a writer you ’ll become .

8. Helps prioritize goals
Many times we ’re certain we know what we “ really want ” in life .
Yet I ’ve found that activities like reading show me things I did n’t know about myself .
My mind will drift to things that I ’d really like to do , and it is n’t long that these little lapses in reading start to cycle .
The same sort of goals keep popping into my head , allowing me to see what I really want to do .
For example , I ’ve been playing music on a consistent basis , but I ’ve always wanted to produce and distribute my own music .
As I ’ve been reading , I ’ve found that song ideas and other general thoughts on music keep popping into my head .
It ’s my times reading that have really pushed me into giving music a serious go .
When you remove yourself from your work environment , you ’ll start to see things that you might really want to do , that you ’re not doing yet .
Reading gives you a chance for your mind to wander .
No time to read ?
No money for books ?
If you think that you do n’t have enough time to start reading , you ’re wrong .
How do I know ?
Because we make time for the things that are important to us .
How much TV do you watch ?
How much time do you spend trawling the web ?
You could easily replace reading with those activities .
If you ’re worried about the cost of books , check ’em out at the local library .
Most libraries take advantage of the interlibrary loan system , so you can check out nearly any book on the planet .
I also use Worldcat to find libraries in the area that might have my book .
There ’s really no excuse to start reading on a regular basis .
The benefits far outweigh the costs , and more knowledge never hurt anybody .

A man has been taken to hospital with head and chest injuries after a large brick was thrown through the windscreen of a truck on the Monash Freeway early this morning .
The 23 - kilogram bluestone brick was thrown from a footbridge near the Warrigal Road exit in Oakleigh and struck a passenger in the truck about 1:00 am ( AEST ) .
The truck was travelling around 100 kilometres per hour at the time .
Sergeant Andrew Douglas says it is " mindblowing " that no one was killed in the attack .
" It was just very fortunate that [ the brick ] actually struck just in the middle of the two passengers , " he said .
" It has not hit them flush in the chest , because if that was the case we would not be talking about an injury ; we would be talking about a fatality . "
Police believe the brick was taken from a drainage gutter nearby .
The victim was taken to hospital with a fractured collarbone , fractured left arm and possible facial injuries .
Police say it is the second time a rock has been thrown at a vehicle from the overpass in the last week .
A similar sized rocked hit a taxi travelling along the freeway on Saturday morning .
No one was hurt in that incident .
Senior Sergeant Gary Maddern has appealed for any witnesses to the attacks to come forward .
" I just hope that the people who committed this act realise that it is quite serious , " he said .
" If caught , they are facing serious criminal charges . "
I personally find this disturbing .

You want a quick indicator of urban decline in any city you visit ?
Ask a local what 's great about the place .
If the top three answers include " a world - class symphony orchestra , " you 're smack dab in the middle of a current or future ghost town .
This orchestra axiom is something I divined while working on Reason Saves Cleveland With Drew Carey , an hour - long documentary you can see at reason .
tv/cleveland .
Time and again , I 'd ask Clevelanders — a proud breed beaten down by decades of lake - effect snow , economic degradation , population decline , and gridiron disasters worthy of T.S. Eliot 's The Wasteland ( " I had not thought death had undone so many " ) — to tell me what was still top - notch about their hometown .
It did n't matter if I was talking to a CEO or a homeless man , a bar owner or a barfly .
The inevitable reply : " We 've got a world - class symphony orchestra , " typically embellished with some transparently phony claim about how it compares to those in other cities ( " It 's in the top 15 or 20 in the world ! " ) , as if orchestras are regularly ranked like NCAA basketball teams .
Such are the thin straws at which residents in drowning cities grasp .
Such is the psychic depravity that failed polities inflict on their residents , the mental tics and habits of mind that both compensate for and reinforce the steadily diminishing material conditions that drive down the quality of life .
The job losses , the economic stagnation , the grim depopulation of downtowns and residential neighborhoods have a psychological dimension that is every bit as punishing and effective in keeping terminally ill cities in their sick beds as high taxes , stifling regulations , and municipal corruption .
Talk to the people left in cities on the skids , and you 'll quickly hear some variant on one or more of the following :
If only heavy industry had n't gone south , if only Standard Oil or Boeing or Consolidated Fuzz or the Browns had n't moved , if only the weather were different , if only the blacks or the Puerto Ricans or the Italians or the bohunks or the unions or the Jews or the Bilderbergers or air conditioning had n't ruined it all .
It is n't hard to understand why certain burghs go bust : Crime goes up , schools go down , taxes go up , services go down , the hassles and costs outweigh the opportunities and benefits until the population leaves in a steady trickle or mass migration .
But it is far more difficult to figure out how to shock a pulse back into a place that once thrived .
No Hope , and No Plan
Part of the solution is changing the mind - set of the residents , replacing the alternating feelings of inadequacy , hopelessness , passivity , and defensiveness with more productive emotions and cogitations .
The prerequisite for change , the economist Ludwig von Mises once said , is a felt need for change .
That 's only part of the answer .
Fatalism must give way not to delusional optimism and boosterism but to a sense of longing for something better — and , equally important , a belief that it can be achieved .
That sensibility is almost completely absent in Cleveland and many other cities today .
Since its population hit a high point in 1950 , Cleveland has lost more than half of its residents and essentially all of its economic and cultural capital .
The Rapture happened here , but instead of going to the bosom of God in heaven , the elect ended up in Houston , Charlotte , Los Angeles , New York , and , most galling of all because of its proximity and broad - shouldered similarity , Chicago .
There was a time , at the turn of the 20th century , when Cleveland and Chicago were real rivals , but that competition long ago devolved into a sort of lopsided Clippers vs.
Lakers fiasco in which the clear winner need not even acknowledge that a competition ever existed .
As Chicago was becoming the hog butcher for the world and tool maker and stacker of wheat , Cleveland peaked as the seventh - largest city in America , with nearly 1 million residents , before beginning a long , slow , steady decline underscored by race riots , the Cuyahoga River bursting into flames , and a 1978 default on its municipal bonds .
This year Cleveland earned the dubious honor of being named " the most miserable city " in the U.S. by Forbes .
" Cleveland nabbed the top spot as a result of poor ratings across the board , " wrote Kurt Badenhausen .
" It was the only city that fell in the bottom half of the rankings in all nine categories . "
Consistently one of the country 's poorest urban areas , Cleveland had double - digit unemployment long before it was commonplace in the rest of the country .
Some two dozen Cuyahoga County officials are under federal investigation for corruption .
Is it any wonder that in the last five years more than 70,000 people have vamoosed not just from the city proper but from the larger metropolitan area ?
As befits a city built for twice as many people , Cleveland has a surplus of desperation , quiet and otherwise , but shockingly little sense that policies need a fundamental overhaul .
At one point , I talked to City Councilman Joe Cimperman about the business climate .
Cimperman 's no villain ; he 's a good guy who clearly loves his hometown .
Many local entrepreneurs , I said , felt the city was anti-business .
" Who said that ? " he asked defensively .
" What were their names ? "
Cleveland does have a pro-business attitude , he insisted .
Cimperman went on to explain that the city council 's role was to help business owners and residents " thread the needle " of endless regulations and mandates and edicts .
( Cleveland has more than 20 zoning designations alone . )
He boasted of helping a linen company — the last one of its kind within city limits — that had been trying for the better part of a decade to get variances allowing it to expand .
With Cimperman 's help , the company managed to navigate the paperwork in a mere 18 months .
When I talked with him about Houston 's less restrictive land use policies and wide - open approach to new businesses , he scoffed : " Houston is a joke . "
If that 's true , the painful punch line is that during the last 50 years , Houston became the country 's fourth - largest city while Cleveland was sliding down to 41st .
When leaders are not defensive , they are poignantly bereft of ideas .
When I asked another council member , Kevin Kelley , what was the single best change that could be made to improve Cleveland 's public schools , he shook his head and said , " I do n't have a good answer to that . "
This defeatist response , conditioned by decades of failures large and small , is a form of learned helplessness that creates a vicious circle of economic and psychological despair and dependency .
Facing Up to Present Problems
From 1990 to 1993 , I lived in Buffalo , a city eerily similar to Cleveland , differing chiefly in scale .
( It 's about half the size . )
As I packed up to leave Buffalo for Los Angeles , there was a mayoral debate in which a Republican candidate , a Democratic candidate , and an independent candidate outlined their plans for revitalization .
The first respondent ( I forget which , but it hardly matters ) said he would go to the state capital and fight for the city 's fair share of tax money .
The second one said he would go to Albany and also Washington , D.C. , and fight for the city 's fair share of tax money .
The third candidate , the eventual winner , upped the ante by saying he'd go to Albany and Washington and fight for more than the city 's fair share of tax money .
Is it any wonder that during the 1990s , a decade in which many cities turned around years of population declines , Buffalo was one of only two entire major metropolitan areas that lost people ?
( The other was Pittsburgh , a long - slumping town inaccurately but repeatedly praised for a comeback that is suspiciously devoid of economic or population growth . )
When down - on - the - heels cities are not simply holding their hands out , they tend to work the same frayed ropes over and over again : building convention centers that will never make money , betting the farm on light - rail systems that always underperform , shoveling tax dollars at stadiums and sports franchises that do n't generate any new revenue , redeveloping the waterfront .
If the basic definition of insanity is trying the same thing over and over again while praying for different results , then huge swaths of urban America are certifiably nuts .
For its part , Cleveland has turned all the usual tricks and more while manifestly failing to address the most basic quality - of - life building blocks that might generate jobs , attract people , and build hope .
What Cleveland and other slump towns refuse to do is decentralize and deregulate , pushing decisions and dollars back to the people so they can navigate their own courses through life .
It 's easy to make light of the sad - sack Americans stuck in dead or dying cities , towns , and villages .
According to a common view , these folks , like John Steinbeck 's Joads and The Beverly Hillbillies '
Clampetts , should just pack up and head west , south , or wherever , and start over .
There 's a tendency to treat the people left behind in the places that dominate the Forbes " most miserable cities " list ( which also included such Omega Man metropolises as Detroit , Buffalo , Memphis , and St. Louis ) as the equivalent of the lazy and stupid relatives our grandparents and great - grandparents thankfully left behind in Old Europe .
You just can't help some people , goes this line of put - down , all you can do is give them a bus ticket or a ranch house somewhere with a growing economy .
It 's true that many residents of dying cities are hardened by the experience of loss , the slow - motion trauma of seeing a once - thriving ( or semi- thriving ) area slowly run out of steam , money , and people .
In such places , the political , business , and social classes can become intensely reactionary , not just living in the past but , like Faulkner characters , making sure that the past ( or an imagined version of it ) is obsessively recreated on a day - to - day basis , no matter how painful and self - defeating the repetition proves to be .
Cleveland can move heaven and earth and spend billions on new stadiums and convention centers ; they also expended a huge amount of time and energy trying to keep a Walmart superstore from opening within the city 's limits .
The leaders and residents of dead towns fetishize a past when the shops were full of people , the public schools were superb , the thoroughfares thick with streetcars .
Seeing no way forward into the future , they refuse to face or sometimes even acknowledge the reality of the present .
Yet to write off such people and places as incapable of change is to write off many , maybe most , of the places where Americans live .
Far more cities are failing than are thriving , independent of the current recession .
This is a crying shame , not simply because of the pain and forgone dreams but because it 's entirely avoidable .
Bringing Dead Cities Back to Life
Cities can in fact wake from the dead .
New York , Boston , and Chicago all did within recent memory .
Resurrected cities wo n't look like they did in their heyday .
Cleveland 2.0 will never again be home to dozens of Fortune 500 firms .
The steel mills and refineries are never coming back ; nor is the Great Lakes shipping traffic .
But it can be a vastly better place to live , work , play , and love .
It can be a magnet , if not for current Americans , then for immigrants searching for relatively cheap houses and for opportunity .
It was immigrants from all the hellholes of Europe and the American South , after all , who helped make Cleveland great in the first place .
There is an infinite number of worst places in the world from which people would be happy to flee .
Cities resurrect themselves by creating a better value proposition for the people who live and work there : improving services , especially schools ; improving the climate for businesses and jobs by offering more flexibility and less regulation ; worrying less about big - ticket sinkholes like sports franchises and publicly owned venues and instead making sure that streetlights work , potholes are filled , and crime is contained .
There are proven ways to do all this , procedures and processes that have worked in all sorts of cities .
These are the lessons of Reason Saves Cleveland .
If Oakland , the place about which Gertrude Stein quipped " there 's no there there , " can improve its education system by granting parents the right to pick their children 's schools , any city can .
If Indianapolis can provide better service for lower cost through competitive contracting , if Chicago can sell off money - losing toll roads , if Washington , D.C. , can take on its teachers unions , then anyplace can do those things and much more .
But before Cleveland , Buffalo , Detroit , or anywhere else can change the way it functions , its residents must sort through the emotional baggage of an urban life on the decline , a complicated , contradictory mix of feelings : that there 's nothing they can do , that there 's nothing really wrong with the place they call home , that one big win or one big stadium or convention center or sales tax or state or federal grant or magnet school or silver bullet will solve everything .
Most of all , they must shake off the crippling nostalgia that tells them the good old days are gone forever , and that only a world - class symphony orchestra remains .

For years , Sony Pictures considered — and then decided against — updating “ The Karate Kid , ” its beloved 1984 family film about a browbeaten kid ( Ralph Macchio ) with a single mom and the enigmatic martial arts coach ( Noriyuki “ Pat ” Morita ) who teaches the boy how to believe in himself , catch a fly with chopsticks and kick some bully butt along the way .
Sony had pretty much beaten the franchise into submission , with the third sequel , 1994 ’s “ The Next Karate Kid ” featuring 19 - year - old Hilary Swank , marking the series ’ commercial and critical tap - out ( a domestic gross of just $ 8.9 million , a Rotten Tomatoes score of a mere 6 % positive ) .
Even though almost every studio was rebooting long - dormant franchises with mixed results — " Superman Returns , ” “ AVP : Alien vs. Predator , ” “ Star Trek , ” among the disinterred titles —
Sony did n’t want to make another “ Karate Kid ” movie just because the title was lying fallow .
“ This is a valuable property , ” says Doug Belgrad , president of Sony ’s Columbia Pictures , recalling his thinking at the time .
“ We better have the right idea , or it ’s not worth doing . ”
So even when Overbrook Entertainment , the production company for Sony ’s biggest star , Will Smith , pitched Sony on a “ Karate Kid ” remake featuring Smith ’s 11 - year - old , martial - arts - obsessed son ( and his costar in “ The Pursuit of Happyness ” ) , Jaden , in the Macchio role , the studio demurred .
Finally , just as Beijing was about to host 2008 ’s Summer Olympics , Overbrook altered its pitch :
What if the new version were set in China ?
With more than 1.3 billion residents , China is both the world ’s most populous nation and one of Hollywood ’s biggest challenges , with borders to entry almost as tall as the Great Wall .
China can be one of the biggest - grossing countries outside of the United States for certain films , even though DVD piracy is rampant and there are n’t a lot of theaters ; “ Avatar ” grossed the local currency equivalent of $ 195 million , the most of any nation beyond American borders .
Paramount ’s “ Transformers : Revenge of the Fallen ” and Sony ’s “ 2012 " ( in which Chinese ark builders help save the planet ) were also huge hits in the country , and business is booming for Chinese movies too , such as John Woo ’s historical epic “ Red Cliff . ”
Total Chinese box - office returns surged more than 40 % to more than $ 900 million in 2009 .
If Sony made “ Karate Kid ” with a Chinese partner , it could be a part of that Asian gold rush , but the deal would come with some foreseeable obstacles , including possible government censorship .
Belgrad did n’t think long before giving his answer .
“ That was enough to say yes , ” says Belgrad , who had long been fascinated by the country and had developed a “ Sinbad ” movie that would be set there .
“ It ’s a fascinating place . ”
The “ Karate Kid ” decision not only launched the biggest modern movie co-production between an American studio and China , but also opened up the film to government - mandated creative controls that ultimately yielded two slightly different movies , as Chinese censors asked that several scenes , including sequences of bullying and a kiss between two young characters , be trimmed .
The geographic move also launched an internal debate about changing the film ’s name to “ The Kung Fu Kid , ” as karate is a Japanese fighting style .
Although the production , which puts action star Jackie Chan in the Morita role and opens in domestic theaters on June 11 ( arriving in China several weeks later ) , was granted vital access to an array of spectacular Chinese locations — the Great Wall , the Forbidden City , Wudang Mountain — the filmmakers also had to negotiate sometimes byzantine permitting rules and parley with residents who were n’t used to having a movie crew descend on their streets .
Try to film a movie in Brentwood , and the locals will grudgingly get out of the way .
Do the same outside of Beijing and the rules are different .
“ The people run the country , ” says James Lassiter , who is Overbrook ’s president and serves as a “ Karate Kid ” producer .
“ So if people did n’t want you shooting in their neighborhood , there ’s no authority that can tell them they have to .
That ’s why it ’s called the People ’s Republic of China . ”
The filmmakers , who hired a number of Chinese crew members , say the production inconveniences were minor and the creative conversations with partner China Film Group Corp. easily resolved .
As part of Sony ’s deal with China Film , the government - run movie company invested about $ 5 million in the film ’s approximate $ 40 - million budget , retaining “ Karate Kid ’s ” distribution rights in China and some ancillary rights in a few Asian territories .
The film ’s director , Harald Zwart ( “ Agent Cody Banks , ” “ The Pink Panther 2 " ) , says that he never felt there was government pressure to steer the movie in a certain political direction , even though “ Karate Kid ” depicted working - class communities around Beijing as a little bit ramshackle .
“ There was never any question of do n’t show this and do n’t show that , ” Zwart says , adding that the creative conversations with China Film were “ very cooperative ” with a lot of “ back and forth . ”
Zwart personally made the edits for the Chinese version , clipping the chaste smooch between Smith ’s Dre Parker and his girlfriend , Mei Ying ( Wenwen Han ) .
“ I am not going to be an expert on what works in China , ” Zwart says .
“ But I think the Chinese version is a beautiful movie . ”
For all the growth in China ’s movie business , the country only allows 20 non-Chinese movies into the country ’s theaters every year , and the government dictates the distribution terms , which return only about 13 % of a film ’s ticket sales to its makers ( the revenue share is closer to a 50 - 50 split in North American theaters ) .
To get around those draconian limits , some studios have tried making local - language productions , movies in Cantonese and Mandarin , rather than simply relying on exporting their movies from the United States .
Disney has launched a Chinese “ High School Musical , ” while 20th Century Fox made the successful Chinese romantic comedy “ Hot Summer Days . ”
Neither project will likely travel outside of Asia , as their modest budgets do n’t require them to be global releases .
At the same time , China is reaching out to American producers , and China Film ’s Han San Ping has traveled to Hollywood to develop business .
“ On every front , China is trying to globalize and internationalize itself , ” says China expert Orville Schell , who has written extensively about the region , including the book “ Virtual Tibet : Searching for Shangri -La From the Himalayas to Hollywood . ”
He says U.S. movie studios , like global pop culture consumers , increasingly are drawn to the region .
“ It ’s a go - to spot that has a lot of cachet , ” Schell says .
The “ Karate Kid ” deal follows a different model , where an American studio and a Chinese , government - run movie arm collaborate on a production .
“ The access was key , ” Belgrad says .
“ We had an unprecedented amount of production value by shooting there . ”
While the financial and location benefits can be material , so too can questions of interference .
The American makers of 2006 ’s “ The Painted Veil , ” which filmed all over China , said their Chinese production and finance partners asked that several of the film ’s sequences about the Chinese Revolution and the country ’s cholera victims be redacted .
By setting “ The Karate Kid ” in modern - day China , the filmmakers were able to magnify the original film ’s fish - out - of - water plot ( in the first film , Macchio plays a New Jersey teen who relocates with his single mother to Los Angeles ) .
In the new story , Smith ’s Dre and his mother ( Taraji P. Henson ) leave Detroit for Beijing when she changes jobs .
Soon after arriving , Dre is confronted by a band of local bullies led by a thug named Cheng ( Zhenwei Wang ) .
Lassister says that while China Film was worried about the film ’s depiction of bullying , they were able to reach a common ground .
“ We talked about the necessity of the fighting , and the level of the violence , ” he says .
“ I understand their point of view .
But we portray both good and bad Chinese ; it ’s not that they are all bad . ”
Determined to fight back , Dre enlists Mr. Han ( Chan ) , a mysterious maintenance man who teaches Dre the Chinese martial art of kung fu .
( There ’s really no karate in the film , and Sony wrestled with changing the title to “ Kung Fu Kid , ” but the original film ’s producer , Jerry Weintraub , nixed the idea . )
In following the trajectory of the first film , Dre in the new “ Karate Kid ” spends more and more time with Mr. Han , who ultimately becomes the boy ’s surrogate father .
Jaden Smith trained for four months before production commenced to perfect his fighting , studying under Wu Gang , Chan ’s stunt coordinator .
“ It ’s great , and it ’s fun — but it ’s very hard work , ” Smith told The Times earlier this year .
Sony privately says “ The Karate Kid ” is among the studio ’s highest - testing movies ever , and it looks ready to open strongly opposite another movie filled with a lot of fighting , 20th Century Fox ’s “ The A - Team , ” both here and abroad .
Equally important , the production has shown Sony and Overbrook that filming in China can be a rewarding experience , even factoring in some of the obstacles .
But do n’t look for an American studio to propose making a film about the Dalai Lama or 1989 ’s Tiananmen Square protests in China — the country may love light , entertaining fare such as “ The Karate Kid , ” but it is far less interested in examining the more complicated aspects of its own history .
“ If you ’re going to get into something political , ” Schell says , “ China is not your destination of choice . ”
But Overbrook and Sony are ready to go back .
Says Lassiter : “ It was a fantastic experience .
And it helps with our overall objective to become a global film production company . ”

Singapore introduces further express legislation facilitating funding
New insolvency and restructuring laws in Singapore will make it easier for liquidators and judicial managers to obtain dispute funding in a broader range of insolvency related claims .
The new laws were not drafted with the effects of a pandemic in mind but are timely and should provide valuable assistance in some circumstances .
A man needs to find the Bank of America branch closest to 19th Street and First or Second Avenue .
I know that 311 does not provide addresses of businesses , so I advise , per the script : “ If you need directory assistance , call 411 or check a phone book . ”
He sounds perturbed .
The next day I regale the quality assurance supervisor with the story of the man who confused 311 with 411 .
She does not laugh .
Sometimes , she says , people do n’t know why they ’re calling .
A call - taker should ask “ probing questions , ” thinking to herself , “ Is it beyond every reasonable doubt in your mind that this person just needs an address ? ”
Tuesday , 9 a.m .
The first order of business is a warm and fuzzy team meeting .
Our leader passes a stack of pennies around the room .
We call - takers have to say something we experienced during the year on the penny , as a team - building exercise .
( Mine is 2002 : The year my husband and I decided to get married . )
Call - taker camaraderie is crucial , my teammates tell me .
Whatever happens , one advises , “ do n’t take it personal . ”
Around lunchtime , a restaurateur calls , seeking the address of a health department building where his employee is set to take a food - handling test .
I do not have the address , but I transfer him to the health department , which presumably does .
I think the call goes well , but this turns out to be my lowest - scoring call ( 80 points out of 100 ) .
I apparently was supposed to point out that the food - handling course could also be taken online .
And I said “ tryina ” instead of “ trying to . ”
Sheesh .
That afternoon I get my first noise complaint — 311 ’s most common category , accounting for more than two million calls over the seven years .
Mine is from a woman being driven to the brink by her neighbor ’s barking dogs .
Later in the week , there is a man so upset by the crying and thumping from a nearby apartment that he wants to file both a noise complaint and a report of possible child abuse .
And a desperate woman whose daughter cannot sleep because of “ a lot of banging and bouncing and skateboard and basketball and everything . ”
Then there is a noisemaker , who wants to know his rights .
Are there rules about when he can listen to his radio “ a little bit loud , ” or enjoy his home theater ?
What if one ’s neighbor is “ a little bit nuts ? ”
Wednesday , 9:40 a.m .
A caller would like to know whether one ’s landlord can enter one ’s garden without one ’s permission .
Good question .
I would hope not , but who knows ?
I offer to e-mail her a brochure detailing landlord - tenant rights and obligations .
Other disgruntled tenants call to report their landlords for renting out illegal basement apartments , and for funneling electricity to other tenants .
Note to landlords : Tenant complaints are the fourth most common calls to 311 .
And that does n’t count inadequate - heat complaints , which are second only to noise .

AT&T announced on Wednesday sweeping changes to its mobile data plans , ahead of the presumed arrival of a new iPhone model next week .
The new AT&T mobile data pricing eliminates the previous " Unlimited " plan , and also adds a tethering option for the iPhone users who have been expecting the feature ever since last summer .
The new mobile data plans from AT&T start at $ 15 per month , and are set to be a better option for those who do not consume a lot of data through their phones , while heavy users will have to pony up extra cash for each extra GB they use .
AT&T says that its current smartphone customers are not required to switch to the new plans , but can do so as of Monday , June 7 ( except tethering ) , without a contract extension .
They will also get help from the wireless carrier to monitor and manage their data usage with SMS alerts and a data calculator .
The June 7 launch date for the new AT&T plans coincides with Apple CEO Steve Jobs ' keynote at the WWDC conference , where he is expected to unveil a new iPhone model ( see leaked prototype ) and make a series of other mobile - related announcements .
The New AT&T Mobile Data Plans
•· DataPlus is the cheapest plan available , which provides you with 200MB of data for $ 15 per month , a much better value plan for light data users who pay $ 30 for the unlimited plan right now .
AT&T says that on average , 65 per cent of its customers use less than 200 MB per month .
If you exceed 200 MB in a month , you can get another 200MB for an additional $ 15 .
•· DataPro is the new highbrow mobile data plan from AT&T , which includes 2GB of data for $ 25 per month , and will charge each additional GB used over this limit at $ 10 .
This new plan is designed to replace the outgoing Unlimited plan , as AT&T claims 98 percent of its smartphone customers use on average less than 2GB of data per month .
•· The Tethering plan for iPhones will work only along the $ 20 per month DataPro plan , and costs an additional $ 20 monthly .
Unfortunately , this extra $ 20 wo n't give you any extra GB of data usage , as the 2GB included in the DataPro plan will be shared between your phone and the tethered device .
Tethering for iPhones is expected to be available when Apple releases iPhone OS 4 this summer .
The revamped AT&T mobile data plans will affect new WiFi+3G iPad owners as well .
The previous $ 29.99 Unlimited plan will now cost $ 25 per month , and will include just 2 GB of data .
If you already bought a 3G iPad and are using the Unlimited plan , AT&T says you can stick to it for now , or just switch to the new one in due course .
If the new AT&T mobile data plans usage limits seem too steep , AT&T is trying to make up for it by throwing in free Wi-Fi at any of its over 20,000 hot spots , alongside any of the plans above .
Wi - Fi will not only be faster on your smartphone or iPad , but wo n't count toward your monthly usage quota either .
Do AT&T 's usage figures reflect your mobile data usage , or are the new limits a bit too steep for those who stream movies and music to their smartphones or iPads ?
Sound off in the comments .

MSNBC ’s Rachel Maddow was a guest on HBO ’s Real Time with Bill Maher last night where she delivered her usual solid performance , but she really shined in the online Overtime segment , where she completely dismantled former Republican Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist on health care .
Check out the video .
Here is the video courtesy of HBO :

After Frist made the crazy claim that if Obama had made a better emotional argument Republicans would have supported health care , Maddow replied , “ Listen but Republicans , the first time that we tried health reform when Clinton was in office , the Republicans came out with an alternate plan .
A lot of what Obama tried to pass this time was stuff that was from the Republican alternate plan from 1993 , and all the Republicans that introduced that legislation were definitely against it and thought it was communism when they saw it this time around .
There was resistance and vituperative condemnation of even the Republicans own ideas .
It was a giveaway that they were n’t going to go along with it . ”
Frist then attacked Obama for using reconciliation to pass health care .
Maddow asked Frist , “ Why did he use reconciliation ?
Did he use it because he did n’t want Republican votes ?
Do you think he should have spent more time in Iowa talking to Chuck Grassley trying to get him to support his old ideas , which he is now against ?
Frist then changed his line of attack to go after Harry Reid for not horse trading with Senate Republicans .
The former Majority Leader then claimed that the GOP did not have a seat at the table .
Maddow shot that down too , “ They were at the table .
They got up and walked away even from their own ideas .
You can be mad at Obama that it worked when Republicans all said we ’re going to vote no , but it was Republicans who said we ’re all going to vote no .
When you are asked to vote yes on your own idea , and you say no the problem is you . ”
Rachel Maddow completely took apart the former Republican Senate Majority Leader , which is why any Republican or Democrat that does not know what they are talking about should be reluctant to go on her program .
She showed everyone why she is the most knowledgeable cable primetime news host .
She knew what she was talking about and had no qualms about taking on Frist , who ignored the reality that whatever the Democrats and Obama would have offered , the Republicans were going to turn it down , because obstruction is their electoral strategy for both 2010 and 2012 .
What made this beat down even worse , is that Bill Frist is not only the former top Republican in the Senate , but he is also a doctor , so you would think that he would be prepared to discuss this issue .
Instead , Frist was the walking , talking embodiment of Republican ineptitude .
He represented talking points over ideas , and politics over solutions .
By going after Frist , Maddow highlighted everything that ills current Republican politics .
If they ca n’t handle Rachel Maddow , why should voters trust them with governing the country ?

Tony Abbott : Classification System Is “ Broken ”
Tony Abbott , leader of the Federal Opposition Liberal Party , has weighed into the debate on media classification , claiming that the current classification scheme is “ broken ” .
On Monday night , Prime Minster Kevin Rudd and Liberal leader Tony Abbott spoke at the Make It Count debate , an event organised by the Australian Christian Lobby .
During the discussion , Abbott expressed dismay over a dysfunctional classification scheme .
“ I think that the best way to handle this is to accept that our current classification system is broken . ” said Abbott , after a question about the premature sexualisation of children in today ’s media .
“ I think we have to be careful about what some might describe as the heavy hand of censorship .
I ’m not normally one for wanting to see government enquiries , but I think in this case we probably do need a further review , building on the work of the senate enquiry to which you refer , and I think any such review should be tasked with trying to come up with a new way of ensuring that proper community standards are applied to the media , all media , including new media . ”
Abbott was speaking broadly about classification across all media , not just limited to computer and video games .
However , the clearest possible way our ratings system is broken is with the lack of an R18 + rating for games .
When stacked up against other forms of media , the ratings system for video games is incomplete .
So what are the chances Tony Abbott supports an R18 + rating ?
It ’s a major step to have a politician of Abbott ’s stature admit that our ratings system is dysfunctional in an election year ( and at a Christian debate ) , considering you ’d be hard - pressed to get a straight answer out of an Attorney - General in any given year .
Considering the government ’s discussion paper earlier this year yielded over 59,000 submissions , of which 98.2 % were in favour of the proposed rating , is it crazy to consider Mr. Abbott might be thinking of R18 + as an election issue ?
His belief that the issue needs further review , however , is in line with the Standing Committee of Attorneys - General ’s decision to request “ further analysis of community and expert views ” .
As a result of this view , Roland Kulen , who heads up the Everyone Plays initiative , believes we wo n’t see an R18 + rating by the end of this year :
“ Mr. Abbott is right about the system being dysfunctional , but we do n’t need further review .
The SCAG is saying we need more consultation but we do n’t , we ’ve already had it .
It ’s time wasting , because it ’s an election year . ”
A combination of efforts from gaming site PALGN and retailer GAME , Everyone Plays has accumulated over 89,000 signatures on a petition for the proposed rating , set to be tabled in the Senate in early July .
Prime Minister Rudd was asked the same question , and deferred it until a later time :
“ As a father with three kids , I share the concern .
I think every Australian child deserves a childhood .. but you know , parents have other responsibilities here too .
We ’ll try and get you a defined response to those recommendations , but I ’d much rather do that in a clear & upfront way rather than try and invent something on the spot , absent the recommendations in front of me . ”
Other topics touched on ranged from whether the Lord ’s Prayer will still be observed in Parliament , to larger issues such as same - sex marriages , refugees , and climate change .
Both candidates took the opportunity to claim that while they do n’t approve of discrimination against any people , in the eyes of their parties ’ , marriage is between a man and a woman .
The Make It Count debate was organised by the Australian Christian Lobby , sponsored by Gloria Jeans Coffees , and was made available via webcast to Christian churches and church groups nationally .
Five years after uTorrent was released for the Windows platform the development team has announced that it 's working on a Linux version of the torrent client .
The massive demand from users is cited as one of the main reasons why Linux users will have a native uTorrent application this coming summer .
u Torrent for Windows saw its first public release in September 2005 and soon became the most widely used BitTorrent application .
Every month , more than 50 million people use uTorrent and this number continues to grow alongside BitTorrent ’s ever - increasing user base .
Ever since uTorrent was released , Mac and Linux users have begged the developers to release a version of the client designed to work on their computers .
In 2006 , when uTorrent was sold to BitTorrent Inc. , the company announced that a Mac version was coming .
In 2008 , nearly two years after the announcement , it was finally released to the public .
With the the release of the Mac version , Linux users were the only ones left out in the cold , but this is about to change .
The uTorrent development team has just announced that they are working on a Linux version of the client .
Further details on the time line and an eventual release date are not available at the moment .
The Linux version is the most backed idea on uTorrent ’s recently introduced Idea Bank .
The Idea Bank is prominently featured on uTorrent ’s website and allows users to submit and vote for ideas they want to see implemented .
In just a few weeks the idea of a Linux version has been supported by 3254 people .
This huge demand from users is one of the main reasons why the Linux version is now in progress .
“ Since launching our Idea Bank on uTorrent.com there has been significant demand for a native client for Linux , ” BitTorrent Inc. spokesperson Jenna Broughton told TorrentFreak .
“ We obviously want to do our best to deliver whenever we see a good fit between our goals and capabilities and what our users say they want . ”
“ We are committed to bringing a lightweight uTorrent client that embraces the usability and features of our Windows and Mac clients to Linux users , ” Broughton said .
The exact feature - set of the Linux client will remain a secret for now , but in common with other versions of uTorrent it wont be Open Source .
The release date for the client is unknown at this point but unlike the Mac version it should come out relatively quickly .
“ While the exact specs as well as the timing are still being developed , we expect uTorrent for Linux to be available for download later this summer , ” we were informed .
Whether or not the uTorrent Linux release will ever reach the massive market share it has on Windows remains to be seen .
The Mac version has been well received but it is by no means the most used BitTorrent client on the platform .
Whatever happens , it ’s definitely good to see that uTorrent will soon be available on all three major platforms .

We all get the PFD which was slightly under $ 64000 dollars this year , most of us will use it to purchase a new 4x4 fully decked out four door turbo truck , we do this yearly to save wear and tear on the classic 68 Shelby Mustang GT500 we keep polished to a high sheen in the garage , its close to factory specs , and our Fathers purchased it new passing it onto us after being lost at sea on either a whaling , crabbing or Coast Guard rescue voyage .
If it was the CG , the rescued survived .
We sit in coffee shops , thoughtfully considering the issues of the day and discussing it with other highly educated men that came up from the lower 48 for a better way of life not afford by big city living .
That ’s when we are not engaging in other manly activities ; waiting for our intellectual equals to arrive from the lower 48 after either a broken marriage to an actor , or just out wondering the world while writing yet another Pulitzer Prize winning novel .
Its just luck those women always are perfectly formed , beautiful and willing lovers not seeking anything but the experience .
When one does get too close , they run off with out leaving a forwarding address , leaving yet another topic to ponder with our manly friends over a steaming cup of coffee served in a blue porcelain camp mug , in front of a roaring fire .
We all cook with the talent of a New York trained chef , in our million dollar , hand - build cabins fully outfitted with the latest accoutrements from Viking .
We heat those homes with wood we chopped ourselves in the massive rock fireplace wedged between the 18 ' high plate glass windows that frame Denali perfectly .
The meat is fresh as are the smoked salmon both of which we hunted down with bow and arrow or simple fly rod , none of that sitting in a tree stand waiting on corn - fed deer to come by .
Usually our friends come up to visit us in the summer and we oblige them by taking them salmon fishing in the most pristine areas imaginable with a 50 ' custom boat , but hey when your friend is an astronaut , ex- pro football player , or noted political being , nothing is too much for them right ?
After all they saved our life once in the war , before we saved theirs .
His sister is in love with us but just can't make that commitment because saving the rainforest is to important right now , and is conflicted on the right moral choice to make , so we sit and pine for her .
To pass the time during the long winter nights , which are always back lit by the Aurora Borealis we carve intricate items to give away at Christmas to the little orphan native kid down the street , you know the street wise one always getting into trouble , so being the good mentor we are we watch his back and take care of his family after all the village elder has made us an honorary member of the tribe so we do n’t want this wise man to look down on us .
Our dogs are our constant companions , and even though they have heavy fur coats they never shed or leave our side to run after all the moose that walk through the streets daily , along side the raccoons ’ , friendly bears and wise eagles that are tame because of our bringing them back to full health after many months of hand feeding and nursing the wound they got from some ill - witted hunter thinking it would attack him while flying around 500 ' in the air .
Well I hope that helped you out a bit to see what a real Alaskan man is all about , I would continue on but I need to load up the snow machines in the back of my cheery red Beaver float plane to help out our researcher buddies up in the Bush , then off to the gold mine .
That and we drink lots of beer and smoke lots of pot .
Do You Really Believe You Are Safe at the Airport ?
A new movie picks apart the Transportation Security Administration .
June 23 , 2010  --
Is it safer to fly today than it was before 9/11 ?
The short answer , according to a new documentary , is no .
Despite spending billions of dollars , creating a new government agency and creating numerous new security procedures , the makers of " Please Remove Your Shoes " argue that the flying public today is no safer from a terrorist attack than it was before Sept. 11 , 2001 .
" What we 've got now is nothing but security theater , meaning all these bells and whistles that you see are only meant to make you feel safe , " former federal air marshal P. Jeffrey Black says in the documentary .
" I honestly think we were safer before 9/11 than we are now . "
The central theme of " Please Remove Your Shoes " is that the Transportation Security Administration has grown into a massive government bureaucracy with too much money .
The filmmakers argue it has n't taken enough preemptive measures in fighting terrorists and that instead of addressing real security concerns , the TSA focuses on herding people through checkpoints as fast as possible and hires poorly - trained workers who dress up in uniforms and play cop .
" Our real security at the airport , while admittedly immeasurable , appears to be even worse than ever , " Fred Gevalt , the film 's executive producer , told ABC News .
" Clearly something has to be fixed .
We have given TSA sufficient time since their creation to establish their merit and they have n't .
It 's time to call for a rethink of the whole security system , and now is as good a time as any .
We certainly should n't allow this farce to continue . "
The 94 - minute documentary is being released straight to DVD on July 1 .
There is no studio is behind it , with Gevalt personally funding it .

Gevalt and director Rob DelGaudio use six current and former federal security officials to tell the story of airline security before 9/11 , the creation of the TSA and some of the problems they see now with the agency .
Most of the arguments in the film have been made before and the accusations come from whistleblowers whose contempt for the agencies they say did not listen to them comes across clearly and harshly .
Gevalt says the TSA and other government agencies are filled with " laziness , waste , disregard for employees , citizens and above all nepotism . "
In response to the movie and the whistleblower accusations , the TSA said it has " significantly improved aviation security following the tragic events of 9/11 . "
" We have full confidence in our highly trained workforce to use the latest intelligence , state of the art technology and other layers of security to keep the traveling public safe , " said TSA spokesman Greg Soule .
" The agency will continue to implement enhanced security measures to stay ahead of ever evolving threats . "
The Federal Aviation Administration , which was also criticized in the movie , declined to comment , directing questions to the TSA .
Filmmaker Previously Sued the FAA
Gevalt is a Vietnam veteran who founded the Air Charter Guide , a listing of all the charter operators around the globe .
He once successfully sued the FAA , arguing that the lack of regulations for fractional aircraft ownership programs gave them an unfair advantage against the commercial charter business .
Now retired , he initially began making a movie that suggested Americans have become too afraid of terrorism .
But that quickly changed into a critique of the TSA .
" At a minimum , I hope to wake up the air traveler , who has put up with personal indignities and a very real loss of civil liberties since 9/11 , " Gevalt said , adding that passengers who are OK " falling into line and cooperating at the airport " are " actually enabling an abusive agency to expand its empire . "
He said little has changed under the Obama administration , but Soule countered by saying that the TSA has improved on many of the issues presented in the documentary .
" TSA is a young agency , and many of the allegations raised in the film are past issues that have been long since addressed , " Soule said .
Terrorists Are ' Sneaky '
" Please Remove Your Shoes " starts off in the pre-9/11 days , when the airlines were responsible for airport security , overseen by the FAA .
Steve Elson , a security special agent with the FAA , explained that his job was to covertly test the accuracy of screeners by trying to sneak guns , bombs and other items through the checkpoints .
Screeners almost never detected items , with fail rates above 90 percent , Elson said .
He said the tests were insufficient because FAA testers followed certain agreed - upon rules about what size guns the testers would try to sneak past screeners .
" Terrorists are n't like that .
They 're sneaky , " he said .
Fellow covert FAA tester Bogdan Dzakovic said the best airports only caught the explosives and guns 20 percent of the time .
" Usually the worse the results were that we had on any given project , the less we were tasked to test to see if they had improved , " Dzakovic said .
" Management simply did not tolerate any kind of dissenting opinion or even discussion about maybe we should do things better . "
Has the TSA Improved Air Security ?
After 9/11 , the government moved quickly to create a new security agency , the Transportation Security Administration .
The rest of the movie recaps the TSA 's past mistakes , large growth in personnel and budget and , in the filmmakers ' view , its inability to improve security .
" I helped create TSA and I 've referred to it sometimes as either my bastard child or a monster that we 've created , a bureaucratic monster , " Rep. John Mica , R - Fla. , says in the film .
" It did n't turn out exactly the way I intended . "
One aviation consultant who asked to not to be named because he has done consulting work for the TSA , conceded that the agency still has " a long way to go " but also pointed out that it has made major improvements .
" TSA 's got huge problems .
But it does n't mean it 's categorically unsafe , " said the safety expert and former pilot .
" I get on the airlines every week and I do n't worry . "
TSA Hiring Questioned
Franklin Puello spent 21 years in the New York Police Department , working undercover in narcotics and retiring as a detective just before 9/11 .
He joined the newly - formed TSA after the terrorist attacks and says he found an agency more concerned about the speed of screening passengers than about security , claiming that this showed in the agencies hiring practices .
" Our military and law enforcement background was a hindrance .
They felt threatened that we knew too much , that we were too independent , " Puello said .
" They wanted really puppy dogs that they could train , malleable individuals , and that 's why the recruitment is deplorable . "
" When you put someone in a uniform with a shield , there is an expectation by the public that that person can protect them and function as a police officer , " adds Jon Adler , president of the Federal Law Enforcement Officers Association .
" Not someone you simply dress up in nice pants , a nice shirt and a shiny badge and say let 's play cop . "
Isaac Yeffet , a former head of security for the Israeli airline El Al who now runs his own firm , Yeffet Security Consultants , said that " all of our aviation security is a joke , an illusion . "
Yeffet has not seen the movie , but he said the TSA relies too much on technology and has a hiring approach of " we need bodies , not qualified people . "
" Technology is good to help a qualified , well - trained human being .
Technology can never replace a qualified , well trained human being , " he said .
Air Marshals Face Challenges
Those who did have law enforcement duties , such as the federal air marshals placed on planes after 9/11 , also ran in the problems .
Black said that his job as an air marshal was compromised by a rigid dress code that forced him to wear a suit and tie , even on flights to tourist destinations like Las Vegas or Hawaii .
" We boarded the plane before the passengers .
When we got on board the plane and they saw us , they knew we were federal air marshals .
They would shake our hand , pat us on the back and thank us for being on the plane , " Black said .
" If the passengers know who the air marshals are , so do the terrorists . "
The message :
You kill the guys with the suits first .
" We went to our supervisors and said this was making our job very difficult , " Black said .
" And of course their reply was : we need you to have a professional image on that plane . "
' We Still Don't Have a System That Is Rational '
The only contemporary security issue addressed by the movie comes in a late reference to the failed attempt to blow up a jet flying from Amsterdam to Detroit on Christmas Day 2009 .
" It 's the same old story .
Failure to share information .
Failure to turn raw data into actionable intelligence , " said Brian Sullivan , a former FAA security special agent who retired before 9/11 and narrates the documentary .
" Failures followed by senseless , knee - jerk reactions focused on the wrong people . "
" Al Qaeda succeeded on 9/11 because people at the top levels of government valued their promotions and pensions more than the public trust , a situation by no means unique to the TSA , " Sullivan adds .
" The sad reality is despite huge expenditures and dangerously - expanded authority , we still do n't have a system that is rational , effective and proportionate to the threat .
We continue to sacrifice our resources and freedoms for nothing more than an elaborate façade of security . "
The distinguished cleric with gold wire - rimmed glasses , a dark suit , and crimson bishop ’s shirt spoke with an African accent and a twinkle in his eye , “ We all know about my friend , Dr. Kinsey .
Although I think I am straight , who knows ?
Maybe I am not as straight as I think . ”
His shoulder swiveled , slightly vampy with this last line , and the audience laughed .
Retired Ugandan Bishop Christopher Senyonjo , 78 , was playing to a sympathetic crowd at the San Francisco Lesbian , Gay , Bisexual , and Transgender Community Center on Tuesday night , May 25 .
The delight of the audience and the esteem in which they held him is not the typical reaction Senyonjo has received since he began ministering to LGBT people nine years ago in his home country of Uganda .
Receiving his theological training in the United States , at Union Theological Seminary and Hartford Seminary , and ordained in New York City in 1964 , Senyonjo served as bishop of the Anglican Diocese of Western Uganda from 1974 to 1998 .
After his retirement , he started a family counseling center .
In 2001 , his life changed forever when he met several gay and lesbian young people who had been rejected by their churches .
“ They had lost jobs and been expelled from school .
Some of them were on the verge of committing suicide . ”
Senyonjo gave them a radical message for their time and place : “ If you are gay or lesbian , God made you and loves you that way , and you should accept yourselves . ”
Once word of his compassionate advice reached his successors in the Anglican hierarchy in Uganda , there was a firestorm .
Senyonjo was asked to “ condemn ” the people under his care “ and convert them to something else . ”
Senyonjo said he would not .
“ I can not see God where there is no love , ” he said , “ I would rather go with the truth . ”
In reaction , he was expelled from the church he had served for 34 years .
More significantly for his own survival , the church stripped him of his pension .
“ The cost has been great , ” Senyonjo said of his post - retirement ministry .
“ It is by the grace of God that I have been able to survive .
By the strength of God I have been able to stand . ”
The Bishop is touring the United States and Europe , sponsored by the Episcopal LGBT group Integrity USA ( among other organizations ) to raise awareness about the draconian law being considered by the Ugandan parliament , which would make homosexuality illegal , in some cases punishable by death .
The law has been the result , in part , of lobbying by American evangelical groups , and has the partial support of Bishop Henry Orombi , Anglican Primate of Uganda .
Having already faced the rejection of his church and loss of his pension for standing up for the equality and spiritual dignity of LGBT people , Senyonjo could face imprisonment for his continued advocacy under a section of the law meant to prevent the “ promotion ” of homosexuality .
Jay Johnson , an Episcopal priest and Director of Academic Research and Resources for the Center for Lesbian and Gay Studies in Religion and Ministry at Pacific School of Religion in Berkeley , explained :
As mainline churches in the United States have become more accepting of LGBT people on issues like ordination and blessing of same - sex relationships , conservatives in these denominations , particularly the Anglican Communion , have appealed to the Global South to seek affirmation for their homophobia .
“ There has been an attempt , ” Johnson added , “ to marginalize the more tolerant Anglican churches in the United Kingdom , United States , Canada , New Zealand , and Australia , suggesting that the center of the ‘ true ’ faith — that is , the faith that is still discriminatory towards LGBT people and women — is in Africa and the developing world . ”
“ The African voices that have dared to stand up against overwhelming spiritual , societal , and governmental pressure , like Bishop Senyonjo , Canon Gideon Byamugisha , Bishop Desmond Tutu , and the South African Council of Churches , have exposed the lie that these dividing lines are as strict as they have been portrayed , ” Johnson said .
“ There are multiple voices and perspectives throughout the Anglican Communion . ”
“ The revelation is still going on ! ”
Asked about the his view of revelation and the Bible , Bishop Senyonjo told an audience at Pacific School of Religion , the day before the San Francisco event , “ What is the real Word of God ?
The Logos ?
Christ is the Logos .
And even Jesus said , ‘ There are many things to tell you , but you cannot bear them . ’
So the revelation is still going on !
A lot of discrimination against LGBT people is due to ignorance about human sexuality . ”
Senyonjo encouraged seminaries around the world to begin to offer courses on human sexuality .
Asked what Americans could do to speak out about the bill being considered by the Ugandan legislature that could end the work he is doing , Senyonjo suggested contacting elected officials in the United States and asking them to express their disapproval of the bill to members of the Ugandan parliament .
Mentioning President Obama and Secretary of State Clinton ’s condemnation of the bill , Senyonjo said , “ The United States is an important country .
Some people in Uganda will say , ‘ Why are they interfering ?
We are an independent nation . ’
But deep down , they know if the United States is saying it to them it ’s important . ”
Senyonjo sees his extended ministry as working to decriminalize LGBT people around the world .
“ Along with heterosexuals , LGBT people are a human phenomenon .
Human sexuality is a beautiful thing , if you understand it .
The real problem is a lot of ignorance about human sexuality .
God has created diversity , and we should embrace it as we embrace the rainbow , because the rainbow is beautiful . ”
Bishop Christopher Senyonjo has completed his tour of California , and will be moving on to Minnesota , New York , Dublin , and Belfast ( see here for tour details ) .

Groups of undercover police were repeatedly identified by protesters at marches occurring between Monday and Wednesday .
Some were reportedly wearing black baseball caps , bandanas with marijuana leaf - designs on them , and patches with Che Guevara on them .
When asked by journalists if they were police , none denied it .
Several arrests were made each day , habitually after the days ' demonstrations had dispersed and people were leaving the scene .
On Thursday we all discovered that a regulation created by the authority of the Public Works
Act had been passed in secret on June 2nd , which essentially allows for anyone within five metres of the G20 security fence ( even if they happen to just be walking by ) , to be searched without reason , asked for their ID , detained , and even possibly arrested .
Dave Vasey did not wish to show his ID without reason and consequently was the first person to be arrested under this new regulation .
He is facing court on July 28 .
Many other similar searches , detainments , and arrests have been made since .
One woman accused by police of trying to break into a building .
When she spoke to the press it was revealed that the building was her place of work and she had been using her keys to get inside .
On Friday morning at 4:45 am
Police pre-emptively raided 2 Toronto houses where activists were staying .
No warrant for arrest was shown .
Police kicked people from their beds and made arrests .
A tenant residing upstairs in one of the houses awoke to a gun in his face , and was cuffed and arrested , before being released and told that that he had been mistakenly arrested .
Later the same morning , police arrested 15 - 20 organizers from Montreal .
A spokesperson for the Toronto Community Mobilization Network was arrested on his way to a press conference to discuss the roundup of activists and organizers by police .
Another organizer slated to be at the press conference was " snatched " and thrown into an unmarked van by police , driven around for an hour without being told where she was being taken , and eventually dropped off in Mississagua .
What many find most significant here , is the pre-emptive nature of these raids ( many arrested were the organizers of demonstrations and events yet to take place ) , and the appalling lack of due process in making the arrests .
Bail is being set high for some : between $ 1000 and $ 5000 .
Some are being faced with charges more severe than others , “ conspiracy to committ mischief ” among them .
In the early morning , 80 workers from Hotel Novotel ' s Unite Here !
Local 75 went on strike .
The strike was triggered after Accor , the French company that owns Novatel , walked away from negotiations without addressing an offer put on the table by the union , which included basic demands for a pension plan and guaranteeing workers enough hours to make a living .
Emomotimi Azorbo , a deaf man unrelated to G20 organizing , was beaten and arrested because he did not hear police commands to stay off the road .
Azorbo was handcuffed , preventing him from communicating with officers , who also refused his friend 's offer to interpret .
Azorbo was refused an American Sign Language interpreter in the temporary jail where G20 arrestees are being held .
He is charged with three counts of assaulting police plus resisting arrest .
While trying to film Azorbo's violent arrest , Jesse Freeston , of the Real News Network , was punched in the face twice by police , and had his microphone temporarily confiscated while other media crowded around and yelled for the police to return it .
On Saturday , there was no sign of protester violence , among the 25 , 000 plus people who took to the streets , contrary to what many corporate media reports are conveying .
A few banks , franchises and corporations had their windows smashed in symbolic shows of property damage .
On the contrary , levels of police violence have been extreme and brutal .
Police repeatedly attacked and arrested peaceful protesters and journalists .
A number of police cars were set on fire .
They were abandoned in the middle of intersections beforehand , and stripped of all their equipment by police -- the cars were discovered to have been damaged previously , which led to reports that the police had purposefully left the cars there as bait , hoping to tempt protesters to set the cars on fire , in order to justify their own violent acts .
Later accounts led many to believe that the fires themselves were set by undercover police , or agents provocateurs .
One journalist was beaten by police .
Another community organizer was violently thrown around by police and later arrested , with several “ severe ” charges .
Jesse Rosenfeld , journalist with The Guardian , was punched in the eye , and violently arrested , being told he “ talked too much . ”
At least four more Alternative Media journalists were arrested throughout the day .
A CTV producer and 2 National Post journalists were also arrested .
A family of non-protesters was in the wrong place at the wrong time .
They were pushed back with police bikes and pepper sprayed .
Message recieved by a journalist : “ They were pushing my mom and me and throwing punches at my brother and they just kept pushing forward and saying ' move move move ' and not really caring who was there .
I have cancer and I kept saying " I have cancer , I have cancer , ' but they did n't care , they just kept pushing forward . ”
Later on in the day , there is footage of police charging out of their lines , about five at a time , and violently arresting peaceful protesters , one by one , dragging them back behind police lines , pushing them to the ground and handcuffed .
Mass arrests were conducted , and large numbers of people were arrested who happened to be in the area at the time .
After the violent arrests described above , a university woman was trampled by a cops on horses in Queen 's Park , a so - called “ Free Speech Zone . ”
She was among other peaceful protestors in the park at the time , but did not manage to get out of the way fast enough .
She was reportedly badly injured .
The police arrested her .
The Queen 's Park Area saw about 20,000 police from all over the country , whether on horse , in cars , in vans , in riot gear , undercover , or in the choppers above .
The area was described by many as a military camp , or a war zone .
There have been multiple reports of police following people in the streets and harassment and intimidation .
Some people have been detained and harassed for the T - shirts they have chosen to wear , most notably , a shirt that is currently selling ' like hotcakes , ' which says " Fuck the G20 . "
There have been photos taken of individuals being " disappeared " into unmarked , presumably police vans .
A peaceful sit -in staged at Novotel Hotel in support of striking workers was stopped by police and more than 100 arrests were made .
People were not given an option to leave first .
A party of about 130 people who went to the detention centre last night to do jail solidarity work for hundreds of friends and fellow activists still being held there was broken up by riot police , and told that if they left right away they would not be arrested .
About 100 left right away , and 30 stuck around to discuss for about 2 minutes .
They decided to leave , but were no longer left with a choice , as police surrounded and arrested them .
Among those arrested were 2 or 3 legal observers .
On Sunday , at 10 am , another group of people went to the detention centre to do jail solidarity .
They were reportedly eventually dispersed with tear gas and rubber bullets , and many were beat with batons , as the police charged on a peaceful crowd of over 100 , some playing music .
At least 20 more arrests were made .
A stand - off between police and protesters continues right now , outside of the detention centre .
Many protesters are also currently being hospitalized for injuries from being beaten by police .
After driving by the Alternative Media Centre ( AMC ) several times the previous night , police showed up at the doors of the AMC claiming that neigbours had issued complaints about people milling around outside .
( Many in the neighbourhood have come by the media centre , but only to offer words of support , and to get the news ) .
Police said they could not be sure whether or not those inside the space had broken in or were squatting .
Luckily , the landlord vouched for the AMC folks and the police eventually left .
70 people were targeted and arrested at the University of Toronto .
An alternative journalist was arrested for filming police doing searches of everybody at an activists convergence space where many were preparing to return to their home cities .
The convergence space is currently being raided by more than 200 police and more than 30 activists have been arrested .
The rest of the people there are “ still surrounded . ”
The journalist was ultimately released .
There is currently a demonstartion happening outside of the convergence centre .
The majority of arrests made so far have involved giant " sweeps " of peaceful protesters , and have not been made for any identifiably justifiable / legal reasons , or with due process , such as reading people their rights , allowing them access to a lawyer , or informing them of the charges against them .
The corporate media continue , for the most part , to focus on “ protester violence , ” while neglecting to report on rampant police violence or on the issues that the protesters themselves have raised at demonstrations .
The number of arrests since the G20 protests began is now 520 + .
Personally , I have never seen anything like this and am appalled at the terrifying political and rhetorical shift that has occurred in Canada 's treatment of its community organizers in the last few days .
It seems to me that activists are being treated as terrorists of some sort .
I cannot imagine any other reason for targeting everybody involved in the organization of events and demonstrations , for targeting journalists and communications people , for rounding people up and locking them away , for raiding their homes , simply for protesting the G20 summit in some form or another .
UPDATE : 600 ARRESTED , Sunday early evening .
UPDATE 2 : " A few hundred " protesters arrested at Queen and Spadina , at approximately 9:30 pm , Sunday .
UPDATE 3 : Terrible prison conditions being reported by some of those being released : cold and overcrowded " cages , " lack of food and water , hands being left tied , strip searches , sexual assault .
UPDATE : 900 arrests and counting .
Largest number of arrests in Canadian history
UPDATE : The regulation created by the authority of the Public Works Act was fabricated by police and in complicity with politicians .
Nobody bothered to mention it had all been a lie until after the summit was over .
Stephen Webber claimed Sussex Police was acting like " Big Brother " A man has criticised Sussex Police after he discovered they were monitoring his updates on a social networking website .
Stephen Webber , from Brighton , said he was surprised when he spotted that the force had become one of his followers on Twitter .
He said the way they made their presence known was like " Big Brother " .
Sussex Police said there was " nothing sinister " about them following messages people publish online .
Twitter is a social networking site which allows people to post messages , or tweets , of up to 140 characters online .
' Fears or rumours '
Users can become fans or " followers " of other members to regularly view their updates .
Mr Webber said : " I had an e-mail to say that Sussex Police were following me on Twitter , which seemed very strange .
" If somebody is going to do something very , very dodgy they 're not going to talk about it openly online . "
We use Twitter to engage with the community in a really immediate way - it 's really helpful for us because we can allay any fears or rumours going round
Christine Smith , Sussex Police
And what drew his attention most , when he looked at the Sussex Police account , was the force also appeared to be following more than 1,700 other people on the Twitter website , he added .
He said : " It struck me as somewhat sinister that they would be following that many people on Twitter .
" It just seems like it 's Big Brother going too far . "
He added : " I simply feel they have gone about it in a slightly misguided way by not announcing it .
" Perhaps a more user - friendly approach might be to emphasise community outreach in a profile description , and thus emphasise that key element of why they are there in the first place . "
Christine Smith , Sussex Police web administrator , said : " We use Twitter to engage with the community in a really immediate way .
It 's really helpful for us because we can allay any fears or rumours going round .
" We can also engage with them and ask them what they want .
It 's better than traditional media in that sense . "

Detained Osama Bin Laden Hunter Gary Faulkner ' on His Way Home ' Family : Gary Faulkner is being released from Pakistan jail .
June 22 , 2010  -- Gary Brooks Faulkner , the American man who was on a lone wolf mission to kill Osama bin Laden before he was detained in Pakistan , is " on his way home , " the man 's family told ABC News .
Faulkner , 51 , a construction worker who lived in Greeley , Colorado , was arrested June 13 attempting to cross into Afghanistan in the mountainous region of northern Pakistan .
He was armed with a pistol , sword , night vision goggles , a map and was reportedly carrying Christian literature .
When he was arrested , Faulkner told police he was intent on avenging the victims of the 9/11 terror attacks by killing bin Laden .
" He said he was being released .
He 's on his way home , " said Dr. Scott Faulkner , who spoke with his brother Gary today .
" He said he was treated well but he can't wait to get back to the good ol ' U.S. of A .
" Apparently , he did not have access to television , radio , or newsprint , " Scott Faulkner said .
" And so , he said that he would let me know when he would be coming home .
But , it sounded like it was imminent . "
During Faulkner 's detention , his family worried about his health due to a failing kidney that required dialysis treatment .
When American officials visited Faulkner with a doctor Islamabad , Pakistan , they said he was in " good spirits " but needed dialysis , according to the family .
Scott Faulkner told ABC News Monday that his brother recieved the treatment .
The family is " tickled " he 's on his way back , Faulkner 's brother - in - law John Martin said .
" The family welcomes him .
We 'll give him a hug and go from there , " he said .
The State Department did not confirm Faulkner 's release .
Family Says Faulkner Is Patriotic , Not Crazy
Martin said Faulkner talked openly with the family about his plans to hunt down the al Qaeda leader .
" He 's a very deeply religious individual , very patriotic , " Martin said on June 15 .
" It seemed to be his thing .
He thought it should be done and he thought he could accomplish it . "
Bin Laden has evaded one of the largest international manhunts in history and remains on the FBI 's Ten Most Wanted list .
Martin said Faulkner was not trained in any way for a seek - and - destroy mission and had no military training , though he had been to the region before .
Faulkner 's brother Scott said he was trained in martial arts and a sword and dagger were his " weapons of choice . "
" We initially laughed when he told us he wanted to kill Osama bin Laden , " one official , Mumtaz Ahmad Khan , said after the arrest , according to The Associated Press .
Faulkner also has an arrest record and spent time in Colorado prisons , according to public records .
It is illegal to carry weapons without a license in Pakistan , but no formal charges have been brought against Faulkner .
Brother : Faulkner Would Enjoy Attention for ' Waking America Up '
While going on such a mission in hostile territory alone and with no training to find the most wanted man on the planet may have seemed ridiculous to many , Faulkner 's brother said he had made several trips to the area to reconnoiter bin Laden 's possible location -- and believed he had found the cave where the al Qaeda leader was hiding .
Scott Faulkner said last week that his brother had " stood at its entrance , possibly within 100 feet " of where he believe his target was living .
If his brother 's mission failed and even if he died trying , Scott Faulkner said his brother would " love " the media attention .
" It 's waking America back up .
...
The fact that it 's bringing it back in the forefront of the American psyche , now there 's hopefully going to be a renewed effort to get this guy , " Scott Faulkner said .
While Faulkner was likely aware of the hefty $ 25 million reward for information leading to bin Laden 's arrest , Martin said the cause was more important to his brother - in - law .
" The inspiration was more important to him than the money , " he said .
Scott Faulkner told CNN Tuesday his brother is " highly intelligent " and " has not forgotten what Osama has done to this country . "
" I think probably every family member out there has a non-traditional family member , " Martin said .
" Ours is just maybe more newsworthy than some sometimes . "
Already Facebook groups have popped up declaring Faulkner a hero and patriot -- a faked personal page features an action figure in the profile picture -- but Martin stopped short of agreeing .
" If he accomplished it , he damn sure would 've been tagged that , would n't he ? " he said .
( CNN ) --
A gay political party will be on the ballot Monday for the first time in the Philippines , where eight out of 10 households are Roman Catholics .
The elections will determine whether Ang Ladlad ( " Out of the Closet " ) -- which represents lesbians , gays , bisexuals and transgender Filipinos ( LGBT ) -- will get the maximum three seats allowable for a marginalized or underrepresented party in Congress .
" We consider it a milestone in Philippine human rights , " said Leila De Lima , head of the Commission on Human Rights of the Philippines .
" They are really always victims of discrimination , exclusion and even violence . "
The Commission , citing The Universal Declaration of Human Rights and International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights , sided with Ang Ladlad when its legal fight to stand for elections reached the Supreme Court .
Leading the five nominees under Ang Ladlad 's banner is its national secretary of seven years , Bemz Benedito , who is transgender and also works for Senator Loren Legarda , herself a vice presidential candidate and Ang Ladlad supporter .
" We are running a common platform of equal rights , not special rights , " said Benedito .
Topping Ang Ladlad 's five - plank agenda is support for the Anti-Discrimination Bill that would criminalize discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity .
The bill has been filed multiple times in the Philippines Congress to no success .
The four other items on Ang Ladlad 's platform are :
• Support for LGBT - related and LGBT - friendly businesses
• Setting up of microfinance projects for poor and disabled LGBT Filipinos
• Setting up centers that could provide legal aid and counseling services for poor and aging LGBT Filipinos
• Support for the repeal of the Anti-Vagrancy law , a tool that Ang Ladlad says has been exploited to extort members of the LGBT community .
Absent is same - sex marriage , which has slowly become legalized in other parts of the world .
" We 've done surveys -- we 're going to lose on this one , " said Ang Ladlad founder Danton Remoto , pointing to the predominance of Catholicism .
" We 're not going to push this .
We focus on human rights first . "
Also absent from the platform is a gender recognition bill , which would recognize transgender people and allow them to legalize the names they identify with .
On the Commission on Elections ' ( COMELEC )
Web site , Benedito and another Ang Ladlad candidate , Naomi Fontanos , are listed under their male birth names .
But Benedito prefers the female " Bemz , " as opposed to her birth name , " Bembol Aleeh , " and Fontanos -- chair of the Society of Transsexual Women of the Philippines ( STRAP ) -- is listed as " Tito Paulo . "
" That 's our struggle , " said Benedito .
" Even if our members have gone through gender reassignment surgery , they are not allowed to change their names to male or female , [ unless ] there is a typographical error . "
One of the biggest challenges Ang Ladlad faces are the " immoral " and " abnormal " labels that the Commission on Elections and an official of the Catholic Bishops ' Conference of the Philippines ( CBCP ) have used against them .
" My faith is always direct to God , and I believe he 's also created us , " said Benedito , a Roman Catholic who once studied at an all - boys Catholic school .
" It 's not up to these priests [ to say ] what is moral and what is not . "
Speaking with CNN by phone on Tuesday , Caloocan Bishop Deogracias Iniguez , Jr. stood by his earlier well - publicized comments against Ang Ladlad 's inclusion on the ballot .
" Personally , I 'm not in favor of the party , because it 's a group that 's of abnormal human persons , according to what we accept as the order that the Creator has made for human persons , " said Deogracias , who chairs the CBCP 's public affairs permanent committee .
" Human society -- we have male and female , so whatever is outside is abnormal .
As with any other people , they are members of society .
We respect them , we can tolerate them , we are compassionate , but we cannot sanction what they are doing . "
In a separate phone conversation earlier , CBCP 's media office director Pedro Quitorio said the body has not yet issued a formal statement on Ang Ladlad .
As recently as a month ago , the Commission on Elections had denied Ang Ladlad 's registration twice in four years -- first for a lack of members and then on moral grounds .
In its latter dismissal , the commission cited Ang Ladlad 's tolerance for " immorality which offends religious beliefs " and then quoted the Bible , the Koran and then the Law Department 's definition of the civil code .
The case reached the Philippine Supreme Court , which on April 8 ruled in favor of Ang Ladlad and ordered COMELEC to grant accreditation .
" The denial of Ang Ladlad 's registration on purely moral grounds amounts more to a statement of dislike and disapproval of homosexuals , rather than a tool to further any substantial public interest , " the court said in its ruling .
The party has had barely a month to campaign .
" So , wherever we go , we say , ' Number 89 , ' " Remoto said , referring to its placement on the long ballot with 186 other " party - list " groups , which together would comprise one - fifth of the House of Representatives .
Ang Ladlad , which estimates 25,000 members , has received an " outpouring of support " from politicians , as well as from nuns and priests who cannot outwardly express it , Remoto said .
" Whether they win or lose , what 's important is , they 're on the ballot , and people are given the chance to vote for them and other parties , " Senator Chiz Escudero said by phone of Ang Ladlad .
Escudero , an independent , rallied the party to endorse presidential candidate Senator Benigno Aquino and vice presidential candidate Jejomar Binay .
Such a combination is a mixed - ticket , considering Aquino belongs to the Liberal Party , and Binay is on the PDP - Laban ticket as Aquino rival and former President Joseph Estrada 's running mate .
Remoto pointed to corruption as the Philippines ' main problem and referred to Aquino as the " Mr. Clean of Philippine politics . "
Binay , the mayor of Makati , has a track record as a human rights lawyer and a gender rights agenda in his platform , Remoto added .
That Ang Ladlad may be the only gay political party in the world has n't been disputed so far .
Sam Cook , communications and research director , of the New York - based International Gay and Lesbian Human Rights Commission , said she was not aware of details of any other .
The Washington - based Gay & Lesbian Victory Fund and Leadership Institute , which supports LGBT candidates to all levels of office , said there has not been an equivalent in the United States , where same - sex marriage and military policy toward gays have generated significant debate .
" Well - known openly gay candidates and elected officials in the U.S. have almost always been affiliated with either the Democratic or Republican parties , with the Democrats fielding far more out candidates than Republicans , " Denis Dison , vice president of external affairs , wrote via e-mail .
Public perception of gays in the Philippines has changed in the past 20 years , said Remoto , who teaches at Ateneo de Manila University .
" We made homosexuality a topic everyone can discuss openly , " he said .
The hot air balloon landed on one of the Beech House Farm 's fields A Northamptonshire woman has been jailed for pointing a loaded shotgun at a passenger in a hot air balloon which landed on her chicken farm .
Marie Dring , 50 , loaded the weapon and pointed it at Martin Henley shouting " get off my land " on 12 September , Northampton Crown Court heard .
Dring , of Pottersbury , near Towcester , admitted possessing a firearm with intent to cause fear .
She was sentenced to 18 months imprisonment by Judge Michael Fowler .
Prosecutor James House said Mr Henley and his wife had been bought the balloon ticket ride as a present by their children .
The pair were in a group of nine passengers who had left Northampton Racecourse in the balloon .
Bottles of whisky and champagne were handed over
James House , prosecutor Mr House told the court balloonists seek permission to land but it could be a " hit or miss affair , " and it was not known if permission had been granted to come down on the Drings ' land .
Pilot David Griffin was approached by Dring 's brother - in - law who jointly farms the land , the court heard .
" It is right to say he was unhappy .
Mr Griffin spoke to him and apologised and bottles of whisky and champagne were handed over , " said Mr House .
The brother - in - law then rang Dring and her husband , who were out at a restaurant , and told them what happened .
Dring returned to the farm and was " extremely angry " , the court heard .
' Genuinely remorseful '
Mr House said she had driven up to Mr Henley as he walked to a car which had been following the balloon to fetch a jumper .
" The defendant was the only occupant and the window was down , " he told the court .
" Mr Henley saw a double barrelled shotgun pointing out of the driver 's window . "
The court heard Dring told Mr Henley to get off her land and swore at him .
Mr Henley put his hands up in the air and walked off with Dring driving behind , making slight contact with him , Mr House said .
Defence barrister David Matthew said Dring was concerned about the threat of the balloon to her livestock .
She was genuinely remorseful , he said .

After a surprise visit to his home by lawyers and anti-piracy group executives earlier this year , the admin of a BitTorrent site has been hit with a large claim for damages .
The 18 year - old operator of the EliteBits private tracker now faces a demand for more than $ 261,000 , but will be assisted in his fight by pro-sharing group , Piratgruppen .
While public BitTorrent sites usually get most of the unwanted legal attention , earlier this year it was the turn of a private tracker .
In early January ‘ Laeborg ’ , the Denmark - based administrator of the EliteBits BitTorrent tracker , was confronted at 7:00 am on his doorstep by a man from the enforcement court accompanied by three men from Johan Schlüter Advokatfirma , a law firm that works with Danish anti-piracy group , Antipiratgruppen .
They showed Laeborg , real name Jonas Laeborg , screenshots from EliteBits while revealing information on the bank account used to collect site donations .
In their possession was a warrant which they said gave them authority to gather evidence to show that Laeborg was involved in the illegal distribution of copyright works .
After accessing Laeborg ’s computer and his admin account on EliteBits , screenshots were taken of all the staff profiles , the site ’s Top 10 downloaders , Top 50 uploaders and uploaded torrents lists .
That case has now progressed to the point where 18 year - old Laeborg has been hit with a cash claim totaling some 1.6 million kroner ( $ 261,150 ) from Antipiratgruppen .
But he wo n’t face this battle alone .
Laeborg apparently has insurance which will cover his legal costs while fighting this demand but his policy has an excess on any claim .
Pro-sharing group Piratgruppen has announced it will donate an amount to cover this excess charge to help ensure the case gets heard .
“ We believe it is extremely important that these cases come to trial , and that you can not just give in to these unreasonable claims , therefore we have paid a sum to cover costs associated with litigation , ” Piratgruppen spokesman Troels Møller told Comon .
The case will be handled by regular Piratgruppen lawyer Per Overbeck but no dates have yet been set for a hearing .
The attack on EliteBits represents a new strategy against file - sharing in Denmark .
Previously local anti-piracy outfit Antipiratgruppen had maintained a policy of going after individuals but its inability to gather solid evidence resulted in the loss of several prominent High Court cases .
This prompted an announcement that it would stop its pursuit of petty file - sharers and instead go after larger targets .
Will Young , Women 's Aid Ambassador , said : " I have been working with Women 's Aid since 2003 when I became the charity 's first Ambassador , and am so pleased to be able to be a part of the ' Real Man ' campaign against domestic violence .
I studied domestic violence at university and feel passionately that we need to raise awareness of violence against women and children and refuse to ignore it .
Just by speaking out against domestic violence and being supportive of those directly affected we can all make a positive difference "

( CNN ) --
The news of intense drug - related violence out of Jamaica is shocking and dreadful but entirely predictable .
Wherever the war on drugs touches down , death and destruction result .
A recent target is Kingston , Jamaica .
When law enforcement attempted to smoke out Christopher " Dudus " Coke , wanted in the U.S. for conspiracy to distribute marijuana and cocaine and to traffic in firearms , scores of people died in the urban warfare .
The death toll reached 73 civilians as Jamaicans were caught in the crossfire between police , soldiers and armed thugs .
Rival drug gangs used the confusion to eliminate their enemies and further ratchet up the violence .
Coke has since agreed to surrender to officials in New York , because he " feels it is in his best interest to be taken to the U.S. rather than to a Jamaican jail , " sources told the Jamaican Observer , but not before scores of people died .
Given that the scenes of violence between rival drug gangs are so common , people often fail to consider the factors that fuel this violence .
The reality is that Jamaicans are just the latest victims in a misguided and expensive war that has taken countless thousands of lives , from the streets of New York to the slums and shantytowns of Colombia , Mexico and other third - world nations .
In more than four decades since former U.S. President Nixon first declared America 's " war on drugs , " the battles against spreading disease , increasing violence and the ongoing destruction of families and neighborhoods have been lost .
Mexico , a country all too familiar with violence as a way of life , is today a stark example of how crackdowns on drug cartels by American and local law enforcement agencies have utterly failed .
The horrible drug- related violence in Mexico was intensified by President Felipe Calderón , with strong U.S. support .
This crackdown has resulted in about 23,000 drug- related deaths across the country since 2006 .
The bloodiest war has been fought in Juárez , a besieged city of 1.3 million on the U.S. border , where 5,100 people have been killed since 2008 .
The global drug war has created a massive illicit market with an estimated annual value of $ 320 billion .
In April , the newly created International Centre for Science in Drug Policy , of which I am founder , released a review of every English - language study to examine the link between drug law enforcement and violence .
The review clearly demonstrates that the astronomical profits created by drug prohibition drive organized crime and its related violence .
Several studies included in the report suggested that law enforcement 's removal of key players from the drug trade , such as Christopher Coke , only creates power vacuums that lead to violent and deadly competition .
Many victims are not involved in the drug trade , as today 's civilian deaths in Mexico , the U.S. and Kingston 's slums illustrate .
The war on drugs has generated a lucrative , cash - rich industry that has -- not surprisingly -- lured poverty - stricken participants from throughout the impoverished third world .
In West Africa , entire countries , such as Guinea - Bissau , are at risk of becoming " narco- states " as Colombian cocaine traffickers employ West African trade routes to distribute cocaine into destination markets in Europe , Russia and the Middle East .
Estimates now suggest that 27 percent of all cocaine destined for Europe is transited through West Africa and is worth more than $ 1.8 billion annually wholesale -- and as much as 10 times that amount at the retail level .
Illicit drugs are big business , with the influence and global reach that goes along the ability to create widespread wealth .
Another conclusion of the review was the clear evidence that drug law enforcement has failed to reduce the availability of illegal drugs .
From a scientific perspective , we must accept that law enforcement will never meaningfully reduce the flow of drugs .
Economists know that the drug seizures we see over and over again as part of police photo ops have the perverse effect of making it that much more profitable for someone else to sell drugs .
The laws of supply and demand have simply overwhelmed police efforts .
With young people reporting that obtaining illicit drugs is easier than getting alcohol or tobacco , the situation could not get much worse .
Strong scientific evidence points to the effectiveness of alternative regulatory models established in Portugal , the Netherlands and Switzerland to counter the disastrous consequences of illicit drug use and drug policies .
The Cato Institute , a respected U.S. think tank , has released a report on alternative drug policies .
Several years ago , Portugal parted ways with the U.S. and decriminalized all drugs so that resources could focus on prevention and treatment of drug use .
The report shows Portugal 's policies have dramatically reduced HIV rates as drug addiction has been viewed as a health , rather than criminal justice , problem .
In addition , Portugal now has the lowest rates of marijuana use in the European Union , with experts suggesting that the health focus has taken some of the glamour out of illegal drugs .
Similarly , the de facto regulation of marijuana in the Netherlands and distribution through licensed coffee shops generates tax revenue for the country rather than profits for organized crime .
Interestingly , rates of marijuana use in the Netherlands remain far lower than those in the U.S. Consider this against the backdrop of the mayhem in Mexico , much of which is driven by fighting to control the marijuana export industry .
The American " get tough " approach , although politically popular in certain circles , has failed to achieve its intended objectives :
The supply of illicit drugs has increased , the costs of illicit drugs have dropped , and drug purity has risen .
The mounting bloodshed in Mexico and the recent mayhem in Jamaica clearly demonstrate that the U.S. is exporting violence , breaking up families and increasing the taxpayer burden to help fight these fruitless battles .
Americans themselves are suffering deeply from these misguided policies .
It 's time to just say no to the war on drugs and to implement science - based alternative policy models that are proving effective in other parts of the world .
The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Evan Wood .

Hello World
What We've Learned
JRuby 's new jrubyc - - java( c ) support for generating " real " Java classes
Tagging a Ruby class with Java annotations , so it can be seen by a Java framework
Booting a Grizzly server from Ruby code
Implementing a JAX - RS service with Jersey in Ruby code
There 's lots of ways to present RESTful web services these days , and REST has obviously become the new " it 's IPC no it 's not " hotness .
And of course Rubyists have been helping to lead the way , building restfulness into just about everything they write .
Rails itself is built around REST , with most controllers doubling as RESTful interfaces , and it even provides extra tools to help you transparently make RESTful calls from your application .
If you 're doing RESTful services for a typical Ruby application , Rails is the way to go ( and even if you 're not using Ruby in general ... you should be considering JRuby + Rails ) .
In the Java world the options are n't quite as clear , but one API has at least attempted to standardize the idea of doing RESTful services on the Java platform : JSR - 311 , otherwise known as JAX - RS.
JAX - RS in theory makes it easy for you to simply mark up a piece of Java code with annotations and have it automatically be presented as a RESTful service .
Of the available options , it may be the simplest , quickest way to get a Java - based service published and running .
So I figured I 'd try to use it from JRuby , and when doing it in Ruby it 's actually surprisingly clean , even compared to Ruby options .
I followed the Jersey Getting Started tutorial using Ruby for everything ( and not using Maven in this case ) .
My version of their HelloWorldResource looks like this in Ruby : Notice that we 're using the new features in JRuby 1.5 for producing " real " Java classes : java_package to specify a target package for the Java class , java_annotation to specify class and method annotations .
We compile it using jrubyc from JRuby 1.5 like this :
The new -- java ( c ) flags in jrubyc examine your source for any classes , spitting out . java source for each one in turn .
Along the way , if you have marked it up with signatures , annotations , imports , and so on , it will emit those into the Java source as well .
If you specify -- javac ( as opposed to -- java ) , it will also compile the resulting sources for you with jruby and your user - specified jars in the classpath , as I 've done here .
The result looks like this to Java : Under the covers , this class will load in the source of our restful_service.rb file and wire up all the Ruby and Java pieces so that both sides see HelloWorld as the in-memory representation of the Ruby HelloWorld class .
Method calls are dispatched to the Ruby code , constructors dispatch to initialize , and so on .
It 's truly living in both worlds .
With the service in hand , we now need a server script to start it up .
Continuing with the tutorial , I 've taken their simple Java - based server script and ported it directly to Ruby :
It 's somewhat cleaner and shorter , but it was n't particularly large to begin with .
At any rate , it shows how simple it is to launch a Grizzly server and how nice annotation - based APIs can be for auto - configuring our JAX - RS service .
Ahh CLASSPATH .
You are so maligned when all you hope to do is make it explicit where libraries are coming from .
The world should learn from your successes and your failures .
There 's five jars required for this Jersey example to run .
I 've tossed them into my CLASSPATH env var , but you 're free to do it however you like
The first four are available in the jersey - archive download , and you can fetch the Grizzly jar from Maven or other places .
The lovely bit about this is that it 's essentially a four - step process to do the entire thing : write and compile the service , write the server script , set up CLASSPATH , and run the server .
Here 's the server output , finding my HelloWorld service right where it should :
And perhaps the most anti-climactic climax ever , curling our newly - deployed service :
It works !
This was a simple example , but we demonstrated several things :
Do you have any examples of other nice annotation - based APIs we could test out with JRuby ?
Obama is the top recipient of BP PAC and individual money over the past 20 years .

Obama biggest recipient of BP cash
While the BP oil geyser pumps millions of gallons of petroleum into the Gulf of Mexico , President Barack Obama and members of Congress may have to answer for the millions in campaign contributions they ’ve taken from the oil and gas giant over the years .
BP and its employees have given more than $ 3.5 million to federal candidates over the past 20 years , with the largest chunk of their money going to Obama , according to the Center for Responsive Politics .
Donations come from a mix of employees and the company ’s political action committees — $ 2.89 million flowed to campaigns from BP - related PACs and about $ 638,000 came from individuals .

On top of that , the oil giant has spent millions each year on lobbying — including $ 15.9 million last year alone — as it has tried to influence energy policy .
During his time in the Senate and while running for president , Obama received a total of $ 77,051 from the oil giant and is the top recipient of BP PAC and individual money over the past 20 years , according to financial disclosure records .
An Obama spokesman rejected the notion that the president took big oil money .
( Also on POLITICO : Obama campaign targets Romney , Big Oil in third TV spot )
“ President Obama did n’t accept a dime from corporate PACs or federal lobbyists during his presidential campaign , ” spokesman Ben LaBolt said .
“ He raised $ 750 million from nearly four million Americans .
And since he became president , he rolled back tax breaks and giveaways for the oil and gas industry , spearheaded a G20 agreement to phase out fossil fuel subsidies , and made the largest investment in American history in clean energy incentives . ”
In Congress , Sen. Mary Landrieu ( D - La. ) , who last week cautioned that the incident should “ not be used inappropriately ” to halt Obama ’s push for expansion of offshore drilling , has been one of the biggest beneficiaries of BP ’s largesse .
Her comments created some blowback , with critics complaining that she is too blasé about the impact of the disaster , even though she was among the first lawmakers to call for a federal investigation into the spill .
As the top congressional recipient in the last cycle and one of the top BP cash recipients of the past two decades , Landrieu banked almost $ 17,000 from the oil giant in 2008 alone and has lined her war chest with more than $ 28,000 in BP cash overall .
“ Campaign contributions , from energy companies or from environmental groups , have absolutely no impact on Sen.
Landrieu ’s policy agenda or her response to this unprecedented disaster in the Gulf , ” said Landrieu spokesman Aaron Saunders .
“ The senator is proud of the broad coalition she ’s built since her first day in the Senate to address the energy and environmental challenges in Louisiana and in the nation .
This disaster only makes the effort to promote and save Louisiana ’s coast all that more important . ”
Several BP executives have given directly to Landrieu ’s campaign , including current and previous U.S. operation Presidents Lamar McKay and Robert Malone .
Other donors include Margaret Hudson , BP ’s America vice president , and Benjamin Cannon , federal affairs director for the U.S. branch .
Donations ranged from $ 1,000 to $ 2,300 during the past campaign cycle .
Environmentalists complain that Landrieu has played down the impact of oil spills .
“ I mean , just the gallons are so minuscule compared to the benefits of U.S. strength and security , the benefits of job creation and energy security , ” Landrieu said at a hearing last month on offshore drilling .
“ So while there are risks associated with everything , I think you understand that they are quite , quite minimal . ”
“ They own Mary Landrieu and the rest of the Louisiana delegation , ” said Greenpeace Research Director Kert Davies .
“ They have more money , disposable income and a fleet of dispensable lobbyists to beat the band . ”
Other politicians with ties to coastal states or states with BP refineries have also reaped benefits from the fourth largest company in the world .
The top congressional recipients of BP campaign cash include Republican Rep. Don Young of the oil - intensive Alaska delegation , who has received almost as much as Obama , raking in $ 73,300 during his congressional tenure .
Also on the list is Sen. George Voinovich ( R - Ohio ) , whose state has a BP refinery in Toledo and who has raked in $ 41,400 .
Sen . John McCain ( R - Ariz . ) has received $ 44,899 .
“ Make no mistake : BP ranks among the most powerful corporate forces in U.S. politics , ” said Dave Levinthal , spokesman for the Center for Responsive Politics .
“ It donates hundreds of thousands of dollars every election cycle through its employees and political action committee and is routinely a seven - or eight - figure federal lobbying powerhouse each year . ”
In 2008 alone , BP gave $ 37,000 to members of the House Energy Committee and $ 106,501 to members of the Senate Homeland Security Committee , which deals with security issues facing the nation ’s oil supply .
BP has also evolved in its corporate giving over the past decade , shifting more money to Democrats .
In 2000 , the company gave almost 39 percent more to Republicans than to Democrats .
But by 2008 , Democrats had nearly pulled even with Republicans on BP donations .
Moreover , the company has nearly tripled the amount of money it has spent on lobbying , from about $ 5.7 million in 1999 to $ 15.9 million last year , according to lobbying disclosures .
BP has bulked up its K Street team by signing some of the biggest firms in Washington , several of which employ former Hill staffers with deep - seated ties to Louisiana and the Gulf of Mexico coast .
BP representation within lobby shop Alpine Group alone includes lobbyist Bob Brooks , who served as chief of staff to former Rep. Jim McCrery ( R - La. ) , and lobbyist Rebecca Hawes , a longtime counsel for former Sen. John Breaux ( D - La . ) .
Jason Schendle worked for Landrieu for nine years , according to lobbying disclosures .
Former Rep. Jim Turner , now a lobbyist for BP with Arnold & Porter , formerly represented the 2nd District of Texas , which includes a large piece of Gulf shoreline .
And at the Podesta Group , BP lobbyist David Marin was formerly the lead Hill staffer for Congress ’s Select Committee to Investigate the Preparation for and Response to Hurricane Katrina .
“ First , they are exceedingly competent .
Second , they are [ Democratic - centric ] .
I know the first will help enormously in the next few weeks .
I am not so sure about the second , ” said Republican energy lobbyist Mike McKen­na of MWR Strategies , who predicted that Landrieu would quite likely get “ very wide latitude ” on the oil issue .
“ That may not be the case with BP , whose record is a bit more spotty . ”
Theory of Central Banking Rapidly Falling Apart
Central banks are about to learn the global economy is not Alice 's Restaurant .
In case you do n't know the tune , here is the crucial line : " You can get anything you want at Alice 's Restaurant "
Anything you want , seems to be the attitude of central banks .
The problem is , it is virtually impossible for every central bank to get what it wants at the same time , when they all want the same thing , cheaper currency relative to each other to stimulate jobs and exports .
UK at Mercy of Demand in EU
The U.K. trade deficit widened in March as imports jumped the most in six months , led by demand for goods from cars to engineering equipment .
The Bank of England is counting on a weak pound to boost exports and support economic growth it helped manufacturing jump the most since 2002 last month .
The sovereign debt crisis in Europe has darkened the outlook for U.K. exporters at a time when domestic demand may come under pressure from measures to tackle the public finances .
“ With a fiscal squeeze looming , and set to have knock - on effects on consumer incomes , we think that the onus is still on the external sector to keep the recovery going , ” Vicky Redwood , an economist at Capital Economics Ltd. and a former Bank of England official , said in a note .
“ Recent events in the euro zone -- the U.K. ’s biggest trading partner -- clearly cast a shadow over the longer - term prospects for U.K. exporters . ”
The U.K. ’s trade deficit with the European Union widened to 3.4 billion pounds in March , a three - month high , from 2.9 billion pounds in February .
Bank of England Governor Mervyn King yesterday cautioned that the U.K. economy remains vulnerable to the fiscal crisis in the euro area , its biggest trading partner .
King said that rebalancing the U.K. economy after the deepest recession on record relied on “ a prosperous European economy . ”
“ We ’re seeing a big , big increase in manufacturing , ” Alan Clarke , an economist at BNP Paribas in London , said in a phone interview before the report .
“ It may be that at long last we have an improvement in external demand or are reaping the benefit of a weaker sterling .
We ’re at the mercy of demand in the euro zone . ”
China ’s Trade Surplus Shrinks 87 %
Inquiring minds note China ’s April Trade Surplus Shrinks 87 % on Imports
China ’s trade surplus shrank 87 percent in April from a year earlier as imports grew faster than exports because of stimulus - driven domestic demand .
A 79 percent decline in the trade surplus in the first four months of 2010 from a year earlier may ease pressure for gains in the yuan and support Premier Wen Jiabao ’s argument that the currency is n’t undervalued .
The sovereign - debt crisis in Europe that today prompted a loan package of almost $ 1 trillion to help nations under attack from speculators may also encourage Chinese officials to delay ending the yuan ’s peg to the dollar .
Yuan gains would be “ a disaster , ” Song Zimin , an executive in the import and export department of apparel maker Shanghai Dragon Corp. , said in an interview at China ’s biggest trade fair in Guangzhou on May 3 .
“ If the yuan rises 3 percent , where ’s our profit ?
Many , many factories will close . ”
Chinese President Hu Jintao told his U.S. counterpart Barack Obama last month that the nation will adjust currency policies according to its own need and wo n’t bow to foreign pressure .
U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner meets with Chinese Vice Premier Wang Qishan in Beijing on May 24 - 25 for the so - called Strategic and Economic Dialogue between the two nations .
India and Brazil have backed calls from the U.S. and Europe for a stronger yuan .
Here are a few examples to help explain what I mean .
Please consider U.K. Trade Deficit Widened in March on Import Jump
Europe is China 's biggest export partner .
Since China pegs to the US dollar , China 's exports to Europe just got a lot more expensive following this mini-crash of the Euro .
That is not what China wants at all .
India , Brazil , the US , Europe , and Japan all want the Yuan to rise .
Adding fat to the trade war fire , the US is threatening to label China a currency manipulator on the misguided notion that US exports will rise if the Renminbi ( Yuan ) rises .
Japan Wants the Yen to Sink
As noted in Equity Plunge Yen Connection ; Reflections on Ponzi Markets and Program Trading , last week 's equity meltdown all started with a sudden spike in the Yen .
In response , to the strengthening of the Yen , the Bank of Japan pumped 2 trillion Yen ( $ 21.8 billion ) , into the banking system , triggering selling of the Yen .
ECB 's Action to Save the Euro
In Europe , the ECB 's plan to " save the Euro " consists of printing $ 1 trillion worth of Euros .
Given that it is impossible to strengthen a currency by printing more of it , the real goal was not to save the " Euro " but to bail out European banks sitting on bad Greek debts .
Long term , the plan increases debt , exactly the wrong thing to do in a deflationary world .
Short term , that action spawned an unprecedented round trip move on the Euro vs. the US dollar from 1.27 to 1.31 and back in little over a day .
Bounce or Die for the Euro and British Pound
For charts and additional commentary on the Euro and British Pound , please see Bounce or Die for the Euro and British Pound ?
Make no mistake about .
Trichet wants a cheaper Euro to help European exports , even as the UK is at the mercy of demand in Eurozone countries .
To top it off , the US does not want a cheaper Euro or a stronger dollar out of fear of losing Boeing contracts to Airbus , and grain exports to Brazil and Australia .
In 2001 - 2002 Greenspan thought slashing interest rates and printing money was a free lunch .
Instead , it spawned the biggest real estate / debt bubble the world has ever seen .
For a while , Greenspan 's efforts created jobs .
Then came the global bust .
The debt still remains , the jobs did n't .
Now the EU has adopted the same nonsensical plan .
Yet all the EU has accomplished is to increase the amount of debt that can not be paid back .
Trichet needs a clue , and here it is :
You can not fight deflation by taking on more debt .
Here 's a second clue : central banks can print , but they cannot dictate where the money goes .
The housing bubble collapsed years ago , but the global central banker fight against deflation still remains , with one big beneficiary : Gold .
Gold Monthly Chart
Amazingly , until this crisis started last week , there was near unanimous opinion that the US dollar needed to sink and for the Yen , Yuan , Pound , and Euro to strengthen .
" Near Unanimous " is the opportune phrase because Japan wanted the Yuan to rise but not the Yen , and China was just happy with the status quo .
If that is not one totally * upped daisy chain of impossible Central Banker wants and needs , what is ?
Hello Ben Bernanke , Jean - Claude Trichet , and Mervyn King , this is Alice , and you are in Wonderland , not my restaurant .
At Alice 's there is no free lunch .
We only take gold .

Karina Oakley , 3¾ , has an IQ that is , at 160 , the same as Stephen Hawking 's
Karina Oakley : ' As soon as she started talking , it was like this massive word explosion . '
Photograph : Graeme Robertson for the Guardian
" All of my horses are called Athena , " announces Karina .
Except for Sandy , that is , a small plastic creature with a wounded leg .
Karina places
Sandy in a bed she has made from Fuzzy Felt .
" There you are , little horse .
I 'll give him some special horse medicine , " she says .
" Five lots of medicine .
Now he 's come back to play with his friends . "
Karina is Charlotte Fraser 's only child .
They live , the two of them , with Truffles the cat , in Surrey .
" As soon as she started talking , it was like this massive word explosion , " Charlotte says .
" Everybody she came into contact with would say , my goodness , how old is she ? "
Charlotte thinks it is " a bit rotten " to compare Karina with friends ' children " because they all develop in their own way and you do n't want to be this competitive mum " .
But after a helper at the church creche noticed Karina 's " incredible " imagination , Charlotte found a child psychologist on the internet and , a year ago , took her daughter to London for an IQ test .
" Karina has an unusual air of maturity in one so young , " said Professor Joan Freeman and , in a careful report pointing out the shortcomings of IQ tests in very young people , suggested that she had an IQ of 160 – said to be the same as Stephen Hawking 's – which placed her in the top 0.03 % of children of her age .
Asked in these tests what we do with our eyes , Karina said we put contact lenses in them .
Shown a picture of a teapot without a handle and asked what was missing , she said the picnic mat .
Shown a picture of a glove that was lacking one finger and asked what was missing , she said the other glove .
Charlotte found it " reassuring " to discover that Karina was not suffering from some " really weird way of thinking " .
She does not know from where her linguistic precocity comes : Charlotte was adept at science , she says , and Karina 's father , Nick ( from whom Charlotte is separated ) , was good at physics and maths .
Stories of home - schooled geeks scare her .
" What every parent wants for their children is to give them a happy , balanced , enjoyable childhood .
I do n't think any adult is ever going to go , ' Damn , I did n't do my GCSEs aged nine ' . "
So Karina goes to a local nursery and spends much of her time " junk modelling " .
She shows off a chocolate tray , decorated with tissue and paper : a butterfly feeding table .
While Charlotte has a few reservations about this " child - led " learning – " There 's a bit of me that thinks it 's a nursery , you 're teachers , you could be doing something more with her " – she plans for Karina to attend her local primary school , along with her friends .
" As she gets older , perhaps I will need to look at it again , " Charlotte says .
" I guess I worry if she gets bored at school .
Sometimes it does n't come out as ' bored ' – it comes out as causing trouble at the back of the class . "
Ishaan Yewale , 5 , has memorised more than 600 London bus routes
Ishaan Yewale : ' I can see buses from other buses . '
Photograph : Graeme Robertson for the Guardian
How long have you been a bus fanatic ?
" The last five years , " says Ishaan , sitting in front of a laptop looking at Transport for London bus maps .
Jay and Sonali Yewale moved to London from Mumbai 10 years ago for Sonali 's job at Citigroup .
Jay is a business development manager for an IT company .
Just over six months ago , their only child , Ishaan , developed a thing for London buses and memorised more than 600 bus routes across the capital .
It was not easy for him , Jay says , because , while Ishaan has a reading age of at least seven , there were some difficult location names to read .
The memorising bit came easily .
So far , Ishaan 's talent has taken him on to BBC Breakfast and ITV News , but he has n't found the media coverage too demanding .
Where did his interest come from ?
Does he see buses from their south London flat ?
" I can see buses from other buses , " Ishaan trills in a singsong voice .
" I can see DLR trains from there , " he points to the front window .
" And I can see National Rail from the kitchen . "
He runs into the kitchen to demonstrate .
Which are best , buses or trains ?
" Buses , " Ishaan answers incisively .
What is his favourite bus route ?
" The whole world , " he says , somewhat tangentially .
Later , he clarifies : his favourite route is actually the 108 from Lewisham to Stratford , which he travels on to school .
How many buses does he see from his favourite bus ?
Roughly , I say .
It 's a stupid question and I am not expecting an answer .
" I only saw 17 today , " he says .
" Ten when going and seven coming back . "
Every few months , Ishaan finds a new obsession .
Cricket was one – he learned to recognise virtually all the players in the IPL ; Thomas the Tank Engine was another .
His favourite engine is " Gordon , the biggest and the fastest .
He goes at least 100 mph .
Other engines only go 50 .
And Thomas and Percy only go at 20 .
No , 25 , " he corrects himself .
His gentle parents seem rather bemused by their hyper - energetic little boy .
He never wants to go to bed and has energy to burn at all hours .
He is bilingual ( he also speaks Marathi ) , and his school has run out of books for him .
While his reading is good , he is among the worst at writing , Jay says .
And if Ishaan does n't like something , it 's hard to get him to do it .
Jay and Sonali were themselves both high achievers at Indian schools , which were far more competitive than British ones .
" But I think he 's ahead of us , " Jay says .
They are keeping an eye on whether the school can meet his needs .
So far , they say , they 've been happy , but " it 's early days " , Jay says .
Megan Ward , 10 , is an inventor ; her anti-smoking keyring is already in production
Megan Ward : ' She thinks differently . '
Photograph : Graeme Robertson for the Guardian
When Paula and Rory Ward are not running a plumbing and drainage company in Kent , they are busy marshalling the lives of their children , Alfie , six , Joe , eight , Charlie , 13 , Steph , 19 , and , squeezed in the middle , Megan , 10 .
While her home reverberates with footballing kids , sulky teens , three bounding dogs , a rabbit and a hamster called Spotty , Megan is quietly inventing .
A year ago , she had to design an anti-smoking poster for a school project .
Rather than a poster , she came up with the idea of creating a translucent , squidgy pair of lungs containing brown food colouring that shows the average amount of tar a smoker collects from just four packs of cigarettes .
" I like people to play with things more than read and write , " she says .
So she researched her idea on the internet , found a company in China that could make the device , saved up her pocket money and , with a bit of financial assistance from her mum , got her idea made .
Paula helped her daughter get a patent and since then , anti-smoking consultancy Gasp has placed an order worth £ 12,000 for 25,000 of Megan 's keyrings .
Megan is dyslexic .
Paula says her daughter " thinks differently " : she " prefers drawings and is obviously quite creative " .
Ideas pop into her mind when she watches TV .
After she got sunburnt on holiday , Megan devised a small plastic bracelet that changes colour in the sun , telling you when to put on sunscreen , and a T - shirt that does the same thing .
Several sunscreen companies have expressed an interest in the idea .
" We were walking the dogs once and what did you come out with ? " asks Paula .
" A ball that could be filled with water and you called it Quetch – like fetch !
– because it quenches a dog 's thirst .
But we did n't do anything with it .
There 's a lot we have n't done , but I backed her on the anti-smoking one because I thought , actually , Meg , it 's good . "
There is also Megan 's idea for a dog collar containing a speaker so that owners can call their dog on the collar .
Then she pulls out a picture of a special fishing rod she has designed .
" There is a camera at the end of the rod , on the hook , " she explains , " and it 's waterproof , and the screen is on the handle , and it shows you if you 've caught a fish or not . "
Megan goes to Girl Guides , does n't want to go to university , and likes the inventor Trevor Baylis , trampolining , the film Marley & Me , Miley Cyrus and The BFG .
She keeps her pink - and - cream bedroom immaculately tidy .
Paula is amazed and a bit confused by her daughter , who is a quiet , yet also slightly demanding presence in their hectic household .
" Everything has to be routine , " Paula says .
" Her brothers and sisters go with the flow , but with Meg it's , ' What time will that be happening ? ' or , ' Where am I being picked up from today ? '
That 's why , when she does enjoy something , I encourage her .
She needs a lot of encouragement . "
Niall Thompson , 16 , started a maths degree at Cambridge aged 15
Niall Thompson : ' I think the media wish I was 4ft nothing with Harry Potter glasses and no friends and no personality . '

" I was just normal in primary school , " Niall Thompson says .
Five years on , he started at Cambridge University aged just 15 ; the only child of a single mother from a family in which no one had ever gone to university .
His life changed in his first week at high school in Manchester .
His maths teacher , Kate Parker , took him aside at the end of lessons and gave him an advanced textbook to try .
He found it relatively easy , so Parker began teaching him after school , delaying her retirement by two years to help him .
It was she who first suggested he try for Oxbridge .
Classmates teased him , saying he and Parker were having a romance .
" There were insinuations , " he says .
" I 'd like to point out that she was 60 . "
After picking up an A * in his maths GCSE in Year 8 , he took his A - levels in Year 10 .
His mum worried he worked too hard at school .
Did he feel he was missing out on normal teenage life ?
" Not often , " he says .
He was relieved to leave Manchester for Cambridge .
" It 's good not to stick out for once . "
Niall does not look any younger than many other boyish first - years at Cambridge .
When he arrived he was nervous : " But two weeks later I was absolutely fine . "
He can call his personal tutor , Martin Hughes , any time on his mobile phone .
Hughes , along with everyone in Niall 's hall of residence , had a Criminal Records Bureau check .
Two terms in , Niall has not socialised much yet .
He went out only once during freshers ' week because everything was based around drinking .
" That was the main difficulty , " he says , " although that really does n't bother me at all .
Everyone should be working anyway . "
He has not joined any clubs or societies ( " I refused to join the Maths Society .
If you 're going to join a society , join a society that 's different from what you 'd be doing otherwise " ) and does not like sport , so instead he relaxes in his room .
He is " never off Facebook " , talking to Vicky , his best friend from home ( although she 's not in his good books right now after she posted on the internet some maths answers he gave her ) .
He watches a lot of DVD boxsets – Shameless , Catherine Tate and , especially , Doctor Who .
With his piercings and love of Paramore , he is a bit of an emo kid .
" I 'm not ashamed , " he says .
Niall will graduate from university before his peers even start it .
This kind of fast - tracking occurs nowadays only in maths , according to Hughes , where there is a belief that you peak early , burn out young , and if you have n't made your mark by 21 , you never will .
When Niall was little , he wanted to be a train driver and then a Concorde pilot .
Now he does not know what he will do at 18 ; he thinks he may need a year out .
He found the media attention when he started at Cambridge a bit weird .
" Sometimes I think they wish I was 4ft nothing with Harry Potter glasses and no friends and no personality , " he says of journalists who meet him .
Does he feel uncomfortable being called a child prodigy or a genius ?
" I 've got used to it .
I feel like I 'm in my rightful place .
I 'm surrounded by people who think you 're good if you 're good at maths , and it 's not considered strange . "
Andrew Halliburton , 23 , began studying maths with secondary school pupils at 8
Andrew Halliburton : ' I always felt I had to live up to that genius moniker , I never once thought I could . '

Before Andrew was two , he recognised the numbers and letters when Countdown came on TV in the living room of the family 's flat in Dundee .
His dad , Al , a civilian police driver , and his mum , Jean , a cleaner , were baffled .
" When he was young , I thought he was hyperactive , " Jean says .
" We had him at the doctors ' and that 's what they said .
But he was n't . "
Luckily , when Andrew was still very young , the council recognised his promise and provided him with a tutor and a computer .
Andrew did Mensa puzzles in newspapers and played on the computer in his bedroom .
" I feel like my childhood was sort of wasted , " he says .
" I did n't really get to go out as much as other kids , but I did enjoy the typical stuff little boys did . "
Like riding bikes ?
He pauses .
" I never did learn to ride a bike . "
When he was eight , his primary school headteacher phoned around secondary schools to find somewhere he could study higher - level maths .
At nine , his maths classmates were 13 and 14 .
" It did n't faze me , " he says .
He was big for his age , almost 6ft by the time he was 11 , which was when he sat his standard level maths .
For the first time in his life , he felt pressured and " started to panic " .
His peers , teachers and parents all expected him to do well .
Then there was the media .
A picture of him sitting on a pile of textbooks and holding up rulers hangs in his parents ' living room .
" Genius Andrew Halliburton " was how the Sun referred to him .
But for a shy boy , talking to the media was tough .
" I could hardly get my words straight , " he says of a TV news appearance .
" That built up a lot of pressure for me before the exam . "
He ended up with a grade two .
He took his highers more slowly , got top grades and went straight to an applied computing course at university .
For years , this had been the ultimate goal .
It was a disappointment .
" I was pretty disheartened when I found out it was a lot easier than I 'd expected , " he says .
" Uni was the one time I had a bit of trouble making friends , which was strange because I was with my own age group . "
He dropped out in his first year and got a job at McDonald's .
Out of place , and unsure of what to do with his life , he nearly got fired .
" What could be worse than getting fired from McDonald's ? " he says .
Five years later , he is still there , a humble crew member who sometimes enjoys the surprised look on customers ' faces when he does the sums in his head rather than going to the till .
He 's not bothered by the geek tag – " I always thought of myself as a bit of a nerd " – but balks at the word genius .
" I never liked the term . "
Was it a burden ?
" Certainly .
I always felt I had to live up to that genius moniker , I never once thought I could . "
It shocks people , Andrew says , but he does n't really like maths .
He 's going back to university in September , this time to pursue his real passion : computer game technology .
" I always thought my parents would n't accept that , " he says , but Al is " over the moon " .
" I was disappointed when he left university , but we did n't fall out .
We expected a lot .
We expected him to do well .
I 'm not saying he did n't live up to my expectations , because he went and got a job , but McDonald 's is a bit of a dead - end job . "
Andrew looks at his mum and dad .
" I feel I have n't lived up to my expectations , " he says .
Jennifer Pike , 20 , became , at 12 , the youngest winner of Young Musician of the Year
Jennifer Pike : ' The number of young people I 've met with somebody literally forcing them to do this …'

Jennifer
Pike is acutely aware that the number of musical prodigies whose early precocity has ended in tragedy could make up a full orchestra .
And she knows of exceptionally talented contemporaries who have struggled with family expectations , and the machinations of the music business that burden a young soloist .
In 2002 , Jennifer , aged 12 , became the youngest winner of BBC Young Musician of the Year .
Instead of burning out , she has taken what critics called " a slow - burn approach " : she eschewed publicity for quiet but intense musical study , and is now balancing an undergraduate degree at Oxford with 40 concerts a year around the world .
We have long been fascinated by musical prodigies – Mozart famously began composing at five – but great artists are often seen as manipulated victims .
" There are so many awful stories – Michael Rabin accomplished everything by the time he was 20 and died tragically , " Jennifer says .
" It 's an honour to be told you have a prodigious talent , but the word has unwanted associations , which is tough for a youngster . "
We assume things come easily to gifted people .
" I 'm very serious and very dedicated , " she says .
" It is like a swan on water : there 's a lot of paddling underneath . "
Her career has entailed sacrifices : her family did not go on holiday so she could play expensive , top - quality violins and there are many things , from basketball to skiing , she would like to do but can't , for fear of injuring her hands .
The daughter of Jeremy Pike , a talented composer who studied under Henryk Górecki in Poland and is head of composition at Chetham 's School of Music in Manchester , Jennifer was taken to concerts as a baby .
A few weeks before her fifth birthday , she picked up a violin .
Her dad immediately spotted her natural talent ; Jennifer says she just " hacked away enthusiastically " .
Her drive , she says , was her own .
" The number of young people I 've met with somebody speaking for them , literally forcing them to do this ...
I am lucky .
I have a very inspiring and supportive family . "
As a child , she always wanted to do more practice and play more ; it was she who had to push her teachers .
" It 's funny , the mentality of England is often , ' Let 's just keep everybody at the same level ' , rather than assisting individual needs . "
She went to Chetham 's aged eight , then , at 16 and with one A - level in music to her name , was taken on by the Guildhall School of Music & Drama to do a three - year postgraduate course in music .
Last autumn , she started an undergraduate music degree at Oxford .
" I am really going for the whole life of being a student , not only to broaden those musical horizons , but really engage with young people .
That will enrich my concert experience . "
To be a concert violinist , she believes you have to experience " normal " ( " I hate using that word " ) life .
When not practising , she watches old films and listens to jazz , Snow Patrol , Coldplay and even heavy metal on her iPod .
" You have to be a really grounded person to communicate music . "
She does n't feel gifted .
" I feel lucky to have this passion for music .
It is just like speaking , in a way ; what you say is completely spontaneous and you do n't know what is making you say these things . "
John Nunn , 54 , was , at 15 , the youngest Oxford undergraduate since Cardinal Wolsey
John Nunn : ' I do n't like this child prodigy / genius thing .
Human abilities are multifaceted . '

In 1970 , when John Nunn was 15 , excited newspapers reported he'd become probably the youngest Oxford undergraduate since Cardinal Wolsey in the 15th century .
Unlike many celebrated underage undergraduates who followed , John did n't go off the rails .
He obtained his degree , taught at Oxford and became a professional chess player , rising to grandmaster and winning tournaments .
He is now a successful chess author and publisher , living in Surrey with his wife , son and at least 1,200 books about chess with exotic , sinister titles : Mastering The Najdorf , Beating The Sicilian II .
John 's father noticed he was unusual when , at three , he memorised the number of pages of every book in the bookcase .
At four , he was taught to play chess by his father and , at seven , began beating him .
He won his first championship aged nine and at 10 went to the comprehensive near his home in Roehampton , south - west London , a year early .
He took maths O - level at 12 , two maths A - levels at 14 .
Taking classes with children four years older did not bother him : " I was too young to have social anxiety .
I just got on with it . "
He remembers " a relatively normal childhood " kicking about Putney Heath .
Unlike other extremely bright children , he never attracted derogatory nicknames and never became disruptive .
" The chess helped .
It was something else I could turn my mind to . "
At Oxford , things got trickier : " Most of the boys were a few years older than me and into girls and drinking and things . "
In those days , there were no CRB checks or special help for a 15 - year - old undergraduate : he shared a room with a " nice " 18 - year - old geologist who proved useful when John needed help shooing nosy reporters off the premises .
" I 'm not sure he had his geologist 's hammer with him when he went out , " he laughs .
The labels that go with early achievement irritate him .
" I do n't like this child prodigy / genius thing .
OK , you 're a bit ahead of other people in one particular subject , but there is just this spectrum .
Human abilities are multifaceted . "
John detects a profound difference between modern childhood and his youth .
As a child , he would play in the garden , read , do a bit of maths or chess .
" With all the conflicting claims on children 's time now , it 's easy not to develop a particular talent which you might have done if you devoted more time to it . "
US Copyright Group Says BitTorrent 's Architecture Explains Why It's Ok To Lump 5,000 Defendants Into One Lawsuit
from the they - could - all - be - sharing !
dept
Under the BitTorrent protocol , the initial file - provider intentionally elects to share or upload a file via a BitTorrent network ....
This is called " seeding . " ...
Other users ( " peers " ) on the network connect to the seeder to download ....
As additional peers request the same file , each additional user becomes a part of the network ( or " swarm " ) from where the file can be downloaded , which means that such additional user 's computer is connected not only to the seeder / uploader but also to other peer / downloaders ....
Unlike the older P2P protocols , each new file downloader is receiving a different piece of the data from each user who has already downloaded that piece of data , all of which pieces together comprise the whole ....
This means that every " node " or peer user who has a copy of the infringing copyrighted material on such a network -- or even a portion of a copy -- can also be a source of download for that infringing file , potentially both copying and distributing the infringing work simultaneously ....
This distributed nature leads to a rapid viral spreading of a file through peer users , all of whom are both uploading and downloading portions of the file simultaneously ....
As more peers join the swarm , the likelihood of a successful download increases ...
Because of the nature of the BitTorrent protocols , any peer that has downloaded a file prior to the time a subsequent peer downloads the same file is automatically a possible , and even likely , source of the file for the subsequent peer ....
Essentially , because of the nature of the swarm downloads as described above , every infringer is simultaneously stealing copyrighted material through collaboration from many other infringers , through a number of ISPs , in numerous jurisdictions around the country .

US Copyright Group ( really DC - based law firm Dunlap , Grubb & Weaver ) is the group that famously has sued thousands of people not to actually take anyone to court , but in an attempt to find out who they are so it can send them " pre-settlement " letters , demanding payment of thousands of dollars to get them to drop a potential lawsuit .
Of course , for this " business model " to work , it can't actually get involved in costly lawsuits or even go to the trouble of spending the fees involved in filing lots of separate lawsuits in the location where the defendants actually live .
So it lumped them all together into a single lawsuit in DC .
Lots of folks quickly pointed out that this seems to violate the law , and the judge in one of the cases has asked USCG to explain why she should n't dump all but one of the defendants from the suit .
THREsq is reporting on USCG 's response , where it tries to defend lumping all of the defendants into one giant case through the somewhat amusing claim that , due to the way BitTorrent works , all the defendants are linked because ( who knows !?! ) all of the defendants may have actually shared bits of the file with each other !
Seriously .
Of course , no one charged anyone with theft here , so it 's a bit odd to see USCG claim that " stealing " happened .
If that were the case , why not go to the police ?
But , more importantly , USCG is trying to argue that because BitTorrent involves little bits shared via a swarm , that it makes sense to link all the lawsuits since they may have been together in a swarm .
I can't see how that actually makes any sense .
Each of the actions were done independently , and there 's no evidence presented that these all were actually a part of the same swarm .
On top of that , I do wonder if calling out some of the specifics of how BitTorrent works could actually do harm to any case that actually goes to court ( as if that will ever happen ) .
Some have pointed out that with the way BitTorrent is set up , that anyone doing the sharing is contributing such a minimal part to the whole ( something USCG seems to be admitting here ) , that users have a stronger ( though , certainly not concrete ) fair use claim , in that the amount they share / receive is tiny and not a large portion of the file .
Either way , this response seems pretty weak , and hopefully the judge agrees .

Update June 7 , 2010 Yahoo ! has changed it 's Profiles feature into Yahoo !
Pulse .
Since the layout and URLs are a bit different , we have updated our opt out instructions below .
Earlier this week , Yahoo !
announced a plan to try to leverage its Yahoo !
Mail users ' contacts into a social network of friends who will receive your Yahoo !
Updates .
Once the most visited website in the world , Yahoo !
now ranks fourth worldwide , reaching about a quarter of all Internet users each day .
Like Google Buzz 's ill - fated launch using Gmail contacts , Yahoo !
wants to jump start its social networking plans with the hundreds of millions of people who already use its email and messenger services .
While Yahoo !
made some effort to avoid the worst aspects of the Facebook and Google Buzz privacy controversies , ultimately the plan conflicts with two principles of the EFF Bill of Privacy Rights for social network users .
The program will begin a roll out next week , and Yahoo !
users need to opt out if they do not wish to participate .
What Are Your Yahoo !
Updates ?
Yahoo !
Updates are similar to Facebook 's news feed and Twitter 's tweets .
For people who receive your Updates ( more on that below ) , they will be seen on the basic Yahoo !
Mail screen , in a category called “ Updates ” just below where email messages are displayed .
Updates will " include things like comments on message boards , songs you ’ve rated , movies you ’ve reviewed , articles you ’ve Buzzed , photos you ’ve uploaded in Flickr , questions you ’ve asked or answered on Yahoo !
Answers and other similar activities . "
If you have customized your Yahoo !
homepage with apps , these apps may also generate Updates .
According to Yahoo ! , " Because the majority of events listed within Updates are inherently public activities , our defaults are set to allow anyone to see them . "
Here ’s the problem :
Even though many of these events are indeed available to the public in that they can be found if searched for ( often by looking in specific places ) , this does not necessarily mean that users want all of these activities to be pushed onto the home email screens of other users .
Whether or not users will want this publicity depends on who will see the Updates .
Who Will See Your Yahoo !
Updates ?
You can never know the complete list of those who will receive Updates about your activities on Yahoo !.
Previously , your Updates were shared with your Connections , an earlier Yahoo !
effort at opt - in social networking that was not widely adopted .
More recently , Yahoo ! started sharing with your Yahoo !
Messenger buddies .
Starting next week , your Updates will get posted automatically to anyone who has you in their Yahoo !
Mail address book , as opposed to , for example , the people in your address book .
Thus , if someone wants to follow your Updates , they can just add you to their address book and you will not know .
What that means is that whenever your doctor , your ex , your stalker , or your plumber include your email address as a Contact in their address book , they will automatically see Updates about your activities on Yahoo ! ’s many , many websites whenever they log into Yahoo !
Mail .
In an effort to avoid Google 's gaffe in making Buzz user 's email contacts public , Yahoo !
Updates will not publicize who is in your address book or who has you in their address book .
By publishing Updates only to people who have you as a Yahoo !
Contact , rather than to those people whose addresses are in your Yahoo !
Contact list , Yahoo ! will avoid revealing any information about who is in your address book .
This solves one privacy problem but creates another : you ca n’t make an informed decision about publicizing your activities because you do n’t know who will see it .
The EFF Bill of Privacy Rights requires " a clear user interface that allows [ users ] to make informed choices about who sees their data and how it is used , " and that " Users should be able to see readily who is entitled to access any particular piece of information about them . "
Yahoo !’s system fails to uphold these rights since it does n’t let you know or control who is getting sent your Updates .
While implemented differently , Yahoo ! ’s strategy ultimately falls prey to the same underlying problem as Google Buzz : your email contact list and your social network are not the same thing , and in some cases may be quite different – and products that try to turn one into the other are doomed to hurt users .
As Newsweek put it " Social networks are about sharing , and e-mail services are intensely private .
Like lightning and swimming pools , they just do n’t mix . "
Red :
Your social network
Blue : People with your Yahoo !
email address
Google Buzz incited controversy because its Gmail users ' contacts were a poor match for their friends .
One might email with doctors , lawyers , landlord , bosses , former spouses , and the like , and yet not want to share personal photos and links with them ( nor receive updates from them ) .
Likewise , when it comes to Yahoo !
Updates , there will likely be other Yahoo !
Mail users who have your email in their address book , but are not actually your friends ; you may not even know them at all or you may know them only as your doctor , your child ’s teacher or your car mechanic .
Yet all of those Yahoo ! users who happen to have your Yahoo !
email address will soon be getting a constant stream of your online activity , unless you opt out .
( They could also choose to block your Updates , if they do not care to see your activities ) .
Can You Control Who Receives Your Yahoo !
Updates ?
Not on a person - by - person basis .
You can control what categories of content are included in your Updates stream .
For example , you can choose to include your comments on Yahoo !
News stories but not include the photos you post to Flickr .
You will also be able to decide whether or not a particular action is published to the Update stream at all , on a per- post opt - out basis .
Or you can decide to just opt - out of Updates completely .
However , as noted above , there are currently no controls over who receives your Updates .
As a result , Yahoo !
Mail users will soon find themselves automatically opted in to a new sharing program without control over with whom they are sharing .
This opt - out program conflicts with EFF ’s Bill of Privacy Rights , which provides that " When the service wants to make a secondary use of the data , it must obtain explicit opt - in permission from the user . "
These contacts were provided to Yahoo ! for the purpose of email and messaging , not social networking .
If Yahoo wants to use that data for a new purpose , it should only do so on an opt - in basis .
How to Opt Out of Yahoo !
Updates
You must opt out if you do n't want to publicize your activities with anyone who has your email address in their address book .
In the wake of the Facebook privacy settings controversy , Yahoo ! has made the opt - out process fairly straight forward .
Yahoo !
Updates Sharing Control
To opt - out of the new program , go to http://profiles.yahoo.com/settings/updates/ and uncheck the box next to Share My Updates .
In addition , to opt out of sharing authorized by your friends , you need to go to http://profiles.yahoo.com/settings/permissions, and uncheck " Allow my connections to share my information labeled ' My Connections ' with third - party applications . "
While on this page , you should review your settings , and adjust the privacy levels as appropriate .
This page also allows to to hide your profile entirely .
Update June 7 , 2010
To control your privacy on the newly introduced Yahoo !
Pulse , go to http://pulse.yahoo.com/y/settings and click on " Manage privacy settings . "
A pop-up window will appear , with a list of checkboxes .
Here you can opt out of sharing a variety of information , and choose to hide your profile .
To maximize privacy , everything should be deselected , except the last option " Hide my profile . "
Next , select the link " my updates " from the first line of text in the pop-up .
This will bring you to the Updates page , where you can uncheck " Share my updates . "
If you have previously followed our opt - out instructions , this should already be unchecked .
Note : Yahoo ! is doing a slow rollout .
The link to http://pulse.yahoo.com/y/settings may not work for you yet .
If that is the case , use the old instructions for now .

While on his book tour Karl Rove continues to revise the history of both George W. Bush and himself .
While in Oklahoma City , Rove said that Bush would never allow him , “ to engage in calling the leaders of the opposition party disparaging labels and question their motives . ”
This is yet another lie from Rove , who is on the outside looking in , and desperate for a comeback .
In Oklahoma City , according to the The Oklahoman Rove unleashed more revisionist history while griping about Obama criticizing his opposition , “ ” President Bush , for example , never allowed a White House staffer or administration spokesman to go out and do what this administration and our predecessor routinely did — that is to engage in calling the leaders of the opposition party disparaging labels and question their motives . ”
Interestingly enough , it sure seemed like Rove was questioning the Democrats motives when he spoke to the New York Conservative Party on June 22 , 2005 , “ But perhaps the most important difference between conservatives and liberals can be found in the area of national security .
Conservatives saw the savagery of 9/11 and the attacks and prepared for war ; liberals saw the savagery of the 9/11 attacks and wanted to prepare indictments and offer therapy and understanding for our attackers .
In the wake of 9/11 , conservatives believed it was time to unleash the might and power of the United States military against the Taliban ; in the wake of 9/11 , liberals believed it was time to … submit a petition .
I am not joking .
Submitting a petition is precisely what Moveon.org did .
It was a petition imploring the powers that be ” to “ use moderation and restraint in responding to the… terrorist attacks against the United States . ”

Rove has also forgotten about his June 12 , 2006 speech to New Hampshire Republicans where he said of Democrats , “ They may be with you for the first shots , but they ’re not going . . . to be with you for the tough battles . ”
Rove questioned Barack Obama ’s patriotism in 2008 :
Rove also questioned Michelle Obama ’s patriotism too :
Karl Rove ’s entire career has been based on questioning the patriotism of the opposition , or are we supposed to forget about what he did to former Sen .
Max Cleland in 2002 where he helped champion the campaign to question the war hero triple amputee ’s patriotism ?
( By the way for anyone who thinks that things are just as bad under Obama as they were under Bush , this ad should serve as a nice reminder of what the post - 9/11 political climate was all about ) .
Rove is a desperate liar who is looking to rehabilitate his legacy in order to get back into power within the GOP , but as the 2006 and 2008 elections demonstrated , Rove ’s brand of patriot politics is terribly outdated and no longer impacts voters the way it used to .
Rove is trying to spin Bush ’s legacy , and he is still operating under the same principle that he was during the Bush years .
He believes that the American people are stupid , and never paying attention , so they can be easily lied to and misled .
Rove ’s thinking is so 2004 , and it really looks like the old dog has run out of tricks .
As a review of Rove ’s Memoir Courage and Consequences by Tom Mcllory pointed out , “ Rove ’s lengthy memoir , entitled “ Courage and Consequence , ” promises its readers that it will “ pull back the curtain on my journey to the White House and my years there . ”
But the former Deputy Chief of Staff to President George W. Bush occasionally rewrites history or repeats dubious claims . ”
Mcllory who writes for the Houston Chronicle pointed out that Rove rewrote history on invading Iraq , Iraq and 9/11 , torture , Mike Brown , smearing McCain in 2000 , Bush ’s DUI , and Clinton sabotaging the White House .
The book tour lie is just part of his latest plan to rehabilitate Bush ’s legacy and by extension , his own .
CIUDAD JUAREZ , Mexico ( AP ) — Pointing their rifles , Mexican security forces chased away U.S. authorities investigating the shooting of a 15 - year - old Mexican by a U.S. Border Patrol agent on the banks of the Rio Grande , the FBI and witnesses told The Associated Press on Wednesday .
The killing of the Mexican by U.S. authorities — the second in less than two weeks — has exposed the distrust between the two countries that lies just below the surface , and has enraged Mexicans who see the death of the boy on Mexican soil as an act of murder .
Shortly after the boy was shot , Mexican soldiers arrived at the scene and pointed their guns at the Border Patrol agents across the riverbank while bystanders screamed insults and hurled rocks and firecrackers , FBI spokeswoman Andrea Simmons said .
She said the agents were forced to withdraw .
" It pretty quickly got very intense over on the Mexican side , " she said , adding that FBI agents showed up later and resumed the investigation , even as Mexican authorities pointed guns at them from across the river .
A relative of the dead boy who had been playing with him told the AP that the Mexicans — who he described as federal police , not soldiers — pointed their guns only when the Americans waded into the mud in an apparent attempt to cross into Mexico .
The Mexican authorities accused the Americans of trying to recover evidence from Mexican soil and threatened to kill them if they crossed the border , prompting both sides to draw their guns , said the 16 - year - old boy who asked not to be further identified for fear of reprisal .
The confrontation occurred Monday night over the body of Sergio Adrian Hernandez Huereka , who died of his wounds beside the column of a railroad bridge connecting Ciudad Juarez , Mexico , and El Paso , Texas .
Each government has made veiled accusations suggesting misconduct on the part of the other 's law enforcement agents .
Hernandez was found 20 feet ( six meters ) into Mexico , and an autopsy revealed that the fatal shot was fired at a relatively close range , according to Arturo Sandoval , a spokesman for the Chihuahua state attorney general 's office .
Mexican authorities said a .40 caliber shell casing was found near the body , suggesting that the Border Patrol agent might have crossed into Mexico to shoot the boy .
That would violate the rules for Border Patrol agents , who are supposed to stay on the U.S. side — and could open the agent to a Mexican homicide prosecution .
A U.S. official close to the investigation told the AP that authorities have a video showing that the Border Patrol agent did not cross into Mexico .
In fact , the official said , the video shows what appear to be members of Mexican law enforcement crossing onto the U.S. side , picking something up and returning to Mexico .
The official was not cleared to speak about the video and spoke only on condition of anonymity .
Alejandro Pariente , Chihuahua state 's regional deputy attorney general , said the U.S. Border Patrol has given him video which he is reviewing .
He declined to describe it except to say that it has sped up the investigation .
The two killings have provoked anger in Mexico like no other recent controversy surrounding immigration , including Arizona 's new law making it a state crime to be an illegal immigrant and President Obama 's decision to send the National Guard to the border .
Although many Mexicans were unhappy with both initiatives , popular and official reaction had been subdued , in contrast to street protests seen in previous years when the U.S. has cracked down on the border .
Many Mexicans have since given up hope for a quick solution to the immigration problem , while other issues including growing drug violence have taken center stage in relations between the two countries .
That has started to change with the back - to - back deaths of two Mexicans at the border : the teenager killed Monday , and migrant Anastasio Hernandez , 42 , who died after a Customs and Border Protection officer shocked him with a stun gun at the San Ysidro border crossing that separates San Diego and Tijuana , Mexico .
Anastasio Hernandez , who had lived in the U.S. since he was 14 , was buried in San Diego on Wednesday .
Mexican news media were filled with images of the 15 - year - old 's bloody body and his grieving relatives .
One tabloid ran a large photograph on its cover , with the banner headline " Grindaderas , " salty slang that roughly translates as " things Americans do . "
Mexican President Felipe Calderon pledged to " use all resources available to protect the rights of Mexican migrants , " and his foreign secretary , Patricia Espinosa , said Mexico was n't taking the Americans ' word that the Border Patrol agent had been defending himself from rock - throwers when he opened fire .
Chihuahua state Gov. Jose Reyes Baeza blamed the two killings on racism fueled by Arizona 's law .
" We believe that this killing , the second in recent days in the border between the two countries , is due to xenophobia and racism , derived from the approval of Arizona 's anti-immigration law , " Reyes said .
Meanwhile , the Border Patrol released statistics showing that assaults on agents along the border between El Paso , Texas , and Ciudad Juarez , Mexico , were on pace to far exceed totals in the previous four years .
In the past seven months , Border Patrol agents in the El Paso sector have been assaulted 33 times , compared with 39 times in the entire previous year .
Twenty - nine of those incidents were rock - throwing , compared to 31 such incidents in all of fiscal 2009 .
That 's what happened Monday night , when suspected illegal immigrants who ran back to Mexico began throwing rocks at Border Patrol agents detaining other immigrants , Simmons said .
At least one rock came from behind the agent , who was kneeling beside a suspected illegal immigrant whom he was holding prone on the ground , Simmons said .
The agent told the rock throwers to stop , then fired his weapon several times , hitting the boy , she said .
The FBI is leading the investigation because it involves an assault on a federal officer .
The agent was not injured , Simmons said .
T.J. Bonner , president of the union representing Border Patrol agents , said rock throwing aimed at Border Patrol agents is common and capable of causing serious injury .
" It is a deadly force encounter , one that justifies the use of deadly force , " Bonner said .
Mexicans ridiculed that stance .
" Let 's say that Anastasio and Sergio Adrian attacked the border agents , one with his fists and the other with rocks , " columnist Manuel Jauregui wrote in the newspaper Reforma .
" Does that mean that killing them was the only valid option ? "
Here are core lessons from the masters : Peter Damien OSB Cam. , Thomas Verner Moore OSB MD , Gerald Fitzgerald s.P. , Aquinas Walter Richard Sipe , Marianne Benkert Sipe M.D. , Thomas Patrick Doyle , Leo Bartemeir M.D. , Ansom Shupe PhD , Eugene Kennedy PhD and Sarah Charles MD
The sexual assault of minors is about power , not sex .
Child Sexual Abuse Imagery , assault and trafficking are fruit of the same delict .
The conduct is criminal behavior , not issues of belief , sin or other magical thinking .
Child sexual abuse includes , but is not limited to , showing a child pornographic images , placing the child ’s hand on another person ’s genitals , touching a child ’s genitals , and / or penetration of any orifice of a child ’s body ( mouth , vagina , penis , anus , ears ) with a penis , finger , tongue , toe , or an object of any sort .
Penetration does not have to occur for it be sexual abuse .
The prevalence of sexual abuse in the Churches was massively covered up and thus underestimated for two millennia .
An additional delay was the recantation by Sigmund Freud of his original theory that serious psychological disturbances were caused by sexual abuse of children .
Freud changed the theory that the histories of sexual abuse provided by his patients were fantasies .
As a result , the secular recognition of child sexual abuse was delayed until around 1950 when Alfred Kinsey surveyed women discovering 25 % suffered from pre-pubertal sexual abuse .
David Finkelhor confirmed this in their 1970 ’s surveys .
These findings were reaffirmed in the largest study to date , Adverse Childhood Effects ( A.C.E ) study with Vincent Felitti M.D. in San Diego .
The Catholic Church is a monarchical system that promises salvation to followers that adhere to the teachings .
The system is fueled by a three tiered taxation engine rooted in powerful myths .
Nota Bene , the first teaching against clerical sexual abuse of minors is from the Didache in 60 A.D .
The Catholic Church is a consortium of 23 sui generis churches under from many cultures and languages under the Bishop of Rome .
Each church is rooted in a specific language / culture called a Rite with the Roman Rite representing 95 % of the 1 billion worldwide followers .
The Catholic Church is also a secular State known as Sanctae Sedes or the Holy See .
The Holy See has diplomatic missions in hundreds of countries called Nunciatures staffed by representatives appointed by the Pope .
The Vatican Bank or I.O.R. is one of the conduits by which the Holy See receives taxes from the 4,400 Dioceses and hundreds of thousands of parishes , missions and auxiliary enterprises .
The Holy See rules by soft power and has not maintained a military force since the creation of the Italian State .
The core Governmental principle is that Power flows down and money flows up .
At the top of the pyramid is the Bishop of Rome aka the Pope who holds universal jurisdiction where he alone teaches , governs and sanctifies the world .
The world is organized by Dioceses which are geographic regions established by the Pope .
Only the Pope appoints the Bishop of a Diocese , the Bishop reports to the Pope and pays annual taxes to Rome .
Each Diocese is a geographic region of parishes established by the Bishop .
Only the Bishop appoints Priests to the parishes , the Priests report to the Bishop and pay annual taxes to the Diocese .
Laity do not have the capacity to govern .
Respondeat Superiori is a common law principle that closely expresses the Roman model of Church polity .
One of the key cases to be aware of is Hosanna - Tabor v. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission , 565 U.S. 171 ( 2012 ) .
A general norm of roman structure is to adapt to the local civil laws ( canon 22 ) in so far as they are not contrary to Codex Iuris Canonici .
Roman Catholic institutions adapt to State law and incorporate to what most closely represents Church Polity .
Corporation Sole is a common listing in the annual Official Catholic Directory ( O.C.D. ) delivered to the I.R.S. and a document you will come to rely upon .
There are three types of Roman Catholics : Clerics , Religious and Laity .
Clerics ( Patricians ) are men ordained as Bishops , Priests or Deacons to teach , govern and sanctify the Religious and Laity .
Religious ( Centurions ) are vowed men and women following a Rule under a Superior .
If male religious are also Clerics they can serve in parishes under the jurisdiction with faculties ( permission ) of the Diocesan Bishop .
Religious men can be either Priests or Brothers .
Religious women are referred to as Nuns or Sisters traditionally running schools and hospitals .
Religious Institutes also are in the O.C.D .
Laity ( Plebs ) are all the baptized ( 99 % ) whose job is to pray , pay and obey .
They achieve salvation through participation in the seven sacraments which are only provided by the Clerics .
Insurance is a requirement of all institutions with each Diocesan Bishop or Religious Superior as the autonomous administrator .
Dioceses and Religious Institutes rely upon commercial insurance companies as well as risk sharing pools as Catholic Mutual Group and Catholic Risk Retention Group .
Once rumor or direct knowledge of child sexual assault comes to a Bishop or Religious Superior there are several traditional management options .
An initial investigation is conducted by the Vicar for Clergy or a trusted Priest and a confidential report ( canon 489 ) is created for the Holy See and the Secret Archives which only the Bishop and Vicar General ( 2nd in command ) have access .
First and most common option is to quickly change the assignment , a geographic solution .
A second is to command the offender to see a sympathetic psychiatrist or psychologist .
Upon further offenses the Cleric or religious is ordered to the Servants of the Paraclete , Saint Luke Institute , House of Affirmation , Saint John Vianney Institute or Southdown .
Final solutions are being sent to a monastery for prayer and penance or involuntary laicization .
All of these management decisions have document trails maintained in the Secret Archives , their retention policy is in to maintain these files in perpetuity .
The Church has a closed loop wholly owned system of Treatment Centers created in 1947 for Clerics and Religious .
The purpose is to evaluate , report back and recycle back to ministry .
Initial evaluations as well as monthly and final reports are sent back to the Bishop or Superior with the most common diagnosis being Pedophilia , Ephebophilia or N.O.S. ( not otherwise specified ) .
Pedophilia is the sexual attraction to pre-pubescent minors .
Ephebophilia is the sexual attraction to post - pubescent minors .
The Church in the past faced minimal criminal exposure with a few exceptions of Fr. Donald Roemer in 1981 or Fr. John Goeghan in 2002 or Fr. Donald McGuire S.J. in 2006 .
There currently are 12 Grand Jury reports and charges against Bishops for failure to report and consumer protection violations for knowingly employing sex offenders .
For a short moment the California criminal statute of limitations was opened but quickly closed with Stogner v. California 539 U.S. 607 ( 2003 ) based on ex post facto principles .
Myth is Power : The Pope is the descendant of St. Peter and St. Paul , his teachings ex-cathedra are without the possibility of error .
Every Bishop chosen by the Pope is a successor to the Apostles .
Every Priest ordained by a Bishop is ontologically changed to be a little less than the angels , set apart to provide the sacraments necessary for salvation .
Rome is the one , true , holy , catholic ( universal ) and apostolic church .
Obedience and Secrecy are the highest virtues while creating scandal is a deadly sin .
Notice : 64 high level documents from the 1st to 21 century demonstrate notice by Catholic Bishops of child sexual assault by clerics .
Here is a short sampling .
Didache of 60 A.D. ; Council of Elvira of 309 A.D. ; Book of Gomorrah by Cardinal Peter Damian O.S.B. Cam. in 1051 A.D. ; Sacramentum Poenitentia by Pope Benedict XIV in 1741 A.D ; Instructio de Modo Procendi in Causis Sollicitationis by Pope John XXIII in 1962 A.D. ; Sacramentorum Sanctitatis Tutela by Pope John Paul II in 2001 A.D .
In a Magical Kingdom not so far away , somewhere between a place where you wish upon a star and dreams come true , Disney heroes and heroines live , once upon a time , in fairytales that are , happily , never ending .
This is the candy - coloured introductory promise of the official website of Disneyland Paris , the most visited tourist site in Europe .
Over 15.4 m people flocked to the park last year , a new record .
For most of them , the candy - coloured promise was fulfilled ( so long as they did n't mind queuing for 50 minutes to be hurled around inside Space Mountain ) .
For many of the 14,500 people who work at the site , 20 miles east of the French capital , there is another , less magical side to the Magic Kingdom .
" What we sell is something wonderful .
We sell smiles .
We sell the happiness of children .
We all love our jobs , or what our jobs represent , " said Hervé Saumade , 37 , a maintenance man and union activist at the park .
" But in the last few years , there has been a new management approach , which has , in many cases , made our working lives intolerable . "
Since the beginning of the year , two Disneyland Paris employees have committed suicide .
One of them , Franck , a cook at Disneyland for 10 years , killed himself on the day that he was supposed to return to the park after a long period of sickness .
According to his father - in - law , he scratched a message on the wall of his home which read : " Je ne veux pas retourner chez Mickey " ( I do n't want to work for Mickey any more ) .
Disney – and the majority of unions on the site – say that there is no clear evidence that Franck 's suicide was linked to his work .
His father - in - law , Pierre - Louis Neut , says that Franck , a gastronomic chef in one of the more upmarket Disney restaurants , was depressed by staff cuts and a policy switch away from " freshly made food " to frozen produce .
The other employee , also a cook , killed himself in February after what one trade union , Force Ouvrière , insists was " humiliating " treatment at work .
A Disney staff and management health committee investigation has found no evidence of work harassment .
The moderate unions on the site – those most representative of the whole workforce – accuse Force Ouvrière of " exploiting " the two deaths in an attempt to win more support in delegate elections at the park later this year .
Even the moderate unions , however , insist that something has gone desperately wrong behind the scenes in the Magic Kingdom .
Over the last five or six years , they say , a younger , mostly French , top management has taken over at Eurodisney , as the parent company is called .
The number of jobs in restaurants and hotels on the site has been sharply reduced , unions say .
The number of visitors – attracted by cut - price deals – has increased .
The hiring of seasonal workers has been slashed .
A whole tier of middle management has been removed or " reduced to secretary status " , unions say , leaving lower - level employees feeling undervalued and ignored .
Longer hours and six - day weeks are frequently demanded of everyone from pastry chefs to the " cast members " , who earn just above the French minimum wage to play Goofy or Donald Duck in the daily Disneyland parades .
The number of industrial accidents on the site has risen to 1,500 a year – one for every 10 employees – a higher rate than in the legendarily accident - prone building trade .
The moderate CFTC trade union federation , which has the widest support among French Disneyland employees , recently sent the President of Eurodisney , Philippe Gas , an excoriating open letter urging him to " wake up " .
" For years now ... union representatives have been fighting daily to denounce the shameful and degrading practices used by [ Disneyland ] managers and anyone who has a little bit of power in this business , " the letter said .
" Prozac factories will never go bankrupt given the incalculable number of your employees who use their products . "
Noel Barbier , CFTC delegate and Disneyland employee since the park opened in 1992 , says that the joyous , family atmosphere of the park used to extend beyond the mouse - ear - clad visitors .
The staff also thought themselves to be part of a family .
No more .
" A large part of the problem is that the present Disneyland management has no strategy – and apparently no desire – to get the best out of its workforce , " Mr Barbier said .
" Most people here still love Disneyland and what it stands for .
They want to enjoy their work .
" But there is no system of career development .
If you were a junior cast member in the parade at 20 , you might still be a junior cast member at 35 , " he complained .
" Playing Goofy or Mickey in the parade might look easy but those big heads that they wear take a terrible toll on people 's necks and backs .
You have to dance while wearing them .
As you get older , it gets to be very tough indeed ...
And there is little prospect of a career move to something else . "
Eurodisney , as the park was originally called , first appeared , like a garish moonbase , in the flat fields just to the east of the Paris conurbation in 1992 .
It was attacked by some in France as a spiritual monstrosity , a " cultural Chernobyl " .
The park , although still making losses in most years ( 2008 was an exception ) , has been a great popular success .
It is now as much a part of the French cultural landscape as the Eiffel Tower .
Or perhaps not quite .
In the village of Chessy on the banks of the river Marne , there is a pleasant church and village square with a bar - restaurant .
You might be in deepest rural France , except for the mournful hooting of the Disneyland Wild West steam train as it runs along the park 's perimeter fence 200 metres away .
Three Disneyland employees came to the bar in Chessy to chat to The Independent about life " Chez Mickey " .
Hervé Impinna , 43 , used to maintain the floats used in the daily parades .
He is now on lighter duties after falling from the top of Cinderella 's coach and damaging his neck and back .
" The whole attitude of management has changed , " he said .
" When I look at the illuminated night parades , I see scores of gaps where bulbs have failed and not been replaced .
Visitors may not notice the difference but I know what the spectacle is supposed to look like and it 's depressing . "
Tama Gandega , 43 , is an assistant manager in one of the large Disney hotels .
He said : " All the pleasure of service is gone .
Some days we have to do 3,500 breakfasts with half the staff we had a few years ago .
No wonder everyone is ready to drop . "
Sandrine , 39 , is part of the team which makes up the Disney princesses in the parades .
" Sometimes they are so exhausted with working six - day weeks they can hardly move , never mind smile , " she said .
" But they are obliged to smile , because that is the magic of Disney . "
The company – like the more moderate unions – has criticised Force Ouvrière for " exploiting " the suicides .
It has cast doubt on the " do n't - want - to go - back - chez - Mickey " suicide note , which was found 10 days after police first investigated the death .
The company has agreed , however , to look again at its working practices .
The official management - employee delegate committee at Disneyland , Paris agreed yesterday to hold a " social audit " of working conditions and worker satisfaction .
In the meantime , access by employees to psychological help will be improved .
Jeff Archambault , the Eurodisney vice - president for communications , said yesterday : " Because of the kind of business we run , the happiness of our employees is very important to us .
Everyone at Disneyland , Paris is a cast member , from the most junior waiter to a senior management executive .
" Many of these complaints are a matter of perception .
Not everyone who works for Disney feels ignored or undervalued .
Seventy per cent of our team managers have been promoted internally .
Despite the financial crisis , we have made a big effort to maintain – and even slightly increase – our full - time staff .
There have been wages increases of 3 per cent or more in 2009 and 2010 . "
On the high rate of work accidents at Disneyland , Mr Archambault said that the company was aware of the problem and trying to improve its record but many of the incidents were relatively " minor " .
" We do not accept that either of these tragic events [ the suicides ] can be directly linked to Disneyland , Paris , " Mr Archambault said .
" But we do recognise that , with the financial crisis , all of us are under increased stress .
At home .
At work .
We are ready to do even more , to go the extra mile , in looking at ways that we can improve relations with our employees . "
Six out of the seven Disney unions have agreed to co-operate with the " social audit " of conditions at the park .
Only the militant , but little supported , Force Ouvrière has refused .
The moderate unions – though neither " wishing on a star " nor expecting all their " dreams to come true " – hope that the audit will add a happier next chapter to the Disneyland fairytale .
Suicide watch : France Telecom
* Work - related suicide has become a high - profile political issue in France after an epidemic of deaths among employees of the telecommunications giant France Telecom .
* A judicial investigation was started last month into alleged workplace bullying after 35 France Telecom workers took their lives in the space of 18 months .
* An official investigation by the French work inspectorate in February confirmed long - standing allegations by trades unions that many of the deaths could reasonably be linked to radical changes in work practices in the last four years .
* France Telecom has been accused of shifting employees to unsuitable jobs and encouraging a bullying attitude amongst its management .
No such official allegations have been made against Eurodisney .
The South Equatorial Belt ( SEB ) has faded away leaving just the north belt ( NEB ) viewable in small telescopes .

( PhysOrg.com ) --
New photographs of the gas giant Jupiter , the first taken on May 9 , show the massive reddish band of clouds known as the Southern Equatorial Belt in the planet ’s southern hemisphere has disappeared from view .
The first photographs were taken by a noted Australian amateur astronomer , Anthony Wesley from Murrumbateman in New South Wales , using a 14.5 inch telescope .
Wesley said he had been eagerly waiting to take photographs after Jupiter disappeared behind the sun and out of view for three months .
In mid 2009 it was clear to Jupiter watchers the cloud band , which encircles the planet , was beginning to enter a new fading cycle .
Wesley , an enthusiastic Jupiter observer , said the exact time the cloud belt will revive is unknown , but it fades every three to 15 years .
Previous fading cycles have been characterized by violent and dramatic storms in the southern equatorial latitudes .
The Northern and Southern Equatorial belts are composed of ammonia ice with phosphorus and some sulfur .
It is not known why the belt periodically disappears , but it may be that it sinks lower if it cools , and then the view of it is obscured by clouds pouring in over the top of it .
The clouds on Jupiter are tens of thousands of kilometers deep .
Wesley said the phenomenon could be linked to storm activity that preceded the change .
Wesley said Jupiter , the largest planet in the solar system , is fascinating to observe and photograph because the internal heat deep within the atmosphere makes it so dynamic and dramatic , and it can look different even from one day to the next .
Watch Jupiter rotate and its cloud belts move with the winds .
The time - lapse video was made using images shot during Voyager 1's flyby of the planet in 1979 .
The most dramatic feature on Jupiter is the Great Red Spot , which now stands out more than usual since it is on the edge of the Southern Equatorial Belt , which has now faded from view .
The Great Red Spot is a huge storm twice the size of Earth that has raged for at least three centuries , although astronomers said last year it appears to be shrinking .
The photographs taken by Wesley have been released by The Planetary Society in California , and are also available on Wesley ’s own website .
In July last year Wesley was first to notice a dark blemish on Jupiter , probably caused by a comet .
It is possible to see the features of Jupiter even with quite a modest telescope .

... vegetarians and vegans have constantly an higher engagement of empathy related areas while observing negative scenes , independently of the species of the individuals involved , which is characterized by an increased recruitment of the ACC and the IFG .
Increased activation in the ACC and left IFG in vegetarians and vegans during human and animal suffering view is likely to reflect a stronger empathic response in the first two groups .
Remarkably , the within - group analysis during animal picture view , showed the absence of signal changes ( in terms of activations and deactivations ) within the amygdala in vegetarians and vegans , suggesting a down - regulation of amygdala response from areas located in the frontal lobes , in an attempt to regulate emotion through cortical processes in these subjects .

Interactions between stimuli ( animal / human ) and groups ( omnivore / vegetarian / vegan ) .
(A) An interaction was found in the right amygdala , indicating greater increase to animal negative valence picture view in omnivores and to human negative valence picture view in vegans .
An interaction between “ human pictures ” and “ vegan group ” was also found in the left amygdala .
The control condition consisted of “ neutral ” scenes that did not include living beings , faces , or suffering of any kind .
Participants passively viewed the photos , they did not have to respond by indicating their emotional reactions .
Participants could be desensitized to human suffering by watching the news .

Stolen from here .
In Short Cuts , the " vegetarians and vegans are more empathetic " neuroimaging article was mentioned in passing , but I did n't actually blog about it .
However , there has been one thingbothering me about this paper ...
But first , a quick summary of the Methods which were rather straightforward .
Filippi and colleagues ( 2010 ) recruited 20 omnivores , 19 vegetarians , and 20 vegans to participate in a study that examined their brain responses to images of human and animal suffering .
They were naïve as to the goals of the experiment .
Before entering the scanner , all participants completed the Empathy Quotient , a 40 item questionnairethat rates one 's level of empathy ( Baron - Cohen & Wheelwright , 2004 ) .
The omnivores did indeed have lower EQ scores ( 38.8 ) than the vegetarians ( 49.5 ) and the vegans ( 44.6 ) , who did not differ from each other .
The fMRI experiment used an ... So what were the neuroimaging findings ?
To no one 's surprise , results indicated differences between the groups , as shown below .
Also to no one 's surprise , differences between the groups were more pronounced for animal pictures ( Fig. 3B ) than for human pictures ( Fig. 3A ) .
Some of the results were interpreted in Rorschach inkblot fashion : the authors saw want they wanted to see in them .
Since when are the specific regions of the anterior cingulate cortex ( ACC ) and the inferior frontal gyrus ( IFG ) shown above primarily known as " empathy - related regions " ?
They 're not .
Curiously enough , the amygdala ( a limbic structure important for emotion ) was not activated by animal suffering in either the vegetarians or the vegans .
Although the amygdala ( LeDoux , 2007 ) is predominantly known for its role in fear conditioning , it is also activated by other emotional responses including disgust ( e.g. , Kober et al. , 2008 ) .
Why would the vegetarians and vegans attempt to down - regulate their emotional responses to animal suffering ?
And why would the vegans showamygdala responses to human suffering than did the omnivores and vegetarians ??
Previously , NeuroKüz mentioned some objections to the study design in a post on The empathetic vegetarian brain I wo n't detail his critique here other than to summarize :
One of the greatest issues , in my view , is with the mode of stimulus presentation .
The event - related design ( which is usually preferable ) may not have allowed adequate time between pictures to " recover " from the shock of seeing a mutilated human or animal .
If this were especially true for vegetarians and vegans viewing images of animal suffering , it could explain the curious silence of the amygdala .
In such scenario , a blocked design ( presenting all stimuli of one category in blocks , rather than intermixed ) might have been a better idea .
The vegetarians and vegans in this study all made their dietary choices for ethical reasons .
It is quite conceivable that they differed from the omnivores on any number of other dimensions .
For example , evolutionary psychology extremist Satoshi Kanazawa recently blogged about Why Vegetarians Are More Intelligent than Meat Eaters , but this only held for a UK sample born in 1958 , but not for a US sample born between 1974 and 1983 .
In addition , some militant vegan PETA - types condone violence against scientists performing animal experiments , so one could expect their responses ( and empathy ) towards human suffering to be diminished
It would be interesting , then , to compare these " ethical " sorts to others who have chosen to be vegetarian or vegan for heath reasons , such as familial hypercholesterolemia or athletic competitions such as the triathlon Compare anterior cingulate cortex , empathy to anterior cingulate cortex , cognitive control Here 's an even newer post , Empathy is What Really Sets Vegetarians Apart ( at least Neurologically Speaking ) Baron - Cohen S , Wheelwright S.

Somebody recently told me that hardcore is dead .
Through chipped teeth and bruised bones , I will promise you it is not .
I turned a corner into an alley on 18th street this past Friday afternoon to find a considerable crowd gathered together for the same purpose .
The place : Alleykatz ; the purpose : United Blood , Richmond ’s fourth annual hardcore festival .
Gritty as hell and DIY to the core , United Blood gathers hardcore fans from all over the country , even as far as Europe and Asia , for two days of undeniably fun chaos , the realest kind of unity I ’ve ever seen , and of course , skull - rattling , gut - pumping music .
Somebody recently told me that hardcore is dead .
Through chipped teeth and bruised bones , I will promise you it is not .
I turned a corner into an alley on 18th street this past Friday afternoon to find a considerable crowd gathered together for the same purpose .
The place : Alleykatz ; the purpose : United Blood , Richmond ’s fourth annual hardcore festival .
Gritty as hell and DIY to the core , United Blood gathers hardcore fans from all over the country , even as far as Europe and Asia , for two days of undeniably fun chaos , the realest kind of unity I ’ve ever seen , and of course , skull - rattling , gut - pumping music .
Now I myself am not a dedicated hardcore fan , but I believe that good is good , and these truly were some of the best hardcore bands in the country .
The first band I caught was Alpha and Omega from Los Angeles , CA .
A rhythm section that reverberates straight up the spine , guitar tones straight out of hell , and a front man with a snarl like a kick in the teeth made this band the perfect introduction to an awe - inspiring weekend .
Notables included hard - as - nails War Hungry and lightweight bad - asses Title Fight , both from Pennsylvania , as well as local heroes Swamp Thing , Naysayer and Wasted Time , and Boston ’s resident nutcases The Rival Mob .
The dual headliners were Connecticut ’s Death Threat and New York ’s hardcore veterans Madball .
I got a chance to talk with Collin Ackerman , co-founder of United Blood ( along with David Foster , a native Richmonder now located in PA ) , and he had this to say :
Me : When did you start United Blood ?
Collin :
In 2007 , it started small .
The headliners were DTN , Bracewar , and Have Heart .
It was just a small little thing .
It ’s probably doubled since we started .
The past two years , we ’ve had over 800 people .
Me : How did this thing come about ?
Collin :
There ’s a fest in PA called Posinumbers , one of Foster ’s friends , Bob Mac , was running it , and it stopped happening a couple years ago .
We figured “ There ’s no reason we should n’t have this here , Richmond ’s a great town and we have a great spot for it .
Let ’s try it and see what happens . ”
We just took a shot and it worked .
Without Foster , though , there would n’t be this thing .
Foster and I pretty much split everything up , doing our own paypal accounts for ticketing , booking all the bands , getting food and contracts for the bands , all of the promotions and everything
Me :
So everything was pretty DIY , huh ?
Collin : Yeah , no sponsors .
We made a pact four years ago that we ’d never have sponsors , we do everything ourselves and with the help of our friends , of course .
It affects my life a lot , I meet kids from all over the world that I would never meet otherwise .
All I care about is that people are having fun , I probably get made fun of for asking everybody that so much .
Me :
What about the connotations that hardcore can be violent and hateful ?
Collin : Honestly , it ’s aggressive just like any other art form can be , but nobody has any bad intentions for the most part .
Nobody ’s out to get anybody , it ’s just about getting what ’s inside of you out .
I do n’t think it ’s any different from Slaughterama or Best Friend ’s Day , which I love and go to .
In all four years , we ’ve had maybe one fight , but fights happen at Beach Boys concerts too .
Me : Anything else to say ?
Collin :
Thanks to everybody that comes out and has fun , thanks to all the bands , thanks to you guys for covering it .
I want everybody to have the opportunity to get exposure to things they do n’t normally see .
And check out Vinyl Conflict Records , that dude hooked us up a lot this year .
All weekend , what I was really overcome by , and Collin touched on it as well , was how positive and community driven of an event United Blood is .
One would look at the rolling , growling mass of tattoos and black eyes with abject horror , until noticing that for every one person that fell , there were two or three raising them back up .
Between songs and sets there was a smile on almost every face , a real “ I ’m just so fucking happy to be here ” smile .
Another little thing that struck me was that every band that I saw perform was sporting the t- shirt of another band at the festival , as well as giving shout outs to all the other bands , small but inspiring .
People came from all over the country to see their friends , have a great time , and support something that they all care very much about .
This , my friends , is what I call love .
Towards the end of the last set that I saw , I looked down at the pit and knew I had one thing left to do before my experience was complete .
I handed off my camera to a friend and shouted something inaudible that probably sounded like “ fuck you dad ! ” as I dove into the crowd .
I lasted about twenty seconds before my entire world exploded momentarily .
Intentional or not , I got rocked in the face so hard that I can only imagine it looked like a UFC highlight reel .
After crumpling like a pile of rags , I jumped back to my feet and into the fray , trying to ignore my wobbly - knees and what I thought to be sand in my mouth ( it was actually tiny tooth fragments ) .
In retrospect , the guy that gave me my first black eye in years probably thought I was some asshole nube , which is fair enough on his part , but to me , getting knocked the fuck out was equal to a firm shake of the hand and a “ welcome to the club . ”
For those of you that still have n’t been to United Blood , I will say that like it or not , hardcore is a part of Richmond ’s identity , and it ’s well worth the price of admission to see what locals and out of towners alike have put so much time , effort , and care into creating .
I am truly stoked to live in a town that produces the kind of diversity that exists in our art and music scene .
To those that did make it this year , I ’ll see y’all at United Blood 5 .
P.S. I ’d like to say thank you to all the bands ( every single one , not just those mentioned above ) , photographers , staff , fans , and of course Alleykatz for putting on such a great show and making this such a memorable event , you really exemplify what true dedication and hard work is all about , while still having a fucking good time .

Casino Markers & Bad Checks
In Nevada , if you sign for a line of credit or " casino marker " at a Las Vegas casino and have insufficient funds to pay the money back , you can be criminally prosecuted for " writing a bad check . "

Drunk Driving
Under Nevada law , if a breath , blood , or urine test shows you have a blood alcohol concentration ( BAC ) of 0.08 or above , you will be arrested and charged with drinking under the influence ( DUI ) .
A DUI can lead to serious penalties , including thousands of dollars in fines , incarceration , driver 's license revocation , probation , and more .
The best way to beat a DUI charge is to hire a skilled , experienced criminal defense attorney .
Michael Gowdey has helped countless Nevada , and California residents avoid jail and preserve their driving privileges .

From Arrest to Sentencing : An Overview of Criminal Procedures in Nevada
While every case is different , there are certain laws and procedures that govern how the criminal justice system in Nevada works .
Criminal defense attorney Michael Gowdey will be there to guide you through every step of the process to help you understand what is happening and what may occur .
In the interim , here is a general overview of the procedures for a criminal case in Nevada
The Arrest :
The criminal process begins when law enforcement has probable cause to believe you committed a crime .
This conclusion is reached by witnessing the crime firsthand or after a search warrant has been issued .
As a result , you will be arrested or given a citation ( common with traffic violations ) .
Following an arrest , you will most likely be taken to the Clark County Detention Center ( 330 South Casino Center Drive ) for booking where you will be fingerprinted , have your mugshot taken , and placed in holding cell ( we can assist you at any jail in the area including Henderson Jail , the Reno Washoe County Jail , the Mesquite Jail , the Laughlin Jail or the North Las Vegas Jail ) .
During this time , it may be tempting to want to deny any involvement in the alleged crime , but the smartest thing you can do is to exercise your right to remain silent until you have an attorney present .
Remember , anything you say to the police can be used against you as evidence in court .
The police officer will submit the arrest report to the district attorney for review .
The D.A. will review the police report and determine whether sufficient evidence exists to press charges .
If so , they will either sign a sworn statement or criminal complaint or present the evidence to a grand jury .
Bail
Depending on the type of offense , you may either be released on your own recognizance or required to post bail .
Bail serves as an assurance to the court that you will appear for all court appearances in the future .
Nevada courts have bail schedules where each crime is matched with a bail amount .
The most serious offenses require higher bail .
For an allegation of murder , bail will be rejected outright , and you will need to remain in custody .
Bail can be paid for with a money order , cashier 's check , or cash .
If the amount is at or below $ 3,000 , Visa and MasterCard are accepted .
Attorney Gowdey can represent you at a bail hearing and argue for a bail reduction or modification if necessary .
If you can still not afford bail , you or your loved ones can use a bail bondsman who will post bail on your behalf and charge you a small fee of about 10 % of the bail amount .
When the criminal case is completed , bail will be reimbursed .
Arraignment
Within 72 hours of your arrest , you will have your first court appearance in front of a magistrate judge , also known as an arraignment , held at one of the Justice Courts at the downtown Regional Justice Center .
At the arraignment , you will receive a copy of the criminal complaint , be advised of your rights and asked to enter a plea of guilty or not guilty .
If you are accused of a misdemeanor , the court will ask you to come back for a second court appearance or trial .
For a gross misdemeanor or felony , the court will set a date for a preliminary hearing .
During this time , Mr. Gowdey will request that the prosecution provide a packet of discovery which includes the police report , witness statements , forensic test results and other information relevant to your case .
Pre-Trial Hearings / Plea Negotiations
Once the arraignment is over , the case enters the pre-trial phase .
During this time , Mr. Gowdey and the D.A. may trade discovery , file motions , and attempt to negotiate a resolution to the case without having to go to trial .
This may include plea bargaining which may result in a plea deal that requires you to plead guilty but to a lesser charge with a reduced sentence .
For example , if you are charged with a DUI , it could be downgraded to reckless driving .
Preliminary Hearing ( Felony Case )
When charged with a felony offense in Nevada , you are entitled to a preliminary hearing .
This hearing acts as a " trial before a trial " and is not meant to prove your guilt beyond reasonable doubt but rather to determine if enough evidence or probable cause exists to believe a crime was committed and that you committed it .
At this hearing , the prosecutor can introduce physical evidence and call witnesses to testify .
This is an attempt to convince the judge that the case should go to trial .
Attorney Gowdey also has the opportunity to present counter arguments and cross-examine the witnesses to try and prove that the prosecutor 's case is not strong enough .
If the judge believes the case lacks probable cause , the charges are dropped or dismissed .
On the other hand , if the judge reaches the conclusion that probable cause does exist , you will be " held to answer . "
This means the case is sent to District Court to defend against the charges .
Trial
If you face misdemeanor charges , you do not have the right to a jury .
Instead , your case will be decided by a judge ( bench trial ) .
For felony charges , you may elect a bench trial or jury trial .
During the trial , criminal defense attorney Michael Gowdey will work tirelessly to expose weaknesses in the prosecution 's case and also to create reasonable doubt .
Compassionate Representation for Personal Injury Victims
Being injured in an accident is a devastating experience especially if the accident is preventable .
Personal injury attorney Michael Gowdey has been advocating for the rights of personal injury victims for 23 years .
He knows the tactics insurance adjusters may attempt to use to pay you less than the full value of your personal injury claim .
In fact , Mr. Gowdey has stood up to insurance companies time and time again to make sure that his clients are not taken advantage of .
Therefore , you can count on him to advocate on your behalf for the maximum compensation available under the law .

Decisions , decisions !
Is it worse to play a game in which you try to stare at a woman 's breasts without getting caught ?
Or to play a game in which the objective is " make Fluffy bloody " ?
Should second - graders be worried about their nails ?
Or should they be learning to shoot in all directions — by a toy based on a very graphic video game ?
Liza Featherstone is voting for the Little Tykes Young Explorer or the Eyelops Mini Projector , because , as she puts it :
As overwhelmingly bad as all the gender crap is , people whose minds have been hopelessly dulled by way too much screen time are not going to be able to grow up and think critically about anything — or relate to their fellow humans in a decent , helpful manner — and that 's even scarier .

BP says the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico has cost it $ 450 m ( £ 308 m ) so far , an increase of $ 100 m ( £ 68 m ) on the figure reported earlier this week .
President Obama is pushing for a law that could force the oil company to pay the full cost of the clean - up operation .
At least four million gallons have leaked from the well that was damaged in an explosion more than three weeks ago .

As the effects of the $ 787 billion stimulus package of last year begin to wear off , the Obama administration is now looking at the option of passing yet another “ limited ” stimulus package to help dig the economy “ out of a deep valley ” .
Without it they fear that the slow gains our economy has made this year could be lost .
The Financial Times explains :
The Obama administration made a strong plea to Congress on Monday to grit its teeth and pass a new set of spending measures – dubbed the “ second stimulus ” by some economists – in order to help dig the economy “ out of a deep valley ” .
The call for action , which was made by Lawrence Summers , Barack Obama ’s senior economic adviser , who urged Congress to pass up to $ 200bn in spending measures , came at the same time as Mr Obama asked Capitol Hill to grant him powers to cut “ unnecessary spending ” .
The combined announcements were made amid rising concern that centrist Democrats , or those representing marginal districts , might vote against the spending measures , which include more loans for small businesses , an extension of unemployment insurance and aid to states to prevent hundreds of thousands more teachers from being laid off .
On the heels of a $ 787 billion stimulus package , $ 200 billion does n’t sound nearly as large , but the fact is – it is money that we do n’t currently have .
A lot of people are n’t quite as sure another stimulus package is a good idea , they say it ’s throwing good money after bad .
The M3 figures – which include broad range of bank accounts and are tracked by British and European monetarists for warning signals about the direction of the US economy a year or so in advance – began shrinking last summer .
The pace has since quickened ….
It ’s frightening , ” said Professor Tim Congdon from International Monetary Research .
“ The plunge in M3 has no precedent since the Great Depression .
The dominant reason for this is that regulators across the world are pressing banks to raise capital asset ratios and to shrink their risk assets .
This is why the US is not recovering properly , ” he said .
The US authorities have an entirely different explanation for the failure of stimulus measures to gain full traction .
They are opting instead for yet further doses of Keynesian spending , despite warnings from the IMF that the gross public debt of the US will reach 97 pc of GDP next year and 110 pc by 2015 .
So there is quite a bit of debate as to whether the first stimulus actually did very much , and now we ’ve got quite a bit of debate as to whether there should be another one .
What do you think ?
Should there be another stimulus ?
Will another $ 200 billion in unemployment extensions , small business loans and aid to states make a difference ?
Should we stop the spending now in light of ballooning deficits ?
Tell us your thoughts in the comments .

Image caption Bill Attew was in complete agony
The stabbing pains in Bill Attew 's face were excruciating - so severe that at times he wished he could go to sleep and never wake up .
What had started as a ' niggly ' feeling in his cheek had rapidly worsened and led to two years of intense pain .
He had to stop working , phone calls were too painful to take and eventually even eating and drinking became too painful .
Doctors quickly diagnosed trigeminal neuralgia - caused when a blood vessel presses on a nerve , sending the wrong messages to the brain .
Increasing pain
But no treatment seemed to work and Bill , aged 58 , from Middlesex , found himself being passed from hospital to hospital .
" I had a dreadful pain in the left hand side of my face , " he said .
I was n't going to kill myself , but I thought if I do n't wake up then OK Bill Attew
" The pain was so bad that if I was driving I had to just pull over to the kerb or someone 's driveway .
" My gums hurt .
I was burning my gums , putting oil of cloves on them and drinking whiskey , but nothing helped .
" I could n't even touch my head .
Even somebody walking past and the friction would set my face off .
I could n't talk or drive .
" I was n't going to kill myself , but I thought if I do n't wake up then OK .
" One day I was in so much pain that I could n't move my eyes .
I was dribbling out of my mouth .
I could n't swallow . "
TV clue
Then a friend of Bill 's told him about an operation he had seen on TV - where a woman with a similar condition was cured .
The friend traced the clip through the internet , and Bill made contact with the Spire Hospital in Bristol .
A week after his initial consultation Bill was booked in for an operation .
As soon as he came round he noticed that the pain had vanished .
" As I came out of theatre , I thought ' he 's done it ' , " he said .
" There was no pain and I needed no painkillers . "
It is regarded as probably the worst pain imaginable Mr Nik Patel , Consultant
Consultant Mr Nik Patel said Bill 's pain had been caused by a blood vessel pressing on the trigeminal nerve .
He performed an operation to decompress the nerve - easing the pressure and lessening the pain .
" It is a quite rare , but potentially underdiagnosed condition , " said Mr Patel , a consultant neurosurgeon .
It is estimated that 1 in 15,000 people suffer from trigeminal neuralgia .
" A lot of people would visit many practitioners before the condition is labelled and because it is quite rare a lot of people may not have seen a case to be able to diagnose it .
" There is better awareness now though than in the past .
" In the majority of cases it is because a blood vessel is pressing on the trigeminal nerve - the largest of the brain nerves and it serves two functions - to transmit sensory functions from the face to the brain , specifically touch and pain .
It also supplies the muscles that help us chew . "
He said the pain was probably " the worst pain imaginable " .
" When treatments were not available or diagnosis not reached it was common for people to take their lives because living with this pain was such an ordeal . "
Relatively unknown
And he said that although the operation has been carried out for over a decade it was still not widely known , with only a handful of surgeons carrying it out .
Jillie Abbott , chairman of the Trigeminal Neuralgia Association , agreed : " Thankfully , the incidence of Trigeminal Neuralgia ( TN ) is rare but because of this the association struggles to get its message out to GPs , dentists and specialists , many of whom are shockingly ignorant about the condition and its treatments .
" We constantly give presentations and exhibit at medical conferences across the country .
" These efforts are starting to reap rewards , as we can tell from the number of people who contact us who are now being managed effectively .
" But many others who could be fast - tracked for surgery are just being prescribed higher and higher doses of drugs , and are left to suffer in pain . "
Mr Attew said his life had been completely transformed .
" I went back to see Nik Patel and told him I felt wonderful , and that 's how it has been in the nine months since . "
New Orleans , Louisiana ( CNN ) --
Federal authorities have ordered BP to get more aggressive with its plans to recover thousands of barrels of oil spewing from a broken well into the Gulf of Mexico , according to a letter made public Saturday .
In the letter , Rear Adm.
James Watson , the government 's on - scene incident manager , gave BP 48 hours to identify and expedite other ways to contain oil , given new estimates that doubled the amount of crude gushing out every day .
Researchers reported this week that up to 40,000 barrels , or 1.7 million gallons , a day may have escaped from the BP well in the 54 days since the explosion aboard the Deepwater Horizon drilling platform in April .
That would mean almost 100 million gallons have spewed since the rig exploded -- many times the amount spilled by the supertanker Exxon Valdez in Alaska 's Prince William Sound in 1989 .
Day 54 : Latest developments in oil spill
" It is clear that additional capacity is urgently needed , " Watson said in the letter Friday to Doug Suttles , BP 's chief operating officer .
" I am concerned that your current plans do not provide for maximum mobilization of resources to provide the needed collection capacity consistent with revised flow rates , " Watson said .
" I am also concerned that your plan does not go far enough to mobilize redundant resources in the event of an equipment failure with one of the vessels or some other unforeseen problem . "
BP has captured some of the gushing oil through a containment cap that has been pumping the crude up to a drilling ship for about a week .
It collected 15,500 barrels , or 651,000 gallons , on Friday and has been able to remove a total of 104,300 barrels , or about 4.4 million gallons , from Gulf waters so far .
i Report : Share your views on the oil disaster
BP spokesman Mark Proegler said company officials are in the process of reviewing Watson 's letter .
" We will be responding directly to him regarding containment plans and will work directly with the Coast Guard to keep the public informed of any changes to the process , " Proegler said in a statement .
Suttles , who was in Houma , Louisiana , on Saturday meeting with BP workers and Coast Guard officials , said Watson can expect a response Sunday .
" We 're looking at everything we have in place and we 're looking to see if there 's anything more we can do , and we will respond by tomorrow night , " he said .
The government asked BP to lay out plans for additional and contingency recovery methods in a letter sent Tuesday .
BP responded Wednesday by describing a three - element plan that included the current container cap , a choke line to pump additional oil to the surface and a kill line intended to capture oil left in excess after the first two methods .
The kill line , said Suttles in a letter to Watson , would not be operational until mid-July , a date that was unacceptable to the government .
" You indicate that some of the systems you have planned to deploy may take a month or more to bring online , " Watson said .
" Recognizing the complexity of this challenge , every effort must be expended to speed up the process . "
BP 's orders to step up came as oil kept gushing and frustration kept flaring .
President Obama , who intends to return to the Gulf next week , discussed the oil disaster Saturday with British Prime Minister David Cameron , according to a statement from the prime minister 's office .
A diplomatic spat of sorts had erupted over perceptions that Obama was attacking Britain with his tough words for BP .
Obama sought to ease the tension by stressing the importance of U.S. trade ties across the Atlantic .
In his telephone conversation with Cameron , Obama said " frustrations about the oil spill had nothing to do with national identity , " according to a statement from Downing Street .
Cameron had spoken Friday with BP Chairman Carl - Henric Svanberg , making it clear that the oil giant 's financial health and stability were in Britain 's best interests .
Svanberg , who is to meet Wednesday with Obama at the White House , " made clear that BP will continue to do all that it can to stop the oil spill , clean up the damage and meet all legitimate claims for compensation , " a Downing Street spokesman said in a news release .
Meanwhile , environmentalists said demonstrations were unfolding Saturday in more than 50 cities across five continents -- from Pensacola , Florida , to Christchurch , New Zealand .
" Let the world know YOU care , " said a flier on the group 's Facebook page , which translated BP 's initials to mean British Predator .
" We need to let BP know that we are NOT okay with what they are putting in OUR oceans . "
About a dozen protesters gathered under a BP gas station sign in Atlanta , Georgia , picketing and cheering as motorists who drove by honked .
" I do n't ever intend to use BP again , " said Atlanta resident Monica Manuel who held up a cardboard sign , " Boycott big polluters . "
Another protester , Ruth Resnicow , said it was devastating to see the wildlife on the Gulf Coast being affected by the worst oil disaster in U.S. history .
" The oiled pelican has been a logo of the disaster .
People need to see change . "
But gas station and convenience store owners said protesters are targeting the wrong people .
" The hardest part is on the employees because they are seeing the protests .
...
They are concerned about their jobs and families , " said Russell Scaramella , who owns 22 BP stations in the Atlanta area .
Jeff Lenard , a spokesman for the National Association of Convenience Stores , said Saturday 's protests were likely to be counterproductive .
" So whether you are protesting by marching , or by not buying gas , you are hurting the small business , " he said , " but you are really not hurting BP . "

Introduction
It was only a few years ago when we would look at a 650W power supply , and knew that it had more than enough jam to power , even the most power hungry rig around .
Fast forward to present day and we look at what is available on the market , and we see CPU ’s with four cores being the norm and an emerging tech sporting six cores , which we know will also become the common place technology in a short period of time .
We also see a trend in video cards getting much bigger and more power hungry than ever before .
Even with companies touting the " green " banner around the field the trend for more power remains as strong as ever .
This leaves the arduous task of making power supplies that are up to the task , of keeping our rigs running smooth and sufficiently powered , to companies like Cooler Master .
Back in April we had the opportunity to look at the Cooler Master Silent Pro M 1Kw 80 +
Bronze certified unit , which yielded very good results and proved to be a very good power supply .
Today we have the pleasure of looking at the Silent Pro GOLD series in the flavour of a 1200W unit .
If the title GOLD has n’t given it away as of yet , all of the GOLD series of power supplies have a 80 +
Gold certification , so let ’s dive into this unit and see what it has to offer .
Thanks go to Cooler Master for supplying the review sample .
Cooler Master was founded with the mission of providing the industry ’s best thermal solutions .
Since its establishment a decade ago , the company has remained faithful to this mission , emerging as a world leader in products and services for companies dealing with devices where heat issues must be resolved .
The cornerstones of Cooler Master ’s philosophy are innovation , speed , and customer satisfaction , ensuring Cooler Master is the supplier that the companies rely on to deliver the best thermal solutions , creating a win-win situation both for Cooler Master its customers .
Moreover , on May 11 , Tisch and Steiner announced that in anticipation of the June 1 deadline for the second round of Race applications they had gotten the unions to agree to a four - tiered evaluation system for teachers — “ highly effective , ” “ effective , ” “ developing ” and “ ineffective ” — that would replace the old satisfactory - unsatisfactory regime .
In part the evaluations would be tied to state standardized test scores , though they would count for only 20 to 25 percent of an evaluation .
This would seem to make it easier to remove ineffective teachers , because the agreement calls for a teacher ’s removal if judged ineffective two years in a row , and , as such , it ’s a reform that would have been unimaginable four months ago when the first - round application was filed — or even two months ago , when Mulgrew and I had breakfast .
But it still does not allow for these evaluations to be linked to teacher compensation , and the small print allows for a drawn - out collective - bargaining process over what the other 75 to 80 percent of the evaluation criteria would be — before which the evaluations could apparently not begin .
Nonetheless , it will make New York ’s second - round application stronger .
One reason New York may have gone even as far as it did in the first round could be that good intentions can’t guarantee perfect execution in a federal bureaucracy .
Joanne Weiss , who runs the Race program for Secretary Duncan , began last summer to recruit experts , called “ peer reviewers , ” to score the applications in a way that would inoculate the decisions from charges of political favoritism .
Five vetters were assigned to each application , and the score was the average of their individual scores .
Duncan would reserve the right to override the point scores , but if he did , he would have to explain himself because the scores would be released publicly .
( He told me that he does n’t plan to override the vetters . )
Department of Education regulations required that the scorers not only have no financial interest in the outcome of their decisions , but not even an appearance of a conflict , both in terms of money and potential bias .
This pretty much eliminated people involved in operating school systems or those who are active in Schnur ’s reform network , yielding vetters who were academics , education foundation staff members ( but not at places like the Gates Foundation that finance reform projects ) and long - retired educators .
“ When I found out that the reviewers would be people who are not directly involved in K - through - 12 education , I got concerned , ” recalled Paul Pastorek , the Louisiana schools superintendent who is widely admired in reform circles .
Pastorek ’s application included impressive details of what Louisiana had already achieved in creating data systems , described the state ’s overhauling of New Orleans schools following Hurricane Katrina and presented a comprehensive plan for more progress .
Pastorek and I had this conversation about the scorers about three weeks before he found out that his state came in 11th .
According to the tallies , he ’d have come in much higher but for the rating he received from one scorer , who gave Louisiana a surprising 349 , which was lower than New York ’s average score .
However the mechanics of the process might be improved in the second round , some of the reformers were also concerned , as three of them told me , all using the same phrase , that Duncan ’s language was “ too collaborative . ”
What they meant was that by emphasizing how the unions had bought into the plans of the two first - round winners , Delaware and Tennessee , he was suggesting that the unions could block a state from winning by not signing on .
When I talked to him in April , Duncan denied wanting to send that signal , noting that Georgia and Florida , with no union sign - offs but far - reaching plans , finished third and fourth in the first round .
And he nodded when I speculated that Florida ’s chances seemed even better for the second round because a new law — passed by both houses of the Legislature after the first round ended — would force accountability on all teachers without the union ’s agreement .
“ What we want are the plans that touch the most children , ” Duncan said .
“ Ideally we want the adults working together , but at the end of the day , this is about doing reform . ”
After we spoke — in another sign not only of the turmoil caused by the Race but also of the union ’s continued power — Florida ’s governor , Charlie Crist , who is in a hotly contested Senate race , vetoed the teacher - accountability bill .
He said he did so because “ the people spoke , and they spoke loudly . ”
Those on the other side pointed to a ferocious lobbying campaign by the state teachers ’ union that generated more than 100,000 e-mail messages and phone calls to Crist ’s office .
As the Florida fight suggests , this is not a battle that is going to end soon .
In fact , even as the battle lines have now been drawn in communities and state capitals across the country , the fight is about to come back to Washington , where turning a grant program into a contest started it all .
President Obama was so pleased with the reaction to the Race that he recently proposed a new $ 1.3 billion contest after the first two rounds are completed , this time directed at individual school districts instead of states .
More significant , Duncan has said that some of the billions in more traditional annual federal aid that has flowed to states according to population formulas should now be based on Racelike competitions aimed at various pieces of the reform agenda .
“ This is the chance of a lifetime , ” Duncan says .
“ We have to move the country in a fundamental , dramatic way . ”
Hershey Bears , Texas Stars To Battle For Calder Cup

American Hockey League Stories from June 1 , 2010
The opinions expressed in this release are those of the organization issuing it , and do not necessarily reflect the thoughts or opinions of OurSports Central or its staff .
One year ago we talked to Dan Marr the Atlanta Thrashers Director of Amateur Scouting and Player Development about the state of the Thrashers system ( Part 1 here , Part 2 here ) .
When I spoke to him , Marr had just completed the NHL Combine and mentioned that the Thrashers were still looking at a few players at various camps .
BWA : It would be great if we could run through the guys in the system like we did last spring at the Under - 18 and you were kind enough to give us an update on where the prospects stood .
Sometimes it can be hard to follow these guys from Atlanta because we are far away from the developmental leagues .
But first of all , let 's talk about the team 's first round pick last year Evander Kane .
I know you were very excited about acquiring him on draft day .
DM : He met any personal expectations that I had for him .
He 's a guy with high standards and he lived up to his standards .
The best is yet to come .
He was n't put into a lot of pressure filled situations , such as high end power play time .
He was used in certain situations such as when the team needed a goal or at the end of the game and he would usually deliver a hit or create a scoring chance .
I could see that they had some confidence in him and the older guys on the team had confidence in him .
I would check with our staff every once in a while and they said he was holding his own and they were impressed with him .
I think Evander has impressed everybody and I fully expect him to be a franchise player for the Thrashers going forward .
BWA : Let 's talk about the two second round picks from last year .
You were fortunate to have two picks and you took too very good players .
Jeremy Morin racked up quite a few points in the OHL .
I know skating was a developmental concern , how is he doing and what are your thoughts on his season .
DM : Well obviously he had a phenomenal year .
We know he 's a scorer and he went out and he did what he does best .
But the things that we were really liked hearing from Kitchener was that they found him to be a very high character player , he was a leader on that team and a hard worker .
Now it can be the case that if you 're not the best skater you can compensate somehow with your work ethic , then it 's not really a liability .
I would n't go so far as to say that his skating is a liability and he has made some improvement .
He has been working on it and right now he 's off at a skating camp on his own dime trying to improve himself .
If he puts in a terrific summer , I would n't surprised at anything that happens come [ NHL ] Training Camp time .
Usually you do n't expect young guys to come in and crack the lineup , but if he puts in the type of summer that he is capable of he could make some people pause and consider him [ for the NHL roster ] .
Carl Klingberg -- he 's a European player who plays a North American style .
He 's one of those guys who just does n't like to take ' no ' for an answer on a play .
So he makes things happen .
He provides energy for the team and he has a decent touch with the puck .
He is someone who will crash and bang and when he gets the puck he knows what to do with it .
He 's a talented athlete and a decent hockey player in his own right .
He 's one of those guys who adds value to a team and coaches find ways to use him .
BWA : Klingberg has just signed with the Thrashers and I understand his contract will have him go back to Sweden if he does n't make the Thrashers .
He is just 19 , do you think he physically mature enough to handle the NHL ?
DM : Yes he is .
Physically he can handle the load .
He 's a mature kid .
It always comes down to whether you think if a kid gets a job what will his contribution level be [ in the NHL ] ?
The NHL just signed a transfer agreement with Sweden , so their kids have the same rules as juniors -- you 're either in the NHL or returned to your club that you were drafted from .
BWA : Next I 'd like to get your take on some players the Thrashers acquired through trades .
Patrice Cormier came in the Kovalchuk deal and was under suspension .
He has n't played much since Atlanta added him .
What are your thoughts on him as a potential NHLer ?
DM : You love to have the guy as a teammate because he plays with his emotions on his sleeve .
He 's a leader in his own right , he 's got to get past that unfortunate incident from last year and move on in his hockey career .
We see a big rugged player who brings intangibles .
He is a hard guy to play against and a hard guy to check , but in his own right he has enough of a skill level that if you put him out there with two skilled players he 's going contribute quite a bit to a line and to your hockey club .
BWA : He was named Captain of Team Canada at World Juniors , that 's certainly a statement about how coaches view his leadership abilities .
DM : He 's a guy that leads both on and off the ice .
With his conditioning and on the ice .
He plays with a passion and he brings some grittiness .
You 've talking about Milan Lucic - type of players -- a young guy who brings that passion to your hockey team and it can be infectious -- that energy and that attitude rub off on everyone else and each player picks their game up half - a- step .
BWA : How about Vishnevskiy ?
I know he has been in the AHL lately and perhaps you have n't seen him in a while .
He put up nearly a point per game as a defenseman in the Quebec League when he was drafted
DM : I have n't seen him play in the American Hockey League , but I remember him .
He needed to get stronger , the physical game is not his strength .
He 's a really stronger skater , very fluid and he can move the puck quickly .
He has a good shot .
BWA : Let 's talk about the goalie prospects .
Chris Carrozzi was picked for Goalie of the Year in the OHL and Ed Pasquale put up another strong Save Percentage while facing many shots .
DM : We knew Chris was a very technically sound goalie -- much like Moose -- and we wanted to work on a couple of things such as his lateral movement and crease movement in terms of being more reflexive and less mechanical .
He made BIG , BIG strides in that area .
He 's a kid who plays big in the net and he 's learned how to use his size .
He had a real good year and going forward we think we have a guy who has a chance to play [ in the NHL ] .
Eddie is more of reflex athletic goalie -- it is good to have both types of prospects in your organization -- he had mono which he had at our camp and delayed him at the start of the season .
He never really got back to 100 % until after Christmas and then he took off and finished the year phenomenally strong .
He 's got that quickness and he also uses his size well .

MUMBAI ( Reuters ) - Mahindra & Mahindra MAHM .BO , India 's top utility vehicle and tractor maker , on Saturday said it had submitted a letter of intent to make a bid for troubled Korean SUV maker Ssangyong Motor , but declined to comment on how much it was willing to pay .
Seven foreign and South Korean companies have submitted letters of intent for Ssangyong 003620 .
KS , 10 percent owned by China 's SAIC Motor Corp 600104.SS , Ssangyong said on Friday .
“ We have submitted an expression of interest for Ssangyong .
If we are one of the companies shortlisted , then we will undertake a due diligence , ” Pawan Goenka , president of Mahindra ’s automotive sector told reporters .
“ We have to look at the economic viability of the company and how it fits into our strategy before we make a bid , ” Goenka said .
When asked to put a value to the deal , he said Mahindra had just expressed an intent to make a bid for Ssangyong .
“ Just because we have expressed an interest does not mean we will finally make a bid , ” Goenka said .
“ We will do it only if it makes economic sense , ” said Bharat Doshi , Mahindra ’s group chief financial officer .
Goenka said Mahindra would have to examine the reasons why Ssangyong sales have fallen and “ whether they can be fixed . ”
“ We have an expertise in utility vehicles and that should help us in this , ” Goenka said .
South Korean media put the deal at $ 300 million - $ 500 million , but analysts said Mahindra was more likely to bid in the range of $ 100 million to $ 300 million to recapitalize Ssangyong , which was forced to undergo a capital writedown last year .
ACQUIRING SPREE
Mahindra has been on an acquisition spree lately as it seeks to expand its portfolio .
In April , it said it was buying out Renault ’s stake in a joint venture making Logan sedans in India , its first entry into the passenger car segment .
Earlier this week , it bought a majority stake in the maker of electrical cars Reva Electric Car Company for an undisclosed sum , giving it a foothold in the small but growing electric vehicles industry which is attracting global majors such as General Motors GM.UL and Toyota 7203.T .
Mahindra reported a 36.4 percent rise in net profit for March quarter to 5.7 billion rupees ( $ 123 million ) , beating market forecasts of 4.7 billion rupees , on robust sales of utility vehicles and tractors .
Net sales rose to 52.8 billion rupees , a jump of 45.9 percent over the corresponding quarter in the previous year .
Rise in raw material prices and expected increase in interest rates would be the challenges for the company in the current financial year , Goenka said .
“ Raw material prices are almost as high as they were in August 2008 .
The first six months ... we expect that they will go up and then come down in the second half , ” Goenka said .
For the next three years , the company will be spending 45 billion rupees , of which 75 percent will be for the automotive sector .
The company is also all set to launch a pick - up truck in the U.S. toward the end of this year , after getting regulatory approvals expected in July .
Shares in Mahindra , valued at nearly $ 7 billion , have risen less than 1 percent so far this year , compared to the main index .
BSESN which has fallen 3.4 percent .

Turn the dough out onto a floured surface .
Divide it into 6 or 7 equal pieces , and arrange them in a row on the surface .
Keeping the other portions covered with a kitchen towel so they wo n’t dry out , roll each piece into a ball .
Leave them , covered , on the surface for another 10 minutes to relax the gluten .
Then , using a rolling pin , flatten the balls into rounds that are 3 ½ to 4 inches in diameter .
Place the buns on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper , put the baking sheet inside a large plastic bag , and tie the open end closed .
Place the pan in a warm area of the kitchen and let the buns rise until they have doubled in size , 30 to 45 minutes .
With the profusion of information available on the Web , search engines have become a key mediator by directing people to the information they 're interested in .
But that has also turned the search engines into gatekeepers ; both by ranking the results and by offering suggested search terms , the sites can subtly ( and , in some cases , not so subtly ) influence the sorts of information that a significant fraction of the public will encounter .
A new survey of Google search terms looks into how this is playing out when it comes to information on nanotechnology .
The researchers found that both suggested queries and search results may be pushing that field down a path that is similar to the one that was traveled by genetically modified foods , where an initial focus on technology and applications has been replaced by worries about health and ethical issues .
Nanotechnology is a sprawling field that is based on a simple observation : the properties of many familiar materials are completely different when they are structured at the nanometer scale .
So , for example , differences between bulk gold and gold nanoparticles include color , melting point , and electronic properties .
Our ability to control the bulk production of nanostructured materials is a relatively recent development , and it holds both promises and risks .
On the promising side , the distinct properties are being used in areas like industrial catalysis , harvesting solar energy , and targeting medical interventions at the cellular levels .
At the same time , the fact that even familiar materials have unusual properties at the nanoscale raises the risk that a nanotech version of a substance we view as innocuous may pose health risks .
How is this balance of potential and risk playing out in the world of Google ?
The authors claim to detect a shift away from basic interest in the technology and its use , and towards health issues .
The authors surveyed search results and suggestions in both October 2008 and August of 2009 .
At the earlier time point , there are three terms related to economics in the top - 10 list : stocks , jobs , and companies .
Three neutral terms ( research , future , and applications ) , also cracked the top 10 , while " nanotechnology medicine " was in 10th place .
Less than a year later , things were radically different .
Medicine had moved up to sixth place , and cancer cracked the top 10 .
" Nanotechnology companies " was the only economic term still on the list .
Search suggestions provided by Google would seem likely to reinforce this trend .
" Nanotechnology in medicine " was apparently the top suggestion from Google , even though it was n't the most frequently searched term .
" This difference between Google suggestions and the top searched keywords is not trivial , " the authors argue , " given that the ranking of Google suggested terms is likely to influence citizens ' searches related to nanotechnology . "
The authors also performed a detailed analysis of the links returned by Google , along with the links present in those pages , placing them in one of 10 possible categories .
Overall , there was a strong bias towards health - related material in the Google results , and one that appears to have increased over the course of the time period in question .
Some of this health material was presented even when the initial search terms had nothing to do with health .
The authors suggest that we 've seen this pattern before .
Their own research into the portrayal of plant biotechnology indicated that news coverage started off focused on the technology itself and the business opportunities it presented .
By the late 1990s , however , the focus had shifted entirely to health concerns and ethical debates , where it largely remains today .
There are a few limitations of this analysis , most notably its attempt to extract a trend out of a year 's worth of data .
There 's also a notable absence of detail when it comes to precisely what 's being said about nanotechnology and human health .
In contrast to plant biotechnology , many of the proposed applications of nanotechnology have very direct and obvious applications to medical therapies , where preliminary studies of nanoparticles have already demonstrated their ability to mediate targeted killing of cancer cells .
So , the focus on health may be at least partly a product of these relevant applications .
The other notable thing is that a shift away from basic science and towards health is occurring throughout the media landscape .
CNN eliminated its science staff , but retains health coverage ;
The New York Times merged its science section in with health coverage several years ago .
Google may not be driving the trend here so much as reflecting it .
The prospect that Google could be in the driver 's seat when it comes to the public perception of science , however , should n't be completely discounted .
In a small experiment of my own , I checked the suggested searches that appeared in response to " climate . "
The only results for specific sites devoted to climate change that appeared all directed me to sites that promote views contrary to those held by most scientists .
The top offering was for " climategate , " which is generally viewed as an event that gave the scientific community a black eye .
Anyone who relies on Google 's suggestions for their reading list is unlikely to come away with a good sense of the current science .

The fourth incarnation of Apple 's iPhone is an incrementally improved , familiar device — not a new kind of device , as was the case with the recent introduction of iPad .
Yes , the notable features with iPhone 4 — both the device and the iOS4 , which came out yesterday in advance of the iPhone itself — are mostly tweaks .
But what tweaks they are : Apple 's focus on improvement is as much key to the quality of its products as innovation .
Still , there 's one flaw it can't completely eliminate : the unreliable quality of calls placed over AT&T , which remains the iPhone 's only U.S. carrier .
THE FORM FACTOR
Thanks to a boy and a bar and a blog , we 've already known for some time what the iPhone 4 would look like .
The squared - off , thinner , steel - and glass form is more masculine , more substantial .
Like a really hot designer watch .
There are bevels and grooves and linear details that did n't exist before .
It feels really nice to hold .
Once my hand got used to it , the 3GS body felt more like a toy , and I did n't much feel like holding it anymore .
The display is a huge leap forward .
It 's really crisp , and hues are more true .
Side by side , the 3GS display and the iPhone 4 display show that the earlier device gives off warmer hues , more peach / red / yellow casts .
The iPhone 4 seems more true to life .
This is particularly noticeable when you are reading large stretches of text , or comparing one photo on both devices , side by side .
On iPhone 4 , whites are whiter , blacks are blacker , and the fonts really pop .
It makes long reading sessions much more comfortable , and reading things in low light and high light environments are easier than before .
The iPhone 4 face and back side are made from " aluminosilcate glass , " which Apple says has been " chemically strengthened to be 30 times harder than plastic . "
Fighting instinct ( my … precious ! ) I banged it on the side of metal tables , attempted to scuff it on the floor , and it did not sustain scratches as my iPhone 3GS and first - edition iPhone have .
Granted , I did n't take a hammer or keys to it , and I do n't know " Will It Blend " — I felt too protective — but this is clearly a much sturdier face .
This also explains why Apple is only selling those little " bumpers " now , to snap around the edges , instead of older style cases that also protect the face and back of the device .
The metal volume and mute / vibrate buttons feel nice ( and are echoed in metal details on those little snap - on bumpers . )
BATTERY LIFE
Battery life has been an Achilles ' heel with earlier versions of this device .
It 's noticeably improved , and that 's a good thing , because much of what this device can do will require more power , over more time .
You 're gonna want more battery .
With light use , but with 3G data and WiFi turned on the whole time , I got a full 4 days of battery life .
With very heavy video recording and playback , instant messaging , email and data tethering over 3G , I got a full day of battery life .
I did n't have enough time before this review to do careful benchmark testing against Apple 's claims , so I can't provide specific percentages , but it felt like the battery life was a good 20 - 25 % meatier .

Apple promises up to 7 hours of talk time on 3G and 14 hours of talk time on 2G , Standby time of up to 300 hours , up to 10 hours of solid use on Wi -Fi , up to 10 hours of video playback , and 40 hours of audio playback .
Compare that with the stats promised for Apple 's iPhone 3GS : up to 5 hours talk time on 3G , up to 12 on 2G .
Up to 5 hours of internet use on 3G , up to 9 hours on Wi-Fi .
Up to 10 hours of video playback , and 30 hours of audio playback .
THE PHONE STUFF
Gadget bloggers and tech reviewers have made much over the built - in antenna placement , and speculation that the body construction allows for greater signal conductivity .
I rode my bike around town with iPhone 4 , iPhone 3GS , and the original iPhone , and observed signal strength differences .
Here 's the thing :
AT&T still sucks , and the best engineering out of Cupertino wo n't change that .
AT&T 's network includes black holes and Bermuda Triangles in many places around my town , Los Angeles .
Even where signal strength was terrific , dropped or garbly calls did still occur sometimes with this new iPhone .
But a little less often .
Overall performance and reception capabilities with iPhone 4 did seem improved , during my limited tests .
The connectivity improvements engineered into this device seem to help you make the best of a very imperfect carrier ( and , of course , none of them are perfect ) .
Standing in one familiar trouble spot that used to drive me crazy , I often had one or two " signal strength " bars on the first - gen iPhone , maybe one or two more bars on the 3GS , and 4 or 5 bars on iPhone 4 .
Bottom line : I think the engineering is better .
But issues of call quality and dropped calls will not be completely gone with this improved device .
As we 're now four hardware iterations in , I believe that has everything , or nearly everything , to do with the carrier .
IS IT SPEEDY ?
Quite .
Unlike prior editions , this one uses Apple 's A4 processor , which is also present in Apple 's iPad .
Huge difference in responsiveness , when comparing identical tasks between iPhone 4 and the 3GS or other prior editions .
FACETIME
Video calls are cool .
Yes , video calls with Skype and video chat with AIM , iChat , and Google are a well - established part of our internet experience .
But FaceTime will open up " video phone calls " to many more users .
Here 's how it works : using the phone feature , initiate a phone call to someone else who is also using an iPhone 4 . A " FaceTime " option will be present for both users , on both ends , and if both opt to initiate FaceTime , you 'll be viewing video from each other as you talk .
i Phone 4 offers the ability to switch the orientation of the camera input , from one side to another , so if you and I are talking I can show you my face , looking into the device right back at you on the other end of the FaceTime call , or I can tap the " switch camera orientation " icon on my screen to show you the sunset on the beach where I 'm standing .
Well , as long as there 's WiFi on the beach : currently , AT&T wo n't allow FaceTime over 3G .
Apple says it will open the Facetime API to developers , which should make for some interesting interfaces between iPhone and social networking or chat services .
The iPhone 4's camera offers much more detailed shots than before , and performs better in poor lighting conditions .
CAMERA
( Click to view more photos shot with iPhone 4 in this Boing Boing gallery )
Reviews of iOS4 have noted that installing the upgrade on 3G iPhones zooms up shutter speed significantly .
This is true .
And on the iPhone 4 hardware itself , speed and sensitivity with iOS4 on the iPhone 4 itself become nothing short of stunning .
I experienced far fewer " lost moments , " those dead shots that happen when you 've tried to grab just the right instant , and instead you end up with a photo of several instants after the right instant .
I brought my iPhone 3GS and iPhone 4 to the Venice Beach skate park , to take shots of fast - moving skaters in those magical aerial moments , just before a swan - dive into the belly of the bowl .
With earlier iPhones , man , just forget it .
You 're using the wrong device .
Response is too sluggish for good odds on getting good action shots .
But with iPhone 4 , I was able to tap - tap - tap in rapid succession , or tap once at just the right instant , and bring home some real trophy jpegs .
Another strong point of the new version of iPhone 's camera is the ability to make better sense of high , low , and medium light within one shot .
When you touch on an area of the camera 's view to focus , the iPhone automatically senses factors such as exposure , and auto - adjusts for you based on the selected focal point .
There was a tendency on iPhone 3GS and earlier to get overly dark , or overly blown - out shots when an image incorporates bright whites and dark darks .
i Phone 4 is smarter in this regard .
i Phone 's built - in flash is a welcome addition , and will no doubt lead to a proliferation of attractive , boozed - up people in better - lit nightclub snapshots on Facebook ( and a new generation of wannabe Cobrasnakes ) .
Three options with the flash : on , auto - flash , or off .
We 're still talking about a tiny flash on an iPhone , so it does n't perform like a pro flash on a $ 2500 SLR camera ( you 're only going to be able to illuminate so far ) , but it 's quite a start .
I was able to get intelligible shots of a completely dark room , where without the flash , I 'd get nothing but black .
One thing I have n't tried yet , which I do with my point - and - shoot digital cameras : making DIY " gels " for the flash .
Scotch tape , maybe embellished with highlighter pen ink for rose , yellow , or other human - friendly gel colors .

VIDEO
( Click here to watch sample video clips shot with iPhone 4 )
I 'm very , very excited about the video capabilities in iPhone 4 .
I 've spent the last few years of my life working in web video , so forgive me if I " squee " here .
The higher definition video [ 720p ] is spectacular , and far better in quality than what was possible with iPhone 3GS ( or , as far as I 've seen , with any smartphone ) .
You have to be mindful of that camera orientation switch option noted above with FaceTime : when you shoot video out of one side of the device , you get lower - resolution 640 x 480 footage , and when you shoot out of the other side , you get far higher - res 1280 x 720 .
As with the still camera function , you can tap an area to focus in , even while you are shooting .
Video is saved and exported as h.264 QuickTime , and you can email , MMS , or publish to YouTube right from the iPhone .
LOCATION TAGGING FOR PHOTOS AND VIDEOS
The ability to browse what 's in your photo and video library by the location where you shot those items is new , and really fun .
I took a bike ride from my office to the beach , and from there down a long bike path along the coast to another town .
I shot photos and videos along the way .
When I arrived back at the office , I was able to view those clusters of media on a map , and tap the red " pushpin " to view everything I 'd shot at the skate park , everything I 'd shot at the pier , and so on .
IMOVIE
The iPhone 4 ships is released alongside a mobile version of iMovie ( $ 5 ) , so you can edit clips into iMovie projects with transitions , music beds , stylized or simple transitions , and templated themes ( " travel postcard , " for instance ) .
Export your final product at medium ( 360 p ) , large ( 540 p ) , or HD ( 720 p ) .
Video snobs may pooh - pooh the notion of editing on a mobile device ( which requires a vastly more simplified and less powerful editing toolkit than one has with FinalCut Studio on an 8 - core Mac Pro ) , but hey , a few years ago these same people were also pooh - poohing the notion of shooting video on a mobile device .
What this means to me : if I 'm traveling , I can shoot , edit , and produce little reports or impressionistic video vignettes from the field without having to have even a laptop .
That is a very big deal for some people ( fine , by " some people , " I really mean , " me " ) .
And for non-videobloggers , it means you 'll now be getting lots more annoying ( but visually good quality ) home movies of your relatives '
Hawaiian vacations in your in - box .
When you 're video editing on the iPhone 4 , there 's a theme sound library to work with , and you can even add songs from your iTunes / iPod library as music beds ( ahem cough awesome but surprising , given the possible copyright conflicts ahem cough ) .
ORIENTATION LOCK
Thank you Jesus .
At last .
Orientation lock on the iPhone , like we have on the iPad .
If you 're reading Boing Boing in bed , just double - press the " home " button , then swipe that menu bar all the way to the left , and you can lock the display in portrait mode so it does n't switch direction on you when you roll over or sit up or whatever .
I wish you could also lock it in landscape mode .
This would be especially handy for videos or gaming while you 're passed out drunk in the gutter or relaxing on your couch at home .
IBOOKS
Apple 's iBooks — the store , storage , and digital book reading application — works pretty much here like it does on iPad .
There are some additional new abilities , like the ability to highlight and add notes .
Given what my own personal reading and device usage habits are , I do n't know that I 'll personally be spending a ton of time reading iBooks on iPhone , but I suspect that others will be awfully excited about the ability to read one book on iPad , laptop or desktop Mac , and iPhone , and start where you left off at any given device .
MULTITASKING
As noted in early iOS4 reviews , multitasking is here , and feels long overdue .
There are limits .
You can't multitask everything with everything , but the ability to check email and Twitter while I 'm on a conference call , or play music while I 'm reading a blog , seems natural now ( and did n't result in crashiness ) .
Double - click the home button to swap between open apps .
Holding down the home button for a few moments gets you voice control , as with earlier versions .
Touching the home button once , briefly , lets you search iPhone .
TETHERING
It worked flawlessly over Bluetooth , using AT&T's 3G , when the cable modem and wireless network in my office happened to be down for a while .
What more do you want ?
It worked when I wanted it to work .
THE GYROSCOPE
I did n't have an opportunity to make use of the additional motion sensitivity that iPhone 4 offers over its predecessor , with the built - in gyroscope .
So I can't say much about it , other than the fact it 's there .
But I 'm sure that as the iPhone 4 makes its way out into the wild , developers of augmented reality applications and games will produce products that use this ability to enrich a variety of experiences .
To me , those augmented reality possibilities are particularly exciting .
Would I buy it ?
Yes .
Apple : iPhone 4
The other shoe has fallen – China announced today that its currency would be priced based on a basket of currencies rather than exclusively on the US dollar .
The net result is that Chinese goods should become more expensive .
But this broader pegging announcement has been heard before and the Chinese manage to wriggle free of currency appreciation [ temporary measure or only certain industries or the basket of currencies mime the US Dollar themselves ] .
Just before the announced gradual revaluation , China had already seen substantial wage increases due to labor agitation [ 33 % now 70 % more in Fall for many electronics worker ] and 20 - 30 % again in the auto sector [ Toyota and Honda so far ] .
Bottom line is that in key sectors like technology and autos plus other businesses using China as a key supplier will see continuing cost pressures .
Given the competitive environ for both industries [ technology sees invasion of new players in markets Apple and Google have pioneered while all automakers are scrambling for a declining total new car market ] expect earnings in both sectors to see downward pressure .
Retailers that are also tied into low Chinese import prices will also be pressed to the extent they cannot pass on Chinese price increases to their consumers .
In sum , expect major downward adjustments to associated stocks .
Update : Japanese Nikkei business paper sees similar pressures :
A recent editorial in the Nikkei business daily highlighted the issue , noting that demands by Chinese workers for higher wages marked a “ sea change ” in China ’s low - cost production model .
“ The situation poses a major strategic challenge to all manufacturers that have set up production in the country to capitalize on its low labor costs , ”
Update 2 : July 5th , 2010 : A NYTimes article examines how rising labor costs in China and the projected rise in the Chinese currency will effect Apple and other large technical producers like Dell , HP , and others .
Though labor costs are small in the assembling of final products , about 7 % , many of the parts and chips used in Apple iPhones and others products are also Made in China and subject to rising labor costs too .
Bottomline , Made in China means rising costs .

An American who claims to have been on a mission to hunt down Osama bin Laden has been arrested in northern Pakistan armed with a pistol , dagger and a sword , police said .
The 50 - year - old man from California was detained in the mountains of Chitral district near the border with Afghanistan 's Nuristan province , a known stronghold of the Taliban , police officer Mumtaz Ahmad Khan said .
Police identified the suspect as Gary Brooks Faulkner .
Police said he arrived as a tourist , checked into a local hotel and was given the customary security escort for his own safety before he disappeared on Sunday night .
" Our security guard noticed that Gary had disappeared .
A search operation was launched and we found him 14 kilometres short of the Pakistan - Afghan border .
He was trying to enter Nuristan , " said Mr Khan .
" He said 9/11 caused colossal losses to the US , therefore he wanted to locate Osama bin Laden and his friends .
We presume he came here with an intention to kill them . "
The daily Dawn newspaper said Faulkner acknowledged to police that he wanted to " decapitate Osama bin Laden " .
Mr Khan described the suspect as suffering kidney problems and high blood pressure but of sound mind .
The US consulate in Peshawar was notified on Tuesday that an American citizen had been arrested .
" We are now working on getting consular access and meeting with the American citizen , " a spokesman for the US embassy in Islamabad said .
Saudi - born terrorism mastermind bin Laden , now in his 50s and rumoured to be in poor health , is the world 's most - wanted man with a multi-million dollar bounty on his head .

The Hamas movement is ready to recognize agreements signed with Israel , and in fact recognize Israel , but only within the ' 67 borders , senior Hamas member Khaled Suleiman said Wednesday .
According to Suleiman , the movement will be ready to accept a Palestinian state inside the ' 67 borders and will not operate to thwart diplomatic negotiations held by Palestinian Authority Chairman Mahmoud Abbas .
In a Ramallah conference , the Hamas faction spokesman in the Palestinian Legislative Council said that " the Palestinian government is unauthorized according to the Palestinian constitution to negotiate with Israel , but does not oppose a possibility that Abbas will do so . "
" All the government can do is reach a calm , and we , Hamas , are committed to a calm up to this moment , " he added .
Suleiman noted , however , that his government will not arrest any Palestinian gunmen under any condition .
He added that this was unacceptable as long as Israel continues its targeted killings and enters Palestinian towns and communities .
Referring to the international Quartet 's demands of the Hamas - led government to recognize agreements signed by the PA with Israel , Suleiman said that " these agreements are a reality which we view as such , and therefore I see no problem . "
In spite of these remarks , Suleiman was skeptical regarding the chances to reach a solution for the Israeli - Palestinian conflict through negotiations .
" The problem is not the Hamas victory , but rather the dead end the negotiations reached since Camp David and the Israeli claim regarding the absence of a Palestinian partner .
We see Israel is only interested in a Palestinian partner who will be ready to accept its policy of unilateral moves , " he said .
Mashaal : Send us arms , fighters , money
Dr. Saeb Erekat , the PLO 's chief negotiator with Israel , also took part in the conference and demanded that the government clearly declare its commitment to the to agreements signed by the PA .
" The government is the Palestinian people 's government , not the Hamas government , and therefore it must be committed to the PA and the previous governments ' commitments and stop being selective on this matter , " he said .
Senior Hamas officials , including the group 's politburo chief Khaled Mashaal and Palestinian Prime Minister Ismail Haniyeh , recently reiterated that they would not give in to pressures and budgets and would not change the movement 's principles , according to which Hamas does not recognize Israel .
Meanwhile , Haniyeh said that he would only agree to receive his salary after 165,00 Palestinian clerks are paid .
Hanieyh spoke in a speech aired by phone to a conference held in Qatar .
Haniyeh added that he will transfer his first paycheck to the family of a Palestinian girl killed last month by an IDF shell in the Gaza Strip town of Beit Lahiya .
Hamas politburo chief Khaled Mashaal on Wednesday urged supporters around the world on to send Hamas arms , fighters and money to back its fight against Israel .
" We ask all the people in surrounding Arab countries , the Muslim world and everyone who wants to support us to send weapons , money and men , " Mashaal said in a speech at a pro-Palestinian event in Qatar .
In an interview , Obama says some members of Congress are hypocritical when it comes to blaming White House .

Obama to POLITICO : Some in Congress hypocritical on spill
President Barack Obama said Friday that some members of Congress are being hypocritical when it comes to blaming the White House for its handling of the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico .
In an interview with POLITICO , the president said : “ I think it ’s fair to say , if six months ago , before this spill had happened , I had gone up to Congress and I had said we need to crack down a lot harder on oil companies and we need to spend more money on technology to respond in case of a catastrophic spill , there are folks up there , who will not be named , who would have said this is classic , big - government overregulation and wasteful spending . ”

The president also implied that anti-big government types such as t ea party activists were being hypocritical on the issue .
“ Some of the same folks who have been hollering and saying ‘ do something ’ are the same folks who , just two or three months ago , were suggesting that government needs to stop doing so much , ” Obama said .
“ Some of the same people who are saying the president needs to show leadership and solve this problem are some of the same folks who , just a few months ago , were saying this guy is trying to engineer a takeover of our society through the federal government that is going to restrict our freedoms . ”
Obama ’s comments , during a 36 - minute Oval Office interview , come as the public is giving the federal government low marks for its response to the BP oil spill , according to recent polls .
Obama travels to the Gulf Monday and Tuesday and has invited top BP executives to the White House for a meeting Wednesday .
As to accusations that he is not showing enough passion in fighting the oil spill , the president blamed the media .
“ You know , what I think I get frustrated with sometimes , as do , I suspect , other members of my team , is that the media specifically is demanding things that the public are n’t demanding , ” the president said .
“ What the public wants to see is us solving this problem .
And that may not make for good TV . ”
The president also declined to say whether the United States was winning the war in Afghanistan .
“ I think it ’s too early to tell whether the strategy that we put forward in September is meeting all the benchmarks that we set , ” he said .
More of the interview will be available in Roger Simon ’s column Sunday .
BERKELEY , Calif . –
For the second time in five weeks , dozens of men and women with disabilities and their caregivers camped out for days on a grassy traffic island here last week , protesting Republican Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger ’s plan to slash funding for human services , including the program they say enables them to live at home instead of in nursing homes .
They called their little cluster of tents “ Arnieville , ” after the Hooverville shantytowns built by homeless people during the Great Depression .
“ We ’re here because we ’re sick and tired of a budget process that treats us as expendable , ” spokesperson Jean Stewart told a June 24 press conference .
“ Every year our governor and legislators look for items they can cut from the budget , and every year they single out In - Home Supportive Services ( IHSS ) and Medi-Cal ( California ’s Medicaid ) along with other programs that elderly , disabled and poor people depend on , like CalWORKS , Adult Day Health Care and mental health rehab . ”
California faces a $ 19.1 billion budget gap .
It ’s the only state requiring a two - thirds supermajority both to pass a budget and to raise taxes .
Democrats in the legislature fall short of that level , and virtually all Republican legislators have signed a no - new - taxes pledge .
As in most recent years , the legislature missed the June 15 budget deadline to pass a budget , and negotiations will likely drag on for many weeks .
Stewart , who uses a wheelchair , spoke of the “ terror ” she and other users of IHSS services , and the caregivers whose jobs are also at stake , experience every year as the budget process wears on .
Calling IHSS “ a model program , ” she described its role in helping low income seniors and the disabled with essential daily activities so they can remain independent in their own homes .
She and others have formed Communities United in Defense of Olmstead ( CUIDO ) , which takes its name from a U.S. Supreme Court decision holding that unnecessary segregation of people with disabilities in institutions constitutes discrimination based on disability .
Also speaking was Berkeley City Councilmember Max Anderson , who told the crowd the state ’s budget troubles stem from “ the way the system is organized .
There ’s not an effort to go to where the money is and get the money to provide resources for those who need them . ”
Anderson called the cuts and the state ’s constant raiding of county and city budgets “ an unconscionable attack on the quality of life and the very existence of life for many people . ”
The Berkeley City Council last week resolved to write to Gov. Schwarzenegger strongly opposing the cuts .
Organizers called on other city councils to do likewise .
Arnieville protesters also targeted the governor ’s proposal for unannounced visits to IHSS recipients ’ homes , supposedly to counter fraud , which IHSS supporters say is virtually nonexistent .
In a conversation after the press conference , Stephanie Miyashiro , a wheelchair user who says her income is “ just a bit too high ” to qualify for IHSS , said independent movements run by people with disabilities are vital to uphold their civil rights and ability to live independently .
“ We outnumber the billionaires , ” she said .
“ If we all get together we can take our state back . ”
Sheela Gunn -Cushman , blind herself , teaches other blind people how to use computers .
A registered Republican , she disagrees with the governor ’s approach .
She also has mixed feelings about the Afghanistan war and its cost : “ We need to focus on the home front – I think we should solve our problems and not think we can solve everyone else ’s . ”
IHSS now serves over 450,000 Californians .
The livelihoods of some 350,000 caregivers are also at stake .
Organizers warned of the devastating economic consequences of forcing hundreds of thousands into far more costly nursing homes which may not have capacity for them , while further boosting the state ’s already soaring 12.4 percent unemployment .

BEIJING ( Reuters ) - A space shuttle simulator ride plunged to the ground , killing six people and injuring another 10 at a popular south China amusement park , state media reported on Wednesday .
Survivors said there was a power cut and they heard a loud explosion moments before the drop , Southern Metropolis Daily reported on Wednesday .
Five of those injured in the Tuesday accident are still in a serious condition , the paper added .
The “ space flight ” attraction at Overseas Chinese Town East aimed to give riders in 11 four - person cabins the experience of a rocket launch , the official Xinhua agency said .
The cause of the accident is under investigation , and part of the amusement park in the coastal city of Shenzhen has been shut down for safety checks , Xinhua quoted local official Xiao Wenhong saying .
In 2006 , one person was killed and another seriously injured by a Ferris wheel accident in the southwestern province of Guizhou .
A warmer Arctic climate is influencing the air pressure at the North Pole and shifting wind patterns on our planet .
We can expect more cold and snowy winters in Europe , eastern Asia and eastern North America .
" Cold and snowy winters will be the rule , rather than the exception , " says Dr James Overland of the NOAA / Pacific Marine Environmental Laboratory in the United States .
Dr Overland is at the International Polar Year Oslo Science Conference ( IPY - OSC ) to chair a session on polar climate feedbacks , amplification and teleconnections , including impacts on mid-latitudes .
Loss of sea ice causes major climate change
Continued rapid loss of sea ice will be an important driver of major change in the world 's climate system in the years to come .
" While the emerging impact of greenhouse gases is an important factor in the changing Arctic , what was not fully recognised until now is that a combination of an unusual warm period due to natural variability , loss of sea ice reflectivity , ocean heat storage and changing wind patterns working together has disrupted the memory and stability of the Arctic climate system , resulting in greater ice loss than earlier climate models predicted , " says Dr Overland .
" The exceptional cold and snowy winter of 2009 - 2010 in Europe , eastern Asia and eastern North America is connected to unique physical processes in the Arctic , " he says .
Irreversible change
The Arctic is warming more than twice as fast as the rest of the planet .
This is known as Arctic amplification -- a much debated phenomenon at the IPY - OSC , where 2400 polar scientists have gathered to discuss the huge amount of research and new findings which are the direct result of the International Polar Year .
The changes are happening a great deal faster than the scientific community expected .
Given the recent reduction of the area of multi- year sea ice and reduced ice thickness , it is unlikely that the Arctic can return to its previous condition .
" The changes are irreversible , " says Dr Overland .
A landmark event
" The IPY Oslo Science Conference is a landmark event in our understanding of the Arctic climate , " says Dr Overland , who is chairing one of the sessions on climate at the conference .
More than 80 scientific papers have been submitted discussing Arctic amplification and its impacts .
THE federal government has been forced to draw up a national population strategy , amid growing concerns the number of Australians will rise to unsustainable levels .
Latest projections show the population will swell to at least 36 million by 2050 , raising questions about the sustainability of capital cities and adequacy of water supplies .
Prime Minister Kevin Rudd said the country needed to know how many people it could handle .

Prime Minister Kevin Rudd said in Canberra yesterday the country needed to know how many people it could handle .
'' Many Australians have legitimate concerns about the sustainability of the population levels in different parts of the country , '' he said . ''…
Particularly its impact on urban congestion , its impact on the adequacy of infrastructure , its impact on the adequacy of housing supply , its impact on government services , its impact also on water and agriculture and on our regions . ''
A federal judge in Alaska refused on Monday to allow state officials to launch an aerial wolf hunt on a federal wildlife refuge in the Aleutian Islands , an emergency effort to save a herd of caribou that is on the verge of collapse .
The ruling is the latest chapter in a legal battle between the state and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service that erupted after federal wildlife officials threatened to charge state game hunters with trespassing if they entered the refuge and began gunning down wolves .
While federal officials have engaged in a variety of predator control measures , no aerial wolf control program has ever been authorized on a federal wildlife refuge in Alaska .
U.S. District Judge H. Russel Holland in Anchorage declined the state ’s request for a preliminary injunction , ruling that federal wildlife officials are allowed by law to complete their studies to determine the cause of the caribou decline and how to deal with the predator wolves before any emergency action .
The state Department of Fish and Game has warned that the caribou population on Unimak Island — the easternmost island in the Aleutians that is home to fewer than 100 mainly Alaska Native residents — is so precariously low that it could disappear if wolves are allowed to attack this summer ’s newborn calves .
Residents have said the wolves are hungry , increasingly desperate and a potential threat to children .
“ The wolves do n’t have enough caribou to eat , so they have to search for something else . …
Where the wolves are camping out now are houses that have little 7 - and 10 - year - old children , ” said Cindy Beamer , general manager of the Isanotski Corp. , which represents Alaska Natives on the 1,571 - square - mile island .
State officials have said they are obligated by law to maintain a healthy enough caribou herd to provide subsistence hunting of the animal for Unimak residents , who also depend on fishing .
While there were 1,200 caribou on the island in 2002 , there were fewer than 300 during the official count in 2009 .
State officials in court Monday presented the results of a survey conducted Sunday that showed only an estimated 250 caribou surviving .
“ They only actually counted 178 , and they counted seven bulls , ” said Bill McAllister , spokesman for the state Department of Law .
Federal officials continue to believe there are at least 400 caribou remaining .
In any case , the extremely low number of bulls means it could be difficult or impossible for the herd to survive with further predation .
The state went to court last week for an emergency order to hunt as many as seven of the island ’s estimated 20 to 30 wolves by air .
Larry Bell , assistant regional director for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service in Alaska , said federal wildlife biologists agree that something must be done about the declining caribou population but need more time to determine the best course of action .
Over the years , the number of caribou on the island has ranged from several thousand to none , and federal officials have tried to allow predators and prey to maintain their own equilibrium .
“ While we see there is urgency to this matter , we do n’t believe it ’s such a dire situation that we ca n’t take time to conduct a thorough analysis prior to acting , ” Bell said .
He said federal officials expect to complete their analysis by December .
They also expect to grant a permit on Wednesday to allow state officials to import additional caribou bulls onto the island , and they will launch a collaring program for caribou and wolves to allow both wildlife agencies to better understand what is happening .

Troy Davis , an African American inmate held on Georgia ’s death row for nearly two decades , will have chance to win his freedom Wednesday as a Savannah , Ga. , federal court holds a new evidentiary hearing on his case .
The Supreme Court ordered the new hearing last year after an international campaign brought attention to the probability of a wrongful conviction .
Davis was sentenced to death for the killing of a white police officer , Mark MacPhail , in 1991 .
Seven of nine witnesses have since recanted their testimony , claiming coercion from police anxious to secure a quick conviction .
Davis has maintained his innocence throughout .
His execution has been stopped three times .
The Supreme Court made an extraordinary decision in ordering a new hearing in the case : “ Last August , for the first time in nearly half a century , the U.S. Supreme Court took a case filed directly to its docket , instead of hearing an appeal of a lower - court ruling .
It accepted Davis ’ last - ditch innocence claim after Davis had exhausted all his appeals . ”
NAACP head Benjamin Jealous points to the unique concerns of the Supreme Court ruling : “ The ruling is unusual in that the Supreme Court has not granted this writ of habeas corpus in more than 50 years .
Their decision is a strong indication that they are concerned about the constitutionality of executing the innocent – as am I . ”
http://www.naacp.org/home/index.htm?gclid=CObO_7aFtqICFSQ65QodAyHY6A
In addition to the NAACP , Amnesty International and others have campaigned extensively on behalf of Davis .
His appeal has won broad support around the world , including from Jimmy Carter and Pope Benedict XVI , to mention a few .
Press reports indicate that the burden of proof in the evidentiary hearing is quite high .
Reasonable doubt is no longer the standard .
Instead , the defendant will apparently have to clearly establish his innocence .
Davis ’ appeal has been hampered by federal anti-terrorism statutes .
News reports indicate that until the Supreme Court stepped in , Davis ’ attempts to get his new evidence presented in court had been repeatedly stymied by the federal Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act , legislation enacted in 1996 to “ streamline ” appeals of capital sentences .
Rallies were held on Tuesday in support of Davis ’ hearing .
Amnesty International called for a “ Day of Solidarity ” in support of the death row inmate .
His conviction was based solely on witnesses ’ testimony .
No DNA or physical evidence was presented .

( CNN ) -- U.S. border patrol agents Friday found a crude tunnel , apparently used for smuggling , underneath the concrete - lined Rio Grande River near El Paso , Texas .
The discovery came as authorities were investigating suspicious activity in the city storm drain system and came upon a juvenile from Mexico with 200 pounds of marijuana .
" This is another example of smuggling organizations actively recruiting juveniles to smuggle narcotics and humans , " said sector Chief Randy Hill .
" These organizations are exploiting the youth of Mexico and putting their lives in danger . "
Mexican authorities were called in to locate the tunnel entrance on the Mexican side .
Peeved by a recent ruling that a National Day of Prayer is unconstitutional , Sarah Palin is urging America to base its laws on the Ten Commandments , telling Fox News ' Bill O'Reilly that we should " go back to what our founders and our founding documents meant .
They 're quite clear that we would create law based on the God of the Bible .... "
While Palin supporters remained mostly silent , secular critics quickly shot back .
" More people in the United States are Christians , " says Joe Gandelman in The Moderate Voice , " but the United States is not a Christian nation .
And the founding fathers most assuredly did not define it as such . "
Not only " should we not base our laws on the Ten Commandments , " adds Ed Brayton in Science Blogs , but " 8 out of 10 are indisputably unconstitutional . "
Besides , the Declaration of Independence 's " principle author , " Thomas Jefferson , once described the Judeo - Christian God as " cruel , capricious , vindictive and unjust . "

Over the past year , new techniques and tricks involving HTML5 and CSS3 enhancements have been shared on a number of websites , giving developers new possibilities for improving the user experience .
Of course , the plethora of information online is hard to keep up with , and some of it may be out of date , inaccurate , or may fail to promote accessibility , progressive enhancement , or other best practices methods .
To that end , designers and developers today may prefer to have a desktop reference in the form of a good old ink and paper companion .
So in this article , I ’ve compiled a list of eleven books that will be released in 2010 that focus on HTML5 and CSS3 .
Many of the authors listed alongside the titles below will be familiar to us , since some of them have established themselves online as zealous proponents of best practices and standards - based code .

There came a rapid knocking on the bathroom door , not for the first time .
Why was I being rushed ?
There were two other bathrooms on the airplane , why was the one I was in so popular ?
Since I could remember , I havent been comfortable using a bathroom when other people were around , and now someone was slamming on the thin , plastic door of this crate of a lavatory .
When I was finished , and had been angrily stared down by the pouting Asian mother outside the bathroom holding her moaning baby , I sat back down and prepared to endure the remainder of the flight back to Miami .
Drifting in and out of consciousness , I finally made it .
I tugged my bulging , hefty duffle bag through the narrow isle , and then I scurried into the gate .
My cell phone vibrated in my pocket .
The caller ID showed a picture of my boyfriend , Shokk .
Shokk !
I squealed , excitedly .
Well hello .
Are you off the plane ? Yeah , I m at the ..uh thing .. where you go when you get off the plane . The gate ? Yep .
So , I talked to him as I navigated my way through the airports long , pretzel - scented hallways .
I was then reunited with my mom and Shokk .
I couldnt have been happier .
Shokk and I kissed and linked hands as we followed my mom to the outside of the airport .
While waiting for our ride , I proudly displayed a whole bunch of the things Id made at my art camp , like the little glass mushrooms Id sculpted in lampworking , and a dragon batik I had made for Shokk .
My dad pulled up in the car , and we all got in , me in the backseat with Shokk .
My parents were talking about something separate from Shokk and I .
Shokk said he had a gift for me too , and he pulled out a book written by Tim Burton , one of my favorite directors and writers .
Then Shokk squeezed my hand , and told me he had something else for me too .
To fast forward through the story , and the events insignificant to the reader , let us skip to when I have taken a shower and am sitting at the kitchen table , my mother brushing my hair .
The doorbell rings , and its Shokk , who had been driven home , but was now coming back to the house to pick me up .
We went back to my room when my hair was finished , and Shokk 's eyes light up and he tells me he has made  Green Dragon .
Now , Shokk has always liked to experiment with things he can easily get his hands on , that many people dont know about using .
He explained to me that this tea hed made is composed of angel trumpets .
I knew from childhood that those flowers were poisonous .
Many times I had asked my parents what would happen if they touched me , and jokingly they replied  Nothing , just dont eat them !
Unfortunately for me , I am a moron , and I was excited about this opportunity to try a new drug , despite my lack of former knowledge or research .
Shokk told me hed tried it the previous day , and that hed tripped and talked to people who werent there , and his eyesight was messed up .
For some reason , at the time , that seemed like enough of an explanation of the effects to make me okay with trying it .
I also attribute my behavior to camp .
At a camp like XXXX , filled with rich , Jewish , art - oriented teenagers , drugs are one of the only conversational cores .
The others being sex , and music .
So , I must admit that all the discussion at camp made me a malenky bit hungry for a psychological screw - with .
So , Shokk and I got into the Prius , a little , buggish vehicle Ive learned to recognize and love , and we begin to drive toward Shokk 's house .
Shokk motions toward the cup holder , which is occupied with a tall , silver thermos .
The other with a pack of Marlboro Light , which Shokk quickly assures me upon my glance , is his fathers .
This format is taking too long , so I m just going to brief this shit now .
As Shokk explained to me earlier , he was actually on an errand for his father to go pick up milk and some more smokes , and he was just picking me up along the way .
As we drove to Wild Oats , I poured myself a thermos -cap of the hot , green liquid inside .
It smelled like cinnamon , but looked like absinthe .
I took a taste , and it was not very pleasant , but tolerable .
After every few shots as I was finishing off the three thermos capfuls I would finish in the car , Shokk let me cover the taste with the lollipop he was working on , not drinking any at the time himself .
We picked up the milk , and drove back to Shokk 's house , where we met up with Lokk , my best friend .
We hadnt seen each other in a month , as I had been at art camp , and she had been taking a month of mini-courses at Yale .
We hugged , and brought in our things .
Her mom had gotten us a flat crust pizza , and I had a bag filled with gifts for Lokk because her birthday had passed on the seventh , when we were still separated .
We all went inside the house .
Shokk poured a coffee cup of the tea and told Lokk it was hallucinogenic .
Lokk , being the smartest of us three , asked some questions .
She didnt know much about the ingredients , and asked what was the amount needed to start effect .
Shokk told her it was a cup , and then took out a measuring cylinder and poured out exactly one cup .
We started talking , and then made our way to the patio in the backyard , and all sat down on the couch by the glass table in the back .
Lokk tried the tea , and , due to the unpleasant taste , could only down about a half of the exactly poured cup .
I finished off her half cup , and Shokk and I passed back and forth the coffee cup full he had poured earlier .
So , in all , I had about 2 and a half cups in me , and then around 3 and a half because Shokk poured some more into the coffee cup , which I drank myself .
Shokk kept checking my pupils , and Lokk was terrified when he told her that the tea dilates your pupils , because her mother is very punctual to check hers when she gets home .
Dizzy and uncomfortable because
Shokk kept grabbing me and staring at me , I decided to go inside .
When I stood up and walked to the door , I slammed into the frame , as my depth perception was already lacking .
Lokk and Shokk soon followed , and we all sat down on the couch .
Now is when my memory begins to give out .
I remember Lokk asking Shokk to hook up her digital camera to the television so she could show us pictures from Yale .
He wouldnt do it , so she just showed me on her digital camera while Shokk played Mars Attacks .
Then some reason , we were tired or something so we all went into Shokk 's room and rested on his bed .
I dont remember much after this , but from what Ive been told about the night , the story is as follows :
We had to pick Jesus , my good friend and Shokk 's brother , up from the airport because he was flying in from New Jersey or something .
So Shokk , Lokk and I got into the car with Shokk 's father .
We dropped Lokk off at home , and then were on our way to the airport .
They told me I was babbling incoherently the whole time , and told them  Never mind  every time I was asked what I had just said .
We then got to the airport , and Shokk was led by someone to the gate where Jesus was supposed to come out of .
I remember the airport appearing to have nothing in it except this one tiny little café , and a row of chairs , but it seemed to go on infinitely .
I was scared of being alone with Jim , and he kept looking at me , and eventually , after I had been wandering around a while , grabbed my shoulders and asked me what I was on .
I said I wasnt on anything .
Cmon , I m not stupid .
What did you take ?
But I kept denying being on anything .
I remember going into the bathroom and looking at my pupils and seeing that they were uber - dilated .
I also remember feeling extremely nervous , like I had overdosed on some kind of speed .
My memory suffers still , but I am told I got lost and wandered around the airport lost for three hours before the guys found me .
I remember talking and then turning around , and Jesus was there , and I was surprised to see him , and saying something to the effect of ,  Woah , Jesus , when did you get here ?
Then they drove me home around 2 AM , and I remember seeing a live action role player out my window .
That night in my house many strange things would happen .
I remember a number of hallucinations from that night .
I saw transparent , giant , hissing and clicking roaches on the ceiling of my hallway .
I remember becoming friends with someone who looked like me in the mirror of my bathroom .
I remember almost waking up my parents to help kill the cockroaches .
I remember my mom telling me to lie down for a while .
I remember being on the computer , talking to people who , when I turned around were not the silhouettes I had seen out of the corners of my eyes .
What my brother told me is that I kept saying random things , and saying I had to get on a plane or Id miss it , and when he told me I was already in Florida , that I said  Oh yeah , land of the free ! 
My mom had come and found me taking pictures off the wall in the hallway .
And , in my room , Im told I was folding my pajama pants and putting them in a gift bag .
Also , I was moving things around in my room .
I remember that if I picked something up , like a pen to write with , and didnt use it immediately , it was whooshed out of my hands , and I eventually accepted all these things , disappearing people and objects , as part of the new reality .
The next morning , I was still fairly delirious .
My mom had gotten a phone call from Shokk 's father .
Shokk was worried about me , and he had told his dad what we all did .
My mom called poison control , and then followed their orders by taking me to the emergency room .
When we got there , I had a loose grip on reality , and I had to go to the bathroom while we were waiting .
In the stall , I was constipated from the belladonna , and I was hallucinating still rapidly .
There were thousands of tiny , transparent maggots squirming out of my feet and the grout in between the bathroom floor tiles .
Ant and Lokk appeared in the stall with me .
My mom came in and told me to hurry because the doctor was waiting , and it made me very uncomfortable .
I remember talking to someone in another stall because they were sniffling , and I think I was trying to comfort them .
The lock on the stall also became a face and the screws securing it were eyes .
It was talking about something , and then I looked at it , and consciously thought  That s a lock  and then it morphed back into a lock .
When I weaned myself off of the toilet , I was taken into a room in which I was attached to an IV and made to drink a jumbo - size cup of activated charcoal .
The poison control center made the hospital keep me in intensive care overnight , and that proved to be good because my heart had irregularity ten times in the night .
Cant have the Angel Trumpet without the Devil Trombone .
Though I mostly game in my office chair , little of that is upright against the seatback , with my feet on the floor .
A study of kids ' gaming postures finds they go to full - on slouch in as little as five minutes .

That 's according to a California - based physical therapy firm , as reported by The Bakersfield Californian .
The study of 45 kids ages 5 to 15 , done in conjunction with Cal State Bakersfield 's Department of Physical Education & Kinesiology , watched kids play games for just five minutes .
Those sitting in chairs had better posture at the beginning and the end of the five minute session , while kids who sat on the floor exhibited more pronounced traits of bad posture .
That would be a head - leaning forward , rounded shoulders , and the lower back rounding forward as well .
Jeff Moffitt , chairman of the CSU - Bakersfield department , said that could lead to posture and back problems later in life .

" Children or adults , the more time they spend in one position , they 're more likely to regress to the least energy - demanding position , " he said .
Moffitt of course recommended that parents notice their kids posture and , of course , nag them about it .
But for adults , you should know that back problems are no joke , and expensive to manage later in life .
Take some time to press pause , stretch out , straighten up , and get back to enjoying yourself .

Study Examined Posture While Playing Video Games [ The Bakersfield Californian via Game Politics ]
The Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico continued spreading May 6 .
British Petroleum and U.S. federal agencies are continuing with their emergency response and mitigation efforts as the unprecedented spill continues .
While the incident has not significantly interrupted shipping or energy refining and production , it does threaten several economic sectors and is sure to have political implications .
However , until the full extent of the damage is assessed , it will be difficult to say whether the spill will result in a policy change regarding offshore drilling .
Analysis
The oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico continued spreading across the waters southeast of Louisiana on May 6 .
British Petroleum ( BP ) , the company responsible for the spill , and several U.S. federal agencies continue apace with their emergency response and mitigation efforts .
So far , the oil has not significantly interrupted any shipping or energy refining and production .
In the past 13 days , the oil slick has tripled in size .
Although BP plugged one of three leakage points May 5 , it does not anticipate the flow to be reduced yet , and BP executives reportedly told the U.S. Congress on May 4 that while the oil is officially estimated to be gushing out at 5,000 barrels per day ( bpd ) the rate could be as high as 60,000 bpd .
In other words , the problem could be far greater and more pressing than previously thought .
Furthermore , as the oil spill grows , so does the magnitude of potential economic and political consequences .
It poses an immediate threat to the fishing , offshore oil production , shipping and refining industries .
It also presents policymakers with questions about offshore drilling , entailing long - term regulatory ramifications for the industry .
However , until the full extent of the damage is assessed , it is difficult to say whether the spill will result in a fundamental change in the national policy toward offshore drilling .
The spill began with a disaster on the BP - and Transocean - operated Deepwater Horizon oilrig April 20 .
The rig was located about 40 miles southeast of Louisiana and had concluded an exploratory drilling into the Macondo oil deposit .
Workers on the rig felt two big shudders , after which oil , gas and mud erupted from the well .
A spark caused the oil to catch fire and set the entire rig aflame .
It sank April 22 , but the oil continued to surge out of the well .
The cause of the explosion is still under investigation .
Several technical problems have been identified — notably , the blowout preventer designed to seal off the well in emergencies failed to stop the gusher .
There also is speculation concerning the fact that the process of cementing the well ( protecting the pipe from the pressures of surrounding oil and gas ) had been completed only 20 hours before the fire .
But undersea drilling is inherently risky because it can unleash the immense pressure in the oil reservoirs under the seabed .
The chief difference between the Deepwater Horizon spill and the Exxon Valdez spill in Alaska in 1989 is that the Valdez was an oil tanker with a limited amount of oil to spill ( 250,000 barrels ) , whereas the Deepwater Horizon spill comes from a leaking well and thus is growing by the day , with no certain end in sight .
BP and a host of U.S. federal agencies — including the Coast Guard , the Minerals Management Service and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration ( NOAA ) — have been focused on containing the oil slick , using controlled burns and chemicals to disperse the oil , protecting the shoreline and addressing the economic and political effects .
Stopping the oil flow will be difficult and will take time .
In the next five days , BP will begin an operation to lower a giant containment structure — a dome or cofferdam — into the sea to cap off the well and then funnel the hydrocarbons up to a special ship on the surface .
The containment dome arrived at the Deepwater Horizon site May 6 and is expected to be in place for operations to begin by May 10 .
It is not clear whether this will work , as it has never been tried before , but it is the best shot at quickly reducing the flow of oil .
Another possible solution would involve installing a second blowout preventer on top of the one that failed , but this is also untested and risks increasing the outflow of oil if it fails .
The surest method of stopping the flow , already under way , consists of drilling a relief well that will allow the company to access the leak and seal it — but will take two or three months .
A three - month delay would be the most prolonged , costly and environmentally damaging scenario and would make the Deepwater Horizon spill almost twice the size of the Valdez spill — assuming the higher estimated rates of leakage are not accurate ( and BP ’s most pessimistic estimate of 60,000 bpd is by no means an impossible output for a single well ) .
However , the cofferdam technique could prevent the worst - case scenario .
The situation is unprecedented , and while experts are devising solutions , the outcomes remain uncertain .
Economic Implications
The oil is expected to hit land as early as May 6 .
Coastal areas of Louisiana , Mississippi , Alabama and northwest Florida are in the slick ’s path and face several economic risks — primarily in the fishing , shipping and energy sectors — as the oil approaches .
The area ’s large fishing industry already has suffered .
Louisiana produced about 417,000 metric tons ( 459,664 short tons ) of seafood , for a total of $ 274.9 million , in 2008 — about 39 percent of which came from shrimp .
Mississippi , meanwhile , produced about 92,000 metric tons ( 101,412 short tons ) worth about $ 43.7 million , with menhaden accounting for 42 percent , and Alabama produced about 11,000 metric tons ( 12,125 short tons ) totaling $ 44.3 million , almost half of the value of which came from shrimp .
Authorities in Louisiana allowed shrimping season to start two weeks early to maximize the harvest before the oil reaches prime shrimping waters , though this special season has already concluded .
On May 2 , federal authorities placed a 10 - day fishing ban on the federal waters surrounding most of the oil slick ( while states have jurisdiction over the waters close to their shores ) .
As the oil infiltrates the marshes and lagoons of the coast , it will become far more difficult to disperse and will affect delicate ecosystems .
Shrimping industry experts and the NOAA also have expressed fear that the chemical dispersants being used could disrupt fishing .
All this could have a negative impact on generations of submarine life — especially if the oil cannot be prevented from reaching the marshes where the life cycle begins — and thus serious ramifications for the fishing industry .
Yet the overall economic damage will be limited to local areas , as commercial fishing makes up less than 1 percent of each state ’s economy .
The oil slick also presents risks to the energy sector .
Federal offshore drilling in the Gulf produced about 1.15 million bpd of oil in 2008 , about one - third of total domestic crude production .
Offshore energy production facilities are highly sensitive to external conditions and frequently have to stop operations when threatened by spills , storms or other unusual circumstances .
Floating oil in surrounding waters poses the threat of fire , most obviously , and is a threat to workers ’ health .
Hence , nearby rigs could have to shut down if the oil spreads to them .
Three platforms already have been evacuated , though these were precautionary as they were close to the Deepwater Horizon site ; two of these were natural gas producing sites , but their output was negligible ( and natural gas output , at about 2.3 trillion cubic feet in 2008 , has been falling drastically over the past decade ) .
As the oil slick expands , however , other rigs in the Gulf could face this problem .
Shipping also will be threatened .
While oil does not damage ocean - going vessels , it will cling to their hulls , and it is illegal for ships to enter U.S. ports or waterways if they will contaminate the waters .
Incoming dirty ships would have to transfer their cargo or be cleaned , which takes time , and cleaning the ships could create delays and port congestion .
At present , the oil slick has not disrupted the main shipping lanes , but as the slick grows , much of the near - shore and coastline is at risk .
The Louisiana Offshore Oil Port ( LOOP ) — a major location for importing oil — remains accessible as it is much further west of the bulk of the spill — but it is not impossible that the slick could affect access .
The major ports at Pascagoula , Miss. , and Mobile , Ala. , have seen no interruptions yet but their shipping lanes could be narrowed as the oil slick continues to move northeast .
The main Southwest Passage into the New Orleans port remains open , though the three - day trajectory of the oil slick provided by NOAA suggests the waters around the passage could become tainted .
This could affect a whole string of ports , from Plaquemines to Baton Rouge and most notably New Orleans , the country ’s 13th - largest port by total overseas trade .
The entire Mississippi River system – a critical transportation route for the economy of the U.S. heartland — will feel reverberations if delays result from the need to clean oil off of ships .
Shipping problems could cause delays in getting oil supplies to refineries in the affected Gulf Coast areas .
However , unlike offshore production rigs , refineries will not be induced to cease operations easily — they are built to withstand hurricanes .
The refineries can receive oil via sub-sea pipeline infrastructure , and currently commercial stockpiles are relatively high ( national stockpiles are at 1.1 billion barrels ) .
Refiners also have the option of seeking assistance from the U.S. Strategic Petroleum Reserve ( SPR ) , with 726.6 million barrels , which the Department of Energy has offered to tap if supply shortages threaten the U.S. consumer market .
The maximum draw down rate of the SPR is about 4.1 million bpd — greater than the total capacity of all refineries in Louisiana , Alabama and Mississippi that could conceivably see their oil supply affected by shipping interruptions , which is roughly 3.5 million to 4 million bpd .
Thus , there should not be any shortages in refined oil products such as gasoline from this incident ( especially as long as the LOOP remains operational ) .
Political Consequences
The political ramifications also will increase in magnitude as the spill expands .
Offshore oil production accounts for about one third of global oil production , and the demand for it will not disappear .
However , the United States already strictly regulates offshore drilling , and regulations will increase as a result of the Deepwater Horizon incident .
California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger already has scrapped his plan to expand offshore drilling as a means of bringing in more revenue to ease the state ’s fiscal woes .
The California electorate is especially concerned with environmental issues — perhaps more than with fiscal ones — but Schwarzenegger ’s statement will change the national debate .
U.S. President Barack Obama has not called for a review of his policy to expand offshore drilling beginning in 2012 , which was just announced in early April , but he has placed a moratorium on new leases until the completion of a Cabinet review of oil rig safety , expected at the end of May .
It will be difficult for Obama to press ahead with offshore drilling ; his core supporters already were disgruntled by his expansion plans , and the Deepwater Horizon incident lends strength to their opposition .
The expansion was linked to a proposed bill in Congress on energy reforms including carbon emission reductions and cap - and - trade , and a halt on offshore drilling could easily derail the bill .
Instead , Obama and lawmakers will focus on raising the liability limit on companies responsible for oil spills — currently at $ 75 million , but proposed to be raised up to $ 10 billion .
BP is already preparing to pay an enormous tab for the losses of capital goods , litigation , reimbursement for local economies and the U.S. government .
With profits at $ 16.8 billion in 2009 , BP has some room to maneuver , but it is facing a serious blow to its reputation and balance sheet .
Still , the wrath of litigation and regulation to come will be costly for oil companies and offshore operations .
BP will bear the brunt of U.S. wrath , but the fallout from Deepwater Horizon will affect the entire oil industry .
Questions about deepwater drilling technology will abound , and resolving these questions will be costly .
The Deepwater Horizon rig was worth about $ 560 million and was one of the most advanced in the world ; it broke the record in 2009 for drilling the world ’s deepest well at some 35,000 feet beneath the Gulf .
There are only about 70 comparable rigs in the world .
As the investigation into the incident continues , questions will arise as to whether such rigs are reliable and technically sound , and it is by no means a stretch to think that expanded and intensified inspections , maintenance reviews and the like will result in significantly raising the costs of — and risks of investing in — deepwater drilling .
As the oil slick continues to expand , so too will the economic and political ramifications .
The immediate things to watch for are the increasing size of the oil slick , the halting of oil production at affected rigs , the oil ’s approach to shipping lanes to ports and refineries , and the progress of attempts to plug the well and stop the outflow .
The success of the containment dome method is especially critical .
The full extent of the damage will not be known for some time , but it will determine the depth of the impact the incident will have on the future of offshore drilling , and how difficult it will be for the public to accept it as a necessary risk in developing advanced technology in pursuit of a domestic energy supply .

Google today published statistical information showing it had received 155 requests for information from Australian government agencies in the second half of 2009 , and 17 requests to remove information from its various sites — only half of which it complied with .
The release of the local statistical information ( Google has declined to provide specific information about the requests ) comes as part of a global initiative where the search giant is attempting to illustrate how widespread government censorship of the web is growing rapidly .
“ We already try to be as transparent as legally possible with respect to requests .
Whenever we can , we notify users about requests that may affect them personally .
If we remove content in search results , we display a message to users , ” Google ’s chief legal officer David Drummond wrote in a global blog about the project .
“ The numbers we are sharing today take this transparency a step further and reflect the total number of requests we have received broken down by jurisdiction .
We are also sharing the number of these content removal requests that we do not comply with , and while we cannot yet provide more detail about our compliance with user data requests in a useful way , we intend to do so in the future . ”
In Australia , Google received 155 requests for data from government agencies over the period , and 17 removal requests , with one of those being relating to a blogger using its platform , one relating to geographical data ( not including its Street View service , which provides street - level photographical data ) , one web search , and 14 YouTube videos .
52.9 percent of those removal requests were fully or partially complied with .
The worst countries for takedown requests over the period were Brazil ( 291 ) , Germany ( 188 ) , India ( 142 ) , the United States ( 123 ) and South Korea ( 64 ) .
Australia and Canada ( 16 ) were roughly equal .
Google has emerged as a strong opponent of the Federal Government ’s plans to filter the internet for refused classification material , and has recently been revealed to have taken the step of contacting the US State Department — which has also expressed concern about the issue — on the matter .
In a blog post , new Electronic Frontiers Australia chair Colin Jacobs said the digital rights advocacy group was encouraged by Google ’s move , which he said could only be taken as a “ good faith attempt to be a better internet citizen ” .
“ Around the world ’s it has often been difficult to get a picture on how prevalent such requests are and the Google information will be examined with some interest .
The fact that they have released these statistics voluntarily is a welcome sign and Google should be congratulated for doing so .
They have raised the bar for the other companies that play such an important role in managing and safeguarding the information that makes up our digital lives , ” he said .

Editor 's note : Sunny weekend or no sunny weekend , comfort food season is n't over just yet .
We sent contributor Maggie Hoffman all over New York in search of the very best macaroni and cheese — and on this gloomy day , she 's here with the results .
Take it away , Maggie !
Comfort food is still having its day in New York : everywhere you look , it 's another meatball , another fried chicken , and another macaroni and cheese .
Nothing wrong with that — some of us happen to be a little bit mac and cheese obsessed .
In order to sort the middling mac from the winners , we tasted around town and considered the following criteria :
Sauce :
Was it well - distributed and plentiful ?
Or did it veer toward soupy or dry ?
Was it creamy and luxurious , not gritty or greasy ?

S'MAC ( Buffalo Chicken Style )
Sauce :
While some of the other versions at this all - macaroni restaurant are a little bland , the Buffalo - style sauce bursts with tangy , spicy flavor .
Lovers of Frank 's
Hot sauce should try this immediately .
The moist chunks of chicken are n't even really necessary .
Cheese : American cheese and cheddar add the requisite gooeyness .
Noodles : Slightly soft elbows .
Topping : Order it with half breadcrumbs and half blue cheese for an additional crazy blast of flavor .
Price / Value : $ 7.25 for a gut - busting mini- skillet is a pretty good deal .
S'MAC : 345 East 12th Street ( map ) 212-358-7912
Schiller 's Liquor Bar
Sauce :
The luxurious béchamel in this dish may taste more of cream than cheese , but it 's delicious , plentiful , and perfectly smooth ( though it might be even better with an extra dash of salt . )
We did notice a little unsightly grease in the bottom of dish .
Cheese : Gruyere and parmesan — most of the cheese flavor is in the topping .
Noodles :
The elbow noodles are a little soft , but in a comforting , sauce - soaked way .
Topping : Instead of bread crumbs , this mac is topped with nutty Gruyere and parmesan , broiled until a little crispy and a little stringy .
Price / Value : A generous Staub skilletful will cost you $ 14.50 , with or without bacon .
Luckily , the carafes of tasty Côtes du Rhône are cheap .

Casellula Cheese and Wine Café
Sauce :
This is not a mac for sauce - lovers ; only a trace of liquid binds together the cheese and pasta .
But what it lacks in moisture , it makes up in fancy - cheese flavor .
Cheese :
The Casellula folks are serious about cheese , and this dish is no throwaway .
Fol epi ( which is a bit like Emmentaler ) and earthy Comté make for a musky , grown - up mac studded with sweet caramelized onions and lardons .
It practically begs for a glass of wine .
Noodles :
The fluted pasta has a nice texture , sturdy enough to stand up to real cheese .
Topping : Generously topped with crunchy , garlicky crumbs .
Price / Value : I 'm not going to lie —
It 's tiny for $ 13 .
If small plates annoy you , skip this one .
Casellula : 401 West 52nd Street ( map ) 212-247-8137
Five Points
Sauce : Chef Marc
Meyer 's brunch cookbook gives away one of his mac and cheese secrets : instead of a standard roux - based bechamel , he melts cream cheese into a sauce that includes evaporated milk .
The sauce is delicate and smooth , but we could have used a little more of it .
Cheese : Good cheddar flavor with a hint of Gruyere for balance .
Not stringy — this is a mac and cheese to be eaten in polite company .
Noodles :
Tender elbow - shaped noodles blend into the sauce for a silky mouthfeel .
Topping :
The buttery breadcrumb topping has a hint of lemon zest , which struck us as slightly out of place .
Price / Value : For $ 12 , it 's an elegant dish , and cheaper than several of other wood - oven baked options at this spacious brunch spot .
Five Points : 31 Great Jones Street ( map ) 212-253-5700
Jack the Horse Tavern
Sauce : Velvety and rich , perfectly smooth and intensely flavored .
Cheese : Smoked gouda and fontina add creamy , smoky flavor without the distraction of bacon .
I 'm a little surprised this combination is n't more commonly used — it 's brilliant .
Noodles :
The sauce manages to get inside the cavatappi noodles , so you get extra creaminess in each bite .
Topping : A little heavy on the breadcrumbs .
A deeper dish would help the crumb - to - mac ratio .
Price / Value :
It 's $ 9 for a dainty appetizer - size portion , but we were left wanting more , just because it 's so delicious .
Jack the Horse Tavern : 66 Hicks Street ( map ) 718-852-5084
The Best of the Best : It 's A Tie !
Ok , so we could n't choose .
Messy , cheesy , oozing mac and cheese — yes , please !
But we were also blown away by a pungent yet delicate penne version , with gruyere - infused sauce and a crackling crust .
The solution : go try both of our favorites , and let us know what you think .
Dumont Burger
Sauce : Thick and plentiful cheddar - laced béchamel .
Deeply flavorful and rich .
Cheese : A mountain of oozing gruyere and cheddar make this dish almost like eating noodle fondue .
Strings of cheese stretch from your fork and crispy bits stick to the sides of the ceramic dish .
Despite the inclusion of bacon lardons , cheese is the star of this mac .
Noodles :
We were worried that we would n't like the radiatore pasta , but the ridges really carry the sauce well .
Topping :
We love how cheesy and crusty the topping is -- this beats plain breadcrumbs any day .
Price / Value : For $ 10 , the small version of this dish will probably tide you over for a few days .
If you do n't like sitting at barstools , perch outside or check out their sister restaurant , Dumont .
( Warning , the more formal Dumont does n't serve mac and cheese during brunch . )
Dumont Burger : 314 Bedford Ave , Williamsburg ( map ) 718-384-6127
Artisanal Fromagerie & Bistro
Sauce : Deep cheese flavor in a beautifully silky béchamel .
Perfect sauce - to - noodle ratio .
Cheese : Mostly gruyere ( with a bit of parmesan ) , and intensely flavorful without getting stringy .
Noodles :
Al dente penne pasta does n't get lost the way elbows sometimes do , and the sauce gathers inside the noodles nicely .
Topping :
An exceptional melted - cheese and crumb crust , broiled to crisp perfection — the most flavorful topping we 've had .
Price / Value :
This delicious mac ( offered as a pretty generous side dish on the dinner menu ) is $ 9.50 , and plenty filling .
It might be the best value on Artisanal 's menu .

Central banks are buying so much gold that investors are beginning to wonder if the world is returning to the gold standard — and some financial advisers see that as a partial possibility .
" We will see some derivation of a gold standard in the next 5 to 10 years , " said Brian Hicks , U.S. Global Investors money manager , in a conference call this week with financial advisors and consultants , CNBC reports .
“ We have been seeing baby steps in the direction of countries holding more gold in their official reserves , and that this gold in effect is backing their currency . ”
While Hicks does n’t expect a return to a true gold standard in which paper money could be exchanged for gold , he thinks there will be “ some percentage , perhaps 20 percent ” of reserves will be in a “ basket of currencies . ”
Investor Jim Rogers expects gold will go much , much higher over the next decade .
In fact , he expects it will hit $ 2,000 .
“ Governments all over the world are debasing money at a rapid rate and that has always led to higher prices for real assets throughout history and it will this time too , ” Rogers told thestreet.com .
“ Rates are going to go much , much , much higher , ’ Rogers says .
“ I 'm judging the world as it goes .
I see that actions by governments all over the world are making it worse .
So I presume that will continue and gold will go that much higher over the decade . ”

As today 's launch progresses , iPads are starting to get into the hands of many across the U.S.
As we get settled with our own iPads , here are a few first impressions :
- The iPad feels very substantial in the hand .
At 1.5 lbs , it takes a bit of getting used to compared to an iPhone or Kindle .
- The screen is bright and crisp with wide viewing angles .
Despite the oleophobic coating , it collects and shows fingerprints more than expected .
- The Apple logo on the back is black with a smooth finish , not with a chromed finish like on the iPhone 3GS .
- The iPad must be connected to iTunes in order to set it up .
Out of the box , it shows a connect to iTunes screen ( you must have iTunes 9.1 ) .
- Set - up via iTunes is similar to that of the iPhone , allowing you to select the apps and media content to be synced to the iPad .
- The capacitive touchscreen is fast and responsive .
Screen orientation changes take place almost instantly .
- The on - screen keyboard in portrait orientation is usable with two thumbs but the middle keys will be a bit of a stretch for those with smaller hands .
The keys are nice and large so it's hard to miss the intended key and the predictive entry also found on the iPhone helps as well .
- Typing with two thumbs in landscape orientation is much harder and a case or some other way to prop it up to see the screen while typing with two hands is the best approach .
- Apps not yet optimized for the iPad are usable in 2 x mode but leave much to be desired .
iPad -optimized apps are really where it 's going to be .
- Sound out of the iPad 's speaker is richer and louder than expected and is sufficient for watching a movie in a quiet environment .
- The standard apps have been adapted very well to the iPad 's larger screen .
The iTunes Store and the App Store are a pleasure to browse on the iPad .
Just us in our iPad forum for questions / discussion .
Meanwhile , other reader first impressions are still being collected in this thread .

The Cato Institute has compiled information on botched SWAT thug raids around the country and produced the map below .
The map graphically reveals how often militarized police mistakenly terrorize citizens as the government pursues its totalitarian drug war .
From Cato :
The proliferation of SWAT teams , police militarization , and the Drug War have given rise to a dramatic increase in the number of “ no - knock ” or “ quick - knock ” raids on suspected drug offenders .
Because these raids are often conducted based on tips from notoriously unreliable confidential informants , police sometimes conduct SWAT - style raids on the wrong home , or on the homes of nonviolent , misdemeanor drug users .
Such highly - volatile , overly confrontational tactics are bad enough when no one is hurt — it ’s difficult to imagine the terror an innocent suspect or family faces when a SWAT team mistakenly breaks down their door in the middle of the night .
But even more disturbing are the number of times such “ wrong door ” raids unnecessarily lead to the injury or death of suspects , bystanders , and police officers .
Defenders of SWAT teams and paramilitary tactics say such incidents are isolated and rare .
A map showing raids on correctly identified addresses would be ten - deep with markers .
Alex Jones has produced a video ( below ) in response to a brutal drug raid in Missouri that resulted in steroid SWAT cops executing one family dog and wounding another during a drug raid that netted less than a gram of marijuana .
Alex describes how the government imports drugs ( primarily heroin and cocaine ) and then brutalizes and imprisons citizens who are foolish enough to consume drugs .
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
People are outraged by the thuggish and murderous behavior of the cops in Missouri .
“ In Columbia , police are getting death threats over a February drug raid where SWAT team members shot a suspect ’s dogs , killing one of them , ” reports the Crime Scene KC blog .
“ The department ’s police chief is defending the officers , saying the pit bull was acting aggressively .
The other dog is a corgi and lived .
The chief notes they ’re reviewing their policies on raids because of the raid . ”
Jonathan E. Whitworth entered into a plea agreement with the state to drop charges of possession of marijuana and second - degree child endangerment for a guilty plea to possession of drug paraphernalia , according to the Columbia Daily Tribune .
Psychotic cops like shooting dogs during drug raids .
In 2008 , a Maryland SWAT team raided the home of Berwyn Heights Mayor Cheye Calvo and shot two of his dogs to death .
“ It ’s worth emphasizing that these were labs .
Not the most intimidating dog in the world .
Of course , offing the dog is almost standard procedure in these things , now , ” writes Radley Balko .
“ On the other hand , maybe once a few public officials feel the brunt end of the militarized drug war , we ’ll get some real discussion about whether it ’s all really necessary . ”
Calvo was eventually cleared of any wrongdoing .
Police refused to apologize for executing his pets .
Cops not only kill dogs during drug raids .
They also murder people .
In 2006 cops in Atlanta , Georgia , slaughtered 92 - year - old Kathryn Johnston with a hail of gunfire during a botched raid .
In order to cover up their crime , the police planted bags of marijuana in Johnston ’s house after her death .
The murder was so outrageous and public outrage so intense the state of Georgia was obliged to put three cops on trial .
“ The fundamental travesty is the use of such paramilitary - style police tactics in the first place .
It has become commonplace in the US drug war for teams of black - clad anti-drug officers to knock down doors without warning , often in the middle of the night , setting off stun grenades , tackling confused residents to the ground and handcuffing them or waving guns in their faces or holding guns to their heads — sometimes even children , ” writes David Borden in response to the death of Alberta Spruill during a mistaken drug raid in New York .
The 57 - year - old Harlem woman died of a heart attack after police threw a stun grenade into her apartment .
New York ended up paying $ 1.6 million to Spruill ’s family .
Indeed , as Borden notes , the drug war is a travesty .
It has nothing to do with preventing the consumption of illegal drugs , however , as the government and the corporate media tell us .
It is about making a tidy profit for the CIA ( so they can run their covert ops off the books ) and Wall Street .
It is also an excuse to militarize the cops and expand the for - profit prison industry .
Militarized cops that have cut their teeth on harmless drug users will be soon be used on the American people as they turn out in the streets in response to the Greatest Depression now unfolding .

“ When it is said that nothing , including a nuclear strike , is off the table on Iran , are those who say it not also threatening genocide ? ”
– Rep. Ron Paul , May 22 , 2007
“ I do n’t think you take [ nuclear weapons ] off the table . ”
– Rand Paul on Iran , The O’Reilly Factor , May 19 , 2010
“ Rand Paul believes in a strong national defense , opposes closing Guantanamo Bay , and believes that Iran is a serious threat … . ”
– Text of Rand Paul campaign ad , March 2010 ( removed from YouTube “ by the user ” in the last 72 hours )
In September 2008 , an estimated 10,000 liberty - minded individuals crowded into the Target Center in Minneapolis , just a few miles away from the Republican National Convention .
They had staged a sort of alternative convention , a “ Rally for the Republic , ” hailing presidential candidate Ron Paul , the longtime Republican congressman from Texas , who had been excoriated by his party so badly that they had refused to let him onto the floor of the convention hall without an escort and had prevented many of his delegates from announcing their votes out loud during the Sept. 3 roll call nomination .
Paul supporters , who had swelled in numbers and had once raised $ 6 million in small donations for him in one day , were dismissed as nut - jobs and “ Paultards ” by mainstream Republicans .
His views – especially against the ongoing military operations abroad – were sneered at and dismissed as too fringe for the RNC platform .
Meanwhile , “ momma grizzly ” Sarah Palin was crowned queen of the ball , sashaying through a convention speech with a lust for the Global War on Terror matched that night only by Rudy “ 9/11 ” Giuliani himself .
How things have changed – sort of .
Today , Paul ’s son Rand is one step closer to becoming a U.S. senator , giving him a platform exceeding that of his libertarian father ’s on Capitol Hill .
This development should be a major boon for antiwar activists and civil libertarians who have long relied on the elder Paul and his “ revolution ” as a reasonable voice for non-intervention .
It is especially poignant as the military will have no less than 100,000 troops in Afghanistan by the 2010 election , and growing signs indicate that there may be more than 50,000 soldiers in Iraq beyond the imposed withdrawal deadline of August .
Congress – which has ignored the issue of war for months – will no doubt soon be called on to act , if not directly on policy , on the budget ( which has already exceeded $ 1.3 trillionsince 2001 ) .
But after months of a grueling primary , it is not yet clear where the younger Paul ’s savvy campaigning ends and his true ideological impulses begin , particularly on national security and foreign policy .
No one is entirely sure how to reconcile his more blistering critiques of the war during his father ’s campaign with his more hawkish pronouncements – particularly on Iran as “ a dangerous threat to the Middle East ” and against closing the Guantanamo Bay prison – during his own campaign .
“ All and all I think it is a positive improvement to keep electing more and more pro-liberty candidates , but those who trumpet Rand as a real liberty candidate might be disappointed when he actually gets in office , ” offers Tarrin Lupo , who publishes the LCL Report Web site .
He joins other libertarians in their skepticism of Paul ’s embrace of the Tea Party movement , including his courting of Sarah Palin ’s endorsement several months ago .
“ At a time when libertarian ideas are becoming discussed more in the mainstream , the last thing we need is to become identified with another right - wing conservative with stances so anti-freedom , ” shares writer Christine Smith , who ran unsuccessfully for the Libertarian Party nomination for president in 2008 .
But Paul ’s identification with the Tea Party movement is unabashed and certainly justified , at least politically .
First , the Ron Paul Revolution , AKA the liberty movement , AKA Campaign for Liberty , was identifying itself with the Boston Tea Party years before it came a haven for disaffected Republicans in the wake the Democratic takeover of Washington .
In a way , the Paul libertarians see these neo-patriots as finally coming over to their way of thinking , not the other way around .
But more importantly , Paul knew he needed the extraordinary momentum and muscle ( not to mention contributions ) of the Tea Party to win the closed Kentucky Republican primary ( only those registered as Republicans as of Jan. 1 were able to vote in the May 18 contest ) .
He guessed early on that some 75 percent of the current Tea Party movement did not support his father during the 2008 Republican primary .
So he ’s careful to call himself not a libertarian , but a “ constitutional conservative . ”
His frank acknowledgment that his campaign courted – and happily received – Sarah Palin ’s endorsement like a blessing from on high indicates how important it is he identify with her faction , despite their differences on war and civil liberties .
This was especially true given that he was running against the establishment Republican , Kentucky Secretary of State Trey Grayson , who had the approbation of not only Kentucky ’s senior Sen .
Mitch McConnell , but also heavyweights like Dick Cheney and plainly nervous national neoconservatives like Bill Kristol , all poised to condemn Rand for his “ neo- isolationist ” pedigree .
Indeed , Grayson and his surrogates went on the attack early last fall , leading to some surprisingly hawkish responses from Paul .
“ Foreign terrorists do not deserve the protections of our Constitution , ” Paul said in a Nov. 19 release .
“ These thugs should stand before military tribunals and be kept off American soil .
I will always fight to keep Kentucky safe , and that starts with cracking down on our enemies . ”
It can not be stressed enough how far this rhetoric diverges from the liberty movement ’s sustained view of the Global War on Terror .
Just the mention of “ foreign terrorists ” – when Paul should know by now that the majority of prisoners at Gitmo today have not been charged with any crime , much less convicted – smacks of gratuitous right - wing demagoguery .
Not to mention that the tribunals have been criticized by a growing line of respected military lawyers – not just “ kooky ” libertarians and the ACLU – on ethical , moral , and constitutional grounds .
And the Supreme Court ruled two years ago that “ foreign terrorists ” being held on American soil do have some rights – including habeas corpus , the right to question their detention in court .
Not surprisingly , Paul ’s comments and the tone of his muscular campaign ads are right in line with the Tea Party , and nowhere was this more evident than at the big Tea Party confabs earlier this year , including the National Tea Party Convention in Tennessee , where Palin brought down the roof when she said terrorists do n’t deserve constitutional rights and mocked President Obama :
“ We need a commander in chief , not a professor of law standing at the lectern . ”
In fact , if the Campaign for Liberty had n’t bussed in all those college libertarians into the Tea Party - friendly Conservative Political Action Conference ( CPAC ) in February , Ron Paul might have lost the straw poll , and he certainly would n’t have gotten the applause he did when he said during his own address that fighting wars “ so carelessly ” and telling the rest of the world what to do are “ neoconservatism , but not true conservatism . ”
The only “ national security ” this crowd wanted to talk about otherwise was the stuff Liz Cheney was dishing out : thanking the CIA for waterboarding , criticizing Obama for not waterboarding enough , and insisting the administration wants to “ bring terrorists into the United States . ”
Referring to the response of regular CPAC - goers to her group ’s antiwar stance at the three - day event , Tracey Harmon of the libertarian Ladies of Liberty Alliance ( LOLA ) , said , “ I ’ve been called unpatriotic . ”
It makes sense that Rand Paul would want to avoid a similar response in Kentucky , whose Republicans hail from a Jacksonian conservative , proud military tradition .
But Paul ’s refusal to outright repudiate or neutralize the overheated rhetoric , while indulging in it himself when it comes to right - wing hobgoblins like Iran and Guantanamo Bay , has set off some alarms .
More recently , he publicly chose sides with Israel on the politically explosive issue of Middle East peace .
This seems so oddly forced and out of place that it might only be explained as more pandering to the right wing :
“ I would never vote to place trade restrictions on Israel , and I would filibuster any attempts to place sanctions on Israel or tariffs on any Israeli goods .
“ The issue of Palestine is incredibly difficult and complex .
The entire world wishes for peace in the region , but any arrangement or treaty must come from Israel , when she is ready and when her conditions have been met .
“ I strongly object to the arrogant approach of Obama administration , itself a continuation of the failures of past U.S. administrations , as they push Israel to make security concessions behind thinly veiled threats .
“ Only Israel can decide what is in her security interest , not America and certainly not the United Nations .
Friends do not coerce friends to trade land for peace , or to give up the vital security interests of their people . ”
It all sounds too much like the last administration for some of his early supporters to bear .
Here ’s a comment from cfountain72 on a Rand Paul - related post I put up on the Antiwar.com blog May 19 :
“ As someone who did make some small contributions to Rand ’s campaign , I am torn as to what the man really stands for .
Is he indeed a non-interventionist like his father , and making some calculated moves to focus attention on areas of agreement to garner broader Tea Party support ?
Or perhaps ‘ being his own man ’ means ( unlike his father ) that he regards American intervention a necessity after all ?
While , in any case , I think he ’ll be a better Senator than his November opponent , I certainly would n’t continue to send donations to out - of - state candidates that hew to the neo - clown mold .
I pray Rand deos n’t ( sic ) fall into that trap . ”
In his favor , Paul has said repeatedly that he would cut away at the bloated military - industrial complex , including the federal procurement system , which fosters an insider racket in which behemoths like Halliburton send battalions of lobbyists and consultants to Capitol Hill each year to mold and drive defense policy and budgets .
The companies are then rewarded billions in defense contracts each year , despite , as in the case of Halliburton , numerous accusations of waste , fraud , and abuse of taxpayer funds .
Like his father , Rand does n’t believe “ we have to have troops in 130 countries and 750 bases . ”
He says there should have been a “ declaration of war ” for the operations in Afghanistan and Iraq .
While he says he would not have voted in favor of such a declaration for Iraq , he would have for Afghanistan , because “ I felt that we were attacked , and we were attacked by people [ on 9/11 ] who were organizing and plotting against us in Afghanistan . ”
But Rand does n’t talk much about the current counterinsurgency mission in Afghanistan , other than to say he “ has questions ” and there must be a “ debate ” on the course of our national security interests in Afghanistan moving forward .
Daniel McCarthy , a Campaign for Liberty scribe and senior editor at The American Conservative , hardly a nest of hawks , nonetheless cautions against a libertarian backlash against Rand solely on the basis of his primary campaign rhetoric :
“ Rand is able communicate with the quite large segment of the GOP that is not anti-interventionist , but that is anti-nation - building – the segment of the GOP that could have become dominant in the 1990s but that went dormant after 9/11 .
I think Rand himself is halfway between his father ’s views and those of the semi-non - interventionist Right of the 1990s . …
It ’s hard to say how he will vote as a senator if he wins in November – but the fact that he has made any criticisms at all of America ’s ongoing wars and has said he would not have voted for the Iraq War already distinguishes him from all the other GOP senators .
“ I think the odds are that he ’ll be better than his colleagues : if he wanted to be perfectly safe and unobjectionable to GOP voters , he would never have said anything critical about U.S. foreign policy .
No group of voters ever gets 100 percent of what it wants from any political candidate .
The question is , if you can get 80 or 90 percent , should you try to achieve that ?
If not , you are n’t in politics .
“ For my part , speaking personally and not for TAC or anyone else , I ’m willing to give Rand Paul a chance .
He wo n’t vote the way I want on every issue , but he ’ll counter - balance some of the more ideologically imperialist forces in Washington .
There ’s a pressing need for that . ”
Interestingly , the biggest howl to come out about Rand Paul ’s national security positions in the wake of his stunning 25 - point win last Tuesday – aside from spirited discussions on libertarian Facebook pages and assorted blogs – were from neoconservatives who still view Paul as a threat , despite his steroidal pro-military campaign ads and his special new friends like Palin ( whose own foreign policy gurus include the likes of Bill Kristol and Randy Scheunemann ) .
“ Rand Paul ’s victory in the Kentucky Republican primary is obviously a depressing event for those who support strong national defense and rational conservative politics .
In another year , such a victory would be a prelude to a Republican defeat in the general election , ” wrote conservative pundit David Frum last week .
Through gritted teeth , Kristol said the GOP was a “ big tent ” that could allow an energizing candidate like Rand Paul into it – but not before he took a few swipes , including one at papa Paul .
“ Paul ran a good campaign , ” Kristol told David Weigel at the Washington Post .
“ He did a good job of being less like his dad – seeming less ‘ out there ’ – so if you were a normal Kentucky voter you thought you were voting for a Sarah Palin - like , anti-Washington figure , not someone who bought into the whole Ron Paul agenda . ”
Comments like this could easily be dismissed as the bitter last throes of the Borg - like neoconservative takeover of the Republican Party post - 9/11 .
Kristol and his pals did their best to thwart both Ron and Rand Paul , so far to no avail .
But the fact that Rand Paul has identified so sharply with the Tea Party movement , stating unequivocally that he shares a “ kinship ” with Sarah Palin and that she is qualified to be commander in chief , naturally raises questions for those so dedicated to changing the course of our current foreign policy .
Everyone is talking today about Paul ’s position on the Civil Rights Act of 1964 .
I argue that the ongoing military operations of 2001 and 2003 are much more critical to the present and future health of this country .
We ’re not only talking budgets here – billions a year on defense , homeland security , and related federal expenses – but also the wars ’ larger impact on the economy , our relationship to the world , the creeping government overreach on the homefront , the tens of thousands of veterans coming home injured and ill and requiring lifetime care and benefits , the burden on our communities and families , and the vulnerability we have felt since 9/11 that never seems to go away .
Questioning where Rand Paul stands on all this is not suggesting we throw out the “ constitutional conservative ” with the bathwater .
While writer Daniel Larison insists that Paul “ is a refreshing exception to the conventional Republican attitudes on national security and war that predominate in the Tea Party , ” others would argue that his full embrace of the Tea Party ( as evidenced in his victory speech ) has effectively muddied the waters .
Will his non-interventionist impulses prevail , or will the Tea Party demand certain reciprocities for its help in winning the seat ?
In a body of 100 polarized members , will he ever be allowed to forge alliances with senators like Democrat Russ Feingold when it comes to defending liberty against warrantless wiretapping and more aggressive military action abroad – or will he be expected to lock arms with Republican hawks and anointed Tea Party leaders when such critical votes arise ?
Kentuckians deserve to know , as do all of Rand ’s outside donors , who contributed 77 percent of his campaign treasury .
If the waters are muddy , it is his responsibility to clear them up before November .

Some retailers are reporting that new PS3 250GB SKUs hitting stores include a six - foot HDMI Cable .
The new 250 GB PS3 bundle which retails for $ 349.99 ( $ 50 more than the base version ) will also pack LittleBigPlanet GOTY edition which is probably one of the best platformers on the system .
The six - foot HDMI cable will be no different than the $ 5 - $ 10 HDMI Cable available in the market as there ’s no meaningful difference in the picture quality between the $ 10 cable and the $ 50 cable .

CHICAGO ( Reuters ) - Genetic tests sold directly to consumers to help people trace their ancestry are imperfect and may lead some people to draw unfounded conclusions about their heritage , a report on the tests released on Thursday found .
More than 40 companies , including 23andMe Inc in Mountain View , California , in which Google has invested , and privately held Pathway Genomics Corp in San Diego , sell the tests to consumers .
They are not intended to provide insight into health information .
Instead , the tests give a rough estimation of a person ’s genetic ancestry .
But the growing popularity of the tests , which are not regulated , has raised some concerns among genetic experts who fear consumers are not fully aware of their limitations .
“ A major issue regarding commercial ancestry testing is that there is no quality assurance guarantee , ” according to a report led by researchers at Duke University on behalf of the American Society of Human Genetics and published in The American Journal of Human Genetics .
Joann Boughman , executive vice president of the American Society of Human Genetics , said genetic ancestry testing is very useful for understanding genetic differences in things like blood type or genetic diseases in large populations of people .
But they are less useful for individuals .
“ If you swabbed your cheek and sent your DNA off to find out what your ancestral origins are , you would get a result back saying you are 5 percent African , 12 percent European and 70 percent Asian , or something like that , ” Boughman said .
“ The question we want people to think about is , what does that mean ?
Why would I want that information ? ”
The group is concerned that consumers who get the test results might read too much into them .
“ Sometimes there are social and political and even economic implications , ” Boughman said in a telephone interview .
“ In some states in the country , you have to prove you are a member of a specific Indian tribe to have access to either land or earnings from investments even in casinos .
“ One of the ways you would supposedly be able to prove or disprove you were from that tribe is through this genetic ancestry testing , ” she said .
A negative result could mean that those genes had been lost in an individual ’s line because parents only pass along half of their genes to their children , she said .
Spokesmen for Pathway and 23andMe Inc could not be immediately reached for comment .
Boughman said genetic ancestry testing is different from direct - to - consumer genetic tests for health information , but the group has concerns about those too .
Walgreen
Co this week planned to distribute genetic health tests from Pathway Genomics in its stores , but put those plans on hold after the U.S. Food and Drug Administration expressed concerns that the tests were not approved by the agency .
The Hotel Lutetia is a beautiful belle époque building in Paris 's sixth arrondissement .
It 's a place steeped in history : Josephine Baker was a resident , and it was here that General de Gaulle spent his wedding night .
It was also here , on 26 January 2000 , that Dr Olivier Ameisen , first official physician to the prime minister of France under Raymond Barre , noted cardiologist at Cornell University , talented pianist and friend of both Nobel Peace Prize - winner Elie Wiesel and record producer Arif Mardin , received the Légion d'Honneur for his " contribution to the image of France abroad and to cardiology " .
A proud moment in a life of excellence and achievement , you would imagine , but you 'd be wrong .
Sitting in the bar of the Lutetia 10 years later , Ameisen , now 56 , recalls how he felt : " When Barre and all those guys were kissing my cheeks , I thought : ' Where are their brains ? '
I mean , when I was accepted at Cornell I looked at those guys and I thought that they were mediocre – that if those guys want me , they are idiots . "
The truth was that Ameisen , for all his successes in life , was consumed with self - loathing and shame .
He was a hopeless alcoholic – hopeless in the sense that , though he seemed able to achieve anything else he put his mind to , he could not stop drinking .
Despite running a thriving private practice in New York , in his late thirties he had become a binge drinker and by 1997 was regularly being admitted to hospital .
He tried any treatment available : tranquillisers including Valium and Xanax , antidepressants and specific alcohol medications including Antabuse and Acamprosate .
He underwent acupuncture and hypnosis , took regular exercise and practised yoga .
He attended cognitive behavioural therapy and up to three meetings of Alcoholics Anonymous a day .
But his drinking only got worse : " The more I drank to ease my anxiety , stave off panic and counter draining insomnia , the more I had to drink for the same effect . "
No longer trusting himself to treat his patients responsibly , he stopped working altogether .
Finally his doctors told him he had " at best " five years of life left .
It 's a dramatic but not unusual story .
According to the World Health Organisation , approximately two million people around the world die from the effects of alcohol each year , more than from any single form of cancer .
In the UK , government figures estimate that one in 13 people is dependent on alcohol .
For all the efforts of doctors , therapists , social workers and support groups , only a fraction of those addicted to alcohol manage to stop drinking and remain abstinent for a significant period .
It 's not extraordinary that , despite all his efforts and his obvious intelligence and commitment , Dr Ameisen failed to overcome his addiction .
What is extraordinary is that he eventually discovered a drug he claims has cured him of alcoholism and that he claims can cure all addictions , including cocaine , heroin , smoking , bulimia and anorexia , compulsive shopping and gambling .
Because that is , according to all other schools of thought , simply impossible .
The Ameisen sitting beside me in the bar of the Hotel Lutetia is as far from the popular conception of the alcoholic as it's possible to get .
Dressed in a dark blue suit and tie , tanned , relaxed and distinguished , he is very much the successful doctor , rather than the ruined drunk who was in and out of rehabilitation units and even a psychiatric ward .
As a recovering alcoholic myself , I no longer expect all addicts to be tramps , but he is certainly a good advert for his method .
The secret of his sobriety , as outlined in his book The End of My Addiction , first published in 2008 and reissued in the UK this month , is a drug called baclofen .
Formulated in the 1920s , baclofen is a muscle - relaxant more often used to treat spasticity and multiple sclerosis .
It came to Ameisen 's attention via a story in the New York Times about a paraplegic addict who found his desire for cocaine decreased when taking baclofen for muscle spasms .
Ameisen already suspected that – contrary to Alcoholics Anonymous 's belief in a physical condition with a spiritual solution , and the opinion of most therapists and even psychiatrists – the cause of his addiction might be chemical .
In fact he pinned his hopes on it .
" In the end , " he tells me , " I thought : ' I want to commit suicide . '
But I did not because I was convinced that the day I died , the next day they would find a cure .
As you 're being buried , people will think : ' You idiot – you died too early . ' "
In his search for a cure , one particular aspect of baclofen caught his attention : that it was a muscle relaxant .
He had suffered from anxiety and muscular tension all his life and was convinced it was at the root of his problem : " I knew that nothing – yoga , meditation , I 'd tried it all – could relax my muscles .
I was tense from morning to evening . "
He thought that perhaps it was the same for all alcoholics or even all addicts : " Unconsciously , as a physician maybe , I was observing people at the AA meetings and I saw the foot - tapping and the fingers going – the compulsiveness . "
Internet research seemed to confirm his hunch : in one study , baclofen was shown to have an effect on panic attacks ; in another , " obsessional thinking about alcohol disappeared " ; in a third , it suppressed the intake of cocaine in addicted rats .
All indications were that it was safe , even in high doses .
Eventually , in March 2002 , he took the plunge and wrote himself a prescription , starting low and gradually increasing his dose .
Almost at once , the effects were positive : " It controlled my anxiety better than any of the standard anti-anxiety medications .
It reduced my craving for alcohol and enabled me to remain abstinent for longer periods . "
He even found he had lost the urge to shop compulsively .
Each time he increased the dose he would feel sleepy , but this wore off after a couple of days .
That was until , in February 2004 , he reached 270 mg – a dose 150 - 190 mg above the maximum dose for most countries .
At this level , the sleepiness did not wear off , but he noticed something else : his desire to drink had gone .
" I was completely and effortlessly indifferent to it , " he wrote .
He called this the " threshold dose " and reduced it until he came down to 120 mg a day , a " maintenance dose " on which he remains to this day , occasionally topping up by 20 - 40 mg when he feels particularly anxious .
He can now even drink socially – an idea entirely counter to the teachings of AA and most other therapies .
" I became disease - free , " he says .
It seemed he had discovered a treatment that might save millions of lives and improve those of even more .
This story raises many questions , the first of which – at least for an alcoholic – is : how come I do n't know about this ?
" Well , that 's the thing , " sighs Ameisen .
" It 's exhausting . "
Naturally he wanted to share his discovery , even though to do so he would have to declare himself an alcoholic – something no practising doctor had done before .
He wrote up his experiment for publication , as a " self - case report " , and submitted it to the journal Alcohol and Alcoholism , published by the Oxford University Press .
This appeared in December 2004 but barely caused a ripple .
Unbowed , he circulated it to anyone who might have an influence .
One of these , Nobel Laureate in Medicine Jean Dausset , told him he had discovered the cure for addiction but warned him : " Medical dogma can be slow to change . "
These would prove to be telling words .
It 's not that there is much argument over how baclofen might work .
Recent advances in brain imaging have increased knowledge of the function of the pleasure and reward systems , and suggested that addiction interferes with the balance of the neurotransmitters dopamine , glutamate and gamma- aminobutyric acid ( GABA ) .
" What baclofen does is stimulate the GABA - B receptors , and you see the release of dopamine and glutamate is slowed , so the reward system is normalised , " says Ameisen .
It is even widely accepted that baclofen in low doses treats withdrawal from alcoholism , though no more effectively than several other medications .
What proved more controversial was Ameisen 's theory of the " threshold dose " , which he says is " needed to break the cycle of addictive craving , preoccupation and obsessive thoughts " and which moves baclofen from treatment to cure .
Ameisen was disappointed by the professional reaction to his discovery , but he found that potential patients were much more interested .
Alerted by occasional mentions in the press , starting with a piece in Business Week in 2005 , they began to contact him directly .
Some eventually found an addiction specialist or GP willing to prescribe " off label " – to give them the drug for a purpose other than that for which it was intended and / or at a higher dose than recommended , at the doctor 's risk .
When , after two years of attempting to work within the medical system , Ameisen decided to go round it and wrote The End of My Addiction , published in France as Le Dernier Verre ( The Last Glass ) , this process accelerated .
Small groups of addicts using high - dose baclofen began to spring up around doctors who adopted Ameisen 's ideas .
This is increasing " exponentially " , according to Ameisen : there are 60 cases in Geneva , 50 in Ann Arbor , Michigan , 40 in Chicago , and so on .
It 's reached Britain , too , with 50 already in Glasgow and others around the country .
One who followed his method was 51 - year - old Debra , who had relapsed after almost five years ' abstinence and was in a state she describes as " absolute bedlam .
The first thing , as soon as I got up , was : ' How am I going to get my drink ? ' "
Just after she 'd discovered the book on Amazon , she visited her GP and he recommended trying the treatment .
" I started on quite a high dose – 30mg in the morning , 30 at lunchtime and 40 at night – but it was n't enough to get me off immediately .
It 's not a magic pill – my obsession with drinking was still so strong .
It was once my mindset had changed and I 'd opened up ; baclofen in conjunction with really wanting to stop was when it hit home . "
After nine months , she says , " I have no cravings now . "
Similar cases are n't hard to find .
Another British patient who began taking the drug in April 2009 kept a detailed blog under the name Baclofenremedy .
Though he started on 300 mg – 30mg more than Ameisen 's threshold dose – his early entries describe a cycle of relapse , anger , self - loathing , denial and despair that is a familiar tale for any alcoholic : " At 5 am I drank six cans of beer , 3 San Miguel and 3 Gold Label , ******* idiot . "
About two months in , however , the tone changes : " I do n't have to try and not have a beer , I just do n't think about it the way I used to . "
Eventually , although his intention had been to drink " normally " , he finds himself , just like Ameisen , totally uninterested in alcohol .
" I just cannot picture [ drinking ] .
It 's like I do n't agree with it any more personally , " he writes .
Baclofenremedy 's NHS GP did not wish to be interviewed for this piece , but confirmed that he had " prescribed baclofen at above maximum dose following Dr Ameisen 's regime and that the treatment has worked very well for the one patient I have used it for " .
But not everyone can find a doctor who will prescribe the drug .
Many alcoholics and addicts have taken to buying baclofen over the internet and conducting their own version of Ameisen 's DIY treatment , exchanging information on websites such as the French alcool - et - baclofene.fr , the German baclofen - forum.com and English - language mywayout.org .
This has gathered such momentum that Dr Fred Levin , professor of psychiatry and neuroscience at Northwestern Medical School , one of Ameisen 's greatest champions and the doctor responsible for the 40 cases in Chicago , made it known on one website that he was willing to advise self - experimenters over the phone , out of hours , to ensure they treated themselves safely .
As yet , though it is increasingly widely accepted that all addictions and compulsive behaviours work on the same neurotransmitters , the use of high - dose baclofen on addictions to cocaine , heroin , nicotine or in eating disorders has not taken off in the same way .
That said , Dr William Bucknam , the addiction psychiatrist in Ann Arbor , Michigan , who picked up Ameisen 's method , counts cocaine addicts , smokers and binge eaters among the 50 he treats .
There have also been positive studies on baclofen 's effect on heroin in a 2007 Italian study , on cocaine in a small placebo - controlled trial at UCLA , California , in 2003 and on binge eating in New York and Pennsylvania in 2007 , as well as several animal tests for cocaine , heroin , nicotine and dextroamphetamine .
These can be added to studies on alcoholics , most recently Ameisen 's own , conducted on 100 patients over three months with Dr René de Beaurepaire of Le Centre Hospitalier Paul - Guiraud in Villejuif , near Paris , and published in February .
This showed 88 % either stopped drinking , regained control of their drinking or reduced it significantly , with thresholds reached at doses varying from 60 mg to 300 mg .
These are significant figures , but it 's clear , as it has been since Ameisen 's self - case report was published , that until there has been a rigorously conducted double - blind placebo trial – a test whereby both the drug and a placebo are handed out at random , with neither patient nor doctor knowing which is which – few in medicine are going to take much notice .
For that , a number of factors would need to align .
The first is funding , which would usually be provided by a drug company .
The problem here is that baclofen is an old drug ; although this means that Ameisen has been able to amass data from over 50 years ' usage , it is also out of patent , and drug companies therefore have no incentive to trial it .
And there 's no shortage of drugs being trialled for alcoholism and addiction treatment that would bring profits .
In February , Reuters reported 24 in development for alcoholism alone , while for addiction in general a 2006 piece in the New York Times said that America 's National Institute of Drug Abuse was studying 200 .
The second factor is the acceptance of the medical establishment .
Ameisen has built up a network of supporters , some of them in senior , influential positions – Jerome Posner , chair of Neuro - oncology at the prestigious Memorial Sloan - Kettering Cancer Center , and Jean Dausset , for example .
When we meet , he is about to fly to America to speak at the McLean Hospital Division of Alcohol and Drug Abuse of Harvard University , and reports on his return that they have " asked me to write them my protocol on a piece of paper , which I did , and that they will simply start prescribing " .
He has also been made a visiting professor at State University of New York which , as he points out , is " not out of charity " .
But there are doubts .
Even Professor Jonathan Chick , the Edinburgh - based psychiatrist who , as editor - in - chief of Alcohol and Alcoholism , published Ameisen 's self - case report , is cautious .
" It 's a very moving , wonderful story , as indeed is his book , " he says , " but we always have to realise in a single - case report there are factors that may be important that are n't necessarily being examined and therefore we can't conclude anything definite – for example , that the baclofen high dose made this remarkable change in him .
One needs to conduct a randomised controlled study . "
Professor Chick is treating 50 patients for alcoholism with baclofen , but not in the high doses of Ameisen 's method ; he stays within the maximum dose drawn up by the British National Formulary of 100 mg a day .
" We 've been very encouraged by patients who had failed with previous attempts to abstain from alcohol who with baclofen have remained abstinent , " he says .
" We 're not saying they 've been cured for life ; I do n't think it 's possible to say that .
Professor Ameisen might say that we have n't used sufficiently high doses . "
And he is currently unwilling to go above the 100 mg dose : " I do actually have some concerns about unwanted effects in larger doses .
I do n't want to give details to you – this is all rather provisional .
This is a drug which is active in the brain , and there are concerns about some unwanted effects of higher doses in a very few people . "
For Ameisen , this is a frustration .
" In the nearly 50 years that baclofen has been prescribed , including at high dose – much higher than Dr Chick 's maximum – I challenge you to find any report of any side effect that was severe or not reversible within 24 or 48 hours .
Trust me , had there been one such report , I would have been demolished since 2004 . "
Ameisen has not hidden the fact that baclofen can have side effects , particularly if not managed properly , including sleepiness ( or somnolence ) , dizziness , nausea , violent dreams , headaches and bouts of depression , or that sudden withdrawal is unsafe .
He has also stated that : " No medication works effectively for everyone , and baclofen is surely no exception . "
With no official figures and many taking it without medical supervision , it 's impossible to assess baclofen 's success rate accurately .
There 's also no definitive way to measure success : anecdotal evidence suggests that those who do n't achieve abstinence stop taking the drug because they find the side effects off - putting , and who 's to say they would n't eventually have been cured if they had continued ?
" So far it seems to work in all types except for one , " says Ameisen , " and that 's people who turn up once and do n't come again .
But it 's not one size fits all ; you have to refine it .
Not to say that I 'm a great doc , but every time I 'm on the case I 've yet to find a patient where it 's not a success .
I 've been playing with this medication for 10 years . "
The miracle - cure aspect of the treatment has certainly provoked some addiction experts , though .
In December 2008 , for example , Dr Nicholas Pace , a clinical professor of medicine at New York University , told ABC News : " I have studied alcoholism for the past 40 years , and there is no single magic bullet .
This is a complex disease , and you can't just flip one switch .
The idea that an alcoholic can drink socially is simply a lot of bull . "
This kind of reaction , says Ameisen , comes from feeling threatened .
" When you question a dogma , you 're very vulnerable , " he says .
" People in the field feel stupid .
The animal data was there for 30 years – I did n't invent this .
I used a model ; I did what they should have done . "
Plus , he says , " if baclofen works , then their specialism is going to fall apart .
There are those who want trials to be blocked – it's not good for their business . "
An alternative reason might be that they 've heard claims like this before .
Since the 1990s , several drugs introduced to treat alcoholism , such as Antabuse , Naltrexone and Campral , have proved disappointing .
Before then , barbiturates , benzodiazepines such as Valium and antidepressants such as Prozac were each hyped as an end to addiction .
In 2007 , Prometa , a treatment for methamphetamine , alcohol and cocaine , was launched with claims of an 80 % success rate but no double - blind testing , and was shot down almost at once .
Around the same time , ibogaine , a psychoactive substance used in African ceremonies , was hailed by a senior member of the American National Institute on Drug Abuse as the most promising anti-addiction medication he had seen , but has since been connected to 12 deaths .
So when Dr Fred Levin said in April that " virtually every patient I 've ever [ treated with high - dose baclofen ] has gotten well " , it sounded too good to be true .
As he said himself : " All of us in medicine are very sceptical when someone says something has approximately 100 % success rate . "
One psychiatrist I spoke to , who wished to remain anonymous because of his own alcoholism , told me : " There 's been the emergence in the past few years of a number of drug therapies for alcoholism which are promising .
But if you rated them on a level from one to 10 , where 10 was ' complete cure ' and 0 was ' does n't work at all ' , most of the drugs in psychiatry are about 3 or 4 , and drugs for addiction are more like a 2 or 3 , or even 1 and 2 .
So anyone who insists that one of these medications is a wonder drug , a panacea or a cure , he probably has either got the patent for the medication or is trying to make a name for himself . "
Ameisen has filed a patent application , but for " prevention of relapse on baclofen " .
He says this was solely to block rehab centres from doing so , and that he is dropping it because it is " costly and useless " .
Though he could have done so , he says , he never applied for a patent for his treatment .
There is also the question of whether a drug that you take for ever – the " maintenance dose " – is a cure at all .
Ameisen says that the correct equivalent is a drug for high blood pressure or diabetes , but this might be questionable if there is always the option of " topping up " , as when he says : " I sometimes think of alcohol and I take a pill and within 30 , 40 minutes it 's gone . "
" ' Whatever works ' is my response , " says Julian Keeling , a therapist with Tony Adams 's Sporting Chance Clinic and a former drugs counsellor at Wandsworth Prison , " but there is the idea of taking a drug in order to come off a drug .
There 's a parallel with methadone , which I was on , a heroin substitute that has a much longer half - life and much less euphoria , so your life stabilises .
It does n't address underlying issues , though , and most people do n't tend to destroy their life with alcohol and drugs unless they 've got some fairly pronounced emotional disturbances that they 're trying to escape from and medicate . "
Could this attitude be due to the general acceptance that the 12 - step programme and therapy are the treatment for addiction ?
Ameisen insists that his cure would not replace therapy or AA – " On the contrary , it will make all these programmes more effective " – but a medical cure would make AA , with its ideas of " defects of character " and " amends " , seem like ancient superstition .
" If I find a drug that works for me then I 'm going to be psychologically addicted to it even if I 'm not physically addicted to it , and it will do for me what I feel I ought to be doing for myself , " says Keeling .
" It 's like that Louis Theroux documentary about medicated children : on the one hand , if you had a nightmare kid , why would n't you put him on Ritalin ?
But you look at it and some part of you says it 's wrong .
But do I have that reaction because I have a puritan view of medication due to 12 - step brainwashing ?
I do n't know . "
As an addict , it 's hard to decide about Dr Ameisen 's treatment .
Would I take it ?
Should I take it ?
Part of me – no doubt the part that has seen lives turned around in just that way – believes that Ameisen might have been able to recover with Alcoholics Anonymous alone .
He says : " If someone managed through willpower to quit drinking , then great – he probably has something smaller than I had , because I was unable .
Every disease has mild and severe cases – some people get the flu and die ; some get it and do n't even notice . "
He may well be right – I 'd certainly agree he had ( or has ) it worse than me .
But AA is based on surrender , on suppression of the ego and a very old - fashioned leap of faith ; Ameisen found his cure through his refusal to surrender , listening to his ego , and through science .
The problem is that science needs proof .
The End of My Addiction : How One Man Cured Himself of Alcoholism by Olivier Ameisen ( Piatkus Books , £ 9.99 ) is published on 13 May

The original stated that Olivier Ameisen is currently 57 .
This has been corrected .
An excellent article by Meena Kadri at the Design Observer Group offers a tour of the new Bus Rapid Transit ( BRT ) system in Ahmedabad , India .
While North Americans argue about whether Bus Rapid Transit can substitute for rail , the developing world is building a lot of both .
India , though , made an early commitment to BRT for its second - tier cities and corridors .
Indian public policy is always intensely focused on the country ’s issues of poverty and economic opportunity .
So many people need improved mobility that the government is strongly encouraged to choose whatever tool will create the most urban mobility for the least cost .
So while a rail transit program is underway for the busiest corridors in the biggest cities — where capacity needs require it — a massive investment is being made in Bus Rapid Transit .
What ’s most encouraging is that they ’re taking the speed and reliability needs seriously .
An early project in Pune was too compromised , as often occurs when you try to take away street capacity for a project that nobody understands yet .
Pune ’s facility was only partially exclusive , so the ferocious scouring force of Indian traffic ultimately carried the day and defeated much of the project ’s purpose .
I worked for a bit on a BRT project in Visakhapatnam in 2008 , and it raised fascinating issues .
When we first toured the proposed corridor , our first reaction was “ Whoa , this is way too narrow !
Where are you going to put BRT here ? ”
Lined with street vendors , as many Indian boulevards are , the street seemed to have only space for four narrow lanes of traffic .
( “ Lane , ” of course , is an abstract concept in India , where vehicles vary dramatically in width and thus find different sorts of lanelike spaces to suit their need . )
But our guides pointed out a wall of permanent buildings lying well behind the vendors .
That , they explained , is the edge of the street right of way .
All the street vendors are engaged in “ encroachment . ”
The word may sound bureaucratic but it nicely captures the barnacle - like gradualness and persistence with which life will press into any available space .
The edge of the Indian street is a dynamic negotiation between the needs of transport and the needs of commerce .
Pedestrians , of course , must walk along the battle - line of this enduring conflict .
So one thing the BRT program was going to do is sweep all these merchants out of the way and restore the original width of the street .
( The merchants would be looked after , however ; considerable budgets are set aside to manage “ social impacts ” from capital projects . )
But then we had to consider how the entire street could operate with BRT down the middle .
How would we manage access ?
Would pedestrians flow across the boulevard at random , or would we try — against all the natural forces of the Indian street — to force them to use signalised crosswaks ?
We also had to decide on raised platforms , with high - floored buses , or low platforms with low - floor buses .
I ’ve always preferred the latter , because they can run through onto non-busway segments and because a high - floored bus is hard to evacuate if you have an emergency away from a station .
But South American experts have enthusiastically pushed the high - floor option .
It ’s cheaper , and this really matters in India .
It also implies high - floor stations that are a bit more visually prominent and thus a little less vulnerable to commercial “ encroachment . ”
If you share the North American activist view that BRT is just a front for people who want to build more roads , a Indian BRT project will probably push that button .
It was clear , for example , that while city leaders were still not sold on BRT — it was funded and promoted by central government — they really liked the idea of reclaiming the full width of their street .
This would create room for BRT plus two lanes of traffic , and would also create space for a “ slow vehicle lane ” for low - speed one - gear bicycles and human powered rickshaws .
Safety , of course , was the rallying cry .
Indian streets can be really dangerous , especially for exposed humans , so we faced the usual irony : A street that separated pedestrians from cars would definitely improve the safety of pedestrians and other pedestrian - speed traffic , even though it would mean the cars would be able to drive faster .
The cruel fact of life is that pedestrians are a form of traffic calming .
Motorists really try hard not to hit them , and this keeps them from driving as fast as they otherwise would .
One of the most interesting challenges was encouraging our Indian clients not to buy too much technology .
Indians are usually good at figuring out the cheapest way to do things , but like almost everyone they do like technology for its own sake .
I tried at one point to talk them out of buying automatic ticket machines .
Labor is so cheap that every bus has a conductor as well as a driver , so there ’s just no need for them .
Indian BRT is an interesting example of a point that I ’ve often raised in bus -rail discussions .
Why exactly should we spend more on a nicer , more comfortable technology when we can provide the same mobility with a cheaper one — and thus extend the product further , into more territory , serving more people ?
North American readers often resist the obvious point that a cheaper unit cost means you can build a larger network , partly because they doubt that cost savings would really be spent that way .
In India it ’s much clearer .
You have a billion people and not much money .
So build big , extensive networks , by choosing the lowest - cost product that meets your standards for civilized space .
The Ahmedabad BRT does have new buses — not fancy but functional , with the same next - stop information ( visual and announced ) that you ’d expect in Europe .
The BRT lane seems to be sufficiently protected from disruption .
But it ’s still cheap , and that means it can take you further than a more expensive technology would do .
Yes , BRT has much worse emissions than rail , and eventually some sort of carbon trading system will make that problem bite .
But right now , Indian planners are looking at the advent of the new Tata Nano , a $ 2000 car designed to be affordable to the poorer families who currently get around , dangerously , on motorbikes .
The cities do n’t have room for all those cars .
So there ’s some urgency to getting good transit built in India , and on that score their priorities make sense .

One such example , " asdf " converted into morse code is .- ... -.. ..-.
If you take the .'s and convert them to 0's and take the -'s and convert them to 1's , you get the binary number of 010001000010 , which is 1090 in decimal .
The year 1090 just happens to be 2 years after Christodoulos of Patmos , supported by Emperor Alexius I Komnenos , founded the monastery of Saint John the Theologian on Patmos .
Only * 4 * years after the year 1090 AD ...
The First Crusade ( 1095 - 99 ) captured Jerusalem ; and the Latin Kingdom of Jerusalem begins .
Now because the Crusade on Jerusalem happened only a short time after the crucial year 1090 , we can convert the letters ASDF into the ancient hebrew alphabet , and we get Aleph Daled Samech ( because of the differences in alphabets , these might not be accurate translations ) .
We take the letters , and convert them into one word .
Alephvovdaledsamech -- which converted phonetically sounds like " A lef volv da leads a mech " .
We can then read these sounds into words , and we get " A left Volvo does leads a mech . "
Going further , we get " A left Volvo does lead the mechanics " , or " A left Volvo does lead the mechanical industry " .
We can then read into it , that a " left Volvo " , obviously a car made in a country where you drive on the left side of the road , will one day lead the mechanical , or automobile industry .
Ford Motors Inc. must have found out about this information before I could disclose it to you -- for they just bought Volvo .
Ford is obviously trying to change this age - old Hebrew prophecy , and claim the winnings for themselves !
Turkey has banned multiple Google services , according to reports , including Google Translate , Google Docs , and Google Books .
But Mountain
View believes the ban is accidental , a side effect of Turkey 's longstanding ban on the Google - owned YouTube .
According to the International Business Times , Turkey ’s Telecommunications Presidency has released a statement saying said it has banned many Google IP addresses , but it did not provide reasons for doing so .
The statement said that some addresses are completely inaccessible while others are merely slow to load .
Reports claim problems with Google AppEngine , FeedBurner , AdWords , and Analytics as well as Google Translate , Google Docs , and Google Books .
Apparently , the ban began on June 4 .
But Google tells
The Reg that it believes these services were banned accidentally and that it 's working with the Turkish government to solve the problem .
" We have received reports that some Google applications are unable to be accessed in Turkey , " reads a statement from the company .
" The difficulty accessing some Google services in Turkey appears to be linked to the ongoing ban on YouTube .
We are working to get our services back up as soon as possible . "
Turkish authorities have continuously blocked access to YouTube since May 2008 , after users uploaded videos that insulted the Turkish republic 's founder , Mustafa Kemal Atatürk .
And the government previously banned the video - sharing site on at least three other occasions .
Apparently , the first ban , in 2007 , was a response to a parody news broadcast in which Greek football fans taunted the Turks by saying : " Today 's news ; Kemal Atatürk was gay ! "
Under Turkish law — Law 5651 — the courts can shut down a website of it attacks Atatürk or incites suicide , paedophilia , drug usage , obscenity , or prostitution .
The original video was taken down , but prosecutors have since objected to countless other videos insulting Atatürk .
Whether accidental or not , free - press outfit Reporters Without Boarders condemned Turkish authorities for extending the ban beyond YouTube , as it has long criticized the YouTube ban .
“ It is time the Turkish authorities demonstrated their commitment to free expression by putting an end to the censorship that affects thousands of websites in Turkey and by overhauling Law 5651 on the Internet , which allows this sort of mass blocking of sites , ” Reporters Without Borders said .
“ The censorship of YouTube in particular seems to be an archaic form of control , one that prevents Turks from accessing Web 2.0 ’s potential ... [ this ] trend has been accentuated by the current problems in accessing other services provided by Google , which are widely used by Turkish Internet users . "
The Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe ( OSCE ) estimates that about 3,700 websites are “ blocked for arbitrary and political reasons ” in Turkey , including foreign websites , sites aimed at the country 's Kurdish minority , and gay sites .
Meanwhile , Bloomberg reports that Turkey ’s communications minister has called on Google to register as a taxpayer in the country , saying this would hasten a move towards lifting the YouTube ban .
“ The company should open a representation , ” Transport and Communications Minister Binali Yıldırım said on Tuesday .
“ You Tube is a taxpayer in 20 countries , and we want them to do the same in Turkey . ”
Google tells us that it does not operate servers in Turkey , but that it will work with the government to resolve this issue .
" Google complies with tax law in every country in which it operates , " reads another statement from the company .
" We are currently in discussion with the Turkish authorities about this , and are confident we comply with Turkish law .
We report profits in Turkey which are appropriate for the activities of our Turkish operations . " ®

Many people struggle with hatching chicken eggs and puzzle about why they are not hatching .
Hatching eggs is not always an easy thing and even poultry producers do not have a 100 % success rate .
Below are the common problems people experience when trying to hatch chicken eggs .
Normally
Chicken eggs take about 21 days to hatch .
If you have a chicken egg that is more than 24 days old , it will not hatch .
Other species of bird eggs take longer or shorter .
Grocery Store Eggs
Sometimes people think they can buy eggs from the grocery store and hatch those .
It will never happen for several reasons .
Firstly the hens that lay the eggs are not exposed to roosters , as such the eggs are not fertile .
Secondly the eggs are collected immediately after being laid , and refrigerated , as such even IF they were fertilized , a chick could not possibly survive , as normally they must be incubated at warm temperatures .
Not Fertile
As mentioned above hens lay eggs whether or not a rooster is present .
Even if a rooster is kept with the hens , not necessarily will all the eggs be fertile , older roosters , or ones who have health concerns , will not have mated with the hens .
The same will happen when the rooster to hen ratio is off and there are too many hens for the rooster .
With a rooster the typical fertility rate can be from 55 % - 95 % , and even then not all of the fertile eggs are likely to hatch .
See below on How to Candle an Egg .
Hen did n't Sit
Not all hens will sit on their eggs long enough to keep them warm .
Some chicken breeds are known for being “ broody ” , meaning they are more likely to raise chicks , while other breeds only sit in the nest long enough to lay an egg then walk away .
Typically a broody hen will lay several eggs before she starts sitting on them .
Rather than using a broody hen to hatch eggs , one can use an incubator .
photo source
Hens who are broody will only get off the eggs for a few minutes to eat and drink .
Incubation Problems
Hatching eggs requires some very specific measures .
The temperature must be perfect , the humidity must be perfect , the eggs must be turned at the appropriate time , and they must be carefully positioned .
Temperature –
This must be kept between 99.5 F and 100 F at all times , if temperatures are too high or too low for very long , the embryos will die and will not hatch .
Humidity – Humidity effects the development of the air bubble inside the egg and must be correct towards the time when the chick is ready to hatch or problems will develop .
Each Incubator will have a feature for keeping the air inside it at proper humidity , typically water is put in a small cup .
Turning – Eggs must be turned two or three times a day in order for the chick to develop , however turning must stop in the last 3 days of incubation .
The easiest way of remember if eggs have been turned , or how far to turn them is to mark both sides , one with an X , and one with an O ( or similar markings ) .
Some incubators are self turning , others will require a human to turn the eggs .
Position –
The eggs should be carefully placed so that , while they are on their side , the larger egg is slightly higher than the more pointed end .

* How to Candle an Egg
To check if an egg is fertile one can “ Candle ” it after it has been incubated ( either by a hen , or in an incubator ) for about 3 – 4 days .
This is done by putting a bright lightbulb in a box with a whole cut to allow some light out .
The egg is held over the hole and if a cloudy area can be seen it is chick developing , if it is clear and the light passes through evenly , then the egg either was not fertile or the growing embryo has died .
Some people will recheck again at 7 days , in fact you can candle them safely at any time but may not want to risk dropping them .
You may even be able to see a network of veins developing if your light is strong enough .
* Eggs should not be out of the incubator for more than ½ hour .
As you get more familiar with candling , you may note some problems ( such as bacteria grown in side eggs ) can also be seen , but as a general rule a clear egg after 7 days does not hold a growing embryo and should be discarded , until you are familiar with other problems keep any egg showing anything else for up to 24 days .

Let 's get this straight .
An ad attacks a Republican candidate for governor in Alabama , Bradley Byrne , for the horrible crime of defending the teaching of evolution .
Byrne lashes back , stating
As a member of the Alabama Board of Education , the record clearly shows that I fought to ensure the teaching of creationism in our school textbooks .
Those who attack me have distorted , twisted and misrepresented my comments and are spewing utter lies to the people of this state .
The nerve of some people to make such horrible accusations .
But wait !
As Talking Points Memo observes
, the ad that made that scurrilous charge that Byrne might have a bias towards reality has an important back story :
The group behind the ad and others attacking Byrne 's conservative credentials is called the True Republican PAC .
Interestingly , as the Montgomery Advertiser reported last month , the PAC has gotten most of its money from the teachers ' union -- or , more accurately , from a collection of other PACs heavily funded by the union .
According to the Advertiser , members of the Alabama Education Association have a beef with Byrne for his past attempts to ban the employees of two - year colleges from serving in the state legislature .
Emphasis mine .
So does this mean the teachers of Alabama support an attack on a political candidate for not being a creationist ( an attack that sadly is not even true ) ?
Is anybody standing up for science in Alabama ?
If you walk out of Jerusalem Old City through its south - eastern gate and on to the perimeter road encircling it , you will most likely see several large coaches with elderly western tourists climbing out of them .
You will see them stand at the low wall at the edge of the road and peer down into the lush valley with its pretty houses that nudge and lean against each other .
The tourists may notice the woman marking exercise books on her sunny terrace , they may smile to see the bright - haired four - year - old riding her tricycle round the yard .
Some of them will think of a favoured grandchild back in Kansas or Ottawa .
Now , if this were a scene in Italy , Spain , or even Turkey , we might have left it there : the tourists come , stare , spend money and go .
But here their effect is devastating – and most of them do n't even know it .
For the town that nestles here , in this valley on the southern flank of Jerusalem , is Silwan , home to some 55,000 Palestinians , annexed by Israel along with east Jerusalem in 1967 , and currently one of the hottest spots in the contest between the rights of the Palestinian townspeople and the plans that Israel has for the area – plans put into effect through a series of administrative measures , clandestine coalitions , and progressive - sounding projects .
None of which could work without the funding that floods into Israel from the west .
What do the tourists know of this ?
These gentle , grey - haired folk have come here , on their Jewish National Fund coaches , to visit the archaeological dig for Ir David , the City of David , which , it is claimed , lies below the Wadi Helweh neighbourhood in Silwan and justifies the digging , the shafts and the tunnelling going on in the belly of the hill and under the homes of the people who live here .
Maryam puts aside the exercise books : " This road , from Jerusalem all the way down the valley , was a main road .
People did good business here , if you had an ice - cream shop , a cafe , a barber , food shops , souvenirs .
Then Elad came , the City of David Organisation ; they take the people into their centre and they never see us . "
Silwan , and particularly the beautiful Wadi Helweh – the Valley of Sweet [ Water ] – has always welcomed strangers .
Traditionally , it has been the last resting spot for travellers approaching Jerusalem from the south and a favourite recreation area for Jerusalem 's residents .
People would come here for picnics , and in summer the cool caves of Ein Silwan spring were a much - loved playing space for children .
Even now people ask if I am visiting Silwan for a shammet hawa , a breath of air , though there is hardly air to breathe with the dust and the noise Elad is generating .
Elad is an acronym in Hebrew meaning " To the City of David " .
Dedicated to " strengthening Israel 's current and historic connection to Jerusalem " , it was founded in 1986 by David Be'eri , who , " inspired by the longing of the Jewish people to return to Zion " , left his elite army unit to set it up .
For a long time Elad refused to reveal the names of its funders ; eventually they submitted the names but successfully requested they be kept under privilege .
Lev Leviev and Roman Abramovich have been present at Elad events .
Elad set up a two - pronged strategy : to strengthen Israel 's " connection to Jerusalem " they started to dig – under Silwan and into the land under the al - Aqsa mosque – for the biblical City of David and to create the Ir David tourist site .
[ See footnote ]
They called it " salvage excavation " to avoid getting official permits .
The " salvage " has lasted for more than 10 years and Wadi Helweh 's houses have started to sink into the hill .
To help " the Jewish people to return to Zion " , in 1991 Be'eri started to acquire Palestinian property ( supported by Ariel Sharon , then minister of construction and housing ) .
His target was principally two Silwan neighbourhoods : Wadi Helweh and al - Bustan ( the Garden ) .
The Abbasi family 's home , with its nine apartments and two warehouses , was Be'eri 's first target .
Be 'eri's wife , Michal , has described how he acquired it : " Davida 'leh took a tour guide card and put in his picture , and for a long time he would take bogus tourists on a tour . . . and slowly he befriended Abbasi . . .
Of course , it was all staged . "
In 1987 , Elad pressured the government to declare the Abbasi house " absentee property " and in October 1991 , Be'eri led a settler invasion of the house with the intruders singing and dancing and waving the Israeli flag on the roof at daybreak .
The Abbasi family went to court and the Jerusalem district judge found " no factual or legal basis " for the takeover ; indeed , he found it characterised by " an extreme lack of good faith " .
Yet still the property continues to be caught up in legal proceedings and Elad people continue to live in it – and to acquire more Palestinian property : to date Elad has gained control of a quarter of Wadi Helweh .
What is happening in Silwan is not unique ; it is part and parcel of what is happening across Israel and the Occupied Palestinian Territories .
Only the specific tactics are different .
Before I came to Silwan , I had been travelling in the West Bank for a week , noting how every Palestinian community has its appointed settlement , its stalking " other " .
There is hardly anywhere you can look up and not see a settlement lowering at you : bristling with barbed wire and flags and antennae and cameras and floodlights and – although you can't see them – arms .
Most scholars agree that , to this day , no evidence of the presence of Kings David or Solomon has been found at the site .
But our group of elderly American tourists are spellbound by the stories they are hearing from Elad 's guides , stories which are conjecture , projection and myth .
" I found a Byzantine water pit , " Professor Ronny Reich of the Israel Antiquities Authority says .
" They [ Elad ] said it was Jeremiah 's pit .
I told them that was nonsense . "
But for a long time the guides would tell the tourists that this was the hole Jeremiah was thrown into .
Close to half a million visitors come here each year and are treated to the Elad version of history .
Professor Binyamin Ze'ev Kedar , chair of the Israel Antiquities Authority Council , wrote in 2008 : " The Israel Antiquities Authority is aware that Elad , an organisation with a declared ideological agenda , presents the history of the City of David in a biased manner . "
None of this activity would have been possible without the support of the Israeli state .
An Israeli activist tells me : " If you ask the Israeli government what is happening in Silwan , they say it 's not a government matter ; these are private people buying and moving in legally .
But now [ the east Jerusalem settlement of ]
Nof Zion is being built .
The Zoning laws permit building there only on 37.5 % of a piece of land .
But Nof Zion has permission to build on 125 % of the land !
And inside Ras el - Amoud , above Silwan , they are building five - storey apartment blocks for settlers .
But they refuse to allow Palestinian families to build a third floor on their house .
A settler organisation buys a police station from the government .
A bus line in Ma'ale Zeitim is diverted to serve a settlement .
In Silwan , the City of David Organisation is telling the archaeologists where to dig and what to look for .
So one has to ask the question with regard to the City of David Organisation and the state of Israel : which is the tail and which is the dog ? "
A critically important study by the independent monitoring organisation , Ir Amim , reaches the same conclusion : " Elad , which is officially a private organisation , serves as a direct executive arm of the government of Israel , and enjoys comprehensive and deep backing by the Israeli administration . "
More chillingly , Doron Spillman , Elad 's director of development , has said : " . . .
We are almost a branch of the government of Israel , but without getting buried under government bureaucracy . "
The main government project right now is for Jerusalem .
And in Silwan and Jerusalem , on 12 May , Jerusalem Day , the day I visit , you can see it clearly .
This morning , Silwan is blockaded by the police , and it's on alert .
The settler , security , police and army vehicles racing up and down the roads are quietly monitored by the neighbourhood watch people .
In the cafe at the bottom of the valley , three young men wipe tables and stock the fridge while keeping an eye on the jumpy young security guard who patrols in front of them .
" These are private security for the settlers .
They do n't go anywhere without them .
They cost around 50 m shekels a year .
And they 're paid for by the government .
Out of taxes , " says one of the young men .
" And the security are protected by the police , and the army 's always round the corner .
Just think what it 's costing . "
On the eve of Jerusalem Day celebrations , prime minister Binyamin Netanyahu said : " Jerusalem is our city and we never compromised on that , not after the destruction of the First Holy Temple , nor after the destruction of the Second . . .
There is no other nation that feels this deeply about a city . "
Now , in the pleasant afternoon , I stand in the Solidarity Tent in al - Bustan with two men whose homes are among the 88 threatened with demolition to make way for an " archaeological garden in the spirit of the Second Temple " .
" So they distribute bits of paper that say that since King David used to go for walks here , it 's wrong that our houses should be here and it must just be a park .
You notice that for them he is King David but for us he is el - Nabi Daoud : David the Prophet .
So who holds him in higher esteem ?
Plus there 's no evidence he ever walked here , " says one .
" And what if he did ?
It was empty .
You know , there 's one thing we 've held against our parents , our grandparents : that they left their land .
They thought they'd be back in a couple of weeks .
We do n't have the excuse of ignorance .
We are not leaving .
And my children will not wash the dishes in their national park , " says his friend .
In Silwan and Jerusalem , the conflation between settler rightwing ideology , government policy , big money , real estate interests and bad taste produces its unique blend of kitsch and nightmare .
Under cover of excavation , massive infrastructure work is done in Wadi Helweh in preparation for the construction of a 115,000 sq m commercial centre , without a town plan scheme and without permits .
The work stops only when it comes up against the foundations of Palestinian homes .
" The streets cave in , " says one of the men .
" You see that darker stretch of tarmac ?
We had to patch up the road .
And the school : the floor of the classroom collapsed under the girls .
Fourteen girls fell 2 m into the tunnel they 'd dug below the school .
And we had to hush it up because they would have said the school was unsafe and closed it down . "
The Israeli military barricade continues to block Silwan 's high street .
In Jerusalem earlier , I had seen thousands of young people who had been bused in from the settlements stream through the streets .
Military police with guns and flack - jackets guard them .
The Old City is closed – except to them .
Women trying to take their children home are turned away from the gates of the city .
Men carrying briefcases sit on raised pavements .
More soldiers watch from the ramparts of the old city walls .
From time to time the police come up to us : " You speak Hebrew ? " No . " You speak English ? " Yes .
" Back !
Move back ! "
A man standing next to us says maybe they want us to back off all the way to Spain .
" Where are you from ? " he asks me .
Egypt. " Cairo ? " Cairo .
" May God forgive Cairo , " he says .
Darkness settles .
The Palestinian residents of Silwan feed their kids and hush them .
They visit each other , chat , watch the news .
In the cafe at the bottom of the hill the young men are courteous but not chatty .
On their TV screen Alan Curbishley talks about the match that 's about to start : the final of the Europa Cup .
The young men keep one eye on the screen , the other , vigilant , is on their town .
On the ledge above their heads , but hidden from their view , is the stage set up by Elad , with its " Lion of Zion " banners .
And we can hear the amplified voices celebrating the three Israelis each being awarded the $ 50,000 " Lion of Zion " Moskowitz award for deeds that " deal with the challenges facing Israel in the fields of education , research , settlement , culture , security and more " .
From the al - Aqsa mosque further above comes first the call for evening prayer , and then , for good measure , the Chapter of the Merciful : " Which then of our Lord 's signs do you deny ? "
The lights in the Palestinian houses dot the hillside and the trees around the small cafe where I sit are also strung with fairy lights .
In a layby 20 m away an Israeli army personnel carrier stands poised , its blue lights flashing .
The Palestinians sense that Israel has moved from ihtilal to ihlal ; from occupation to replacement , and that making life unlivable for Palestine 's Palestinians is the prelude to transforming Palestine itself .
This is what the money coming from the west will achieve .
To see the future projected for Jerusalem , you need only visit the spanking new Jewish Quarter .
Go into the Temple Shop and buy teatowels and doilies and puzzles featuring the Third Temple rising out of al - Haram al - Sharif in place of the Dome of the Rock .
In this approaching future it will be impossible to look out at the landscape and think of continuity , or eternity .
In place of the old , mellow stone , of the interdependent structures , softened and polished by time , there will be the jagged and the new and the fake .
In place of trodden paths along the valleys and children playing freely , there will be chairlifts and viewing points and fast food outlets and always , always the iron gates and the security checks and the ticket kiosks and the merchandising .
In place of the thousands of stories laid down over the ages above , below and around each other , there will be one story – and it wo n't , actually , be the Jewish story , because the Jewish story in Jerusalem is indivisible from the Roman , the Byzantine , the Arab , the Muslim , the Christian .
It will be a fake .
Like the fake inscribed prayers or mezzuzas the settlers carve into the Arab houses when they take them over .
Soon , in Jerusalem , if the world does not wake up , there will be one voice : the crash of the cash register .

A version of the following clarification was scheduled for publication in the Guardian of 4 October 2010 regarding the phrase in the article above saying that the tunnelling goes " under Silwan and into the land under the al - Aqsa mosque " .
There are five archaeological projects in Silwan ; of the five , the closest runs about 75 m from the southern wall of the Temple Mount , as it is known to Jews and Christians , or al - Haram al - Sharif , as it is known to Muslims , upon which the mosque stands .
SEOUL ( Reuters ) - North Korea said on Sunday it was ready for direct military talk with South Korea to discuss the sinking of one of Seoul ’s warships , but only if the armistice commission overseeing the Korean War truce does not get involved .
South Korea has accused the North of sinking the Cheonan , and killing 46 sailors , after a multinational investigation concluded that a North Korean submarine had torpedoed the corvette , an incident that has ratcheted up tensions on the peninsula .
North Korea has denied involvement , saying the investigation was a fabrication .
It has also threatened military action if it is punished by the United Nations for the incident .
South Korea said this week it has not given up on trying to persuade the U.N. Security Council to adopt a resolution against North Korea over the navy ship ’s sinking .
“ If the South Korean authorities respond to our proposal , we will promptly come out for a working contact for the opening of the military talks , ” the North ’s official KCNA news agency said .
“ The U.S. forces side should no longer meddle in the issue of the North - South relations under the name of the ‘ UN Forces Command ’ , ” it said .
A multinational team from the U.S. - led United Nations Command is probing whether North Korea violated the Korean War armistice by sinking the Cheonan , a probe the North has denounced as a “ bogus mechanism . ”
North Korea ’s military has proposed sending a team of military inspectors to review the multinational investigation into the Cheonan ’s sinking , but South Korea has rejected that call and demanded the North make an unconditional apology and a pledge to end provocations .
President Barack Obama said after meeting South Korean President Lee Myung - bak on the sidelines of the Group of 20 leaders in Toronto that the North will face consequences for the incident , pressing for a Security Council condemnation .
( PhysOrg.com ) -- Researchers at Virginia
Tech are using science to control unstable components in biomass to develop stable oils that can be readily upgraded to transportation fuels for the first time .
Biomass comprises recently living organisms such as wood or waste products .
Converting woody feedstocks - in this case , poplar and pine wood - to liquid fuels usually produces bio-oil that is unstable and acidic , and which cannot be converted to transportation fuel using traditional processing technologies .
According to Foster Agblevor , associate professor of biological systems engineering in the College of Agriculture and Life Sciences , these bio-oils present further problems .
The oils become thicker during storage , resulting in a substance that turns to char when heated .
These bio-oils are unusable for fuel after only a few months in storage .
Agblevor and his research team are working to produce stable bio-oils with the potential to be converted to biogasoline .
Other researchers include S. Ted Oyama , the Fred W. Bull Professor of Chemical Engineering in the College of Engineering at Virginia Tech ; Francine Battaglia , associate professor of mechanical engineering at Virginia Tech ; Ronald McClung , research scientist for BASF Inc. ; and Michael T. Klein , dean of the College of Engineering at Rutgers University .
They have been working on the research for three years .
The team ’s work is based on a theory that by looking at the three unstable components of biomass - cellulose , hemicelluloses , and lignin - and controlling them separately can cause the overall product to become more stable .
Thus far , the Virginia Tech - led team has developed catalysts that produce stable bio-oils that can be stored for at least one year without significant increases in viscosity .
Agblevor believes this is the first stable biosyncrude ever produced .
“ We will be able to move from where we are now to making transportation fuels from biomass without doing complicated processes that have been done in the past , and if it ’s pursued aggressively , we should see biogasoline on the market soon , ” Agblevor said .
The research overcomes several hurdles by turning biomass into transportation fuels that can directly replace fossil fuels .
The research shows a potential pathway toward lowering carbon emissions while using domestic biomass resources to produce sustainable energy for vehicles .
“ I think [ creating biogasoline in existing refineries ] can be done sustainably and cost - effectively within three years if the research in this area is funded , ” Agblevor said .
Agblevor is looking at the entire production cycle to understand how the current fuel infrastructure could play a part .
“ My rationale is that instead of trying to build a new biorefinery that will cost millions of dollars , this process can use existing petroleum refineries and make them green , ” he explained .
This new bio-oil could be processed in traditional petroleum refineries , which would leverage existing infrastructure .
The next step for Agblevor ’s team is to develop a pilot test that will transform biomass materials directly into transportation fuels as evidence that this solution works .
“ We are now working on moving forward with developing a demonstration where you ’ll see wood coming in one end and , out of the other , we ’ll see gasoline , ” he said .
“ This should get everyone very excited . ”

It was a feather in the cap of pro-boycott activists , but for Israelis , a major setback .
Image by Getty Images Both Sides Now : Paul McCartney ( 1 ) played before Israeli audiences , and Elton John ( 3 ) still is scheduled to perform .
But Elvis Costello ( 2 ) and Gil Scott - Heron ( 4 ) have joined the cultural boycott of Israel .
Carlos Santana ( 5 ) canceled a large concert in Israel due to ?unforeseen scheduling conflicts .?
With battle lines drawn across concert halls and stadiums hosting rock bands , the decision by mega-star Elvis Costello to cancel his planned concerts in Israel is being viewed as a game changer .
In a statement posted on his website , Costello described his decision as a “ matter of instinct and conscience . ”
Israel ’s culture minister , Limor Livnat , responded by saying that Costello “ is not worthy ” of performing in Israel .
The movement for a cultural boycott of Israel has increased its activity in recent years , strategically targeting selected artists who are scheduled to perform there .
Until recently , the campaign has had limited success .
It failed to dissuade musicians Paul McCartney and Leonard Cohen from giving concerts in Israel , but took pride in positive responses from several authors and poets .
Numerous other stars , such as Madonna , have been unmoved by the cultural boycott campaign , performing successfully in Israel even recently .
But Costello ’s action is the first open endorsement of the boycott movement by an A - list artist in protest of Israel ’s policies in the occupied West Bank and of its siege of Gaza .
In a detailed statement , the performer argued that he could not perform in Israel because by doing so , “ it may be assumed that one has no mind for the suffering of the innocent .
“ One lives in hope that music is more than mere noise , filling up idle time , whether intending to elate or lament , ” Costello wrote in his statement .
He suggested that his decision had been complex and difficult .
“ I must believe that the audience for the coming concerts would have contained many people who question the policies of their government on settlement and deplore conditions that visit intimidation , humiliation or much worse on Palestinian civilians in the name of national security , ” he wrote .
“ I am also keenly aware of the sensitivity of these themes in the wake of so many despicable acts of violence perpetrated in the name of liberation .
“ I offer my sincere apologies for any disappointment to the advance ticket holders as well as to the organizers . ”
In reaction , a music industry insider confirmed that the winds could be shifting .
The music executive , who spoke on condition of anonymity in light of his ongoing business ties with artists , said that in recent months he had approached more than 15 performing artists with proposals to give concerts in Israel .
None had agreed .
The contracts offered high levels of compensation .
He called them “ extreme , big numbers that could match any other gig . ”
Another successful boycott campaign was directed at poet and performing artist Gil Scott - Heron .
Shortly after announcing his plan to perform in Tel Aviv on May 25 , Scott - Heron , who is known for his political activism , was blasted by supporters of the boycott movement , who called on him to cancel his visit .
Scott - Heron ’s April 24 concert in London was disrupted by pro-Palestinian protesters , and at the end of the show , he announced the cancellation of his Tel Aviv tour .
A letter sent to Scott - Heron by more than 50 pro-boycott groups and artists praised the decision as a moral one .
“ You have chosen to stand on the right side of history , ” the letter stated .
Scott - Heron ’s progressive views and his outspoken political stands have made him a prime target of the boycott movement .
Organizers explained that they have been focusing on artists who they believe could be open to the idea of culturally boycotting Israel .
“ Obviously , we ca n’t target everyone , so we single out those who we think will be more responsive and open to the issue , ” said Hannah Mermelstein , a spokesperson for Adalah - NY : The New York Campaign for the Boycott of Israel .
But the groups are also going after other performing artists whose planned concerts in Israel are expected to sell tens of thousands of tickets .
Currently , the focus is on singer Elton John , who is scheduled to perform in Tel Aviv on June 17 .
A video clip circulating on the Web shows a takeoff on Elton John ’s 1976 hit “ Sorry Seems to Be the Hardest Word . ”
The parody replaces the song ’s original lyrics with a call to cancel the planned show : “ Always seems to me that boycott seems to be the hardest word . ”
The song criticizes Elton John for performing in South Africa during the apartheid era and claims that Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu is using gay tourism to Israel as part of the country ’s rebranding campaign .
The clip urges John not to “ let Bibi use you as his gay Band - Aid . ”
Other high - profile artists being targeted are Bob Dylan , who plans to give a concert in Israel at the end of May , and Joan Armatrading , who is scheduled to give two shows in the first week of June .
But in the battle over public opinion , many other names have also been thrown into the debate .
These include artists who either scheduled concerts in Israel or indicated their wish to perform there , but who later withdrew without providing reasons for their decisions .
Such is the case of guitar legend Carlos Santana , who had planned a stop in Israel as part of his tour of Europe and the Middle East .
Thousands of tickets to the concert , which was scheduled to take place in a large soccer stadium in Jaffa , had already been sold before Santana and his group announced that the concert had been canceled due to “ unforeseen scheduling conflicts . ”
The Israeli daily Yediot Aharonot quoted unnamed sources from the Israeli production company organizing the concert as saying that Santana had been under “ pressure from anti-Israel figures ” to cancel the visit .
Another no -show is rapper Snoop Dogg , who pulled out of a planned performance in Israel due to “ contractual difficulties . ”
It is not clear in this case whether the decision was a response to pressure to boycott Israel or the result of slow ticket sales .
Boycott , Divestment and Sanctions activists , however , have included these artists in a list of musicians who declined to perform in Israel , hinting that their decision to cancel was driven by political considerations .
Mermelstein , the Adalah - NY spokesperson , said that even when artists officially cite logistical reasons for canceling their shows , it could still be a sign that they are responding to boycott calls .
“ Most mainstream artists are not yet making public statements in support of BDS , but the movement is becoming a consideration , and artists are thinking twice before performing there , ” she said .
Some artists have come out clearly in support of the boycott and have declared their refusal to appear in Israel .
These include mainly poets , authors and scholars rather than performing artists .
Indian writer Arundhati Roy , British novelist John Berger , poet Adrienne Rich , director Ken Loach , and author and activist Naomi Klein are among them .
BDS activists in the United States stress that by calling on artists to boycott Israel , they are following demands from Palestinians on the ground who believe that this is an effective way of pressuring Israel .
The movement also has supporters in Israel .
Ofer Neiman , a Jerusalem activist , said the purpose is to show that occupation “ has a price tag attached . ”
He rejected the notion that having leading artists come to Israel in order to express their disagreement with the government ’s policies would be more effective than boycotting .
“ How many people have taken [ rock musician ] Roger Waters ’ anti-occupation statements to heart when he played here in 2006 ?
The main thing people remember is that he performed here , ” said Neiman .
Despite recent successes of the boycott movement , Israelis still face a full slate of concerts and performances this summer .
Elton John , Rod Stewart , Rihanna and the Pixies are among those confirmed to play in Israel .
Also in the works are plans to host MTV ’s annual summer party , one of the music channel ’s top productions , in Tel Aviv .

Guillermo Del Toro has quit as director of the two The Hobbit movies , but will still help write the screenplays for the Lord of the Rings prequels .
" In light of ongoing delays in the setting of a start date for filming The Hobbit I am faced with the hardest decision of my life , " the Mexican filmmaker said in a press release .
" After nearly two years of living , breathing and designing a world as rich as Tolkien 's Middle Earth , I must , with great regret , take leave from helming these wonderful pictures . "
Del Toro and producer Sir Peter Jackson said they remained committed to the films and would do everything they could to satisfy fans .
Del Toro said he would be first in line to see the finished films .
" I 've been privileged to work in one of the greatest countries on earth with some of the best people ever in our craft and my life will be forever changed .
" The blessings have been plenty , but the mounting pressures of conflicting schedules have overwhelmed the time slot originally allocated for the project . "
Jackson told fan website TheOneRing.net : " We feel very sad to see Guillermo leave The Hobbit , but he has kept us fully in the loop and we understand how the protracted development time on these two films , due to reasons beyond anyone 's control – has compromised his commitment to other long term projects .
" The bottom line is that Guillermo just did n’t feel he could commit six years to living in New Zealand , exclusively making these films , when his original commitment was for three years .
Guillermo is one of the most remarkable creative spirits I ’ve ever encountered and it has been a complete joy working with him . "
Jackson told TheOneRing .net that he would discuss options for a new director with MGM this week .
" We do not anticipate any delay or disruption to ongoing pre-production work , " he said .
The Hobbit films have been plagued by delays , and have not yet been greenlit by the studio , MGM , which is having financial troubles .
At a press conference last week , del Toro said : " It 's not greenlit . "
" That 's categorical ...
We 've been caught in a very tangled negotiation ...
There can not be any start dates until the MGM situation gets resolved .
They do hold a considerable portion of the rights .
" We have designed all the creatures .
We 've designed the sets and the wardrobe .
We have done animatics and planned battles sequences ...
We are very , very prepared for when it is finally triggered . "
Reports emerged late last year that MGM was " teetering on bankruptcy " and Del Toro said due to those issues the Lord of the Rings prequel had been caught in a " tangled negotiation " .
Jackson last month dismissed rumours that the Hobbit movies been delayed due to production problems , insisting the project was still in its early stages .
He told Moviefone.com : " Well , it 's not really been delayed , because we 've never announced the date .
I mean it 's sort of interesting because the studio has never greenlit The Hobbit , so therefore The Hobbit has never been officially announced as a ' go ' project , nor have we ever announced a date . "
There have also been discussions about shooting the prequels , which are due to be released in 2012 and 2013 , in 3D .

The past couple days we ’ve featured some DC Comics posters .
Well , today we ’ll tackle some Star Wars posters !
I ’ve owned many more Star Wars posters than just these over the years , but the following are still in my possession .
Tomorrow we ’ll finish up our poster coverage with some other films , some Marvel comics , television , and other geeky posters .
Please feel free to share any of your favorite posters in the comments !
The image on this first poster was done by Boris Vallejo and has been reproduced a number of times .
This poster states “ Collector ’s Edition ” , but I honestly have no idea what they are referring to .
Perhaps the poster itself , perhaps a re-release of the film , who knows .
Regardless , it ’s a pretty sweet looking poster !
The next four are movie theater one - sheets .
A one - sheet is a type of poster sent by a film company for theaters to use in advertising .
They are typically larger than regular posters and are two sided .
The front has the image you are promoting , the flip side has the same image reversed so it looks good when lit from behind in a theater poster case .
The images used below for Star Wars , Empire Strikes Back , and Return of the Jedi are not actually my own photos .
I had to use somebody else ’s photos because my one - sheets are framed and the glass is too reflective for photography .
Here is the one - sheet for Star Wars – Special Edition in 1997 .
I was working for AMC Theatres at the time and was totally thrilled to have the Star Wars films playing in my theatre .
Regardless of how I felt about some of the changes , seeing Star Wars on the big screen again was AMAZING !
Next up is The Empire Strikes Back – Special Edition one - sheet .
Interesting to note is that the poster lists February 21 , 1997 as the release date .
That was the original plan , however , the Star Wars – Special Edition was selling so well at the box office they delayed the release of The Empire Strikes Back – Special Edition until the following week , February 28 , 1997 .
As I mentioned above , I could n’t use photos of my own one - sheets for this post because of the reflection off the frames .
So the poster below does n’t exactly match mine .
My Return of the Jedi – Special Edition one - sheet lists a release date of March 7 , 1997 .
Similar to the release of Empire , Return of the Jedi – Special Edition was delayed a week so it actually came out on March 14 , 1997 .
Next up is a teaser one - sheet promoting Star Wars Episode I : The Phantom Menace .
There were several teaser one - sheets promoting this film , but this is my favorite .
If you have n’t noticed already , check out Anakin ’s shadow on the wall .
The next five mini-posters were made available after purchasing a LucasArts video game called Star Wars : Force Commander .
I thought they were fun propaganda posters so I ordered them .
I liked the AT - AT poster so much I cut off the bottom and hung it on my wall for many years .
The next two posters are Photomosaics by Robert Silvers .
The image itself is made up of tons of tiny little images .
When you step back far enough , you can see one image created from all the others .
Click each image to enlarge .
Come back tomorrow when we finish up our poster coverage with some other films , some Marvel comics , television , and other geeky posters .
Abstract :
Climbing a mountain is strenuous and hazardous , but the view from the top can be spectacular and makes it all worth while .
There is a clear analogy with mathematics .
In both cases one has to train properly , collect the right tools and gear , practice on the lower slopes , examine maps and do some background reading .
After that it is a matter of hard work , patience and skill .
I will look back on my 60 years of mathematics , describing what views I have seen from the heights and what challenges lie ahead for the next generation .
There are many more mountain ranges to explore .
Electronic Empire : Orientalism Revisited in the Military Shooter
by Johan Höglund
Abstract
Through use of Said 's concept of Orientalism , this article examines how a set of military computer games set in the Middle East construct this location within its game space .
Initially , the article addresses the problem of the realistic and the real in these games .
The discussion then centers on the relationship between these games , the War on Terror and the US invasions of Afghanistan and Iraq .
In connection to this , the article pays particular attention to what has been styled the Military Entertainment Complex ( Lenoir , 2003 ) or , alternatively , the military - industrial - media - entertainment network ( Der Derian , 2001 ) .
The article concludes that , as a part of the Military Entertainment Complex , the games under scrutiny render the Middle East as a site of perpetual war and enlist , both through their marketing strategies and through game semiotics , the gamer as a soldier willing to fight the virtual war and even support the ideology that functions as the games ' political rationale .
Keywords : American empire , computer games , first - person shooter , game studies , military shooter , Orientalism , perpetual war , US imperialism , war - on - terror
Introduction
One does not need to be a student of computer games to notice that one of the most successful game genres at the moment is the military shooter .
The Medal of Honor , Call of Duty and Battlefield series span virtually all systems and consoles , assuring that the military shooter keeps attracting new gamers and generating increased revenue for the game producers .
Furthermore , since the arrival of the first first - person shooters ( FPS ) , this genre has attracted the attention of actual military organizations .
One of the most interesting conversions of the seminal FPS Doom was Marine Doom . [ 1 ]
Primitive as the first military shooters were , the computer generated game space allowed for a new type of simulation where the practicing soldier was able to interact with other soldiers and with computer generated enemies on screen .
Marine Doom was soon released to the public letting not only soldiers but anyone in possession of the original computer game to play the modified , military training scenario of the modification .
Marine Doom takes place in a non-descript game space where the objective is the destruction of an enemy bunker .
Since Marine Doom lacks fire - breathing demons and the imaginative environment of the original Doom game , it can undoubtedly be considered as more realistic than the original .
However , Marine Doom still lacks the sophisticated graphics and physics needed to create a believable game world .
Since then , the military shooter has evolved and game producers , commercial as well as military , are now able to set the action of the game or simulation within realistic environments that render spaces reminiscent of Normandy during the 1940s , Vietnam in the sixties or , most importantly for the present study , the Middle East during the beginning of the twenty - first century .
The Middle East has arguably been the focus of American economic and military interests since the end of the cold war , and the purpose of this study is to examine how a set of military computer games construct the East within its virtual game space .
This discussion first deals partly with the problem of realism and reality in computer games .
I will then move on to discuss the relationship between these games , the War on Terror and the US invasions of Afghanistan and Iraq .
In connection to this , I will pay particular attention to what has been styled the Military Entertainment Complex ( see Lenoir , 2003 ) or , alternatively , the military - industrial - media - entertainment network ( see Der Derian , 2001 ) .
In relation to this , I will introduce and discuss the concept of neo-Orientalism .
This concept can perhaps best be described as a discourse that in military electronic entertainment is characterized most importantly by the construction of the Middle East as a frontier zone where a perpetual war between US interests and Islamic terrorism is enacted .
Neo -Orientalism in American culture has been studied and discussed within disciplines such as Post - colonial studies and Cultural Studies .
Unfortunately , these disciplines address digital entertainment without any regularity and seldom venture into computer gaming .
[ 2 ]
Game Studies , by contrast , tend to focus on the semiotics and technology of computer and video games , often ignoring the political dimensions of the complex narrative and virtual environment that make up the gaming experience . [ 3 ]
From this perspective , the present study is an attempt to discuss the military shooter as precisely a computer game ( rather than just any for of popular culture ) , but with the aid of a set of theoretical tools normally associated with Cultural Studies .
The point of this is not to suggest that the methodological arsenal of Cultural Studies is better or more relevant when studying computer games than that traditionally employed by Game Studies , but rather that the two fields may benefit from such a methodological transgression and perhaps even that it may be unnecessary to insist on differentiating between Cultural Studies and Game Studies ; both disciplines , to the extent that they are two disciplines , ultimately serve to interrogate the remarkably diverse landscape that is contemporary culture .
Orientalism Revisited
To understand the relationship between Orientalism and the military shooter , it is necessary to first examine where the concept comes from and how it may inform the study of contemporary computer games .
In Edward Said 's seminal text Orientalism , Orientalism is most pertinently described as a " Western style for dominating , restructuring , and having authority over the Orient " ( Said , 1978 , p.3 ) .
Orientalism is thus a " distribution of geopolitical awareness into aesthetic , scholarly , economic , sociological , historical , and philological texts " ( Said , 1978 , p.12 ) .
In other words , Said defines Orientalism as a discourse - with reference to Michel Foucault - a discourse that through journalism , literature , academia and politics , encouraged , legitimized and even enabled or produced the British domination of great portions of the East .
Today , America holds a position strikingly similar to that held by the British Empire of the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries .
Claims have been made both by the critical left and by the approving , neoconservative right that America , in fact , constitutes an empire . [ 4 ]
The British historian Niall Fergusson , for example , argues fiercely that the " United States is an empire " ( Fergusson , 2004 , p.10 ) in Colossus : The Price of America 's Empire , while neoconservative historian and political writer Max Boot confidently declares that " U.S. imperialism has been the greatest force for good in the world during the past century " ( Boot , 2003 , p.1 ) .
These assertions furthermore suggest that US imperial practice is surrounded by the same kind of political , historical and cultural discursive framework as surrounded the British Empire .
In other words , it is possible that the bid for a New Global American Century is accompanied by an American - style Orientalism , an Orientalism that legitimizes US foreign policy in the Middle East in the same way that British Orientalism made British colonial policy both possible and agreeable to the British and European public .
There are ongoing efforts to investigate this possibility .
One of the most thorough studies on American Orientalism within popular culture is Epic Encounters by Melani McAlister ( 2001 ) .
McAlister , writing before the ascendancy of George W. Bush and before 9/11 , argues that American culture is characterized by " a new version of Orientalism , one that revitalizes , in a more subtle form , the insistence that fixed cultural differences must structure the organization of political power " ( McAlister , 2001 , p.12 ) .
In the wake of the War on Terror and the invasions of Afghanistan and Iraq , there may be reason to suspect that the American version of Orientalism has grown more insistent and permeated American cultural and political life even further .
As I will argue in this paper , the military shooter is one form of popular culture that appears to precisely insist that fixed cultural differences must structure not only political power but military as well .
That computer games help disseminating a new form of Orientalism was furthermore recently suggested by Vít Sisler in the article " Digital Arabs : Representation in Video Games " , a wide - ranging study of more than 100 computer and consol games .
Under a chapter heading named " Orientalism in the digital age " , Sisler describes how most western game designers produce games that either " construct a ' fantastical ' Middle East , using quasi- historical elements in order to give the player an oriental impression " or , in military action games , routinely represent the Arab as a terrorist and Islamic extremist who laugh mockingly after they have succeeding in killing an American soldier ( Sisler , 2008 , pp.207-8 ) .
Sisler 's conclusion is that while western game producers insist on stereotyping and Othering the Arab , the digital game as a medium has the potential to transcend this stereotyping just like any other cultural form .
While eminently useful and thorough , Sisler 's examination of military action games suffers somewhat from the tremendous scope of his study as he is only able to devote a few pages to this genre .
The Military Shooter
Any serious student of electronic entertainment is well aware of the fact that digital entertainment travels further and is accessed by more people than most other forms of culture , more than academic writing , more , perhaps , even than broadcast and printed news media .
Even more poignantly , popular culture in general and computer games in particular , to a greater extent than academic writing and news media , can be bought and doctored to suit a particular political agenda .
Because of these qualities , electronic popular culture is singularly well - posed to construct and produce the world we live in .
In fact , David Leonard , as one of those who emphasize the political content of electronic games , has argued that computer games constitute the most influential conveyor of discourse and ideology in contemporary American society : " video games - more so than schools , religion , or other forms of popular culture - are teaching Americans about race , gender , sexuality , class , and national identity " ( Leonard , 2004 ) .
Because of this , and because of their popularity , electronic games are , again in the words of Leonard , " sophisticated vehicles inhabiting and disseminating ideologies of hegemonies " ( Leonard , 2004 ) .
In other words , it would appear necessary to study computer games as vehicles that disseminate the ideologies of hegemonies .
Anyone interested in how race , ethnicity , gender and national identity are constructed in the West , and how these constructions also enter non-Western discourse , needs to pay attention to all forms of electronic entertainment and perhaps to computer and console games in particular .
The study of the military shooter , its content , narrative and spatial strategies as well as its economic and political relations , shows this need clearly .
The games that I will pay particular attention to are : Americas Army ( U.S. Army , 2002 ) , Kuma \War ( Kuma Reality Games , 2004 ) , Close Combat : First to Fight ( Destineer , 2005 ) , and Full Spectrum Warrior : Ten Hammers ( Pandemic Studios , 2006 ) .
Figure 1 .
The un-uniformed terrorist enemy rears his head to invite the gamer 's sniper fire in Full Spectrum Warrior : Ten Hammers .
These four games all belong to the genres Military Tactical Shooter or military shooter .
What they all have in common is that they render a game space before the gamer that is reminiscent of an actual , modern battlefield .
To be precise , Close Combat , America 's Army : Special Forces , Kuma \War and Full Spectrum Warrior all take place , partly or completely , in the Middle East .
Thus , the game spaces rendered by these games reveal the architecture and the iconography of a ( usually generic ) Islamic nation and the people the gamer , playing as an American soldier , encounter are dressed as the stereotypical Arab .
Sometimes this Middle Eastern setting is presented as Iraq or Afghanistan ; sometimes the games takes place in an imaginary locale such as " Zekistan " as is the case in Full Spectrum Warrior : Ten Hammers .
Figure 2 . The Middle Eastern terrorist of Close Combat : First to Fight as seen in the game trailer .
Note the defiant expression , the stereotypical beard and the red turban .
Regardless of whether these games take place in a fictional nation or in a supposedly authentic state , they all purport to be both realistic - meaning essentially that the game environment and its physics appear authentic before the gamer 's eyes - and real - meaning that the narrative that the gamer becomes part of is historically and ideologically accurate .
[ 5 ]
To separate these terms is crucial when discussing the way the military shooter represents the Middle East .
To claim that a game is realistic means essentially that the game space the gamer enters looks , sounds and feels authentic .
A realistic Middle East in the military shooter is a world that appears to obey the same natural laws as the universe our physical bodies inhabit ; people cannot fly or walk through walls , when shot a person falls down , bleeds and is either injured or dead .
The notion of a real Middle East is much more problematic , partly from a technological perspective , but most importantly from a political and theoretical point of view .
To argue that a game is real is to suggest that the game space they render corresponds to what we would find in the Middle East should we go there .
More importantly , it is also to suggest that the action of the game , the game 's narrative ( to use a somewhat controversial term within Game Studies ) and its ideological and political rationale correspond to a material , ideological and political reality that can be located in the real world .
In other words , for a game producer to suggest that a particular game it is realistic is not necessarily problematic .
It merely means that the game appears life - like .
To propose that the game is real is problematic as this means that what happens in the game may also happen , or has happened , in reality and that the ideological and political rationale of the game is similar to the world we inhabit with our physical bodies .
Figure 3 . Photography is intermingled with computer graphics in the game Full Spectrum Warrior : Ten Hammers .
Note the mazelike appearance of the Arabian battleground behind the two American soldiers .
From this perspective it is interesting that the four games of this study focus on the creation of a game space that is at the same time very realistic and real .
Indeed , most of the games are certainly realistic : when shot in the left shoulder , a body will fall back , pivoting to the left , the weapons used by soldiers and terrorists look like and perform very much like their real - life counterparts , vehicles will also look and drive like real military vehicles and objects can be moved around , stood on , used for shelter or shot to pieces .
What is interesting , however , is that the games are also marketed as being real in the sense that they tell stories - or allow the gamer to take part in actions that are , or could be , true .
This claim is made partly because all four games have been developed in close cooperation with military personnel , and partly because they deal precisely with military violence in the Middle East - something the American , as well as the global , citizen encounters routinely through CNN and other American broadcast news providers .
Figure 4 . The action in Full Spectrum Warrior :
Ten hammers is framed and explained by the narrative of news - reporter Jared Stevens who accompanies the group on missions and explains the constant carnage the gamer participates in .
Thus , the makers of America 's Army claim to immerse the gamer in the everyday reality of the US army , arguing that the " game provides civilians with an inside perspective and a virtual role in today 's premier land force : the US Army .
The game is designed to provide an accurate portrayal of Soldier experiences across a number of occupations " ( America 's Army webpage ) .
Furthermore , Close Combat : First to Fight is advertised as : " an authentic , team - based first - person shooter created under the direction of active - duty United States Marines fresh from the front lines of combat in Iraq and Afghanistan .
Set in a modern mid-eastern urban battleground , players lead a four - man Marine fireteam through the perils of modern urban combat " ( Close Combat webpage ) .
Close Combat is thus a game that boasts the involvement of actual Marine veterans fresh out of the fighting in Afghanistan and Iraq in its production .
The game as such is technologically advanced , allowing the player to enter a meticulously modeled Middle Eastern setting .
As a member of a small team of elite soldiers , the role of the player is to flush out and neutralize local forces .
The player moves his or her team carefully through the streets of a bombed out , anonymous Middle Eastern city , scanning windows and doors , on the lookout for the red turbans that some of the swarthy enemy soldiers inanely sport on the top of their heads .
When the enemy has been engaged , the carnage is fast , furious and remarkably realistic .
Figure 5 . The Middle Eastern play / battle ground of Close Combat : First to Fight as seen in the game trailer .
The gamer is invited into a labyrinthine game space where the only interaction possible is relentless military violence .
In a similar way , Kuma \War also portrays itself as a game that is not only realistic , but which also re-enacts real and actual battlefield events .
Through playing the game , you get to participate in presumably historically accurate events that were recently on the news .
Thus , as a player of Kuma \War you get to re-enact the capture of Saddam Hussein , or invade his residential palace and assassinate his sons .
In this way , Kuma \War does not propose to situate the player in a fantasy world , but in a historically accurate , and therefore real , environment and the game is , not surprisingly , marketed with the slogan " Real war news .
Real war games " ( Kuma \War webpage ) .
To further enhance the feeling of accuracy and realism , these games are marketed with the help of elaborate home pages and television advertisements which stress their relationship to the ongoing military conflicts the US is involved with .
In addition to this , most games also use a number of ploys to make the gameplay experience seem more real .
For example , the mission assignments of Kuma \War , downloaded from the Kuma \War website , are accompanied by actual news photography of US soldiers in Iraq .
The missions are also explained with the help of fake news reports which clarify the event the player is about to be confronted with , while also outlining the moral stakes of this event .
In addition to this , Kuma has enlisted the retired major general Thomas Wilkerson who explains the action and the tactical problems facing both US forces on the ground and the gamer who is about to engage in this allegedly real mission .
When it comes to graphics and detail , Kuma \War is not state of the art .
Therefore , the thrill is finally not in how realistically the environment is rendered , but in its presumably close approximation to news stories carefully picked from American news media .
The interplay between the realistic game space , the news flashes reminiscent of CNN and Fox News and White House press briefings , allows the makers of Kuma \War to think about their product as something other than a game .
An article in Wired explains that Kuma 's chief executive Keith Halpern " sees his company not as a hyperrealistic competitor of Nintendo , but a highly interactive alternative to CNN " ( Werde , 2004 ) .
That Kuma indeed perceives a direct link between their game space and reality is further explained in an interview in the San Francisco Chronicle where Halper argues that " We do n't really see ourselves strictly as making games … We use game technology , but in a news - like way , and telling the stories of US soldiers and others through that .
...
For many of our customers , gaming is the main way they pick up on the news anyway " ( Halper quoted by Freeman , 2005 ) .
In other words , Halper is arguing that Kuma \War is news .
Halper 's both striking and provocative notion positions the gaming experience not primarily as entertainment but as an actual confrontation with history and the real world .
In other words , as far as Halper is concerned , Kuma \War recreates a historically and ideologically actual space , allowing the gamer / newshound to access and partake in this reality .
The claim that it is possible to re-create or accurately describe reality is problematic under any circumstances .
For the manufacturer of a military computer game based on the US news media 's description of the occupation in Iraq to make this claim borders , perhaps , on the absurd .
From the perspective of the gaming community though , the relationship between these games and reality is not necessarily perceived as a problematic one .
Thus , it may well be argued that Halpern is saying essentially what Leonard argues in an already quoted passage , that " video games - more so than schools , religion , or other forms of popular culture - are teaching American 's about race , gender , sexuality , class , and national identity " .
However , to Halpern this is not a problem , but rather a natural consequence of the digital revolution .
From this perspective , it is important to keep in mind that when these games claim to be real , this claim has more to do with the historical and ideological content than with the games ' capacity to render a life - like version of the Middle East .
The question that needs to be addressed is therefore what kind of game space these games actually produce and what kind of narratives they construct .
Perpetual War and Neo-Orientalism
When discussing the games from this perspective , it is necessary to stress two aspects of Orientalism as Said describes it .
The first is the fact that Orientalism essentially conjures an imaginary space , a space that finally produces the East in the minds of a Western audience .
The second thing that needs stressing is that Orientalism both then and now is intimately connected with economic and military practice .
In many ways , British Orientalism enabled the colonization of the East .
Similarly , American neo-Orientalism appears to justify and even encourage and produce American military and economic practices in the Middle East .
To return to the games in question , and to look closely at the Middle East they render , it should be clear that this space is very one - dimensional in a metaphorical sense , despite being created by sophisticated 3D - engines .
This one - dimensionality is not a feature peculiar to the military shooter .
As Human Geographer Stephen Graham has remarked in " Cities and the ' War on Terror ' " , " Arab cities … have long been represented by Western powers as dark , exotic , labyrinthine and structureless places that need to be ' unveiled ' for the production of ' order ' through the ostensibly superior scientific , planning and military technologies of the occupying West " ( Graham , 2006 , pp.256-257 ) . [ 6 ]
A crucial aspect of this representation is that as long as the Arab city remains essentially Arabic , it will continue to attract the military technologies of the West , thus turning the site into a locale of perpetual war .
The only way for the Arab city to cease drawing perpetual military attention is to cease being Arabic and transform itself into an ordered , western - style capitalist democracy .
Figure 6 . American soldiers prepare to head out into a bombed - out , labyrinthine urban landscape .
The game map that follows is often confusing and forces the gamer to lead his or her group of soldiers through cramped alleys and into dark houses .
Perfectly in line with the tradition of representation described by Graham , the games discussed in this article render or construct the Middle East as a perpetual military frontier where the conflict between American democracy and Islamic fundamentalist terrorism is acted out indefinitely .
The notion of perpetual war , first outlined by George Orwell in his classic 1984 ( 1948 ) , suggests that it is in the interest of government that certain wars do not stop .
Not only does a perpetual war fuel a nation 's ( war ) industry indefinitely , it also allows the beleaguered nation to believe that the hostile ( but never finally defined )
Other is being perpetually contained .
Lately , the concept of perpetual war as such has been examined by Tony Cliff ( 1957 ) , and in relation to American hostilities in the Middle East by critics like Noam Chomsky ( Chomsky , 2003 ) .
With this concept in mind , the gamer involved in a military shooter set in the Middle East is forever performing this strategic containment of the Other .
Furthermore , if there is a difference between the representation of the Arab city in the military shooter and that found in other forms of ( popular ) culture , it is that in these games the labyrinthine and perilous city is the only geography the gamer encounters .
From the perspective of the gaming experience , the Middle East remains forever a space where Americans can participate in an everlasting War on Terror .
Through reducing the Middle East to a perpetual frontier within this game space , war is effectively transformed from an extreme and unusual measure to a state of normality .
In other words , in the military shooter , warfare as performed by American soldiers in the Middle East ceases to be a politically problematic and expensive confusion of resources and instead appears to be a part of the natural order .
In the end , this effectively conveys to the gamer that continuous warfare lends safety and cohesion to society rather than destabilizing the world . [ 7 ]
In a similar way , the populations of the Middle East are relegated to terrorists in most of these games .
While friendly units sometimes show up and participate in fighting the terrorists , for the most part the only interaction possible between the soldier of the gamer and the computer generated people of the Middle East is that of military violence .
The gamer has the option of either shooting the approaching enemy or ceasing to play .
For this necessary conflict to be realized within the game , and in order to avoid the moral issues tied to urban warfare , the Middle Eastern city must be transformed from a teeming habitat into a childless and ( often ) womanless territory occupied primarily by terrorist guerrillas .
Having thus skirted one of the crucial questions of modern warfare - collateral damage - the gamer need not hold his fire , but can engage in never - ending warfare .
It should be pointed out here that the construction of the Middle East as a site of perpetual war is a result of the gameplay itself .
While the narrative of the games encourages an understanding of the Middle East as a site for everlasting military carnage , it is the game experience as such which cements it .
When discussing the notion of American neo-Orientalism , this representation of the Middle East is crucial .
By rendering a virtual Middle East as a frontier inhabited primarily by male terrorists where the American military ( and by invitation of the gaming industry , all subjects with a reasonably modern computer ) can engage in a cleansing and perpetual war , the world finally begins to resemble the one outlined by George W. Bush shortly after 9/11 , a world where the only way to " defeat terrorism as a threat to [ the American ] way of life is to stop it , eliminate it , and destroy it where it grows " ( Bush , 2001 ) .
In this way , it can be argued that these games do not dramatize the invasions of Iraq or Afghanistan , but rather the War on Terror as defined by Bush after 9/11 .
This is not surprising , partly considering the impact that Bush 's interpretation of 9/11 has had on American society , but more pertinently in view of the fact that some of these games were not only developed with the help of the military , they were also partly funded by this institution .
The Military Entertainment Complex and the Military Shooter
While war is perhaps best considered the very opposite of entertainment , as most who have experienced it up close would probably agree , war has proven to be a supremely marketable commodity within the entertainment sector .
Partly as a result of this , and partly as a development of what Eisenhower styled the Military Industrial Complex , the Military Entertainment Complex or the military - industrial - media - entertainment network has made its appearance in the form of Hollywood war films , war toys , books , television shows and , of course , military shooters .
Eisenhower worried that the merger of the federal military agencies with private industrial enterprise might pose a threat to continued peace and felt that the potential influence of this alliance must somehow be curbed .
The Military Entertainment Complex is perhaps best seen as evidence that the United States has failed in controlling this influence .
The Military Entertainment Complex , then , is essentially the merger between the Military Industrial Complex and the entertainment industry , a merger that has spawned Hollywood films , television series and most recently the computer games I address in this paper .
Kuma \War and Close Combat were both developed with the aid of the US military , but the most interesting games from this perspective are America 's Army and Full Spectrum Warrior since these two were wholly or partly funded by the US Military .
The creation of the Middle East as a site of perpetual war in these games can be related to how and why these games were produced in the first place .
The origin of these games thus exemplifies one of the most direct connections between American neo-Orientalist discourse , American economic / military practice and the entertainment industry .
In 1999 , the US Army saw the fewest recruits in thirty years ( Cabell , 1999 ) .
This led Congress to endorse new " aggressive , innovative experiments " in military recruiting ( Hodes and Ruby - Sachs , 2002 ) .
These experiments included the construction of a military tactical shooter , developed by the MOVES institute of the Naval Postgraduate School in Monterey , California .
After two years of development and some seven million dollars , America 's Army was finally released on the fourth of July 2002 .
Those in charge of the project have never denied that the game is essentially a recruitment and propaganda tool which allows the Army to reach out to and market themselves to the computer savvy - and therefore arguably intelligent - youngsters of contemporary American society ( America 's Army , website ) .
As a recruitment tool rather than as an entertainment commodity , the game was distributed to the public for free .
Full Spectrum Warrior by Pandemic Studios was also developed through substantial military funding .
Like Kuma / War , many episodes of America 's Army and First to Fight , Full Spectrum Warrior takes place in a Middle Eastern setting where a team of American soldiers must fulfill a series of military missions which involves gunning down a great number of Islamic insurgents in the fictional Middle Eastern state of Zekistan .
Full Spectrum Warrior is an effort that began with the establishment of the Institute for Creative Technologies in 1999 , located at the University of Southern California and funded by the US Army .
According to the ICT home page , part of the mission of the ICT " is to build a partnership among the entertainment industry , Army , and academia with the goal of creating synthetic experiences so compelling that participants react as if they are real . "
The ICT is precisely this : an alliance between university - based computer science , the Silicon Valley / Hollywood entertainment industry and the US Army .
Full Spectrum Warrior is one of the most recent commercial products to be released as a result of this particular alliance .
Rather than being conceived as a game , then , Full Spectrum Warrior began as a military training tool .
This simulation game was called Full Spectrum Command , and Full Spectrum Warrior is the commercial spin - off released to the public .
The purpose of the original game was in this case not to recruit soldiers but to train them for the tactical challenges of urban combat .
Of course , the commercial version of the game does not train actual soldiers in the art of urban combat , but , I would argue , subjects in the ideology of American neo-Orientalism .
In other words , these games market war as entertainment in the interest of recruiting or training soldiers ultimately willing to practice military violence .
From one perspective then , the Military Entertainment Complex can be described as an alliance that feeds and feeds off both an entertainment paradigm - in this case the computer game - and a certain discourse - that of neo-Orientalism - ultimately creating the conditions for its own continued economic and ideological survival .
Thus , it is hardly surprising that the games funded and created within the Military Entertainment Complex render a virtual and ideological space that really has very little to do with reality in the Middle East , but which makes perfect sense within the wider discursive formation of the War on Terror launched by Bush after 9/11 .
These games actually recruit and train real soldiers .
In doing so , they fulfill an important function for the American state which is in need of soldiers willing to fight an actual war .
However , their most important purpose is undoubtedly that they seek to produce a subject comfortable with the prosecution of a perpetual war .
Ultimately , then , the Military Entertainment Complex functions to commodify the notion of perpetual war .
From this perspective , the Military Entertainment Complex allows both the American and the global citizen to consume and , through this consumption , purchase a military identity while at the same time presenting a sanitized , bi-polar and fundamentally Orientalist image of military violence conducted in the Middle East .
Through the fusion of three of the most influential power structures of the United States today - the entertainment industry , the academy and the military - this process is accomplished almost with elegance .
Consent for continued and perpetual military conflict is manufactured effortlessly , a crucial but ever - important by - product as the Military seeks to simulate war or recruit soldiers , as the academy looks for funding for its research , as the leisure industry hunts for entertainment consumers and as Western consumers seek both to be entertained and for a convenient way to understand a world that seems strangely hostile to American interests and principles .
Orientalism Revisited
These games were essentially produced with an American audience in mind .
However , the actual audience is much more heterogeneous .
In the wake of globalization , the audience consuming digital entertainment in various forms has become remarkably diverse .
While early military shooters such as Wolfenstein were distributed on floppy disks or CDs and sold over the counter , virtually anyone with an internet connection and a credit card can buy , download and play Close Combat or any of the other games discussed in this paper . [ 8 ]
Game manufacturers sometimes seem to take this into consideration and adapt the games to a more international audience .
For example , Full Spectrum Warrior : Ten Hammers , the sequel to Full Spectrum Warrior , allows the gamer to sometimes play as a British soldier .
At the same time , the reason why some of these games include a somewhat multinational fighting force may well be as a homage to the notion that war in the Middle East is fought by a " coalition of the willing " .
Obviously , the fact that the community consuming these games is heterogeneous does not mean that they allow non-American game characters much individuality .
Rather , this fact suggests that the discourse rehearsed by these games is efficiently spread beyond American and even Western borders .
Like Hollywood films , then , these games traverse the borders of nation states , posing as entertainment while at the same time manufacturing world - wide consent through the dispersion of what I want to argue is best labeled American neo-Orientalism .
As I have suggested , American neo-Orientalism has been investigated before by writers such as Melanie McAlister .
In her book from 2001 , she studies a very broad field comprising political speeches , news media , Hollywood film , academic texts and more .
My focus is much narrower , being limited to that of the military first person shooter , and it is not strange that the image of the Middle East that is constructed within the game space of this particular genre is much less subtle and much more reductive .
This game genre also differentiates itself from a lot of other popular culture through the claim that it has a mimetic relationship to reality .
However , the study of the military shooter suggests essentially the same thing as McAlister 's project : that the discourse that saturates American popular culture and political life ultimately aims to organize our understanding of the Middle East as a site that requires the economic , political and military attention of the United States .
As I have furthermore argued , the military shooter is especially concerned with dramatizing the necessity of continuous military violence in the Middle East by describing this space as a site for perpetual war .
The enthusiasm with which the military entertainment network sponsors this genre has also earned some academic attention .
Der Derian , director of The Information Technology , War and Peace Project , commenting on the relationship between the military - industrial - media - entertainment network and American cultural and political life , paints a bleak picture of things to come : " for the near future , I believe virtuous war as played out by the military - industrial - media - entertainment network will be our daily bread and nightly circus .
Some would see us staying there , suspended perpetually , in between wars of terror and counterterror " ( Der Derian , 2001 ) .
One reason why Der Derian voices this concern is because the popular critics of digital culture seem reluctant to engage with the political dimension of computer games .
Unlike critics of other forms of popular culture such as movies , books , television shows and music , game reviewers tend to de-politicize computer games .
As sometimes the case within the field of Game Studies , the focus in game reviews is often on storytelling , game experience and technological advances .
The generation that grows up reading the mainstream magazines and visiting the most popular game sites and looking for them to explain the game experience , will be very poorly equipped indeed to deal with the political dimension of what they are playing . [ 9 ]
In fact , I would argue that it may not be necessary for the students of Game Studies to apply terminology from Cultural / Critical theory in the way I have done here to perceive the political content of these games .
Even when disregarding the game 's origin and reason for production , marketing strategies and cut- scenes , to instead focus on the internal semiotics of games such as Full Spectrum Warrior , it should become clear that the game - play only allows for one type of action : the perpetual slaughter by an American soldier avatar of Middle Eastern subjects in a never ending attempt to rid the Arabian urban landscape of its inhabitants as if they were anomalous to this setting .
Game reviewers as well as Game Studies scholars often celebrate the supposed open - endedness and freedom provided by modern digital games .
This freedom does exist also in the military shooter and allows the gamer to solve missions in different ways .
However , underneath this apparent freedom the political rationale for the missions the gamer is involved in remains constant .
Thus , the playing of the game implies at least a tacit acceptance of this rationale which is reflected in the games ' unceasing rendering of the Arabian urban maze and of the terrorists that always and forever lurk within it .

The news archive search is one of several new Google services
The web - based tool allows users to explore existing digitised newspaper articles spanning the last 200 years and more recent online content .
People using the search are shown results from both free and subscription - based news outlets .
Partners in the project include the websites of US newspaper the New York Times and the Guardian from the UK .
Other sources include news aggregators , websites which collect and display news stories from multiple sources .
" The goal here is to be able to explore history as it unfolded , " said Anurag Acharya , an engineer at Google and one of the team behind the project .
" It 's fascinating to see how people 's attitudes and emotions have changed through time . "
History lesson
The new service searches hundreds of different news sources to answer a user 's query .
The exact number of sources is confidential .
Results are presented in similar fashion to a Google News search , with " related " articles about the same event grouped together .
Free and charged - for articles are displayed side by side .
The ability to browse this historical overview allows users to identify key time periods and get some sense of the flow of events

Google 's empire
With pages from commercial websites , the cost of viewing them is also shown .
Google says search results are based on relevance , not partnerships with companies .
Users can also view articles using a timeline that displays key dates associated with a story .
So the first Moon landing would highlight 1969 as a key date , but also identify other years when lunar landings took place or when the topic was in the news .
" The ability to browse this historical overview allows users to identify key time periods and get some sense of the flow of events , " said Mr Acharya .
The earliest known searchable story is , he said , from " somewhere in the mid-1700s " - considerably older than the current 30 - day archive offered through Google News .
The service is accessed through the news archive website or the Google news page .
It is also activated when it can provide relevant results to a user 's search on google.com .
In this case , links to the most relevant historical news articles are displayed separately above the normal search results .
Historical challenge
The launch of the news archive search extends Google 's influence over how the world 's information is indexed , searched and accessed .
The way we access information is changing
According to online research firm Nielsen / NetRatings , more than 380 million people used the search engine every month in 2005 .
The company is also expanding into areas other than search .
In August it announced plans to offer consumers the chance to download and print classic novels free of charge .
" I 'm strongly in favour of the democratisation of access to historical documents , but also cautious about how much information Google now controls , " said Professor Roy Rosenzweig , a historian from the Center for History and New Media at George Mason University in the US .
He says that increasingly the model of how we access information and what information we have access to is changing , as public archives such as libraries are replaced by private companies .
But , he says , he is " extremely excited " about Google 's latest offering .
" As a scholar and historian I want as much information as possible , accessible to as many people as possible at the least cost , and the extent to which Google is doing that is compelling . "
Google says it plans to launch the news archive search service on other international Google sites soon .
