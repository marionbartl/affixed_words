Google has not only opened up on how often the world 's governments request user data stored on its servers .
It 's come awfully close to acknowledging that it does n't actually " anonymize " your IP address after 9 months .
As noticed by longtime Google critic Chris Soghoian - now a technical advisor for the US Federal Trade Commission 's Division of Privacy and Identity Protection - Google has departed from the usual false claims of anonymization to say that after 9 months , it " obfuscates " your IP .
At the very least , this new language is n't as misleading as the old .
An unnamed Googler recently gave an interview to Privacy International over the company 's decision to release data on government requests for your private information , and the new language appeared when he or she was asked how long the company retains unique identifiers .
" Many of our services can be used without registering for the service ( for example , Google search ) and therefore we do not ask for any personally identifying information " the Googler said .
" For those services , we may have unauthenticated logs data and our retention policy is to obfuscate the IP addresses after 9 months and delete the cookie after 18 months . "
Google introduced its current data retention policy in the fall of 2008 , and it was actually implemented sometime before the November of 2009 .
Google has always claimed that under the new policy , it " anonymizes " IPs - even though it does n't .
After 9 months , Google merely erases the last eights bits from IPs in server logs for search and other services that do n't require sign - in .
And as Soghoian has pointed out , if a cookie stays intact for 18 months , then restoring those missing eight bits is trivial .
Though Google erases the bits on your nine - month - old search queries , they remain intact on your newer queries - and both sets of queries carry the same cookie info .
" Obfuscate " is an improvement - though it still does n't tell the whole story .
And " anonymize " is still the word of choice on Google 's website .
" We strike a reasonable balance between the competing pressures we face , such as the privacy of our users , the security of our systems and the need for innovation , " reads the company 's privacy FAQ .
" We believe anonymizing IP addresses after 9 months and cookies in our search engine logs after 18 months strikes the right balance . " ®
Representative John Linder ( R - GA ) , one of former House Speaker Newt Gingrich ’s top lieutenants , has announced that he is retiring and will not seek reelection .
First elected to Congress in 1992 , and representing Georgia ’s seventh congressional district since 2003 , Linder ’s claim to fame is for continually introducing legislation that never passes .
Linder is the primary sponsor in Congress of the FairTax , a progressive national retail sales tax .
The FairTax is the brainchild of three businessmen concerned about the crippling effects on the economy of the current federal tax code .
After adopting the name “ FairTax ” for their tax - reform plan , they formed Americans for Fair Taxation in 1997 and enlisted Representative Linder to introduce FairTax legislation in Congress .
Linder first sponsored the “ Fair Tax Act ” in the House in July of 1999 , and has reintroduced a FairTax bill at the beginning of every term of Congress since then .
The current incarnation of the FairTax is H.R. 25 , the “ Fair Tax Act of 2009 . ”
This bill was introduced on January 6 , 2009 , and has 61 cosponsors , including one Democrat , David Boren of Oklahoma .
Notably absent from the list of cosponsors is Representative Ron Paul ( R - TX ) , continually acknowledged as the taxpayers ’ best friend because of his consistent voting record against unconstitutional spending .
The FairTax bill is currently languishing in the House Committee on Ways and Means ( as it does each time it is introduced ) .
A companion bill was introduced in the Senate ( S. 296 ) on January 22 , 2009 , by Saxby Chambliss ( R - GA ) , but it only has 4 cosponsors , all Republicans .
It is sitting in the Senate Committee on Finance .
Former Republican presidential candidates Mike Huckabee , Thomas Tancredo , and Duncan Hunter have been supporters of the FairTax .
The most vocal proponent of the FairTax outside of political circles is radio talk - show host Neal Boortz .
He is the author , with Congressman Linder , of The FairTax Book ( Regan Books , 2005 ) and a sequel , FairTax : The Truth , Answering the Critics ( Harper , 2008 ) .
The FairTax is a consumption tax in the form of a national retail sales tax on all services and the final sale of all new goods .
All services , except tuition , would be subject to the FairTax — from heart surgeries and funeral services to haircuts and manicures .
And although the FairTax would only be levied on the final sale of new goods , nothing is exempt — not food , not prescription drugs , not new cars , not even new construction ( what would the FairTax be on a skyscraper ? ) .
All Internet purchases of new goods would also be taxable .
In exchange for these new taxes , there would no longer be — on the federal level — personal income tax , corporate income tax , capital gains tax , Social Security tax , Medicare tax , unemployment tax , alternative minimum tax , gift tax , or estate tax .
However , without an income tax , all tax deductions , exemptions , and credits would also be eliminated .
No more child care credit , education credits , earned income credit , personal exemptions , home mortgage interest deduction , etc .
The FairTax would not do away with other federal taxes like tariffs , excise taxes , and special taxes on things like airline tickets .
State and local income , property , and sales taxes would be unaffected as well .
The reason for such a radical tax - reform proposal is obvious : the intrusive , wealth - destroying , income redistributing , social engineering monstrosity known as the U.S. tax code .
With its progressive brackets that punish success , refundable tax credits that allow some Americans to receive a refund after paying no taxes , and arcane rules and schedules that confound not only seasoned tax preparers , but IRS employees , the tax code in the 20 volumes of Title 26 , “ Internal Revenue , ” of the U.S. Code of Federal Regulations is an abomination .
The appeal of the FairTax should be evident as well : no more record keeping , no more taxes withheld from paychecks , no more compliance costs , no more tax forms , no more IRS audits of individuals , no more lines at the post office on April 15th .
For Good and Evil : The ... Charles Adams Best Price : $ 4.28 Buy New $ 5.72 ( as of 08:10 EST - Details )
But that ’s not all .
Proponents of the FairTax also tout some additional benefits it is supposed to bring .
Congressman Linder believes that under the FairTax we would see an increase in GDP , exports , real investment , real wages , economic growth , and economic efficiency .
Neal Boortz maintains that the FairTax would result in the creation of millions of new jobs , an increase in foreign investment in the United States , and be a financial bonanza for the poor and middle class .
Both claim that prices would decline and interest rates — which are already at historic lows — would drop by 30 percent .
These grandiose claims for the FairTax notwithstanding , there is no question that the beauty of the FairTax is its simplicity .
This beauty , however , is only skin deep .
The FairTax promises a utopia that is simply too good to be true .
The cure offered by the FairTax may even be worse than the diseased federal tax code it is designed to replace .
The price of the FairTax ’s simplicity is a 30 percent national sales tax on all new goods and services in addition to the state and local sales taxes already levied in most states and many counties and cities .
And it is not just individuals who would be responsible for paying the tax : State and local governments would , unlike now , be required to pay taxes to the federal government on the goods they purchase , and the federal government would pay taxes to itself .
The FairTax rate is usually given by its proponents as 23 percent , with the caveat that the rate is figured inclusively ( the tax is included in the price of the product ) rather than exclusively ( the tax is added to the price of the product ) like it is computed in every state that assesses a sales tax .
Obviously , it is much easier to sell a national sales tax to the American people if the rate is 23 percent instead of 30 percent .
But whether one thinks the rate is 23 or 30 percent , the fact remains that it will cost Americans an extra 30 cents on the dollar to purchase any new good or service under the FairTax .
Some economists do n’t think that either of these rates would be high enough to fund the government at its current level .
And as a practical matter , as bad as the current system is , I do n’t think the American people are ready to pay an additional 30 percent sales tax on their purchase of a $ 30,000 new car on top of the state and local sales tax that they already pay .
Although it seems as though the exchange of the income tax for the FairTax would lead to higher prices on all new goods and services because of the new sales tax , FairTax proponents claim that the removal of embedded taxes would result in the prices of goods and services falling by enough to offset the amount of the sales tax imposed .
Now , it is true that the current price of consumer goods includes embedded taxes like corporate income taxes and the employer share of Social Security and Medicare taxes , but the amount by which it is claimed that prices would fall under a FairTax system has been grossly exaggerated .
What we know for certain is that under the FairTax retail prices will increase by 30 percent ; what we do n’t know is how much prices will decrease after their embedded costs are removed .

Laurence M. Vance Best Price : $ 3.46 Buy New $ 5.96 ( as of 12:30 EST - Details )
But not only will the lower prices on goods and services help consumers to pay their new federal sales tax , the FairTax also includes a monthly rebate to offset the taxes paid on basic necessities .
This “ prebate ” would be based on family size and the government poverty level .
There would be no means test ; every household — including the “ rich ” — would receive a prebate .
And as Boortz mentioned in his first book on the FairTax , for some households the amount of the prebate might even be more than the sales tax paid .
Thus , although everyone would pay the same rate under the FairTax , the end result would be that some Americans would pay no taxes at all , some would have most of their taxes offset , and some would get more money back than they paid in taxes .
This makes the FairTax an income redistribution scheme under the guise of tax reform .
There are three fundamental problems with the FairTax : the arbitrary concept of fairness , revenue neutrality , and the nature of taxation .
Maintaining that the FairTax is a “ fair ” tax system , or one that is “ fairer ” than our current system , is highly subjective .
Boortz himself even acknowledges this in his most recent book on the FairTax : “ Whether a tax system is ‘ fair ’ is a complicated economic and philosophical question , one that inevitably involves oversimplification and subjective judgment . ”
Some Americans think it is fair that other Americans pay for their health care .
Some Americans think it is fair that other Americans subsidize their housing .
Some Americans think it is fair that the top 50 percent of wage earners pay 97 percent of the taxes .
Why should it be considered fair for the federal government to confiscate 23 or 30 percent of the value of every new good or service ?
The late economist Murray Rothbard , although he died before John Linder introduced the first FairTax bill in Congress , said it best : “ There can be no such thing as ‘ fairness in taxation . ’
Taxation is nothing but organized theft , and the concept of a ‘ fair tax ’ is therefore every bit as absurd as that of ‘ fair theft . ' ”
The concept of “ revenue neutrality ” is one that all advocates of liberty and less government should be suspicious of .
The FairTax , like all other current tax reform plans , is revenue neutral .
It merely allows the federal government to confiscate the wealth of its citizens more efficiently .
The problem with revenue - neutral tax - reform plans is that every federal agency , every federal program , every pound of federal pork — would be funded exactly as it is now .
As Boortz likewise says in his newest book : “ The goal of the FairTax movement is not to strangle the life out of government by depriving it of needed revenue . ”
The FairTax merely shifts the debate from how much wealth the federal government confiscates to the manner in which it is confiscated .
Obama ’s trillion - dollar budgets , like Bush ’s trillion - dollar budgets , should n’t be funded by replacing one tax with another — they should n’t be funded at all .
Rethinking the Good War Laurence M. Vance Best Price : null Buy New $ 5.95 ( as of 12:45 EST - Details )
The root of the problem is clearly taxation itself , not the tax code .
Liberals are not opposed to taxes on principle , and have no problem using the tax code for their various social engineering and income redistribution schemes .
Conservatives are generally not opposed to taxes on principle either , as long as they are used in the right way — to fund U.S. military adventures around the world , anything related to law enforcement or homeland security , faith - based welfare programs , educational vouchers , abstinence - education programs , and the war on drugs .
Yes , the tax code is too complex , too intrusive , too long , too full of loopholes , and too progressive .
But if rates are low enough , then it really does n’t matter how taxes are collected .
The FairTax perpetuates the fallacy that the government has a right to confiscate a percentage of the value of each new good sold and every service rendered .
This is no different than claiming that the government has a right to the portion of each American ’s income that it takes under the current system .
As Rothbard explains :
The consumption tax , on the other hand , can only be regarded as a payment for permission - to - live .
It implies that a man will not be allowed to advance or even sustain his own life , unless he pays , off the top , a fee to the State for permission to do so .
The consumption tax does not strike me , in its philosophical implications , as one whit more noble , or less presumptuous , than the income tax .
It ’s time to retire the FairTax .
Although on the surface it sounds like a workable solution to the problem that is the U.S. tax code , it promises a utopia that it cannot deliver .
The FairTax creates new taxes , new taxpayers , and new tax collectors , makes it easier for the federal government to raise taxes , institutes universal welfare with its prebate check , has unknown and potential huge transition costs , could saddle us with a sales tax and a reconstituted income tax , and has a stated rate that is too low to achieve revenue neutrality , a problematic concept in itself .
The federal government has an insatiable lust for Americans ’ money to maintain the welfare / warfare state .
All revenue - neutral tax - reform plans allow Congress to maintain its spending orgy while appearing to make taxes “ fairer . ”
The FairTax — as acknowledged by Boortz and Linder — would merely change the way taxes are collected .
And not only is it not an incremental step toward lower taxes or tax rates , it contributes nothing toward returning the size , scope , and cost of the federal government to its proper constitutional authority .
As Congressman Ron Paul has said : “ The real issue is total spending by government , not tax reform . ”

INSIDER : Palin Show ALL - TIME LOW for Discovery - Ad Buyers rolling in aisles laughing at Promo ..
Refuse to buy !
Last week Discovery had its annual sales conference for ad buyers for all of its 13 networks .
The presentation showcases all of their new shows across the different networks .
That night the presentation was on Sarah Palin ’s Alaska .
Our source says “ the whole thing [ was ] comical . ”
Apparently the ad buyers were not impressed .
This Discovery insider said , “ When the promo was over , people ( employees and buyers ) were rolling their eyes , snickering , and even laughing .
People were laughing and it ’s not even a comedy .
No one took it seriously . ”
This person was concerned that given the lack of interest from ad buyers that Discovery would have to dump the show to “ a crappy time slot ” to cut its losses .
They added , “ Bottom line everyone thought it was a new all time low for Discovery .
My guess is the show is going to tank big time . ”
Remember Discovery is paying Sarah Palin $ 250,000 an episode for this series .
There are eight episodes , so she will be clearing $ 2 million for this possible disaster ( TLC will be spending between $ 800,000 to $ 1.2 million per episode for the whole production ) .
The ratings for her new show on Fox News Channel were already low ( she could n’t even hold on to Greta Van Susteren ’s audience ) .
Imagine how much worse she ’ll do on TLC where the audience presumably wants to learn something , i.e. the exact opposite of what Sarah Palin is known for .
What ’s next for TLC , George Bush ’s Ranch ?
When are people going to finally realize that just attaching a “ big name ” to a project does n’t mean it ’s going to work ?
The person hosting the show has to have some credibility in the field .
I ’m not sure Sarah Palin has credibility in any field .
Many people would argue that Palin did great ecological damage to Alaska and would like to do more by drilling all over it .
So , getting her to host a show about the natural beauty of Alaska is a bit like getting Jeffrey Dahmer to host a cooking show for the Food Network .
Yes , there ’s a big name attached , but is that the name you really want associated with your brand ?
Watch The Young Turks Here :
Here are the next ten top one - liners from the commandlinefu website .
The first post about the topic became massively popular and received over 100,000 views in the first two days .
Before I dive into the next ten one - liners , I want to take the chance and promote the other three article series on one - liners that I have written :
Update : Russian translation now available .
Alright , so here are today 's one - liners :
# 11 . Edit the command you typed in your favorite editor
$ command < CTRL-x CTRL-e >
This one - liner opens the so - far typed command in your favorite text editor for further editing .
This is handy if you are typing a lengthier shell command .
After you have done editing the command , quit from your editor successfully to execute it .
To cancel execution , just erase it .
If you quit unsuccessfully , the command you had typed before diving into the editor will be executed .
Actually , I have to educate you , it 's not a feature of the shell per se but a feature of the readline library that most shells use for command line processing .
This particular binding CTRL-x CTRL-e only works in readline emacs editing mode .
The other mode is readline vi editing mode , in which the same can be accomplished by pressing ESC and then v .
The emacs editing mode is the default in all the shells that use the readline library .
The usual command to change between the modes is set -o vi to change to vi editing mode and set -o emacs to change back to emacs editing mode .
To change the editor , export the $ EDITOR shell variable to your preference .
For example , to set the default editor to pico , type export EDITOR=pico .
Another way to edit commands in a text editor is to use fc shell builtin ( at least bash has this builtin ) .
The fc command opens the previous edited command in your favorite text editor .
It 's easy to remember the fc command because it stands for " fix command . "
Remember the ^foo^bar^ command from the first top ten one - liners ?
You can emulate this behavior by typing fc -s foo=bar .
It will replace foo with bar in the previous command and execute it .
# 12 . Empty a file or create a new file
$ > file.txt
This one - liner either wipes the file called file .
txt empty or creates a new file called file .
txt .
The shell first checks if the file file .
txt exists .
If it does , the shell opens it and wipes it clean .
If it does n't exist , the shell creates the file and opens it .
Next the shell proceeds to redirecting standard output to the opened file descriptor .
Since there is nothing on the standard output , the command succeeds , closes the file descriptor , leaving the file empty .
Creating a new empty file is also called touching and can be done by $ touch file .
txt command .
The touch command can also be used for changing timestamps of the commands .
Touch , however , wo n't wipe the file clean , it will only change the access and modification timestamps to the current time .
# 13 . Create a tunnel from localhost :2001 to somemachine :80
$ ssh -N - L2001:localhost:80 somemachine
This one - liner creates a tunnel from your computer 's port 2001 to somemachine 's port 80 .
Each time you connect to port 2001 on your machine , your connection gets tunneled to somemachine :80 .
The - L option can be summarized as - L port : host : hostport .
Whenever a connection is made to localhost : port , the connection is forwarded over the secure channel , and a connection is made to host : hostport from the remote machine .
The - N option makes sure you do n't run shell as you connect to somemachine .
To make things more concrete , here is another example :
$ ssh -f -N - L2001:www.google.com:80 somemachine
This one - liner creates a tunnel from your computer 's port 2001 to www.google.com:80 via somemachine .
Each time you connect to localhost : 2001 , ssh tunnels your request via somemachine , where it tries to open a connection to www.google.com.
Notice the additional -f flag - it makes ssh daemonize ( go into background ) so it did n't consume a terminal .
# 14 . Reset terminal
$ reset
This command resets the terminal .
You know , when you have accidentally output binary data to the console , it becomes messed up .
The reset command usually cleans it up .
It does that by sending a bunch of special byte sequences to the terminal .
The terminal interprets them as special commands and executes them .
Here is what BusyBox 's reset command does :
printf ( " \033c\033 ( K\033 [ J\033[0m\033 [ ?25 h " ) ;
It sends a bunch of escape codes and a bunch of CSI commands .
Here is what they mean :
\033 c : " ESC c " - sends reset to the terminal .
: " ESC c " - sends reset to the terminal .
\ 033 ( K : " ESC ( K " - reloads the screen output mapping table .
: " ESC ( K " - reloads the screen output mapping table .
\ 033 [ J : " ESC [ J " - erases display .
: " ESC [ J " - erases display .
\ 033 [0 m : " ESC [ 0 m " - resets all display attributes to their defaults .
: " ESC [ 0 m " - resets all display attributes to their defaults .
\ 033[?25h : " ESC [ ? 25 h " - makes cursor visible .
# 15 .
Tweet from the shell
$ curl -u user : pass -d status= ' Tweeting from the shell '
http://twitter.com/statuses/update.xml
This one - liner tweets your message from the terminal .
It uses the curl program to HTTP POST your tweet via Twitter 's API .
The -u user : pass argument sets the login and password to use for authentication .
If you do n't want your password to be saved in the shell history , omit the : pass part and curl will prompt you for the password as it tries to authenticate .
Oh , and while we are at shell history , another way to omit password from being saved in the history is to start the command with a space !
For example , < space > curl ... wo n't save the curl command to the shell history .
The -d status= '...' instructs curl to use the HTTP POST method for the request and send status= ... as POST data .
Finally , http://twitter.com/statuses/update.xml is the API URL to POST the data to .
Talking about Twitter , I 'd love if you followed me on Twitter ! :)
# 16 . Execute a command at midnight
$ echo cmd | at midnight
This one - liner sends the shell command cmd to the at - daemon ( atd ) for execution at midnight .
The at command is light on the execution - time argument , you may write things like 4 pm tomorrow to execute it at 4 pm tomorrow , 9 pm next year to run it on the same date at 9 pm the next year , 6 pm + 10 days to run it at 6 pm after 10 days , or now +1 minute to run it after a minute .
Use atq command to list all the jobs that are scheduled for execution and atrm to remove a job from the queue .
Compared to the universally known cron , at is suitable for one - time jobs .
For example , you 'd use cron to execute a job every day at midnight but you would use at to execute a job only today at midnight .
Also be aware that if the load is greater than some number ( for one processor systems the default is 0.8 ) , then atd will not execute the command !
That can be fixed by specifying a greater max load to atd via -l argument .
# 17 . Output your microphone to other computer 's speaker
$ dd if= / dev/dsp | ssh username@host dd of= / dev/dsp
The default sound device on Linux is / dev/dsp .
It can be both written to and read from .
If it 's read from then the audio subsystem will read the data from the microphone .
If it 's written to , it will send audio to your speaker .
This one - liner reads audio from your microphone via the dd if= / dev/dsp command ( if stands for input file ) and pipes it as standard input to ssh .
Ssh , in turn , opens a connection to a computer at host and runs the dd of= / dev/dsp ( of stands for output file ) on it .
Dd of= / dev/dsp receives the standard input that ssh received from dd if= / dev/dsp .
The result is that your microphone gets output on host computer 's speaker .
Want to scare your colleague ?
Dump / dev/urandom to his speaker by dd if=/ dev/urandom .
# 18 . Create and mount a temporary RAM partition
# mount -t tmpfs -o size =1024 m tmpfs /mnt
This command creates a temporary RAM filesystem of 1GB ( 1024 m ) and mounts it at / mnt .
The -t flag to mount specifies the filesystem type and the -o size =1024 m passes the size sets the filesystem size .
If it does n't work , make sure your kernel was compiled to support the tmpfs .
If tmpfs was compiled as a module , make sure to load it via modprobe tmpfs .
If it still does n't work , you 'll have to recompile your kernel .
To unmount the ram disk , use the umount / mnt command ( as root ) .
But remember that mounting at / mnt is not the best practice .
Better mount your drive to / mnt / tmpfs or a similar path .
If you want your filesystem to grow dynamically , use ramfs filesystem type instead of tmpfs .
Another note : tmpfs may use swap , while ramfs wo n't .
# 19 . Compare a remote file with a local file
$ ssh user@host cat / path / to / remotefile | diff / path / to/localfile -
This one - liner diffs the file / path / to / localfile on local machine with a file / path / to / remotefile on host machine .
It first opens a connection via ssh to host and executes the cat / path / to / remotefile command there .
The shell then takes the output and pipes it to diff / path / to / localfile - command .
The second argument - to diff tells it to diff the file / path / to / localfile against standard input .
That 's it .
# 20 .
Find out which programs listen on which TCP ports
# netstat - tlnp
This is an easy one .
Netstat is the standard utility for listing information about Linux networking subsystem .
In this particular one - liner it 's called with - tlnp arguments :
-t causes netstat to only list information about TCP sockets .
causes netstat to only list information about TCP sockets .
-l causes netstat to only list information about listening sockets .
causes netstat to only list information about listening sockets .
-n causes netstat not to do reverse lookups on the IPs .
causes netstat not to do reverse lookups on the IPs .
-p causes netstat to print the PID and name of the program to which the socket belongs ( requires root ) .
To find more detailed info about open sockets on your computer , use the lsof utility .
See my article " A Unix Utility You Should Know About : lsof " for more information .
That 's it for today .
Tune in the next time for " Another Ten One - Liners from CommandLineFu Explained " .
There are many more nifty commands to write about .
But for now , have fun and see ya !

It has been nearly two decades since New Yorkers faced their last doorman strike , but as the deadline for a new contract for building workers approached , the questions being posed throughout the city remained largely unchanged on Sunday .
Who will safeguard my apartment as I sleep ?
Greet my children when they come home from school ?
Accept deliveries ?
Clean the hallways ?
Sort the mail ?
Operate the elevator ?
And who , for goodness sake , will let the cleaning lady in ?
Residents , co-op boards and building management companies have been busy planning for the sudden complications that could come at 12:01 a.m.
Wednesday with the possible departure of the building workers who , among many other things , hold open the city ’s doors .
The Realty Advisory Board on Labor Relations has distributed a preparedness manual with recommendations for keeping buildings in operation in case of a strike .
“ A strike is not pleasant , nor should it be taken lightly , ” according to the 45 - page document .
“ During a period of work stoppage , pressures and problems develop which make building management very difficult . ”
Not only did McDonnell revive the proclamation , but the new language removes a line inserted by Republican Gov. Jim Gilmore in 1999 recognizing ' that slavery was one of the causes ' of the Civil War.
Va. gov ripped for Confederate month
Virginia Gov. Bob McDonnell ’s proclaimed celebration of Confederate History Month — without a mention of slavery — set off a full day of full - throated criticism Wednesday , including a slam from a major Virginia newspaper that endorsed the Republican during his campaign for the state ’s highest office and the head of the NAACP .
Most of the criticism of what McDonnell had described essentially as a tourism promotion , centered not on taking note of the confederacy , but in doing so without reference to the issue of slavery , as some of his predecessors had been careful to do .
Advertisement
“ Although his proclamation quite properly recognizes the sacrifices of those who fought on behalf of the Confederacy , a hole lies in the statement 's heart , ” said the Richmond - Times Dispatch in an editorial .
“ McDonnell speaks of shared history , yet does not cite slaves .
Southern heritage includes not only those who supported the Confederacy but those who welcomed the Union armies as liberators .
McDonnell recognizes that the past must be interpreted within the context not only of its times but of ours .
The inexcusable omission reduces the slaves and their descendants to invisibility once again . ”
Gov. Bob McDonnell 's " party should be gravely concerned , ” said Benjamin Jealous , president and CEO of the NAACP in an interview in POLITICO ’s Arena forum .
“ They ca n’t be the party of Lincoln and deny the legacy of slavery in this country or give it short shrift . ”
“ Our primary concern is the decision to exclude the language about slavery ... it ’s whitewashing at best and rolling the clock back at worst to exclude that language , especially in these times .
These are times that are increasingly racist and far right wing .
“ You can look from the halls of Congress … to education by attempting to remove civil rights history from textbooks , and tea party rallies ; you see this as a movement that is both far right - wing in its orientation and in one way or the other , treats black people in a way that is second - class … .
“ It ’s not about being politically correct , but being correct .
You ca n’t talk about the confederacy and the Civil War and not talk about slavery .
It just does n’t make any sense . ”
McDonnell said Tuesday that the move was designed to encourage tourism in the state , noting that next year marks the 150th anniversary of the start of the Civil War .
“ April is the month , ” the declaration begins , “ in which the people of Virginia joined the Confederate States of America in a four - year war between the states for independence that concluded at Appomattox Courthouse . ... ”
About 20 percent of Virginia 's population is African - American .
The state ’s two most recent Democratic governors did not issue a proclamation , which had been revived in Virginia by GOP Gov. George Allen in 1997 .
And the new language of Mc Donnell ’s proclamation removes a line inserted by Republican Gov. Jim Gilmore in 1999 recognizing “ that slavery was one of the causes ” of the Civil War .
“ I hope [ McDonnell ] will revise that proclamation to give an inference to who Virginians really are , and what they feel is celebratory , ” said former Virginia Democratic Gov. L. Douglas Wilder in an interview with POLITICO ’s Arena ’ forum .
“ How can you say that something that was detrimental and antithetical to [ African - Americans ’ ] being is something that anyone could be celebrating ? ” added Wilder , the first African - American to be elected the state 's governor .
Virginia ’s Legislative Black Caucus and the Virginia chapter of the NAACP condemned the proclamation on Tuesday .
In a statement , Virginia Del. Kenneth Alexander , who serves as chairman of the Virginia Legislative Black Caucus said “ Gov. McDonnell 's proclamation was offensive and offered a disturbing revision of the Civil War and the brutal era that followed .
Virginia has worked hard to move beyond the very things for which Gov. McDonnell seems nostalgic . ”
Democratic state Sen. Mary Margaret
Whipple said on MSNBC Wednesday that “ Gov. McDonnell ’s proclamation is very troubling to me and many others because it only portrays one side of the story . ”
“ We ca n’t just erase part of our history by ignoring it and glossing over it .
It ’s just wrong , ” she said .
Terry McAuliffe , who ran unsuccessfully for the Democratic nomination to oppose McDonnell , noted that " Gov. [ Mark ] Warner and Gov. [ Tim} Kaine chose not to issue this declaration .
It ’s not that they did n’t have respect for our history .
But they realized that as governors we ’re a multi-ethnic , multi-- racial state . "
" This is not helpful for us to create jobs in this state , ” he said in the Arena .
“ We want to send an inviting message to people throughout the world .
No , it ’s not going to bring tourism to the state . "
Former Gov. Kaine , now chairman of the Democratic National Committee , issued his own statement late Wednesday .
“ Governor McDonnell ’s decision to designate April as Confederate History Month without condemning , or even acknowledging , the pernicious stain of slavery or its role in the war disregards history , is insensitive to the extraordinary efforts of Americans to eliminate slavery and bind the nation ’s wounds , and offends millions of Americans of all races and in all parts of our nation , " Kaine said .
“ In recent years , Virginia has broken the back of segregation , become the first state in America to elect an African - American governor , passed a unanimous General Assembly resolution expressing profound regret for " the most horrendous of all depredations of human rights and violations of our founding ideals in our nation 's history , " and cast its electoral votes for President Obama .
Neither America nor Virginians want to go backward .
“ A failure to acknowledge the central role of slavery in the Confederacy and deeming insignificant the reprehensible transgression of moral standards of liberty and equality that slavery represented is simply not acceptable in the America of the 21st century . ”

4/5/10 : Mark Buehrle chases down a bouncer off his foot and flicks on the backhand to Paul Konerko , who makes a barehanded grab at first
Former prime minister Ehud Olmert is a suspect in the Holyland real estate scandal , police announced Thursday .
According to police suspicions , between 1999 and 2008 , the Holyland development company andassociated land development projects , then owned by businessmanHillel Charni , paid tens of millions of shekels in bribes to senior public decision makers in the JerusalemMunicipality , members of its planning and construction committee , the Israel Lands Administration and others .
Police suspect that Olmert accepted bribes from businessmen and other interested parties .
There have been contradictory reports as to the amount in question , ranging from hundreds of thousands of shekels to millions .
According to media reports
Olmert is the chief suspect in the scandal , and is expected to be questioned under warning in the next few days .
Meanwhile , another top suspect in the affair , former Olmert associate Uri Messer , was expected to be released to house arrest at a court hearing on Thursday afternoon .
Messer is suspected as acting as an intermediarybetween bribe givers and takers and transferring hundreds of thousandsof shekels in bribes .

Police also said Thursday that they hadmanaged to secure a state witness in the affair , and announced thearrest of another elected official , who still serves in the capital 's municipality .
Theofficial also serves as the director of a major construction firmthat was allegedly involved in the Holyland project .
He waswas questioned on Wednesday night and was due to be brought for aremand extension hearing at the Rishon Lezion Magistrate 's Court on Thursday afternoon .
It comes a day after the detention of formerJerusalem mayor Uri Lupolianski in the case .
On Thursday morning , a seniorJerusalem councilman said he suspected the Holyland real estateaffair was “ just the start ” and called on authorities toinvestigate a number of other massive building projects he believesmay be tainted with corruption .
Councilman Meir Turgeman , thehead of the opposition faction in the Jerusalem municipal council , told Israel Radio he fears plans to build at the YMCA compound , the Gilo Uptown project and Mamilla neighborhood might have been approvedin return for kickbacks .
On Wednesday , the policeinvestigation into suspected massive bribery in the Holyland realestate affair took a dramatic turn when detectives from the National Fraud Unit arrested Lupolianski on suspicion of accepting more thanNIS 3 million in bribes to ensure that the housing plan was approved , and of money laundering .
Temperature and exports

What are the likely economic effects of climate change ?
This column examines the impact of changes in climate on detailed export data .
If a poor country is one degree Celsius warmer in a given year , its exports are lower , by as much as 5.7 % .
While there is no effect on rich countries ’ exports , their consumers will still suffer from reduced imports at higher prices .
Policymakers worldwide are wrestling with potential policy responses to climate change , including national and global cap - and - trade systems , fuel efficiency standards , research subsidies and other measures .
Decisions on these issues can turn quickly as beliefs about the economic damages of climate change vary .
If broad and aggressive economic damages are expected , aggressive measures may be called for .
But if the expectations are for mild or narrow effects , the measures may be just as lukewarm .
The more we know about what climate change might – or might not – do , the more accurately we can guide policy .
A “ narrower view ” argues that climatic change would affect agriculture but not much else .
This view is hardwired into many mainstream climate - economy models , and therefore into the predictions that are often relied on by policymakers .
Broader views move substantially beyond agriculture .
For example , Montesquieu famously argued in The Spirit of Laws ( 1750 ) that an “ excess of heat ” made men “ slothful and dispirited ” , suggesting potentially broad labour productivity effects across many sectors .
In fact , consistent with Montesquieu ’s ideas , recent micro-analysis of the US economy shows that labour productivity declines in hotter weather ( Graff - Zivin and Neidell 2010 ) , especially in the absence of air conditioning , a finding that has also been established in laboratory settings ( e.g. Hancock and Vasmatzidis 2003 , Ramsey and Kwon 1992 ) .
More broadly still , climatic effects may extend to health , crime , conflict , and migration , all of which could have first - order implications for measuring the policy response .
One way to examine these effects – and without taking a stand on which micro channels might matter – is to look directly at any net effects on national economic growth .
Historically , countries have warm and cold periods .
They also have good and bad periods of economic growth .
If weather fluctuations over time within a country are essentially random , then examining the historical association between idiosyncratic climatic shocks and growth episodes within countries can test whether climatic shocks have large or small economic effects .
Together with Melissa Dell ( Dell et al. 2008 ) , we have taken this approach and find that warming has historically had negative impacts on economic growth – but only in poor countries .
The effects in poor countries are remarkably large – with a 1 degree Celsius rise in temperature reducing economic growth by about 1.1 percentage points .
Looking underneath national growth , the study also finds large effects on both agriculture and industrial value added , in addition to effects on aggregate investment , political stability , and innovation .
To further understand whether temperature affects only a narrow slice of economic activity , or instead has much broader effects , we turn to data on a country ’s exports .
Unlike data from the national accounts , which for most countries break down economic activity only into broad sectors like agriculture , industry , and services , export data is naturally collected at very fine levels of detail .
To the extent that temperature shocks do not differentially affect domestic demand for particular goods , this export data can help us understand the sectoral composition of temperature ’s impact on production .
In Jones and Olken ( 2010 ) , we examine historical data relating national weather variation to export performance .
Specifically , we look at how idiosyncratic annual temperature changes in a country explain that country ’s export growth for particular products , holding constant worldwide trade patterns for each product and worldwide temperature changes .
We use data on exports to the whole world and , for more finely disaggregated sectors , data on exports to the US .
The findings confirm large negative impacts of temperature on poor countries .
On average , we find that a poor country being 1 degree Celsius warmer in a given year reduces the growth of that country ’s exports by between 2.0 and 5.7 percentage points in that year .
As in Dell et al. ( 2008 ) , we find no effect on rich countries ’ exports .
The fact that exports are even more sensitive to temperature than overall GDP is consistent with the idea that domestic consumption is relatively steady , so that volatility in domestic production translates into greater volatility in net exports .
When we examine the industrial breakdown of temperature ’s impacts , we find substantial negative impacts not just on agricultural exports , but also on light manufacturing exports , such as electronic equipment , footwear , wood manufactures , and travel goods .
We find little apparent effects on heavy industry or raw materials production .
While the negative impact on agricultural exports is consistent with the primary thrust of the climate - economy literature , the negative impact on manufacturing provides further evidence that climate ’s impact on economic activity may be much broader than conventionally implemented in climate - economy models that seek to guide policy .
A further advantage of using export data is that it alleviates concerns about data quality in poor countries .
In particular , several recent studies have questioned the validity of poor country GDP data ( e.g. Deaton 2005 , Young 2009 ) .
Since export data ( particularly exports to the US ) is recorded by the importing country ( e.g. the US ) , and measured with a high degree of accuracy at the importing ports , export data are likely to be much more reliable than national accounts data , particularly for poor countries .
The fact that we find qualitatively similar impacts in the export data as in the national accounts data suggests that the effects we are picking up are , indeed , real effects rather than data artefacts .
The fact that temperature affects exports suggests that trade is also an indirect channel through which climate change may affect the world economy .
Climate change may therefore decrease welfare in rich countries not by affecting production directly but by raising prices and reducing quantities of goods imported from poorer countries .
Analysing the welfare consequences for rich countries is an important trajectory for further work .

eso1015 — Science Release
Triton ’s Summer Sky of Methane and Carbon Monoxide
According to the first ever infrared analysis of the atmosphere of Neptune 's moon Triton , summer is in full swing in its southern hemisphere .
The European observing team used ESO 's Very Large Telescope and discovered carbon monoxide and made the first ground - based detection of methane in Triton 's thin atmosphere .
These observations revealed that the thin atmosphere varies seasonally , thickening when warmed .
" We have found real evidence that the Sun still makes its presence felt on Triton , even from so far away .
This icy moon actually has seasons just as we do on Earth , but they change far more slowly , " says Emmanuel Lellouch , the lead author of the paper reporting these results in Astronomy & Astrophysics .
On Triton , where the average surface temperature is about minus 235 degrees Celsius , it is currently summer in the southern hemisphere and winter in the northern .
As Triton 's southern hemisphere warms up , a thin layer of frozen nitrogen , methane , and carbon monoxide on Triton 's surface sublimates into gas , thickening the icy atmosphere as the season progresses during Neptune 's 165 - year orbit around the Sun .
A season on Triton lasts a little over 40 years , and Triton passed the southern summer solstice in 2000 .
Based on the amount of gas measured , Lellouch and his colleagues estimate that Triton 's atmospheric pressure may have risen by a factor of four compared to the measurements made by Voyager 2 in 1989 , when it was still spring on the giant moon .
The atmospheric pressure on Triton is now between 40 and 65 microbars — 20 000 times less than on Earth .
Carbon monoxide was known to be present as ice on the surface , but Lellouch and his team discovered that Triton 's upper surface layer is enriched with carbon monoxide ice by about a factor of ten compared to the deeper layers , and that it is this upper " film " that feeds the atmosphere .
While the majority of Triton ’s atmosphere is nitrogen ( much like on Earth ) , the methane in the atmosphere , first detected by Voyager 2 , and only now confirmed in this study from Earth , plays an important role as well .
" Climate and atmospheric models of Triton have to be revisited now , now that we have found carbon monoxide and re-measured the methane , " says co-author Catherine de Bergh .
Of Neptune 's 13 moons , Triton is by far the largest , and , at 2700 kilometres in diameter ( or three quarters the Earth ’s Moon ) , is the seventh largest moon in the whole Solar System .
Since its discovery in 1846 , Triton has fascinated astronomers thanks to its geologic activity , the many different types of surface ices , such as frozen nitrogen as well as water and dry ice ( frozen carbon dioxide ) , and its unique retrograde motion [ 1 ] .
Observing the atmosphere of Triton , which is roughly 30 times further from the Sun than Earth , is not easy .
In the 1980s , astronomers theorised that the atmosphere on Neptune 's moon might be as thick as that of Mars ( 7 millibars ) .
It was n't until Voyager 2 passed the planet in 1989 that the atmosphere of nitrogen and methane , at an actual pressure of 14 microbars , 70 000 times less dense than the atmosphere on Earth , was measured .
Since then , ground - based observations have been limited .
Observations of stellar occultations ( a phenomenon that occurs when a Solar System body passes in front of a star and blocks its light ) indicated that Triton ’s surface pressure was increasing in the 1990's .
It took the development of the Cryogenic High - Resolution Infrared Echelle Spectrograph ( CRIRES ) at the Very Large Telescope ( VLT ) to provide the team the chance to perform a far more detailed study of Triton ’s atmosphere .
" We needed the sensitivity and capability of CRIRES to take very detailed spectra to look at the very tenuous atmosphere , " says co-author Ulli Käufl .
The observations are part of a campaign that also includes a study of Pluto ( eso0908 ) .
Pluto , often considered a cousin of Triton and with similar conditions , is receiving renewed interest in the light of the carbon monoxide discovery , and astronomers are racing to find this chemical on the even more distant dwarf planet .
This is just the first step for astronomers using CRIRES to understand the physics of distant bodies in the Solar System .
" We can now start monitoring the atmosphere and learn a lot about the seasonal evolution of Triton over decades , " Lellouch says .
Notes
[ 1 ] Triton is the only large moon in the Solar System with a retrograde motion , which is a motion in the opposite direction to its planet 's rotation .
This is one of the reasons why Triton is thought to have been captured from the Kuiper Belt , and thus shares many features with the dwarf planets , such as Pluto .

Hei , denne artikkelen er over ett år gammel og kan inneholde utdatert informasjon
Solveig ( 38 ) forsket på kreft , ble selv uhelbredelig syk Slår alarm om arbeidsforholdene på Radiumhospitalet .
Sykehuset innrømmer rutinesvikt .
| || ( Dagbladet ) : Solveig Garman - Vik ( 38 ) ble uhelbredelig kreftsyk etter å ha vært utsatt for kreftfremkallende stoffer i elleve år i sin jobb som laboratorietekniker på Radiumhospitalet .
38 - åringens arbeid har lagt grunnlaget for flere gjennombrudd i kreftbehandlingen det siste tiåret .
Nå slår hun alarm om manglende opplæring og sikkerhetsrutiner ved Norges fremste kreftforskningssenter .
- Legene har gitt meg tre måneder igjen å leve .
Ut i fra blodverdiene , er det heller snakk om dager og uker .
Jeg håper min historie kan få alle dem som jobber på laboratoriene og de som leder dem til å ta sikkerheten på alvor , sier 38 - åringen fra sykesengen på Lovisenberg hospice i Oslo .
Fikk nye lunger
I 2006 fikk Garman - Vik konstatert akutt myelogen leukemi ( AML ) og har siden gjennomgått beinmargs - og lungetransplantasjon og flere cellegift - og strålekurer .
Hun ble erklært frisk våren 2009 .
Under en rutinekontroll for lungene for seks uker siden , kom sjokkbeskjeden - kreften er tilbake .
Denne gangen er det ingenting mer legene kan gjøre .
Blandet cellegift
I 1995 begynner Garman - Vik avdeling for Tumorbiologi ved Institutt for kreftforskning på Radiumhospitalet .
Hennes jobb er å injisere rotter og mus med ulike krefttyper , for så å forsøke eksperimentell behandling .
På et lite kontor uten vinduer , arbeider hun ofte 14 - 15 timer om dagen , og overnatter når dyrene trenger smertebehandling om natten .
Hun håndterer daglig virus , cellegift og en rekke andre kjemiske preparater .
Ventet på nytt byggBeskyttelsesutstyret hun bruker , munnbind og sterile hansker , skal hindre overføring av smitte til de immundefekte forsøksdyrene .
Det gir liten beskyttelse for henne mot kjemikaliene og den radioaktive strålingen hun arbeider med .
Dyrenes størrelse gjør at hun må sitte med hodet svært nær dem under behandlingene .
Ved flere anledninger får hun en rusfølelse etter å ha bedøvd dyrene med gass .
HELSEFARLIG ARBEIDSMILJ

Få med hvor fantastiske alle her på Lovisenberg er mot meg , sier Solveig .

- Vi sa ifra mange ganger , uten at noe ble gjort .
Dyreavdelingen ligger i et gammelt bygg med dårlig ventilasjon .
Hele instituttet skulle flytte til et nytt bygg , derfor utsatte man vedlikeholdet av det gamle , forteller Garman - Vik og fortsetter :
- Det var flere kontroller i laboratoriene som førte til strenge beskjeder om å rydde opp i blant annet prøvene som sto lagret overalt .
Heller ikke det ble fulgt opp .
Jeg hadde prøver på mitt kontor som hadde stått der i sikkert ti år .
Jeg tør ikke en gang å tenke på hvor mye stoffer som har lekket ut i rommet i løpet av denne tiden .
Ingen opplæring Arbeidsmiljøet i avdelingen er preget av stor entusiasme og engasjement , men det er samtidig stort fokus på økonomi og tidspress .
- Alle som jobber på Radiumhospitalet må gjennomgå et firetimers kurs i håndtering av cellegift .
Og det var den opplæringen vi fikk , før vi ble kastet ut i det .
Laboratorieansatte får en innføring i mikrobiologi og dyrestell .
Håndtering av de ulike kjemikaliene og virus lærer de derimot av hverandre .
- Vi trodde jo at vi håndterte ting riktig , men visste i mange tilfeller ikke bedre .
Sølte man cellegift , ble det tørket opp med papir som ble lagt i plastposer .
Der sto giften og dampet i rommet , forteller hun og utdyper :
- Uhell med cellegift og radioaktivitet skjedde ofte .
Det ryktes at det skulle være en rapporteringsbok der slike tilfeller skulle skrives ned , men den har jeg aldri sett .
Det var ingen som passet på sikkerheten på laboratoriene .
Vi som teknikere fikk som oftest instrukser om hva vi skulle gjøre på e-post og var stort sett overlatt til oss selv .
Blir akutt sykI 2000 utvikler Garman - Vik en sterk allergi mot dyr , men fortsetter likevel forskningsarbeidet .
Sommeren 2006 forverres allergien og hun får flere infeksjoner og en spesiell og ubehagelig hoste .
I september blir hun akutt syk og diagnostiseres med AML .
Hun gjennomgår cellegiftbehandling og blir erklært kreftfri våren 2007 , men får tilbakefall samme høst .
Det tar nesten ett år fra de første symptomene til Radiumhospitalet varsler NAV og forsikringsselskapet om en mulig yrkesskade .
- Jeg spurte flere ganger om arbeidet kunne ha gjort meg syk , men sjefene mine benektet det .
Det var nå slik at folk kunne få kreft uansett .
Mine kollegaer fikk samtidig munnkurv mot å snakke om saken i media .
« Uegnet til heldagsbruk » Instituttets arbeidsmiljøavdeling gjennomfører likevel en risikovurdering av hennes arbeidsplass i april 2007 .
Det konkluderes med at bruken av kjemikaler og rommets utforming tilsier at det er en risiko for eksponering av helsefarlige stoffer .
Det 12 kvadratmeter store rommet er heller ikke egnet til å benyttes i mer enn 3,5 time per dag .
Fikk samme symptomeneI desember 2008 blir hun tilkjent 2,5 millioner kroner i yrkesskadeerstatning , etter at avdeling for arbeidsmedisin ved Ullevål slår fast at det er mer enn 50 prosent sannsynlighet for at hennes sykdom er yrkesrelatert .
« Hanskene hun brukte viste seg å ikke beskytte mot cellegift etter 3 - 4 timers bruk , slik at man må regne med at en del av det hun blandet ble tatt opp gjennom huden .
Hun skiftet hansker sjelden , for å spare penger for sykehuset ..
Selv om dosen har vært lav , har den vært daglig og kan meget vel ha satt i gang en kreftutvikling hos denne pasienten . »
I forbindelse med utredningen om yrkesskaden , får 38 - åringen en oversikt over de kreftfremkallende stoffene hun hadde arbeidet med .
- Jeg fikk sjokk da jeg så listen .
Det var 14 tettskrevne sider med preparater .
Da ble jeg også veldig redd for mine kollegaer som fremdeles jobbet i avdelingen .
En av dem hadde de samme symptomene som meg , men har ikke fått påvist kreft , og sluttet etter at jeg ble syk .
DÅRLIG BESKYTTELSE : Utstyrt med sterile hansker og munnbind , jobbet Solveig svært tett inntil dyrene hun behandlet .
Selv om hanskene bare beskyttet i 3 - 4 timer , ble vi oppfordret til å bruke det samme paret lengst mulig for å spare penger , forteller hun .
Det er naturlig å anta at noe av cellegiften ble tatt opp gjennom huden .

Riktig utstyr og ventilasjonDet er nettopp bekymringene for kollegaene og andre laboratorieansatte som er Garman - Viks motivasjon for stå fram med sin historie .
- Kanskje jeg er litt naiv , men jeg trodde at arbeidsmiljøet på laboratoriene har blitt bedre de siste årene .
Men det er mye som tyder på at det en lang vei å gå .
Det er ikke lenge siden Universitet i Oslo måtte stenge et titalls laboratorier som ikke hadde ordentlig ventilasjon , og det etter at de ansatte hadde klaget i over 30 år , forteller 38 - åringen , som tilbringer de siste dagene med familien ved sin side .
Stemmen er hes og det er av og til vanskelig å huske ordene .
Budskapet er likevel krystallklart :
- Ingen andre skal trenge å gå gjennom det jeg har gjort .
Ikke la økonomien og prestasjonspresset komme foran sikkerheten .
Gi nødvendig opplæring i håndtering og oppbevaring av cellegift og kjemikalier , sørg for god ventilasjon og riktig beskyttelsesutstyr og få på plass rutiner til å følge dette opp .
Svikt i rutineneOslo universitetssykehus kjenner ikke til andre tilfeller av kreft eller alvorlige sykdom ved den aktuelle avdelingen .
- Sykehuset ønsker å uttrykke stor medfølelse for henne og at hun er rammet av så alvorlig sykdom .
Dette er en fryktelig trist sak , selvfølgelig mest for henne og hennes pårørende , men også for arbeidskollegene .
Sykehuset har hele tiden vært opptatt av å ivareta henne og samtidig sikre arbeidsmiljøet slik at dette ikke kan skje igjen .
Alle som jobber samme sted er kartlagt og det er ikke funnet flere sykdomstilfeller , sier Einar Hysing , konstituert direktør for medisin og helsefag , Oslo universitetssykehus .
Det er løpende gjort HMS - tiltak og selve dyreavdelingen vil i løpet av kort tid være på plass i det nye forskningsbygget i moderne lokaler , utdyper han .
Sykehuset innrømmer at de har sviktet , og sier de har endret rutiner på grunn av saken .
- Dette er en meget trist sak .
Det var svikt i arbeidsrutinene den gangen , og både da og i etterkant har vi jobbet for at dette ikke
skulle kunne skje igjen .
Dette er gjort både gjennom endring av arbeidsrutiner for håndtering av kjemikalier og i utforming av det fysiske arbeidsmiljø , blant annet for ventilasjon , sier forskningsdirektør Erlend Smeland ved Oslo universitetssykehus .

Authentic and Original New Orleans
I am part of the first of many confused generations to have lived only to witness a pop culture dominated by reproductions ( of reproductions ) of music , fashion , film , etc .
And every so often , the repercussions surface .
Such as when my co-workers discovered ( in utter horror ) that I had neither heard of The Police nor their hit song “ Every Breath You Take ” ( 1983 ) , despite my prolonged obsession with Puff Daddy ’s tribute to Notorious B.I.G. , “ I ’ll be missing you ” ( 1997 ) .
While the general omnipresence of recycled material has taught me to treasure anything truly original and good ( with the exception of Forever 21 ) , embarrassing situations like these have conditioned me to use words like “ authentic ” and “ classic ” with excessive caution .
But really , what is “ authentic ” ?
A reproductions is , in fact , an authentic product ( and fascinating documentation ) of pop culture ’s evolution .
And what makes something “ classic ” more deserving of respect ?
Many of today ’s most revered “ classic ” artists were completely ostracized in their day because of their originality .
Treme also challenges the meaning and significance of these words used to describe New Orleans .
In the second episode of Treme , street musicians Sonny ( piano ) and Annie ( fiddle ) are asked to play “ something authentic ” ( after having performed Careless Love ) by a group of church volunteers in town to help rebuild homes .
Sonny scornfully offers to play the clichéd spiritual “ When the Saints Go Marching In ” for an additional fee , which is earnestly accepted ( to his chagrin ) .
This provides us with a well - needed reminder that New Orleans is a constantly evolving city that continues to produce some of nation ’s best original work .
So in honor of this message , I set out to find and explore a current authentic and original ( obviously ) New Orleanian album and dish .
x
Ya - Ka-May
But I did n’t have to look very far .
Galactic , a seriously funkdafied jazz quintet known for fusing the modern and retrospective musical styles of New Orleans , was featured in the latter scenes of the same episode .
Galactic produces an avant - garde sound by incorporating progressive electronic techniques , and a wide range of musical genres , from hip - hop , rock , blues , to electronica .
And thanks to my musically au courant boyfriend ( who first introduced me to Galactic ) , I had a copy of their recently launched album , “ Ya - Ka - May ” , which so happened to be the perfect subject for my investigation .
Ya - Ka -May might just be the most entertaining original musical treat of the century ( for the ears AND ass ) .
You will never hear anything quite like it , and you will never otherwise see your booty bounce in such an uncontrollably delightful and inexplicably soulful manner .
If you are sneakily procrastinating in an office with the type of cubicles that reach just above the shoulders , I suggest that you wait to get home before watching the two videos below .
But if you are in an environment to safely act upon a bootyful call , by all means , listen / watch it all !
** My favorite songs on the album are “ Boe Money ” , “ Katey vs. Nobby ” , “ Double It ” , and “ You Do n’t Know ” , which are all not available online ( for free ) .
But check out the samples here .
There is a definitive explanation for the corollary booty bounce : “ bounce ” !
Confused ?
Bounce music is a style of hip - hop native to New Orleans , characterized by “ call and response ” ( over lyricism ) and hypersexual chants and call - outs ( the Mardi Gras Indian kind , not the NYC construction worker kind ) .
Bounce influenced much of the nationally recognized southern rap of the ‘ 90s , such as the works of Juvenile , Three 6 Mafia , and Lil Jon .
Anyways , Ya - Ka - May creatively incorporates the sounds of new bounce artists ( Cheeky Blakk , Big Freedia , Katey Red , Sissy Nobby ) with the “ seemingly disparate ” but “ intrinsically connected ” sounds of the new and established New Orleanian jazz , funk , and brass artists ( Trombone Shorty , Corey Henry , Irma Thomas , Big Chief Bo Dollis , Allen Toussaint ) .
Hence the booty bounce !

Ya - Ka -May , the Soup
As it turns out , “ Ya - Ka - May ” is the name of a very peculiar and popular New Orleanian street food !
Ya - Ka -May is a multi-ethnic noodle soup that much like Galactic ’s Ya - Ka - May album , is composed of “ seemingly disparate ” ingredients – spaghetti pasta , beef broth , tender stewed beef , green onion , boiled egg , Cajun seasoning , soy sauce , and hot sauce .
Ya - Ka -May is typically sold in Asian - American run bodegas in predominantly African - American neighborhoods across New Orleans , served in Styrofoam cups , and consumed with forks .
It is also perceived as a miracle hangover cure , hence the nickname , “ Old Sober ” .
The origins of Ya - Ka - May are heavily disputed .
But I am inclined to agree with Leah Chase , a prominent New Orleans Chef ( aka Queen of Creole Cuisine ) whose restaurant , Dooky Chase , served as a gathering / meeting place during the Civil Rights movement .
According to Mrs. Chase and a number of other local sources , the concept of Ya - Ka - May originated in New Orleans ’ now extinct Chinatown , which was established by the Chinese immigrants who were brought from California in the mid 19th century to build the railroads in Southern Louisiana .
The Chinatown was further developed by the Chinese immigrants who came to work the sugar plantations after the fall of slavery .
Check out what Leah Chase has to say here :
Legend has it that this geographical hub was adjoined to a once thriving African - American neighborhood .
And it was during this time that the basic Asian concept of noodles and soup evolved ( according to local tastes ) to what is now known as Ya - Ka - May .
The New Orleans Chinatown and surrounding districts ultimately languished , but the dish was “ kept alive by the poor , the hung - over , and the corner markets run by Asians serving Blacks , ” according to the Po Boy Views of New Orleans .
Ya - Ka -May is very easy and inexpensive to make .
And as you will see , it also has a ton of soul .
The best part ?
It is incredibly flavorful , yet gentle on the stomach ( grant it you do n’t overdo it with the hot sauce ) , and therefore , the perfect New Orleans “ Old Sober ” !
So there you have it !
An authentic and original New Orleans album and dish !

1 . Place the stewing beef in a Crockpot ( note – I halved the recipe ) .
Add the water , beef bouillon cube , Cajun seasoning , onion powder , salt , and pepper .
Cook on low for 6 - 8 hours .
** If you do n’t have a Crockpot , place all of the above ingredients in a stockpot and bring to a boil ; reduce the heat and simmer for 2 hours , or until the meat is tender .
After 6 hours :
2. Meanwhile , cook the spaghetti noodles according to package instructions , and boil the eggs .
3 . To assemble the soup , place a serving of spaghetti noodles in the bottom of a bowl .
Ladle about 1 - 2 cups of the beef and broth over the noodles so that they are almost completely submerged .
4 . Add a boiled egg half .
Sprinkle with sliced green onion and toasted sesame seeds .
Add a few dashes of soy sauce , hot sauce and Worcestershire sauce ( optional ) .
Yes , that is Katrina Storm Sauce you see there .
I picked it up along with the Slap Ya Mama during my last visit to Natchitoches .
And voilà !
A steaming hot and spicy bowl of Ya - Ka Mein .
Ok .. let ’s try …
** slurp slurp slurp ** ** Mmmmmmmm ** ** slurp slurp slurp ** ** Mmmmmmmm **
OMG , I want more .
But I ’m so full .
I ca n’t really justify eating another bowl .
Well … unless ….
Wanna get it crunk ?
Until next time …..

Earlier today Revolution Muslim , the Islamic group that posted a veiled threat against South Park this week , called us " Darwinist faggots who are as despicable as the rest , walking around eating your Triscuits . "
But , we wondered , why Triscuits ?
Younus Abdullah Mohammed , a member of the group , was behind the original quote .
When pressed on his choice of Triscuits as a snack - based insult , he was curt in his response .
" It does n't matter what your favorite crackers or cookies are .
They are not more important than the hegemonic wars the West is fighting against Islam . "
He refused to elaborate further on his disdain for the delicious wheaty squares .
The Triscuit website yields a few clues .
Perhaps the squares , made of " soft white winter wheat , " are too decadent .
Indeed the ingredient is described as " a kind of cashmere of wheat because of its soft texture and delicate taste . "
Basil Maglaris , a spokesperson for Kraft Foods , the company that makes Triscuits , was nevertheless also stumped when asked why Islamic extremists might target his innocuous and nutritious charges .
" I do n't think we have any comment on that , " he said .
" Triscuits are a very popular cracker .
We have a broad variety of people who love them these days . "
Except Islamic extremists ?
" ( Pause . )
Everyone loves Triscuits , and we hope that everyone enjoys them . "
We consider this to be a coded call for unity and peace .
The religious and the secular alike must enjoy the crackers of their choice , free from the tyranny of snack censorship .
There is a sense today in which the imaginativeness and breadth of Popper 's philosophical system has been somewhat forgotten .
For the most part , elements of his philosophy such as his philosophy of science are treated in isolation and then compared unfavourably to the work of writers such as Kuhn .
In courses we teach that Popper failed to understand the complexity of scientific methodology and scientific culture , and is thus an illustration of what goes wrong when philosophers treat science abstractly , even though it was the abstractions of logical empiricism that he was chiefly writing against .
History is thus in some sense monumentally unfair to Popper by dividing his philosophical systems up in this way .
The real ingenuity and strength of Popper 's philosophy lies at a deeper level , in its proposed unification of all human knowledge on an anti-foundationalist methodological ( rather than theoretical ) notion of rationality and objectivity .
This unification ties science together with political theory , liberalism , and human freedom within one unified epistemic and ethical system .
Gattei's text sets out to reassert the revolutionary character of Popper 's work in the philosophy of science , while emphasizing that this philosophy is itself just one aspect of a revolutionary epistemological program , and that it can be fully articulated , understood , and thus properly valued only in relation to this program .
The program is that of ' critical rationalism ' , which breaks the centuries long tradition of linking rationality and objectivity to justification by understanding rationalism as a methodological commitment ( rather than a theoretically justified notion ) .
In particular , the commitment is to critical dialogue ( or falsificationism in the context of science ) in all human intellectual pursuits .
As is well known , Popper rejects all forms of epistemological foundationalism .
He takes seriously , unlike many then and since , the problem of induction as the end of all attempts to justify knowledge , and maintains instead that the rationality and objectivity of knowledge must rest on the manner in which claims are discussed , criticized and rejected .
As Gattei puts it , rationality in this sense is not so much a property of knowledge as a task for humans .
For a rational endeavour , indeterminism is the only consistent metaphysics and democracy the only consistent political system .
The choice to follow rationality is a moral decision and does not itself require justification .
Likewise truth should not be understood as dependent on justification .
Truth is a regulative ideal that guides the very process of knowledge formation and sustains it , even if truth itself remains unattainable or unknowable .
Realism is the only metaphysics consistent with this sort of pursuit of truth .
For Gattei critical rationalism is the starting point of all of Popper 's philosophy , not just in its scope but also in its temporal development .
Popper was driven by the principle of critical rationalism throughout his intellectual life .
Gattei therefore uses ' critical rationalism ' as the organizing and unifying principle of his account of Popper 's philosophy of science and its development .
This allows him to present Popper 's work coherently , as well as with remarkable simplicity and clarity .
The book is divided into five chapters , the first on Popper 's intellectual development in Vienna from 1927 to 1934 .
This provides the context for his development of critical rationalism in the Logik der Forschung , which was published 1934 in a series edited by Philipp Frank and Moritz Schlick .
Gattei tries to show how Popper 's philosophy emerges out of his own attempts to use the tools and principles of logical positivism , such as inductivism and conventionalism , which he abandoned one by one under the influence of the Würzburg school .
The demarcation problem itself was critical in leading Popper towards his falsifiability criterion .
Gattei 's point in fleshing out this history is faithful to his main principle of illustrating the character of Popper 's ideas through their own history and the work he had to do to arrive at them .
Unlike Popper 's autobiographical accounts of his reasoning ( framed somewhat in terms of his own yet uninvented methodology ) , this account is full of Popper 's missteps , wrong directions , and intellectual impasses .
In this discussion , Gattei does not fully take into account recent research on the relation between Popper and the Vienna Circle , in particular his encounter with the anti-foundationalist Otto Neurath , and his conversations with Herbert Feigl , Felix Kaufmann , and Viktor Kraft , who had developed a critical realism earlier than and independently of Popper .
Regrettably , Gattei reproduces uncritically some related myths ( following Popper 's autobiographical chapter " Who Killed Logical Positivism ? " ) about Popper 's intellectual development in the context of logical empiricism .
The next two chapters shift from an historical perspective to a more descriptive one , giving broad accounts of Popper 's philosophy of science -- relying principally on the Logic of Scientific Discovery -- and his position on metaphysical positions such as realism and indeterminism .
These chapters illustrate the power and reach of critical rationalism and antifoundationalism .
The fourth chapter is probably the most critical for Gattei 's interpretation ( and certainly the most interesting chapter in the book ) .
It challenges the orthodoxy view , which misleadingly assumes that Kuhn ( perhaps because of his enormous influence and his responsibility for the so called ' historical turn ' ) broke the grip of logical empiricism and linguistic analysis on philosophy of science .
As Gattei argues , the claim that Kuhn undermined a whole philosophical tradition is wrong .
Unlike Popper's , Kuhn 's philosophy of science is still committed to the foundationalist tenets of logical empiricism .
Kuhn , like Wittgenstein before , breaks the link of justification and objective truth with rationality .
He argues that justification and hence rationality is internal to the linguistic or conceptual system ( or paradigm ) in which scientists operate , thereby hugely undermining the epistemic claims of science .
Nevertheless this conclusion is premised on the belief that rationality requires justification and so falls back on the essential foundationalist presupposition .
In this sense Kuhn is unoriginal , merely extending foundationalism to its logical conclusion .
He still in some sense tries to resolve the problem of induction , just not objectively .
Popper on the other hand abandons the connection between rationality and justification and explores a purely anti-foundationalist epistemology .
This marks Popper as a genuine revolutionary .
From this point of view , we can better analyze the agreement and disageement between Kuhn and Popper .
As Gattei points out , there is agreement on quite a few issues .
Methodologically , both are responding to logical empiricism .
Also , both accept the theory - ladeness of observation and reject the idea that science proceeds by accumulation , emphasising the revolutionary processes by which scientific theories are overthrown .
Nevertheless the differences that derive from their disagreement over the foundations of knowledge are profound .
For Popper , criticism and justification are separable , with criticism itself requiring no justification .
As Gattei points out , for Kuhn ( and Wittgenstein earlier ) there can be no separation of the two .
Criticism always operates within some framework , and we cannot challenge the framework , only ask questions within it .
In addition , revolutions for Kuhn are rare episodes while rationality implies commitment to a paradigm , whereas for Popper rationality requires the continual overthrow and challenge of established ideas .
For Popper ' normal science ' is continual revolution .
Further , we can , according to Popper , define a notion of progress through refutations , which Popper does and formalizes somewhat with his concept of verisimilitude , whereas Kuhn holds that progress can be defined only sociologically or psychologically .
While for Popper science is rational by virtue of its commitment to the unceasing and relentless criticism of its theories and assumptions , for Kuhn it is the very relaxation of this criticism that marks the beginning of normal science , which is fundamentally dogmatic .
Kuhn 's scientific community is therefore close - minded .
Gattei contends , however , that their disagreement is basically over truth :
The core difference between Popper and Kuhn is not about the possibility of falsification , incommensurability , or the existence of normal science .
It is about the role of truth , the value of criticism , and the nature of the bond that unites scientists into a community . ( 75 )
Both agree that there is no objective criterion for truth , but Popper asserts that truth nonetheless takes a regulative role in scientific practice , whereas for Kuhn truth is of no use at all for understanding the problem - solving behavior of scientists .
Kuhn , however , as Gattei points out , confused the concept of truth with its criterion , thus taking it to be a vacuous notion because of the lack of an objective criterion to determine it .
For Popper truth is necessary to make sense of what scientists are doing and to sustain the very falsificationist methodology they apply .
These insights are quite important ; they provide a clear contrast with Kuhn and emphasize the novelty of Popper 's approach .
Gattei comments ,
Instead of trying to build on the ruins of the collapsed edifice of the positivist research programme , as Kuhn himself did ( and as his heirs and those of the Vienna Circle keep trying to do , only working on additional layers of ruins ) , we are presented with the project for a new edifice . ( 76 )
Kuhn should be read as dealing with the old problem of how knowledge is guaranteed or justified , but seeking a foundation for knowledge that is external to philosophy .
But here again we encounter the inadequate historiography that takes the " received view " as representative of the program of logical empiricism as well as of the project of the International Encyclopedia of Unified Science -- to which Kuhn contributed his Structure of Scientific Revolutions ( 1962 ) .
It would have been much more innovative to reconstruct the discussion between Kuhn and Popper ( together with Lakatos and Feyerabend ) on the occasion of the LSE conference in 1965 .
The last chapter puts critical rationalism into its broader context as part of an ethical system that frames a general approach to all human activity , characterized by a willingness
to entertain any position , and hold anything in it … as open to criticism , without resorting to any authority , faith , or irrational commitment .
Any position may be held rationally provided that it remain open to criticism and survives severe tests . ( 80 )
It is natural of course to ask the question :
Are n't we then required to justify our commitment to such rationality ?
Not for Popper , according to Gattei .
Popper , he argues , takes it to be simply a moral choice .
In this respect Gattei argues against Bartley that Popper was falling into the trap of trying to ' justify ' critical rationalism .
Popper , Gattei asserts , made no such argument .
His critical rationalism should be expressed not as a theory but as an attitude , " that is a disposition , a readiness to listen to each other 's critical arguments , to search for one 's own mistakes , and to learn from them , following the best argument in a critical debate " ( 81 ) .
This choice determines one 's very attitude and approach to life both scientifically and politically .
As such , critical rationalism lies at the beginning of all philosophical discussions and helps them progress in parallel ways .
In all these respects , Gattei gives an informative reconstruction of Popper 's philosophy of science that emphasizes its essential unity , coherence and simplicity , and particularly its revolutionary aspect , which marks its real achievement .
Our criticisms stem from the fact that what Gattei is doing here is to some extent a rational reconstruction of Popper 's philosophical system .
As such it perhaps runs the risk of giving too much coherence to Popper 's work .
This is so especially in the context of his metaphysics , where one has to look at a wider range of Popper 's texts from different periods to piece together an overall account .
This , however , is not the essential problem we have with this book .
Our problem is with the essentially hagiographical modus operandi , which gives a misleading impression of the strength of Popper 's philosophy .
For example , Gattei never mentions the problems Popper had to address in " A Reply to my Critics " , problems that to some extent force Popper to weaken his own claims .
In particular , there is no mention of Lakatos ' strong criticism that , on Popper 's terms , falsifications are very rare in scientific practice .
Non-corroborations are not necessarily falsifications and are usually not perceived in practice as falsifications .
This is a problem with which Popper struggled , eventually agreeing that auxiliary hypotheses , etc. are part of any testing and part of the package that is falsified by a negative test result .
Hence he was forced to shift his demarcation criterion from falsification itself to the way in which falsifications of theoretical and auxiliary groupings are dealt with .
Ad hoc shifts simply to preserve a theory from falsification become the unscientific elements .
Perhaps more significantly , it is difficult to find the basis upon which the falsification criterion could be anything other than conventional in Popper 's system , given his commitment to theory - ladenness .
Popper of course vigorously rejected conventionalism , yet it seems a central part of falsification .
Of course we are free to question the conventions associated with observation .
Doing so , however , seems to undermine the point of falsification as a methodology , since it depends on having some kind of stable basis for relying on falsifications as objective events .
If changing observation conventions can render previously falsified theories valid again , then it seems impossible to have any kind of progress .
These are well known criticisms and deserve more of an airing in any account of Popper 's work , particularly since they were criticisms to which Popper himself had to respond .
Nevertheless the principal problem with Gattei 's reconstruction is that it papers over the critical interpretative question for Popper scholarship .
This is the deep tension throughout Popper 's account of science ( and his general epistemological program ) over whether he is giving a descriptive or normative account of science .
This is often apparent in deep ambiguities in what he has to say .
His critical rationalism can be read as a normative program , especially when its link to ethics is emphasized .
His account of science often takes a perspective that is less about what scientists do and more about what critical rationalist methodology would require of scientists .
How we interpret Popper in this respect completely determines how we respond to his arguments , and of course ignoring the issue is likely to give a coherence to Popper 's assertions that does n't exist .
Popper can in fact be read as quite uncertain about the normative and descriptive dimension of his programme with respect to science .
Gattei however does n't discuss this question but plays Popper 's game of slipping between description and normativity .
This has ramifications that Gattei overlooks for how we understand the clash between Kuhn and Popper .
To some extent Kuhn and Popper are talking past one another .
Kuhn sets out to give a chiefly descriptive account of science , and does so , on the basis of historical patterns .
Popper is working normatively from his critical rationalist methodology , which itself could be taken as a criticism of what Kuhn sees as the normal scientific practice unquestioningly accepting the paradigm .
In this sense the normative Popper and the descriptive Kuhn do n't necessarily clash .
The level of miscommunication between Popper and Kuhn in this respect is at least worth considering .
However of course this only goes so far .
When Kuhn decides to draw lessons for metaphysics and epistemology from his descriptive account of science , then a clash between the two is inevitable .
Gattei in fact rightly describes the encounter between Popper and Kuhn as basically a dispute over metaphysics .
On this level , Gattei 's point about the revolutionary nature of Popper 's work holds , and Kuhn is more or less simply interpreting his descriptive results in terms of a foundationalist epistemology .
In sum , Gattei 's Karl Popper 's Philosophy of Science
is an important reassertion of the value , novelty , and coherency of Popper 's programme .
It is an important historiographical contribution , particularly because it leads us to reevaluate our tradition of painting Kuhn as an epistemological radical , when that title more properly belongs to Popper .
Chapter 1 does not fully come up to the current state of the art , but Chapters 2 and 3 provide a useful introduction to Popper 's philosophy of science suitable for students and researchers alike .
Chapter 4 on Kuhn and Popper should be fruitful for future scholarship .
Recently , I bought a pair of those new Western Digital Caviar Green drives .
These new drives represent a transitional point from 512 - byte sectors to 4096 - byte sectors .
A number of articles have been published recently about this , explaining the benefits and some of the challenges that we ’ll be facing during this transition .
Reportedly , Linux should unaffected by some of the pitfalls of this transition , but my own experimentation has shown that Linux is just as vulnerable to the potential performance impact as Windows XP .
Despite this issue being known about for a long time , basic Linux tools for partitioning and formatting drives have not caught up .
The problem most likely to hit you with one of these drives is very slow write performance .
This is caused by improper logical - to - physical sector alignment .
OS ’s like Linux use 4 K blocks ( or multiples of 4 K ) to store data , which matches well with the physical sector .
However , nothing restricts you from creating a partition that starts on an odd - numbered 512 - byte logical sector .
This misalignment causes a performance hit since the drive has to read and rewrite the 4 K sectors with whatever 512 - byte slices changed .
WD claims to have done some studies and found that Windows XP was hardest hit .
By default , the first primary partition starts on LBA block 63 , which obviously is not a multiple of 8 .
They provide a utility to shift partitions by 512 bytes to line them up .
WD also tested other OS ’s and declared both MacOS X and Linux to be “ unaffected ” .
I do n’t know about MacOS , but with regard to Linux , they are not entirely correct .
Following are the results of my experimentation .
The first thing I did was test the performance effect itself .
It has been suggested that WD might internally offset block addresses by 1 so that LBA 63 maps to LBA 64 .
This way , Windows XP partitions would not really be misaligned .
I performed a test that demonstrates that WD has not done this .
I ’ve included the source code to my test at the end of the article .
This program does random 4 K block writes to the drive at a selectable 512 - byte alignment .
So if I pass 0 to the program , it runs the test on 4 K boundaries .
If I pass 1 , the test is on 4 K boundaries plus 512 .
The effects of this test are amplified by the use of O_SYNC , which insists that all writes hit the disk immediately , but it demonstrates the problem .
Note that I realize that all my testing is “ quick and dirty , ” but I ’m just trying to demonstrate a point , not analyze it in painful detail .
1000 random aligned 4 K writes consistently take between 7 and 8 seconds .
1000 random unaligned 4 K writes consistently take between 22 and 24 seconds .
Now , this just demonstrates the problem we already know about .
What about how it affects filesystems .
Next , to formatting the drives .
I have two drives , / dev/sdc and / dev/sdd , both identical Green drives .
I partitioned them as follows :
For / dev/sdd , I used fdisk to add a Linux ( 0x83 ) primary partition , taking up the whole disk , using fdisk defaults .
By default , the partition starts at LBA 63 .
For / dev/sdc , I used fdisk the same as with sdd , but after creating the partition , I realigned it .
I did this by entering expert mode ( “ x ” ) , then setting the start sector ( “ b ” ) to 64 .
Once that was finished , I formatted both drives using the command “ time mke2fs / dev/sdc1 ” ( and sdd1 ) .
/ dev/sdc , which was aligned , took 5 m 45.716s to format .
/ dev/sdd , which was not aligned , took 19 m 53.609s to format .
That ’s a difference of greater than a factor of three !
Now to file tests .
I ran two test .
The first test was to copy one large file .
I have a Windows XP disk image for qemu-kvm that takes up 18308968 KiB .
I copied the file ( from my much faster 7200 RPM drives in RAID1 configuration ) to one drive , then the other , then I reran the first test to avoid buffering effects .
$ time cp winxp.img /mnt/sdc # ALIGNED real 5m9.360s user 0m0.090s sys 0m20.420s $ time cp winxp.img /mnt/sdd # UNALIGNED real 13m26.943s user 0m0.110s sys 0m19.350s
Pretty striking difference .
I did n’t really expect this .
Since this is one large file , and it can be written linearly to the disk , I expected that we would see a very slight performance hit .
I think this is something that itself should be investigated .
There ’s no reason for long contiguous writes to get hit this hard , and it ’s something that the kernel developers need to look into and fix .
To complete the testing , I next tried random writes .
I have some stuff I ’ve been working on for school , lots of small files of all sorts of different sizes .
So I decided to copy that stuff recursively .
$ time cp -r Computer Architecture / / mnt/sdc # ALIGNED real 42m9.602s user 0m0.680s sys 1m59.070s $ time cp -r Computer Architecture / / mnt/sdd # UNALIGNED real 138m54.610s user 0m0.660s sys 2m15.630s
This performance hit of a factor of about 3.3 is surprisingly consistent across operations .
And this is severe .
I ’ve read people guessing that there would be a 30 % performance loss .
But a 230 % performance loss is exceptionally bad .
In conclusion , these drives are on the market now .
We ’ve known about this issue for a LONG time , and now it ’s here , and we have n’t fully prepared .
Some distros , like Ubuntu , use “ parted ” , which has a very nice “ –align optimal ” option that will do the right thing .
But parted is incomplete , and we must rely on tools like fdisk for everything else .
But anyone manually formatting drives based on popular how - tos that pop up at the top of Google searches is going to cause themselves a major performance hit , because mention of this alignment issue and how to fix it is conspicuously absent .
I ’ve done a lot of googling on this topic , and as far as I can tell , this issue has really not been taken seriously .
There ’s plenty of discussion on aligning partitions for SSDs and VMWare volumes , but nothing about the issue relating to these new hard drives .
And no fix for fdisk .
Most of the drives still being sold today have 512 - byte sectors , so lots of people will say “ not my problem ” , but it will become your problem soon since all the hard disk manufacturers have been very eager to make the switch .
This time next year you may have trouble buying a drive without 4 K sectors , and you ’re going to want all your Linux distros to handle them properly .
Evaluation setup and methodology :
Gentoo ~amd64 system with 2.6.31 - gentoo - r5 kernel
fdisk version : fdisk ( util- linux - ng 2.17 )
The drives are identical , but I did not try swapping configurations to make sure that one drive is n’t fundamentally slower than the other .
Core 2 Quad at 2.33GHz ( Q9450 ) , 8 GiB of RAM
MSI X48 Platinum motherboard — Intel X48 Express + ICH9R

Below is a powerful article posted on Iranian.com that talks about the persecution of Baha ’is in Iran as a strategy of the Iranian regime to pit one group against the other .
The writer contends the accusation leveled against the Baha ’i community in Iran in general and the trumped - up charges against the Yaran 7 in particular are opposed to the basic principles of the Baha ’i Faith .
A very moving comment at the end of this article is also posted here .
In it , an Iranian unanimous commenter apologizes for being brain - washed by the Iranian regime into mistrusting and suspecting Baha ’is .
Baha ’is are often accused by Iran of being spies for foreign regimes , despite the fact that the Baha ’i Faith originated in Persia .
Struggle fought in hearts
Human rights in Iran
by Randolph Dobbs
08 - Apr-2010
Human rights and globalization share a common vocabulary .
No matter where people may live in the world they share a vital interest in the basic requirements of liberty , including the right to “ freedom of thought , conscience and religion ; ” the right to “ freedom of opinion and expression ” and the “ right to peaceful assembly and association . ”
These and 27 other specific freedoms outlined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights were adopted by the United Nations more than 60 years ago .
Partly as a result of this declaration as well as a growing global view of social responsibility , human rights transcend national borders .
Globalization is more than just economic interests — it includes a social and political interdependence that promotes human rights worldwide .
Unfortunately for the people of Iran and most especially for Iranian Baha ’is , human rights are neither widely recognized by the Islamic government nor is their application evenly distributed .
Yet human rights are universal exactly because they define the interests of those without power — even in authoritarian states like Iran .
No country in the world has unlimited power to do whatever it wants to its own people .
The very idea of national sovereignty includes a dual responsibility : to respect the sovereignty of other countries but also to respect the rights of its own citizens .
As a member of the U.N. and signatory to a number of international conventions , the Islamic Republic of Iran has to face some tough questions about the treatment of its own people and especially the 300,000 Iranian members of the Baha ’i Faith .
Baha ’is have been persecuted ever since their religion was founded in mid-19th century Persia ( present - day Iran ) .
The Iranian Baha ’i community is often viewed as the canary - in - the - coal - mine regarding human rights abuses because as the nation ’s largest non-Muslim religious minority they suffer the most discrimination — denied access to higher education , prevented from working in government jobs or receiving federal pensions to cite only a few examples .
Since obedience to government wherever Baha ’is reside in the world is a matter of religious principle , the Baha ’is in Iran are a convenient scapegoat for the Islamic regime which seeks to redirect public ire over its difficulties .
Following the Ashura Protests last December , a group of Baha ’is were arrested on January 3 under the guise that they were responsible for the anti-government turmoil .
But Baha ’is must also refrain from involvement in partisan politics whether local , national or international .
In the spring of 2008 , seven Baha ’i leaders were rounded up during the night and have been held in Tehran ’s notorious Evin Prison ever since .
Faced with trumped - up charges of “ spying for the state of Israel ” and “ spreading corruption on earth ” their fate may be decided at a trial in a Revolutionary Court set for April 10 .
Their families and fellow Baha ’is around the world have good reason to fear what may result should they be found guilty .
Some 25 years ago members of Iran ’s national - level Baha ’i leadership were arrested in a similar manner and executed by the Iranian government .
The Islamic Republic of Iran promotes division within its own country by pitting one group against another .
To make this policy effective Iran has tried to isolate its people from accurate reporting of the news .
According to Reporters Without Borders , the Paris - based organization that promotes freedom of the press , Iran has more journalists in prison than any other country in the world — a distinction it has earned not only by jailing foreign correspondents but also by depriving its own citizens of the freedom of thought and conscience .
Iran , in fact , controls every aspect of its domestic news even down to minor details .
Last November the country ’s largest circulation newspaper , the Hamshahri , was temporarily closed down after it published a photograph of a Baha ’i temple in India as part of an advertisement for tourism to that country .
Any kind of criticism , foreign or domestic , only fuels the Iranian Islamic regime ’s worst expectations .
The government is sensitive to international embarrassment and highly reactive as is clearly shown by its response to ongoing public protests over the Iranian presidential election held last June .
The international community , including the American government , should continue to highlight Iran ’s human rights abuses as such global attention makes it more difficult to continue rights violations without being noticed .
What is also needed is a sustainable policy that promotes human rights , encourages international support and does so in a way that does n’t antagonize Iran ’s historical anxiety over foreign influence or heighten concerns over the loss of traditional values — a sustainable policy , in other words , that appeals to the Iranian government ’s better judgment .
In essence , the abrasive relationship between Iran and the rest of the world , particularly between Iran and the West , masks a deeper truth .
Iran needs the rest of the world more than the rest of the world needs Iran .
That “ the earth is but one country and mankind its citizens ” is an oft - quoted excerpt from the 19th century writings of the prophet - founder of the Baha ’i Faith , Bahá ’u 'lláh .
Universal human rights and international conventions may not represent global governance , but the recent earthquakes in Haiti followed by those in Chile and just last week the modest quake in Los Angeles , pose an excellent metaphor for global unity and the interconnectedness of nations — what happens in one part of the world affects people living elsewhere .
Whatever happens in the show - trial of seven Baha ’i leaders in Iran , the larger issue is the fate of the Iranian people .
The question is :
What kind of nation does Iran aspire to become ?
Will it remain a repressive society unable to overcome the effects of religious bigotry ?
Or will it live up to the ideals not only of international human rights but also Islamic standards of justice ?
Bahai’s have the greatest respect for all religions .
The sacred writings of the Baha ’i Faith refer to Islam as “ the blessed and luminous religion of God ” and Iran , itself , as having a glorious future as a “ focal center of divine splendors ” to match its proud history of achievement .
In the face of injustice people turn to external interventions .
They march in protest , conduct economic boycotts , work to enact various laws , abandon old policies and adopt new ones .
Bahai ’s believe that the ultimate struggle for justice in Iran will not be waged in the streets of Tehran , will not be contested in Islamic courts but will , instead , be fought in the hearts of the Iranian people .

The U.S. Supreme Court will be holding a private conference hearing on Friday , April 23rd 2010 , to determine whether to hold a full court hearing on corruption charges within the Los Angeles County government for illegally imprisoning attorney Richard Fine .
A rally to acknowledge the U.S. Supreme Court hearing will be held at the L.A. Superior Court building at 8 am Tuesday April 20th , by supporters of Richard Fine ’s release from illegal imprisonment .
Mainstream media has avoided any mention of this epic corruption scandal , despite its significance , and now it is on its way to the the Supreme Court .
Richard Fine , who holds a PhD in international law and served as an anti-trust prosecutor at the Department of Justice in Washington D.C. , has been in jail in the L.A. County Jail for over a year in solitary confinement .
He never had a trial , there has been no conviction , nor any sentence to keep him there .
Sheriff LeRoy Baca claims he does not know why Fine is in jail , yet he keeps him there and failed to answer Fine ’s Writ of Habeas Corpus .
Baca refused to allow a filmed interview with Fine until Judicial Watch filed a lawsuit on behalf of Full Disclosure Network , and then , out of the blue , he “ changed his mind ” and granted a filmed interview with them !
Fine believes he is imprisoned because of political reasons :
1. Fine exposed L.A. Superior Court judges of taking illegal money from the County , in violation of the California State Constitution .
2. The County Supervisors were using public tax money to pay off the Superior Court judges .
3 . The Superior Court Judges decided cases in favor of the County ( Fine reports that since 2005 to present , only 3 people have won cases against the County as a result of the bribes ) .
4 . The California State Legislature have given the judges and County Supervisors immunity from prosecution for their actions and misappropriation of taxpayer money .
5 . The judges have tried to get Mr. Fine disbarred from the California State Bar as a result of the lawsuit he filed on behalf of the taxpayers who were denied “ due process ” .
6. Superior Court Judge David Yaffe ( accused judge ) failed to recuse himself and sent Fine to prison .
He also failed to cite any precedent ( denying Fine “ due process ” ) .
7. L.A. County Sheriff LeRoy Baca illegally imprisoned Fine , and Fine is in jail today .
8 . Fine should have been released within 5 days , according to the law .

Sheriff LeRoy Baca was subject to term limits , but prior to his last election , he filed a lawsuit to get out from under term limits .
The Superior Court judge ruled in his favor ( surprise ! ) .
Term limits are a prevention against corruption .
The lawsuit was approved by the County Supervisors who paid for it with the taxpayers ’ money ; the taxpayers had previously voted in term limits , but it was overturned for Sheriff Baca .
Sheriff LeRoy Baca is up for re-election June 8 , 2010 .
No one is running against him .
He makes $ 268,000 a year in this position .
In this interview , Fine tells us that the special interests behind the County Supervisors are the real estate developers , who gave money to Supervisor Antonovich and Supervisor Knabe , who were then disallowed from voting on a related Environmental Impact Report that Fine submitted in a real estate development case .
They voted illegally in favor of the developers .
This is how our government is usurped by criminals and corruption within the system .

• Liverpool manager defends taking off Torres at Birmingham • Roy Hodgson may be forced into sending out weakened team
Liverpool 's unpopular owners George Gillett and Tom Hicks look to be on their way out of Liverpool after Barclays backed a £ 300 m refinancing deal that could lead to the sale of the club .
The bank is to take over from the Anfield club 's present lenders , place a sizeable transfer fund at Rafael Benítez 's disposal and appoint Martin Broughton of British Airways as chairman .
Liverpool have outstanding loans of £ 237 m and its lenders , Royal Bank of Scotland and Wachovia , an American bank , have demanded £ 100 m by July .
Broughton , whose job will be to find a new owner , is the chairman of British Airways and a former head of BAT , the tobacco giants , and the British Horseracing Authority .
Hicks and Gillett bought Liverpool from the Moores family for £ 219 m three years ago .
They have been taking to several potential investors , including an American private equity fund , Rhone Group , who offered to buy a 40 % stake for £ 116 m .
Whether Benítez will be there to work with the new regime is open to doubt , with Juventus reportedly planning to poach Fernando Torres and Javier Mascherano in order to lure the manager to Italy .
Benítez yesterday attacked armchair critics who " do n't have a clue " about tactics but still piled into the row over last Sunday 's controversial substitution of Torres .
The Liverpool manager made the surprising decision to take off his top scorer with 25 minutes left at Birmingham , as Liverpool struggled to break the deadlock at 1 - 1 .
That proved to be the final score , leaving Benítez 's " guarantee " of a top - four finish in the Premier League looking about as secure as a politician 's promise at election time .
They trail fourth - placed Manchester City by four points and Tottenham by three , despite having played a game more than both .
But with Torres troubled by a sore knee and weary after a draining European tie at Benfica , Benítez is adamant he made the right decision , despite the result .
" I have been listening to many things , " the Liverpool manager said ahead of today 's vital match with Fulham .
" People do n't have a clue when they talk about the substitution , or say that he can not be tired .
" Some people say he can not be tired because he did n't play too many games .
That does n't matter .
We played 60 minutes with 10 men against a very good Benfica team and we had to work very hard .
We had Mascherano , [ Daniel ] Agger and Torres really tired and you have to manage them .
" We wanted to start the Birmingham game with Torres because he can make the difference , but as soon as we could see he was not making the difference , we needed fresh legs .
David Ngog made the difference – we then had six chances in 30 minutes . "
Torres put his Birmingham frustrations behind him on Thursday to score twice in Liverpool 's stunning 4 - 1 win in the second leg of their Europa League quarter - final against Benfica .
Victory in the semi-final could set up a Europa League final against Fulham , visitors to Anfield in the league this afternoon .
Benítez will know – if not admit – that defeat this afternoon could make the final Champions League spot for next season almost unreachable .
Mid-table Fulham have rather less to play for and their manager , Roy Hodgson , says he will be forced to rest players suffering from campaign fatigue ( today 's outing is their 55th this season ) and injury .
West Ham , who are in a relegation battle , have already complained to the Premier League after Hodgson rested key players for the trip to Hull a fortnight ago , which Fulham lost 2 - 0 .

Вся деятельность осуществляется через официальный сайт mostbet.com .
Если сравнивать с большинством других букмекерских контор , которые работают на территори и
России , то именно эта организация , хотя только и начинает свой путь , но уже успела обзавестись миллионной армией поклонников , которые стабильно совершают ставки на спорт и помогают сервису стать еще лучше .
Особенности официального сайта Мостбе т
Букмекер сделал свой сайт предельно простым и не перегруженным – в дизайне нет ничего лишнего .

Подобная простота помогает пользователям сосредоточиться на анализе предстоящих событий и сделать ставку максимально точно , выиграв деньги .
Несмотря на то , что BK Mostbet обладает функциональным и стильным сайтом , над его усовершенствованием стабильно работают лучшие умы .
Это видно хотя бы из - за того , что стабильно обновляются акции , новости и бонусные программы .

Когда будет проводиться переключение между баннерами , обязательно понравится анимация .
Всего было представлено порядка 40 языковых версий сайта , в это время речь идет не о переводе чере з
Google , а действительно качественном переводе .

Есть режим просмотра событий в режиме онлайн , что значительно удобней .
Линия , роспись и коэффициент ы
Игровая линия у букмекера – это одна из самых сильных сторон .
В ней представлено достаточно большое число спортивных турниров и еще больше событий , на которых вы можете зарабатывать деньги .
Если вам интересуют самые важные события , которые происходят на данный момент в мире спорта , тогда достаточно просто заглянуть в раздел ТОП , который предлагает контора .
Там представлено самое интересное .
Кто интересуется матчами и турнирами меньшей популярности , тогда нужно уже углубиться вглубь игровой линии .
Важное преимущество в том , что здесь есть экзотические события , которые вы никогда не сможете встретить у других букмекерских контор .
Справедливости ради нужно отметить , что экзотические виды спорта обновляются реже .
А появление интересующих матчей может состояться за пару часов до начала , а это существенно усложняет качество прогнозирования .
Линия дополнена виртуальными видами спорта , поэтому если в мире спорта не происходит интересных для вас событий , тогда оптимальным будет виртуальный спорт .
Официальный сайт Mostbet гарантирует максимально удобное и простое оформление ставок на интересующие события , т.к. все они структурированы по группам и турнирам таким образом , что даже если человек не имеет понятия , как ставить деньги на спорт , без проблем сможет разобраться .

Сразу виды , из каких команд состоит группа .
Нельзя не отметить долгосрочные ставки , которые предоставляет эта букмекерская контора .
К примеру , вы можете заключить пари на победителя в том или ином первенстве .
И важно то , что это может быть событие не из элитного дивизиона .
Почему же не поспорить с букмекером , кто станет в этом году чемпионом по футболу ?
Роспись каждого события достаточно обширная , особенно если говорить о популярных дисциплинах .
Вы можете заключать пари на то , какой будет точный счет , победителя матча и на статистику .
Количество вариантов иногда может превышать даже 400 вариантов .
Нельзя оставить без внимания и коэффициенты букмекерских контор .
Они несколько выше , чем у некоторых лидеров на букмекерском рынке .
Радует стабильность котировок – маржа может достигать 7 % , но в это время она актуальна для всех событий .
Ординарные ставки при подобном раскладе не смогут обеспечить высокий уровень прибыли , но есть и экспрессы , матчи и системы , поэтому вы можете выбрать множество вариантов , которые будут гарантировать стабильный и солидный доход .
Регистрация в букмекерской конторе Мостбе т
Регистрация в Мостбет открыта для игроков для большинства стран мира .

Важно вводить исключительно достоверную информацию о себе , т.к. при введении недостоверных данных , ваш счет может быть заблокирован или возникнут сложности при выводе денежных средств .
Ставки на спорт с БК Мостбет в обход блокирово к
Если вы хотите совершать ставки на спорт с максимальным комфортом , тогда оптимально будет совершать ставки на международной версии Мостбет .

России , поэтому легально играть только в официальную российскую версию , которая требует прохождения усложненной регистрации в три этапа и уплачивать налоги в размере 13 % с каждого выигрыша , что вряд ли будет радовать игроков .

Launched only two months ago , Palo Alto's CauseWorld is already raising about $ 200,000 per month for various community organizations with a mix of mobile phone applications , geo-location technology and social media .
Meanwhile , BetterWorldBooks uses Facebook and Twitter to publicize book drives that fund about 80 literacy programs that help schools , libraries and other nonprofit organizations , including many in the Bay Area .
And Project Medishare for Haiti Inc. , which helps bring medical services to that country , saw its donations from an annual year - end campaign increase dramatically in the first year of using social media for donor outreach .
MBA BY THE BAY : See how an MBA could change your life with SFGATE 's interactive directory of Bay Area programs .
These are just some examples of how technology is reshaping the way nonprofit organizations , charitable causes and relief agencies reach out for donations and volunteers .
Remember mass mailing campaigns , phone banks and those cardboard packets with slots cut out to hold dimes ?
These days , there just might be an app for that .
" People have come to accept that this is the way to fundraise , " said Julio Vasconcellos , creator of TwitCause , a San Francisco organization that uses Twitter to gain attention for various community causes .
" With social media , you can reach out to hundreds of people within a couple of hours , whereas in the past , that would take days , " he said .
" We 're reaching 3 million people every month with TwitCause .
It 's to the point we can be a very large megaphone . "
A report published by the Giving USA Foundation and researched by the Center on Philanthropy at Indiana University found that donations reached about $ 307 billion in 2008 .
Based on that information , an estimated 30 percent was donated online , said Mark Davis of Blackbaud Inc. , a Charleston , S.C. , firm that develops software for nonprofits .
Davis co-authored a study with a Texas consulting group , Charity Dynamics , that found organizations that adopted social media tools could increase fundraising by up to 40 percent .
" Twenty years ago , the only method that was available to nonprofits was direct mail and phone calls , " said Davis , Blackbaud 's director of technical solutions .
Text messaging
The Jan. 12 quake that ravaged Haiti put the fundraising power of social media on display .
In the first 48 hours , more than $ 21 million in donations toward Haitian quake relief poured in from a mobile phone text - messaging campaign .
Mainstream media outlets publicized the $ 5 or $ 10 donations , which are tacked onto monthly cell phone bills .
However , the plea also spread virally through millions of Twitter tweets and Facebook status updates .
The fact that donors could see how easy donations can be made , especially with a growing generation of young adults who regard their mobile phone like air and water , sent many nonprofits to seek help from the Mobile Giving Foundation , a Bellevue , Wash . , organization that works with carriers to arrange text donations .
" Haiti has put us on the agenda of every major charity out there , " said vice president and co-founder Christian Zimmern .
The foundation now works with more than 400 organizations , including ones benefiting from a text - donation drive started after the Chilean earthquake .
That drive has n't matched the one for Haiti because the situation in Chile has been regarded as less dire , Zimmern said .
However , while text donations work best in an emergency that draws major media coverage such as the recent quakes , they may not work with the small " cookie and coffee " fundraising drives , he said .
But incorporating social media in fundraising can keep a cause in front of potential donors even when traditional media are n't looking .
Project Medishare , a nonprofit based in Miami , has brought health care personnel , programs and resources to Haiti since 1994 .
But when it began using Facebook and Twitter in an annual year - end fundraising drive in 2008 , the group 's profit jumped to $ 44,000 from less than $ 700 the year before , a significant portion of the $ 473,000 the group raised in donations during that year .
Keeping in touch
The group found that Facebook and Twitter helped them keep in touch with individual donors , who in turn have been able to spread the word to people in their own networks .
The rate of responses increased from 4.6 percent in 2007 to 14 percent in 2008 .
With Haiti already moving off the front pages , the challenge is going to be keeping people talking about helping the country down the road , said David Murphy , president and chief executive of BetterWorldBooks .
The for - profit online used books seller , based in Mishawaka , Ind. , pledges a portion of each sale to community literacy programs throughout the country and in six years has donated $ 7.6 million .
After the Haiti quake , it launched a book drive to fund a nonprofit partner to rebuild educational programs in Haiti .
" Social media lets us do this in such a way so we can draw people into our community , and hopefully they 'll buy a book , " Murphy said .
' Karma points '
On CauseWorld , the list of community causes changes every second , from disaster relief for Haiti or Chile to art for schools to treating autism to fighting cancer .
Started just two months ago by Palo Alto startup Shopkick Inc. , CauseWorld has attracted about 300,000 members by mixing social media and smart phones with new mobile networking technology similar to the popular Foursquare or Gowalla .
With an iPhone or Google Android device application , CauseWorld members collect " karma points " by visiting local shops or restaurants .
The accumulated karma points can then be turned into actual donations to various charities , such as the American Red Cross , Prevent Child Abuse America or Carbon fund.org .
CauseWorld members can also let their network of friends and relatives on Facebook and Twitter know what they 're donating .
The money comes from CauseWorld sponsors CitiGroup Inc. , Kraft Foods Inc. and Procter & Gamble Co .
The for - profit CauseWorld keeps 20 percent , but is already generating about $ 200,000 per month in donations , said Cyriac Roeding , Shopkick 's chief executive .
" We 're turning regular marketing dollars into charity dollars , " Roeding said .
James Cameron is giving NASA tips on how to equip the Mars Rover with a better camera , for footage that he may use for a 3 - D documentary .
It 's good to have endless cash and an undying love of space .

Cameron convinced NASA to buy a 3 - D camera for Curiosity .
It will sit on top of the rover 's mast - even though a mast camera , without 3 - D capabilities , had already been built and was delivered to JPL this month .

The camera is so advanced that " as you 're driving , you could make a movie , " states Joy Crisp , JPL deputy project scientist on Mars Science Laboratory .
Now listed as a co-investor on the project , Cameron is taking great pains to see if the camera will be ready by launch , which is set for 2011 .
But only time will tell .
Let 's just hope the Rover does n't fall in love while on this alien planet , because we 've heard this story before .

Overview
GoodRelations ( http://purl.org/goodrelations) is a standardized vocabulary for product , price , and company data that can ( 1 ) be embedded into existing static and dynamic Web pages and that ( 2 ) can be processed by other computers .
This increases the visibility of your products and services in the latest generation of search engines , recommender systems , and other novel applications .
LESS ( http://less.aksw.org/about) is a framework and service for the template - based syndication and presentation of Linked Data .
In this recipe , we show how LESS can be used to include current information about offers and products matching a certain keyword ( or more sophisticated SPARQL query ) into your Web pages .
The data is taken in real - time from an RDF store that collates structured data from a huge number of Web sites that expose GoodRelations data .
For examples in the wild , see
Getting Started
First , go to
and register and account .
Only registered users can create new templates .
When done , log in and click on " Create New " in the upper left corner .
The system will unfortunately show a nasty error message :
" This template belongs to another user .
You can make a copy using the " Save As " button or clicking here . "
Click on " here " and enter the name of your template into the opening dialog box
Next , click on " SPARQL query " to design a template that fetches data dynamically based on a SPARQL query ( the standard query language for Linked Data ) against a public SPARQL endpoint ( a public access point to a Linked Data database system ) .
Query
The first challenge is to define a suitable query .
Below , you find an example for a SPARQL query that lists offers for products that contain the words " Johnny Cash " in the description .
The query also does a bit of cosmetics for polishing the results values ( e.g. trimming the price to two digits after the comma etc . ) .
For querying GoodRelations data , see http://www.ebusiness-unibw.org/wiki/GoodRelationsQueries.
PREFIX rdfs : < http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>
PREFIX gr : < http://purl.org/goodrelations/v1#>
PREFIX foaf : < http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/> select distinct ?o as ?uri , bif:sprintf ( " %.2f " , ?p2 ) as ? price , ? currency , ? text , ?label , ? thumb , ?ean , ?order_link where { #
Find products that contain " Johnny Cash " ?s1 rdfs : comment ?

OPTIONAL {?s1 foaf : thumbnail ? thumb .} OPTIONAL {?s1 gr:hasEAN_UCC-13 ?ean.} ?s1 gr:hasMakeAndModel ? model . ? model rdfs:label ?label . #
Find offers that include those products ?o a gr:Offering . { #
The following UNION is because we cannot assume that the expansion of gr:includes is on {?o gr:includes ?
s1.} UNION {?o gr:includesObject ?t. ?t a gr:TypeAndQuantityNode . ?t gr:typeOfGood ?s1.} } ?o gr:hasPriceSpecification ?p. ?o rdfs:seeAlso ?order_link .
?o foaf : page ?order_link . ?p a gr:UnitPriceSpecification . ? p gr:hasCurrency ?currency . ? p gr:hasCurrencyValue ?
p2 . } order by desc ( ? p2 ) limit 5 offset 0
Paste this query into the respective form :
SPARQL Endpoint
Then , select a public endpoint to access with this query .
The following one holds a lot of GoodRelations data :
Alternatively , you can also try
Note that the query above uses Virtuoso built - in functions , so it wo n't work with RDF stores other than Virtuoso .
Click on " Update Properties " ; this will test the query and create handy shortcuts to the variables in your results .
HTML Template
Next , create an HTML template that defines the rendering of your results .
Simply create a list or table and use the placeholder syntax from the LESS documentation .
You can also simply point the cursor to the location to which the data should be inserted and click on the name of the proper variable on the right - hand side .
The complete HTML code for our example is given here .
Note that the markup itself may be a bit sloppy ;-)
< xml >
</xml >
Then , click on preview .
You will see how the results will look like immediately .
Save and Publish
The last step is to make your template available to others .
Choose a name and a few tags and click on " Save " , then " Publish " .
You can then request permalinks that can be easily embedded into arbitrary Web sites .

A perfect example of the last - minute crap Mrs. Trella loves to spring on sixth period .
OLD BRIDGE , NJ — In what many are calling a complete bullshit move , Riverside High School algebra teacher Mrs. Trella , 34 , assigned her sixth - period class an assload of math homework due Monday .
Advertisement
The homework , which included a number of impossible to solve word problems , several stupid equations , and a bunch of other pointless crap , was assigned at the end of class on Friday .
According to sources , Trella handed out the homework at approximately 2:43 p.m. , even though it was a completely unfair thing to do and would totally screw over everyone 's weekend .
" She assigned it right before the bell rang , " said ninth - grader Kenny Riley , who claimed that the last thing he needed was to spend all day Sunday looking at some retarded math book .
" I was packing up my stuff to go when Mrs. Trella comes out of nowhere and gives us , like , four huge pages of work to take home . "
Advertisement
Added Riley , " Fuuuuuuccck . "
In addition to its poor timing , students expressed outrage Friday over the length of the math assignment , which some estimated would take fucking forever to complete , and was even more tedious than that lame history project from Mr. Shepard 's global studies class .
Advertisement
Students also cited the need to show one 's work , circle final answers to get full credit , and use the quadratic formula — whatever that is — as leading indicators of how hard the homework sucked .
" We did so much work in class already , " said Michelle Siringano , who still plans to go to the mall with several friends on Saturday .
" Mrs. Trella just wants us to be as miserable as she is . "
Advertisement
According to a recent survey , Trella pulls this kind of stupid bullshit all the time .
In November , the 34 - year - old announced a surprise math test that was n't even about stuff that made any sense , while earlier this year , Trella reportedly lost her mind and assigned homework on the very first day of school .
Sources still have not confirmed what the fuck that was about .
Some students have warned that if classmates did not complete last week 's assignment on polynomials there was no way in hell they were going to understand Friday 's work .
Making matters worse , students said , was their math textbook , which reportedly does n't even have any of the freaking answers in the back .
Advertisement
So far , various attempts have been made to get out of doing the required work .
Many students , such as Daniel Gill , have considered leaving their heavy - ass bags in their lockers and coming in early on Monday to copy the answers from that douche Brian Raffel .
Still others planned to come up with some kind of genius excuse before Monday , such as forgetting their assignment on the bus , getting food poisoning , or maybe having their grandmother pass away over the week - end and being way too sad to think about doing math .

Despite being a total nut - job who hates her life and probably never gets laid , Trella claimed that assigning the weekend work was n't something she wanted to do .
" We were falling a little behind , " the conniving bitch said .
" I just wanted them to catch up so they would n't have any extra work to do over the break . "
AS HAS been widely noted , John McCain recently told Newsweek " I never considered myself a maverick . "
This was belied , of course , by approximately one million campaign advertisements and speeches from 2008 in which John McCain had described himself as exactly that .
When Chris Wallace asked Mr McCain this morning about this , showing a mercifully short reel of just about four or so examples , I expected a little straight talk .
I , like so many other journalists , once fell in love with a John McCain who used to talk like a normal person , who would n't take an embarrassing question about something he had said and pull that stupid politician trick of saying " but the really important question is why our middle class is suffering ... "
No , I expected something like " yeah , that was obviously a misstatement , but let me tell you what I was thinking ... "
Instead , Mr McCain simply re-branded himself , calling himself a " fighter " about 15 times , saying , " Look , when I was fighting against my own president , whether we needed more troops in Iraq , or ... spending was completely out of control , then I was a maverick .
Now that I 'm fighting against this spending administration and this out - of - control and reckless health - care plan , then I'm a partisan , " as if some unnamed " they " had been responsible for the " maverick " label .
It was embarrassing in the way most American politicians are embarrassing much of the time .
Mr McCain did n't used to be like this .
In the face of a challenge from his right in the form of the ( loopy ) J.D. Hayworth , I predict no return of the senator who not only considered himself a maverick but who truly was one , who could sponsor immigration reform with Ted Kennedy or campaign - finance reform with Russ Feingold .
Whoever wins Mr McCain 's primary , a distinguished senatorial career is already over .

1 ) A train is really , really big .
Can we all accept that ?
Not even your Ram / F350 / Hummer / douche - mobile is a match for a locomotive .
You say you have a Cummins diesel ?
Caterpillar ?
Detroit ?.
Well I have an EMD 567 on aday , and even its pathetic eighteen - hundred horsepower will pound you and your gleaming pickup into the fourth dimension , so please , stay behind the white line !
2 ) I hate blocking crossings .
Seriously , I feel like a complete asshole when I stop a train in the middle of the road and leave two dozen motorists to ponder their lattes and ask what the hell I 'm doing .
The truth is , sometimes it has to be done , so do n't honk at me , flip me off , or scream at me from the window of your Dodge Caravan as you 're shooting a U .
Instead , be patient and try to believe that there 's a point to what I 'm doing .
It 's called switching , and my conductor is depending on me to work slowly and not run his ass over .
If you do n't believe me , Wiki that shit .
3 ) Do n't climb on the equipment .
I hate to sound like your mother , but you 're saving me a lot of paperwork and horrifying flashbacks by staying off the equipment .
To you it might look like an abandoned train or a free ride , but when that bastard starts to move with you on it , there 's a damn good chance you wo n't be able to hold on .
As long as you 're on Wikipedia , punch in " slack action " and see what comes up .
Also , the romance of riding freight trains is total bullshit .
They 're really dark , really cold , really windy , and hobos are fucking SCARY .4 )
Do n't put shit on the tracks .
It 's dangerous to me and my conductor , and it 's ten times more dangerous for you and everyone else on the ground .
If you 're wondering " can a train go over a rock ? " the answer is YES .
There 's only one problem .
You probably have n't wondered where the million shards of rock are going to go at four times the speed of sound , have you ?
5 ) Stop whining about the horn .
Countless accidents have been avoided because drivers missed the flashing lights but heard the horn .
You 'd have to blast Miley Cyrus and Lil ' Bow Wow pretty fucking loud to drown out a five - chime , and often that 's the only thing that saves people .
Still , that 's no reason to keep your stereo at eighty decibels as you 're rolling through a crossing at sixty without looking both ways .
6 )
By and large , railroad cops are major douche bags , so when you 're trespassing on railroad property , keep your head out of your ass .
These guys did n't make it into the real police force , and they will ream your ass inside and out to make up for it .
Also , walking on bridges and in tunnels is extremely dangerous .
Ask yourself :
If a train comes , where will I go ?
Trains are much wider than the rails they run on , so do n’t be fooled .
Now for some of the DO'S.1 )
If you see a large object ( like a garbage can or an F350 ) that 's about to get love - tapped by a hotshot freight train , get in the clear .
If the shit 's about to fly at a railroad crossing , run to the side of the street that the train is coming from .
That way you 'll be behind the point of impact and you wo n't have to worry about catching that beautiful pickup and its over - confident driver square on your fucking shoulders .
If you run away from the train you 're just putting yourself in the line of fire , and the death toll could very possibly be two .
2 ) If the gates stay down and the lights stay flashing , stay where you are .
I guaran - damn - tee there 's another train coming , and speeding onto the tracks the moment the first train clears is a lot like celebrating a touchdown too early .
WHAM.3 ) When you 're waiting for a train to pass , it 's a good idea to stay back thirty or forty feet .
Trains are operated by professionals , but often they 're loaded by total assclowns .
I 've heard some real nasty stories about payloads falling off flatcars and crushing people in their vehicles , or doors sliding off boxcars and ripping through everything in their path .
It 's rare , but shit happens !
4 )
Always report problems or suspicious activity .
If you see a photographer with a radio scanner and a big - ass notebook , ignore him .
We know that guy .
But if there 's a dude in street clothes working a crowbar through a signal box , hit us up and tell us what the deal is .
Railroad crossings usually have signs with emergency numbers , or you can call the non-emergency number for your local fuzz .
If an accident has already occurred or a life is at risk , call 911 instead .
Pretty sure they have our number .
5 ) Last but not least , when you 're inconvenienced by a train , remember that we 're pulling for you !
Trains are a great way to conserve fuel , reduce greenhouse gas emissions , and keep American jobs alive and green .
Rail technology is the best solution to our energy crisis , and as the rail network grows in the years to come , it 's important for everyone to stay safe .
Look , listen , LIVE .
Torn has previous arrests for drunk - driving
US actor Rip Torn has been released on bail and will enter rehab after his arrest for breaking into a bank in Connecticut while armed with a gun .
A court heard Men In Black star Torn , 78 , was allegedly so intoxicated that he believed he was at home and had left his hat and boots by the door .
He was arrested on Friday night after he was found inside the Litchfield Bancorp bank with a loaded revolver .
Torn was charged with burglary , criminal trespass and weapons offences .
He did not enter a plea and was released on $ 100,000 ( £ 62,688 ) bail and will be required to undergo alcohol rehabilitation .
The gravelly - voiced actor was born Elmore Rual Torn in 1931 .
A cousin of US actress Sissy Spacek , he was nominated for an Oscar in 1984 for his role in Cross Creek , a biopic of The Yearling author Marjorie Kinnan Rawlings .
He also won an Emmy for The Larry Sanders Show in 1992 , and most recently appeared in US sitcom 30 Rock as television boss Don Geiss .
Last year , Torn was given probation in a drink - driving case in Connecticut and granted permission to enter an alcohol education programme .
He also has two previous drink driving arrests in New York , one of which became notorious after a video emerged of the actor cursing at police officers and refusing to take a test for alcohol levels .
The emergence in the last three years of " house and funky " as a force on the UK pirate underground has been inspirational .
Some people have pointed out its blatant parallels with the rise of 2000s UK garage , while new funky producers have fallen over themselves to update UKG classics for a new decade .
And while new producers continue to flourish , the original UK garage heavyweights themselves have clearly been inspired too -- none more so than MJ Cole .
For those unfamiliar with his classy , peerless output , MJ Cole shot to fame with seductive garage classic " Sincere " , having been an engineer for junglists S.O.U.R .
Two major - label albums showcased his slick , musical style , though he was never afraid of making a rude dub for the clubs , as his countless remixes proved .
Then things suddenly took a turn for the worse .
His label was disbanded and things began to unravel for Cole in ways symbolic of what was happening to UK garage as a whole .
" These were the darker years for me , " admits Cole .
He 'd started his own imprint , Prolific , and club night ; he worked on different projects ( including a rock band and a duo with Laura Vane ) .
Yet something was n't right .
" I was searching for musical satisfaction but nothing was really clicking .
I was bored with the ' old school garage ' sound and was looking for something new . "
The future was n't clear .
" At the beginning of 2009 things changed , " he explains .
" Music became exciting to me again .
Genres began to blur .
Bass music became the focus and it seemed like everybody was creating some great new sounds .
Since then I 've been hugely inspired and have been releasing records independently on my label and have been remixing and producing more than ever with frequent trips out of the studio to DJ at fantastic gigs with great people " .
MJ Cole in a hugely inspirational mood is a force to be reckoned with , and since his 2009 epiphany , his output has been , well , huge and inspirational .
While part of the joy of UK funky was watching a new breed of producers perfect their craft , it was equally exciting to see someone as imminently capable as Cole get quickly involved .
So for every home grown funky anthem like Ill Blu [ ft .
Shystie ] 's " Pull It " or Funkystepz 's " Bounce " , there 's the equally rude " AO " [ ft. Serocee ] or his Funky Dubb of his own " Gotta Have It " .
" UK Funky has had a big effect on me , " he admits , as if it even needed stating .
" Here were the parts of UKG which I connected with all those years ago but presented within a new rhythmic structure and with a new sense of freshness and energy .
It 's been a lot of fun playing with these new toys and influences .
I would n't say that I 'm now immersed in the funky scene only -- it's become a time of cross[ing ] genres and truly eclectic DJ sets and live shows .
This I like very much . "
But asked about the parallels between UKG and UKF , he concurs .
" I think that 's a fair connection to make , " Cole says , " The similarities between the two begin with the tempo -- both around 130 b pm .
Funky has a pirate radio feel , often vocal - led , featuring MCs , a very UK sound , quite soulful in its foundations with skippy rhythms and big bass lines .
UKG had all these elements too to my ears " .
Cole is not the only UKG producer to find himself inspired , with garage dons and dubstep co-founders Zed Bias , El - B , and even the elusive Steve Gurley producing new tracks in the 130 bpm range .
As if to cement the point , Cole and Bias got in the studio together last year .
" Funnily enough myself and Dave [ Zed Bias ] never worked together back in the day , " Cole chuckles .
" In fact I think we only met in passing maybe once or twice .
Collabs were n't so common then .
It was a blast working together -- Dave is and extraordinary musician with a deep love and understanding of grooves and low end theory .
The result was the ' Battlestations EP ' .
We 're planning a followup . "
Later this year , Cole is also putting out an EP by Roof Light , a new producer whose he describes as " a combination between Gurley , Burial , and [ Burt ] Bacharach . "
He 's also done deliciously restrained 2step remixes of Todd Edwards and Zed Bias [ ft Omar ] .
But before that , due on Prolific is the Riddim EP which features four stripped - down rhythm tracks for the clubs , the greatest of which is the immense " Volcano Riddim " , a kind of dark orchestra string - lead banger that Wiley would have made in 2003 had he not frozen his eski synths into grime and instead chosen to pre-empt funky .
It 's effect on clubs is , as its title suggests , explosive .
What 's striking about " Volcano Riddim " , beyond what it does to venues , is how despite a decade of losing and rediscovering his musical faith , it sounds so unmistakably like MJ Cole .
It makes you wonder despite all their vast output and broad inspirations ( Cole describes his as " varied and from unlikely sources … audio nuggets from TV , passing cars , airports , radio , bleed from iPods , websites etc " ) , that perhaps some producers have fundamental production traits in their psyche than are hardwired into them and come out in their music , no matter what style they tackle .
Interestingly , Cole agrees .
" Yes , I believe musicians develop their own grasp of the musical language in much the same way a growing human does with spoken language , " he says .
We all pick up little quirks and approaches to music making .
These may develop from physical habits , such as the way hands naturally fall over the keyboard or mental routes which always reap rewards .
The musical mind always remembers taking a turn which results in success .
I think also that a musician always has an internal " visualisation " of what sounds " good " to them and that their hands are always trying to find this . "

Drink - drive ban for father who took toy Barbie car for a spin
As a means of transportation it left something to be desired in terms of comfort and street cred .
And when police asked the driver to pull over , the Barbie car , with its top speed of 4mph , was hopeless as a getaway vehicle .
Paul Hutton , 40 , is regretting his impromptu roadtrip after he was arrested for drink - driving when he tried to take the battery - operated child 's toy to a friend 's house .
' Complete twit ' : Paul Hutton , pictured carrying the steering wheel and seat of the children 's toy he drove while drunk , has been banned from driving for three years
Yesterday he admitted he had been a ' complete twit ' after he was banned from driving and given a 12 - month conditional discharge by magistrates .
The 6 ft - tall father of four said that an adult needed to ' be quite a contortionist to get in ' the 4ft by 2ft white and pink jeep , which is designed for fans of the popular girls ' doll .
' I 'm not unhappy with my punishment , just surprised , ' he said .
' It need n't have gone to court .
Possibly the police arrested me for something to tell the grandchildren . '
Mr Hutton , a divorcee from Jaywick , in Clacton - on - Sea , Essex , is a former RAF aeronautical engineer who studies electric engineering at the Colchester Institute .
Toy vehicle : Mr Hutton was caught drunk at the wheel of this electric Barbie car
He took the Barbie car home after finding it abandoned ten years ago and has been tinkering with it ever since .
About eight months ago he started rebuilding it with his eldest son Simon , 17 , who is doing a car mechanics course .
Modifications to the vehicle - which is aimed at three to five - year - olds and runs on a 12 v battery - include adding larger wheels and changing its body colour from pink to white .
Mr Hutton had been drinking on March 28 when he decided to show the jeep off to a friend who lives just 500 yards away .
Police spotted him at 9 pm with his knees tucked up under his chin ambling along Brooklands Road , which is named after the motor racing circuit .
He was arrested when he ignored warnings for him to stop and tried to make a very slow getaway .
' The police car came up alongside me and the officer said , " Are you all right there ? " ' he said .
' When I tried to talk I realised how drunk I was .
' A lot of burble came out .
There was a dispute at first between the officers as to what the legalities of it were .
Then they decided I was to be done for drink - driving .
' I was taken to Clacton police station and breathalysed .
I was released at about 5.30 am .
I really did n't realise I should be doing it .
' I knew that it was daft but I did n't realise it was a criminal thing to do . '
Mr Hutton admitted drink - driving on Friday after magistrates in Colchester heard he had 89mg of alcohol per 100 ml of blood , more than twice the 35 mg limit .
He was given a three - year ban because he had received another drink - drive ban within the previous ten years .
He was also ordered to pay £ 85 costs .
Chairman of the bench Neil Munson said : ' This is most unusual .
I have never seen the like of it in 15 years on the bench .
' The vehicle is not even capable of doing the speed of a mobility scooter and could be outrun by a pedestrian . '
The older we get , the more different we become .
This is the conclusion of a study that followed people from their 70th to their 90th year of life .
' Old people are usually thought of as a rather homogenous group -- they are considered to be ill , lonely and unable to take care of themselves .
But the truth is that the differences among people grow with age , ' says Bo G Eriksson , University of Gothenburg .
As part of his doctoral thesis , Eriksson studied participants of the extensive and unique so - called H - 70 study , which is based on a group of randomly selected individuals born in 1901 and 1902 who were followed closely over their entire lifetimes .
Eriksson 's study focuses on the period from their 70th to their 90th year of life .
It turns out that people become more and more different as they age .
' The perception of old people having similar interests , values and lifestyles can lead to age discrimination .
However , I found that , as people age , these stereotypes become more and more untrue , ' says Eriksson .
Eriksson also studied differences in causes of death with increasing age , and again found indications of possible age discrimination .
Eriksson explored how social conditions can affect longevity , and found four mechanisms at work .
The first two relate to creation of social facts .
Examples of social facts include promises and agreements that strengthen the identities of individuals .
The third mechanism relates to how a person builds and maintains self esteem by successfully responding to challenges .
The fourth mechanism consists of everyday conversations , which decrease anxiety and offer support in everyday decision making , improves attention and gives the brain and the memory a healthy workout .
' Taken together , these mechanisms also contribute to increased everyday activity , which has some beneficial physical effects , ' says Eriksson .
Moreover , Eriksson applied two different methods to predict people 's lifespan : one that researchers commonly use when calculating probability and one that is based on artificial neural networks ( ANN ) , which is common in research on artificial intelligence .
It turned out that the ANN method was more effective in complex situations where traditional methods do not work .
ANN may therefore be appropriate in evaluations of results produced with traditional research methods .
High fructose corn syrup , which some studies have linked to obesity , may also be harmful to the liver , according to Duke University Medical Center research .
" We found that increased consumption of high fructose corn syrup was associated with scarring in the liver , or fibrosis , among patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease ( NAFLD ) , " said Manal Abdelmalek , MD , MPH , associate professor of medicine in the Division of Gastroenterology / Hepatology at Duke University Medical Center .
Her team of researchers at Duke , one of eight clinical centers in the Nonalcoholic Steatohepatitis Clinical Research Network , looked at 427 adults enrolled in the network .
They analyzed dietary questionnaires collected within three months of the adults ' liver biopsies to determine their high fructose corn syrup intake and its association with liver scarring .
The researchers found only 19 percent of adults with NAFLD reported no intake of fructose - containing beverages , while 52 percent consumed between one and six servings a week and 29 percent consumed fructose - containing beverages on a daily basis .
An increase in consumption of fructose appeared to be correlated to increased liver fibrosis in patients with NAFLD .
" We have identified an environmental risk factor that may contribute to the metabolic syndrome of insulin resistance and the complications of the metabolic syndrome , including liver injury , " Abdelmalek said .

Research Abdelmalek published in the Journal of Hepatology in 2008 showed that , within a small subset of patients , high fructose corn syrup was associated with NAFLD .
Her latest research , published online in Hepatology , goes one step further and links high fructose corn syrup to the progression of liver injury .
" Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease is present in 30 percent of adults in the United States , " Abdelmalek said .
" Although only a minority of patients progress to cirrhosis , such patients are at increased risk for liver failure , liver cancer , and the need for liver transplant , " she explained .
" Unfortunately , there is no therapy for non-alcoholic fatty liver disease , " she said .
" My hope is to see if we can find a factor , such as increased consumption of high fructose corn syrup , which , if modified , can decrease the risk of liver disease . "
The idea is similar to what cardiologists have done for heart patients , Abdelmalek explained .
They discovered that high - fat diets are bad for your heart , so they have promoted low - fat diets to decrease the risk of heart disease , she said .
" We have n't made it that far with liver disease yet , " Abdelmalek said .
" We know that alcohol is not good for your liver , and therefore encourage patients to limit alcohol consumption .
But what do you do when people have non-alcoholic liver disease ? "
" Our findings suggest that we may need to go back to healthier diets that are more holistic , " Abdelmalek said .
" High fructose corn syrup , which is predominately in soft - drinks and processed foods , may not be as benign as we previously thought . "
advertisement
The consumption of fructose has increased exponentially since the early 1970s , and with this rise , an increase in obesity and complications of obesity have been observed , Abdelmalek said .
" There is an increasing amount of data that suggests high fructose corn syrup is fueling the fire of the obesity epidemic , but until now no one has ever suggested that it contributes to liver disease and / or liver injury . "
Abdelmalek said the next step is more studies looking at the mechanisms of liver injury .
" We need to do formal studies that evaluate the influence of limiting or completely discontinuing high fructose corn syrup from one 's diet and see if there are health benefits from doing so , " she said .
Other authors on the study include Ayako Suzuki , Cynthia Guy , Anna Mae Diehl , all of Duke ; Aynur Unalp - Arida and Ryan Colvin of John Hopkins ; and Richard Johnson of the University of Colorado .

In response to the above - mentioned study , the Corn Refiners Association issued a statement titled " Flaws in Duke University Statement About High Fructose Corn Syrup " ( http://www.corn.org/press/newsroom/duke-statement-flaws/).

It 's impossible to read Charlie and the Chocolate Factory without imagining oneself as Charlie Bucket , holding that magical golden ticket .
The Nestle - owned Wonka candy brand hopes to offer a similar feeling with its new promotion .
Buy a candy bar in its Exceptionals line , and you may pull out a wining Golden Ticket .
The prizes are pretty sweet :
Ten grand prize winners get to bring three friends on a trip around the world with $ 12,500 in spending money .
Other prizes include airline vouchers , Ticketmaster gift cards , movie certificates and ( of course ) free chocolate .
It 's worth noting that the Exceptionals bars are the line 's priciest items ; they 're being marketed as " premium chocolate . "
However , that 's money I think a lot of Roald Dahl fans might be willing to spend in exchange for a potential thrill .

People in Inverness report sightings of 13 water ghosts in the last 25 years , evil spirits whose main purpose is to lure their victims into dangerous water and then drown them .
The water ghosts contribute to the area 's overall total of 39 demonic beings and one of the most notorious water ghosts resides in the area of Boat of Garten , which lies on each side of the River Spey , near Chapeltown and Tulloch Moor .
The paranormal reports from Boat of Garten involve an ancient , inscribed stone visible when the river is at its lowest .
According to legend , the stone is cursed and guarded by a malevolent water - demon , or kelpie - type entity , who protects it savagely .
Anyone touching it or attempting to move it is said to become prey to this aquatic , demonic being .
Google is working on Android - based set - top box software with Intel and Sony , the New York Times reports .
It 's the latest in Google 's ongoing efforts to enter the TV industry .
Here 's what we learn from Nick Bilton 's article for the Times :
Google is working on a platform called Google TV with Sony and Intel .
It 's based on Google 's Android OS , and will be open source .
Users will be able to do Web stuff like search , plus watch Web video from sites like YouTube , and maybe Hulu .
Google and Intel want to move into the TV business , where they have little presence .
Sony wants to compete with Vizio on something other than price .
Google wants software companies to write apps for Google TV , the same way they do for Android phones .
Logitech is teaming up for peripherals , including a remote with a tiny keyboard .
The companies are hiring for Android - related jobs .
Google obviously wants to put ads on this system .
Google has built a prototype set - top box , but the software might be built straight on to TV sets .
Google TV will use a special version of Google 's Chrome browser .
Sony may develop a new brand for TVs running Google TV .
This seems like a decent opportunity for Google , though it 's not like Google is first - to - market here .
Yahoo already has a similar platform called Yahoo TV Widgets , which has had some * success since launching last year .
( Sony is one of the manufacturers that use it , in addition to Samsung , LG , and Vizio . )
But generally , like in the mobile phone business , TV makers should always be thinking about better software .
Perhaps Google 's will be a step above Yahoo's .
And if Google can skip ahead of cable and satellite providers to place ads in front of your eyeballs , all the better .
Biggest hurdle :
These TVs will probably be significantly more expensive to make than the cheap TVs people want to buy , which could limit adoption .
We 've heard from industry sources that TV makers will " kill " to shave a few dollars off the cost of TVs .
We can't imagine these Intel chips or Sony TVs being cheaper than the competition .
Plus any other components these TVs need .
Best case for Google is that maybe the software will be good enough that people will want to spend more for it -- especially if it can eventually help you cut your cable TV subscription -- and that it can pick up adoption that way .
But it 's far - fetched to assume that this will be built into EVERY television set sold in the near future .
What about Apple , Google 's new big rival ?
At an investor conference last month , Apple COO Tim Cook said the company has " no interest in being in the TV market . "
Given Apple 's tendency to say one thing and then do the exact opposite , this suggests Apple will either continue to stay out of the TV market , or will come out with a TV in a year and proclaim that it 's the greatest TV of all time .
* Update : Yahoo reaches out to inform us that its Widget platform is doing better than the " limited success " we first wrote .
Specifically , it 'll be on 5 million TVs in 16 countries by Q2 .
And 35 apps are available for the platform , with 80 expected by the summer .
These are n't huge numbers , but they 're not bad .
It 's very early in this game .

Recently by Gary North : Oldspapers and the Crisis of the Establishment
“ If you are in the hip pocket of any political party , prepare to be sat on . ” ~ Gary North
Political victory in the United States is best defined as follows :
Getting your political agenda enacted into law , enforced by the Executive branch , and upheld by the courts .
A definition of political victory that ignores any of these criteria is part of a shell game : getting people elected for their careers ’ sake , not your agenda .
To achieve this three - part victory , you must be part of a voting bloc that has the power to impose sanctions : positive and negative .
Establishment politicians understand this .
They respect it .
They have learned to exploit it .
They tell their constituents : “ You can win through me if you supply the votes to enable me to win ( positive sanction ) at the expense of my opponent ( negative sanction ) . ”
This is the politics of the shell game , what I call the Punch and Judy show .
The correct definition of the power to impose political sanctions is this :
Sufficient votes to deliberately keep your party ’s candidate from winning in November if he waffles , and sufficient votes to elect his replacement two years later .
There is a corollary :
The willingness to run a post- nomination independent candidate against an incumbent member of your party if he has waffled during his most recent term in office .
Any voting bloc that has this ability will not be in any party ’s hip pocket .
Conclusion : a fundamental strategy for political success is to get the rival wing of your party into the party ’s hip pocket .
In modern American history , we saw this strategy applied by the Eastern Republican Establishment ’s refusal to support Goldwater in 1964 .
They ran Governor Scranton as a last - ditch effort to keep Goldwater from getting the nomination .
When that failed , they literally walked out of the convention .
Johnson won in 1964 .
He did not run in 1968 .
Nixon defeated Humphrey , and the Republican Establishment took over the White House in 1969 .
They were willing to go down to defeat in 1964 in order to ruin the Goldwater wing of the party .
They were wise to do this .
Goldwater sold out the conservatives in 1968 .
The Rockefeller wing that had ruined his candidacy in 1964 got him to give his infamous “ grow up , conservatives ” speech at the 1968 convention .
“ Grow up ” meant “ vote for Nixon . ”
He lived to regret this .
He was on the side of the pro-impeachment Republicans in 1974 .
Too late .
Note : Ron Paul refused to support John McCain in 2008 .
That decision was crucial .
It kept his supporters from sucking up to the Republican Establishment .
They owe it nothing .
This leads me to North ’s law of political suction :
“ If you do n’t suck up , you avoid being sucked in and then sucked down . ”
THE TEA PARTY MOVEMENT
Mainstream Republican politicians now face a major problem : the rise of the Tea Party movement .
These furious voters are in no one ’s hip pocket .
They are in a position to de-rail any Republican candidate who does not promise to roll back taxes and spending .
They can run an independent candidate after the nomination of a squishy Republican .
They can spoil his election night party .
The Tea Party movement is now the largest swing vote bloc in the Republican Party .
It is going to get larger .
CBS News has an on - line poll for the Republican Presidential race .
It ’s here .
On April 8 , Ron Paul beat Sarah Palin , 41 % to 22 % .
The two of them constituted almost two - thirds of the votes .
In 2007 , who had heard of either of them ?
Mitt Romney so far is an also - ran .
If he announces , I think he will be the front - runner .
But the fact that his results are in single digits surprises me .
It is almost as if the voters have forgotten about him .
How is this possible ?
This is not politics as usual .
This indicates a true shift in the Republican voters ’ thinking .
The poll is not scientific , but think through what it means .
CBS is not the media outlet of choice among conservatives .
The people who are most likely to visit this page are more likely to be mainstream Republicans .
In the article that introduces the poll , we read the following :
Paul , of course , is a libertarian - leaning Republican who could well duplicate his 2008 run , but he is seen as a candidate with passionate but limited appeal within the party .
Paul won the straw poll at the Conservative Political Action Conference in February , though critics were quick to point out that the respondents were not necessarily representative of the GOP as a whole .
When 31 % of the conservatives at CPAC voted for him , what does it mean when he gets 40 % of the CBS vote ?
How will the Republican Party ’s Establishment spinmeisters spin this ?
This poll reveals something like an ideological revolution inside the party .
If it does n’t reveal this , then it reveals something else , namely , that conservative users of the Web have the ability to skew results dramatically .
Do the folks at CBS News want to tell their readers that they should ignore the results of this poll , because conservatives are the dominant force on the Web , including the CBS News site ?
Is that the image of CBS News that the folks at CBS News want to convey ?
That the Website is a plaything of conservatives ?
Oh , the agony of it all !
The Web has made this possible .
The Establishment has no clue as to what to do about this .
The networks are losing their grip on the choices people have available to them .
The voters can — and do — bypass the MSM .
THE LONER WHO BYPASSED THE MSM
Ron Paul is still dismissed as a gadfly or kook by the mainstream media .
He is not taken seriously .
Yet he keeps scoring straw poll victories .
This should not be happening , they believe .
When I was his research assistant in 1976 , we knew that on some votes , the outcome would be 434 to 1 .
He would be the lone “ no ” vote .
This has not changed .
He is still the lone ranger in the House .
The problem for the Republican Establishment is that he represents a rising swing vote nationally .
He and Palin together represent a growing threat to the Party ’s Punch and Judy show that Republican incumbents play with incumbent Democrats .
The doctrine of representation matters in politics .
These two represent disillusioned Republican voters who are in a position to inflict permanent losses on Republican candidates who operate in terms of politics as usual .
In 2010 , Ron Paul remains the ultimate loner inside the Beltway .
Outside the Beltway , he is not a loner .
The Republican voter in the street knows who he is .
There is no other person in Congress even close to his ability to gain votes at this stage .
This is causing consternation inside the Republican Establishment .
Paul can raise tens of millions of dollars on the Web .
They know that .
He has a constant YouTube presence .
They do n’t .
He has a hard - core audience inside the Tea Party movement .
Only Sarah Palin matches him , which gives the big- spending Republican Establishment no comfort .
They hate her , too .
SPOILERS
The name of the political game in both parties is to ignore your sure voters , since they are sure .
You offer a few platitudes .
That satisfies them .
They may grumble , but they will vote for the party ’s candidate .
They constitute about 10 % of the Party ’s total vote .
You then appeal to the moderate 80 % , which includes independents and wavering members of the rival party .
You ignore the extreme wing of the party , offering them platitudes .
You know they wo n’t support you .
I offer two examples .
First , Obama has opened up off - shore drilling to oil companies .
The greens are outraged , but they are in the Democrats ’ hip pocket .
Second , his escalation of the war in Afghanistan and his refusal to bring troops home from Iraq .
The peace wing has swallowed hard and has kept quiet .
When you are part of a voting bloc that is in a party ’s hip pocket , you will be sat on .
In November , a Republican candidate will face a major problem with the old strategy .
Tea Party voters are in no one ’s hip pocket .
The hard - core Tea Party types will not support him unless he gets tough on taxes and spending .
They may even run a rival candidate and siphon off his votes in the general election .
He will probably lose if they do .
This is the big threat : rival candidates in the general election .
No more falling in line behind the mush - mouth sell - out who is now trying to recruit the moderates .
The anti-tax Republican Right is growing like a brush fire in August .
The Tea Party movement did not exist in late 2008 .
It is a major factor today .
It constitutes the swing vote that Republican candidates need to win in November .
It came out of nowhere .
It is the loose cannon bouncing around on the political deck .
Any Republican challenger who ignores it will lose .
The Republican candidates can see this now .
The ones who cash in on it will be favored to get the nomination .
Incumbents will be able to point to their opposition to Obama ’s health care .
But if voters ask them if they will vote to repeal , they had better say yes .
When voters vote in terms of anger , they are dangerous to incumbents .
They are also a threat to challengers who want to paper over this anger .
Republicans who run on the basis of bipartisanship and “ coming together ” in November will not win .
The Tea Party people are spoilers .
They are a real threat to the go - along - to - get - along Republicans who dominate the national party .
They are in a position to upset the existing system by running an independent candidate or multiple candidates after the nomination goes to a mush - mouth .
They have the power of the veto in November .
He who has this power and who uses it can get his way .
If Tea Party voters demonstrate for two consecutive elections that they can keep a Republican moderate from being elected , Republican moderates will get religion or be replaced by those who are not willing to compromise .
The great spoiler of this century was Ralph Nader .
He ran a third - party campaign in 2000 : Green Party .
In New Hampshire , he got about 22,000 votes .
Gore lost by 7,200 .
Most of Nader ’s votes would have gone for Gore .
New Hampshire ’s four electoral votes would have given Gore the Presidency .
Republican candidates in 2010 will have to factor the Tea Party voters into their campaigns .
The public ’s anger will be even greater in 2012 .
It is spreading to the independents .
Any political candidate who runs on a platform of “ me , too , but slower ” is going to lose the Republican Party ’s nomination in 2012 .
Republican voters are fed up .
I see this as a tremendous opportunity for grass roots mobilization at the local level .
People who are fed up with Washington have a shot at digging in locally .
CONCLUSION
The most important power in politics is the power to impose pain on politicians .
Civil government is about imposing negative sanctions on law - breakers .
So is politics .
Any time a politician begins to think you are in his hip pocket , make sure he knows you are a tack .
The Tea Party movement is growing .
Rising taxes and rising deficits will guarantee that this will continue .
If the Tea Party bloc cannot get its candidates nominated , it should run third - party candidates every time .
It should kill the chances of any Republican candidate unless he decides to pander to them .
The Establishment Republicans will wail in despair .
“ This is keeping the party from winning . ”
Exactly !
The goal is to do this for as long as the Republic Party does not publicly pursue the agenda of the Tea Party wing .
Two election cycles later , the wafflers will be gone .
At that point , the Tea Party bloc will control the Republican Party ’s grass roots .
The political cancer today is big spending .
Big spenders must be removed with surgical precision .
Every candidate must know that he will lose in November if he waffles .
Politicians see the light only when they feel the heat .
This is the doctrine of hell in politics .
It is time to give politicians hell .

Abstract :
The hodgepodge of new taxes that have already or will soon take effect as a result of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act may not all show up in the income tax tables , but their huge cost is still very real .
This cost will become most apparent in lost wages and international competitiveness , and it reduces middle - and low - income families ' wages just as surely as an income tax hike would .
These taxes break President Barack Obama 's promise not to raise taxes on families making less than $ 250,000 per year .
Now that the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act ( PPACA ) of 2010 has been passed by Congress and signed into law by President Barack Obama , substantial tax increases can be expected in the near future .
Combined , all of these tax increases ( including those on employers that do not provide health insurance for their employees and on individuals who do not buy health insurance ) will cost taxpayers $ 503 billion between 2010 and 2019 . [ 1 ]
These tax hikes will slow economic growth , reduce employment , and suppress wages .
Further , in an act reminiscent of George H. W. Bush breaking his " no new taxes " pledge in 1991 , the tax hikes in the PPACA will raise taxes on middle - income families in direct violation of President Obama 's oft - stated pledge not to do so .
And by delaying the effective date for most of these new taxes , the President and Congress have shown themselves unwilling to implement these taxes on their own watch , raising doubts as to whether future Presidents and Congresses will be willing to do so .
This increases even further the likelihood that this bill will substantially increase the deficit , which would break another Obama promise .
Major New Tax Increases in the PPACA
Three major tax increases make up a majority of new revenue in the PPACA .
A new 40 percent excise tax on health insurance plans .
This will apply to plans valued in excess of $ 10,200 for individuals and $ 27,500 for families .
It will take effect in 2018 and is projected to raise $ 32 billion by 2019 .
The PPACA could have fixed one of the health care system 's most serious flaws : the inefficient tax treatment of employer - sponsored health insurance .
Done rightly , a serious reform of the federal tax treatment of health insurance could have expanded opportunities for Americans to own and control their own health insurance , created true portability of coverage , stimulated intense competition within the health insurance market , and reduced overspending on health care by making workers more attuned to their health care costs .
[ 2 ]
Instead , the new excise tax will make health insurance more costly and complex , while leaving the perverse incentives and inequities of the existing system in place .
In addition , this hidden tax will do nothing to make costs more transparent .
Many families that make far less than $ 250,000 a year have high - end health plans and will be subject to the excise tax when it goes into effect in 2018 , breaking President Obama 's pledge not to tax these families .
The threshold above which an insurance plan will be hit by the tax is indexed to increase at inflation plus 1 percent , which is below the rate of medical cost inflation .
This means that more and more health insurance plans that Congress never intended to tax will fall above the threshold in future years .
Many of these plans will also belong to families making less than $ 250,000 a year , further shattering President Obama 's pledge . [ 3 ]
An increase in the Hospital Insurance ( HI ) portion of the payroll tax .
This will increase the employee 's portion from 1.45 percent to 2.35 percent for families making more than $ 250,000 a year ( $ 200,000 for singles ) .
Combined with the employer 's portion , the total rate will be 3.8 percent when the tax hike takes effect in 2013 .
There is a long - standing tradition that the payroll tax should be used exclusively to fund Social Security and Medicare .
The increased HI rate not only breaks this principle , but also , and for the first time , will fund a new , separate entitlement .
With this precedent broken , future Congresses will be tempted to use payroll tax increases to pay for other new programs that the tax was never intended to fund .
The $ 250,000 threshold is not indexed for inflation , so in inflation - adjusted terms , families making less than $ 250,000 a year today will pay the tax when it takes effect in 2013 .
As inflation increases , more and more middle - income families will be hit by the tax .
This tax hike also breaks President Obama 's pledge not to raise taxes on these families .
Payroll taxes on investment .
The PPACA applies the new higher 3.8 percent HI tax to investment income , including capital gains , dividends , rents , and royalties , effective in 2013 .
For the first time , a portion of the payroll tax will apply to investment income -- a sharp departure from the nature and history of social insurance programs and another dangerous precedent for future policy .
This will discourage investment and lead to slower economic growth , fewer jobs , and lower wages .
[ 4 ]
Tax policy should work to reduce the growth - depleting tax on capital income , not to increase that burden .
Together , these payroll tax hikes will raise $ 210 billion between 2013 and 2019 .
Mandates on Individuals and Businesses Raise Taxes
In essence , the mandates on individuals to purchase health insurance will raise taxes on families .
When fully implemented in 2016 , the individual penalty for not complying will reach up to $ 695 per person ( for up to three people or $ 2,085 per household ) or 2.5 percent of taxable income .
[ 5 ]
Many healthy but uninsured individuals will now be forced to buy insurance plans under the PPACA .
This added cost -- whether as new premiums or as a penalty for not purchasing insurance -- is a de facto tax increase for these individuals .
Employers also have a new mandate to provide health insurance for their employees .
Employers with more than 50 employees that do not offer coverage and have at least one full - time employee who receives a premium tax credit will pay a fine of $ 2,000 per employee ( excluding the first 30 ) or $ 3,000 per employee receiving the premium tax subsidy .
As with the individual mandate , families will feel the bite of these tax increases in two ways :
If an employer begins to offer insurance , the wages of those employees to be covered will drop by the amount that the newly provided health insurance plan costs the employer .
If the employer fails to offer coverage , it will pay the tax , and the employee 's compensation will fall by that amount .
Either way , workers ' total compensation does not change ; only its composition changes .
But because workers will be forced to take more of their compensation in the form of health insurance , their cash wages will fall , and they will have less flexibility to use their earnings as they wish .
Even though their total compensation will not change , lower cash income will negatively affect middle - and low - income families .
Other PPACA Tax Increases
The health legislation includes a myriad of smaller tax hikes , many of which will also fall on middle - and lower - income Americans .
Many of them will not take effect until after Obama 's potential second term .
These hikes include :
A reduction in the number of medical products that taxpayers can purchase using health savings accounts ( HSAs ) and flexible spending accounts ( FSAs ) .
An increase in the penalty for purchasing disallowed products with HSAs to 20 percent .
A limit on the amount that taxpayers can deposit in FSAs to $ 2,500 a year after 2013 .
A requirement that corporations report more information on their business activities , the theory being that if corporations must report more about their activities , they will be less likely to try to avoid taxation .
An annual fee on manufacturers and importers of branded drugs based on each individual company 's share of the total market .
The tax starts at $ 2.5 billion in 2011 and goes to $ 2.8 billion in 2012 - 2013 , $ 3.0 billion in 2014 - 2016 , $ 4.0 billion in 2017 , $ 4.1 billion in 2018 , and $ 2.8 billion per year thereafter .
A 2.3 percent excise tax on manufacturers and importers of certain medical devices .
An annual fee on health insurance providers based on each company 's share of the total market .
Since health insurance companies stand to get more customers because of the individual and employer mandates , Congress forced them to share some of the revenue increase with the federal government .
The tax raises $ 8 billion in 2014 , $ 11.3 billion in 2015 - 2016 , $ 13.9 billion in 2017 , and $ 14.3 billion in 2018 .
After 2018 , it will raise $ 14.3 billion , indexed to medical cost growth .
Elimination of the corporate deduction for prescription expenses for retirees .
This provision has caused many large companies to announce write - downs of their future earnings .
An increase in the floor on the deduction for medical expenses from 7.5 percent of adjusted gross income to 10 percent .
A limit on the amount that health insurance companies can deduct from their taxes to $ 500,000 of compensation paid to officers , employees , directors , and service providers .
Repeal of the special deduction for expenses related to claims adjustments and administrative expenses specifically for Blue Cross / Blue Shield organizations .
A 10 percent excise tax on indoor tanning services .
Exclusion of unprocessed fuels from the existing cellulosic biofuel producer credit .
Some industries that do not make biofuels were able to claim the credit because of byproducts produced during their manufacturing process .
This credit is an unjustified use of the tax code that encourages certain kinds of energy production at the cost of others .
Congress might better have scrapped the credit altogether .
A change in the definition of which business activities are for economic purposes and which are strictly to avoid taxation -- many of which were perfectly legal -- along with penalties for underpayments due to the latter .
Broken Promises to the Middle Class
President Obama repeated again and again during the campaign that he would not raise taxes on any family making less than $ 250,000 a year .
He broke that promise early in his presidency when he increased cigarette taxes , and he has done so in a far grander way with this health care legislation .
Not only will the higher HI taxes cost middle - income families jobs and suppress their wages , but the excise tax on high - cost plans will hit them directly .
Several of the taxes listed above , while not targeting middle - income families , will ultimately be passed on to them through higher prices .
These include the fees on medical device manufacturers , pharmaceutical companies , and health insurance companies and the new tax on tanning services .
Restricting how much taxpayers can set aside in HSAs and FSAs will increase the income taxes paid by middle - and low - income families , because income that they now set aside tax - free in these accounts above the new threshold will now be subject to income tax .
Limiting the types of products that taxpayers can buy with the funds in these accounts will cause middle - and low - income taxpayers to put aside less money in their HSAs and FSAs , increasing their income tax liability .
The mandates on individuals to purchase health insurance will also function as a tax on middle - and low - income families that are currently not covered .
Even those who do have coverage will be forced to buy more expensive insurance because of mandates that require certain levels of coverage .
As a result of the employer mandate , middle - and low - income families will see their wage income fall even as their total compensation remains the same .
A Steep Price to Pay
Over time , the hodgepodge of new taxes in effect now or in the future will substantially slow economic growth and affect taxpayers from all walks of life .
This will become most apparent in lost wages and international competitiveness .
These lost wages , largely out of the pockets of low - and middle - income families , represent a huge cost of this legislation that does not show up in any official tables , but this cost is every bit as real .
It reduces families ' incomes just as surely as an income tax hike would and breaks the promise that President Obama made when he said he would not raise their taxes .

Some Southern California cities fine residents for watering their lawns too much during droughts .
But in Orange , officials are locked in a legal battle with a couple accused of violating city ordinances for removing their lawn in an attempt to save water .
The dispute began two years ago , when Quan and Angelina Ha tore out the grass in their frontyard .
In drought - plagued Southern California , the couple said , the lush grass had been soaking up tens of thousands of gallons of water -- and hundreds of dollars -- each year .
They said they were trying to do something good for the environment .
“ We ’ve got a newborn , so we want to start worrying about her future , ” said Quan Ha , an information technology manager for Kelley Blue Book .
But city officials told the Has they were violating several city laws that require residents to cover significant portions of their frontyards with live ground cover .
On Tuesday , the couple is scheduled to appear in Orange County Superior Court to challenge the city ’s lawsuit against them .
Soon after the city complained about the yard , the Has placed wood chips on top of the dirt , with help from neighbor Dennis Cleek .
“ It ’s their yard , it ’s not overgrown with weeds , it ’s not an eyesore , ” said Cleek , whose own yard boasts fruit trees .
“ We should be able to have our yards look the way we want them to . ”
But city officials determined the fix was not acceptable , saying city codes require that 40 % of the yard be landscaped predominantly with live plants .
“ Compliance , that ’s all we ’ve ever wanted , ” said Senior Assistant City Atty .
Wayne Winthers .
Last summer , the couple tried to appease the city by building a fence around the yard and planting drought - tolerant greenery -- lavender , rosemary , horsetail and pittosporum , among others .
They sent a photo of the yard to city officials in October .
But according to the city , their landscaping still did not comply with city standards .
“ They put up a nice fence , but [ the photo ] did n’t show anything about how they had complied with code , as far as the frontyard goes , ” Winthers said , “ nor did it include a site plan . ”
At the end of January , the Has received a letter saying they had been charged with a misdemeanor violation and must appear in court .
“ It ’s just funny that we pay our taxes to the city and the city is now prosecuting us with our own money , ” Quan Ha said .
“ Does n’t it waste funds to go back and forth in court , rather than sending pictures , e-mails and having phone conversations ? ”
Winthers said he hopes the city can work out a compromise .
“ We know times are tough , but we ’re willing to work with them , we ’d be more than happy to , ” he said .
Meanwhile , the couple said they had reduced their water usage from 299,221 gallons in 2007 to 58,348 gallons in 2009 .

Mr Maliki said the men had been hiding in a hole in the ground Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri Maliki and US officials say two leaders of al - Qaeda in Iraq have been killed in a joint Iraqi - US operation .
Mr Maliki said on national TV that the Iraqi al - Qaeda leader Abu Ayyub al - Masri and Abu Omar al - Baghdadi , who led an affiliate group , were dead .
US Vice - President Joe Biden said their deaths were " potentially devastating blows " to al - Qaeda in Iraq .
Mr Maliki said both had been killed in Salaheddin province , west of Baghdad .
Iraqi TV showed pictures of both men before and after their deaths .
ANALYSIS Jim Muir , BBC News , Baghdad
When the Americans killed the leader of al - Qaeda in Iraq , Abu Musab al - Zarqawi , in 2006 , it was described as a massive blow to the insurgency .
Yet it raged on unabated .
Only a switch of tactics by the Americans the following year , and other developments , reduced it to its current low levels .
Assuming the announcement is correct , it has taken four years to track down and kill Zarqawi's successor , known as Abu Hamza al - Muhajir or Abu Ayyub al - Masri .
Leaders are clearly important , and eliminating them can have an effect in compounding the decline or hampering the growth of an adversary .
But - as Zarqawi's death showed - it is not enough on its own .
However , the insurgency has been sharply curbed in the past two years .
The death of the two leaders , if confirmed , could help accelerate the downward trend .
" The attack was carried out by ground forces which surrounded the house , and also through the use of missiles , " Mr Maliki said .
He said the house in Thar - Thar had been destroyed and the two bodies were found inside , in a hole in the ground in which they had been hiding .
" During the operation computers were seized with e-mails and messages to the two biggest terrorists , Osama bin Laden and [ his deputy ] Ayman al - Zawahiri , " Mr Maliki added .
Speaking in Washington , Mr Biden said the operation " demonstrates the improved security , strength and capacity of Iraqi security forces " .
In a statement , the commander of US forces in Iraq , Gen Raymond Odierno , said : " The death of these terrorists is potentially the most significant blow to al - Qaeda in Iraq since the beginning of the insurgency . "
The statement said Iraqi forces with US support had mounted a night - time raid on the al - Qaeda leaders ' safe - house .
It said the men were killed " after engaging the security team " and that al - Masri 's assistant along with the son of al - Baghdadi were also killed .
A US helicopter crashed during the attack , killing one US soldier , the statement said .
There have been several previous official reports that both militants had been captured or killed which have turned out to be untrue .
Umbrella group Abu Ayyub al - Masri was also known as Abu Hamza al - Muhajir .
ABU AYYUB AL - MASRI Believed born in Egypt in 1968 Also known as Abu Hamza al - Muhajir Replaced Abu Musab al - Zarqawi as leader of al - Qaeda in Iraq when Zarqawi was killed in 2006
He was believed to have helped Abu Musab al - Zarqawi form the first al - Qaeda cell in Baghdad .
Zarqawi was killed in June 2006 .
The Islamic State in Iraq is an umbrella organisation that includes several radical Sunni militant groups .
Al - Baghdadi was a nom de guerre for its shadowy leader , although some US commanders had previously cast doubt on whether he even existed .
US officials said his real name was Hamid Dawud Muhammad Khalil al Zawi .
Mr Maliki said al - Qaeda had tried to camouflage Baghdadi by presenting several people with this name .
Al - Qaeda in Iraq has been blamed for some of the bloodiest insurgent attacks in the country since the US - led invasion of 2003 .
The BBC's Jim Muir in Baghdad says that despite the optimism , the death of Abu Musab al - Zarqawi in 2006 did little to slow the insurgency .
The militants ' fortunes in Iraq are at a low ebb , he says , and the deaths of its leaders are no doubt a factor in that , but there are many other elements involved too .
Since early 2007 the US has adopted a more proactive policy in confronting insurgents in Iraq and undermining their support within the Sunni community .
The sectarian strife on which the Sunni insurgents thrived also died away as coalition and Iraqi government forces moved to curb Shia militias , our correspondent adds .
Mr Maliki is currently contesting the results of the 7 March election which was narrowly won by former prime minister Iyad Allawi .
Election officials have ordered a manual recount of votes cast in Baghdad after complaints from Mr Maliki that the electronic system of counting was unreliable .
The recount could alter the final result of the poll .

Uribe , who now resides in his native Mexico , blames his food addiction on the US , where he lived for over a decade working as a computer repair man .
While there , he gorged himself on hamburgers and soda pop , saying , " Life in the US is like that .
You just go from your desk to your car .
I used to drive my car to and from work , so I did n't get any exercise . "
In 2006 , he entered the Guinness Book Of World Records as the heaviest man in the world .
Uribe has , since tipping the scales at his record weight , lost 400 lb thanks to doctors , nutritionists and the Zone diet .

Hagan , 69 , was a member of the militant Nation of Islam movement when Malcolm X was shot in New York while giving a speech to hundreds of people .
Hagan was captured by the crowd at the Audobon , in Washington Heights , and shot at and beaten before being rescued by police .
Rapamycin , a drug that keeps the immune system from attacking transplanted organs , may have another exciting use : fighting Alzheimer 's disease .
The drug -- a bacterial product first isolated in soil from Easter Island -- rescued learning and memory deficits in a mouse model of Alzheimer 's , a team from The University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio reported on Feb. 23 .
The study , in the Journal of Biological Chemistry , offers the first evidence that the drug is able to reverse Alzheimer 's - like deficits in an animal model , said the senior author , Salvatore Oddo , Ph.D. , assistant professor in the Department of Physiology of the UT Health Science Center San Antonio .
Tissue evidence
Rapamycin also reduced lesions in the brains of the mice , the team found .
The lesions are similar to those seen in the brains of people who died with Alzheimer's .
" Our findings may have a profound clinical implication , " said Dr. Oddo , who is a member of the university 's Barshop Institute for Longevity and Aging Studies .
" Because rapamycin is a U.S. Food and Drug Administration - approved drug , a clinical trial using it as an anti-Alzheimer 's disease therapy could be started fairly quickly . "
Last year three institutions , including the Barshop Institute , announced that rapamycin extended the life span of aged research mice at each of the sites .
It was the first pharmacologic intervention shown to extend life in an animal model of aging .

Study method
For 10 weeks the mice that model Alzheimer 's disease were fed chow containing rapamycin .
At the start of treatment the mice were 6 months old , roughly the age of young adults , but already exhibited indications of learning and memory deficits and brain lesions .
At the end of the 10 weeks , the mice were tested in a contraption called the Morris water maze , sort of a miniature swimming pool used to assess learning and memory in rodents .
At the end of the behavioral tests , the brains of the mice were analyzed to determine the effects of rapamycin on the lesions that indicate Alzheimer's .
Promise remains to be determined
Rapamycin , a bacterial product first isolated in soil from the island Rapa Nui in the South Pacific , also is being tested in cancer research studies .
Rapa Nui is commonly known as Easter Island and is distinguished by ancient monoliths with faces .
" While it remains to be determined whether our results obtained in mice could be translated in people , we are very excited as these findings may lead to a new therapeutic intervention to treat Alzheimer 's , " Dr. Oddo said .
Co-authors , all from the UT Health Science Center San Antonio , are Antonella Caccamo , M.S. ; Smita Majumder , M.S. ; Arlan Richardson , Ph.D. ; and Randy Strong , Ph.D. Dr. Richardson , professor of cellular and structural biology , is director of the Barshop Institute .

It has been so long since the federal law regulating tap water has been updated that since 2004 , more than one - fifth of the U.S. population has consumed tap water that the government classifies as toxic , but still approves for human consumption .
" People do n't understand that just because water is technically legal , it can still present health risks , " said Pankaj Parekh , director of water quality for the City of Los Angeles .
Even though more than 60,000 chemicals are used in the United States each year and most have never been tested for human safety , the Safe Water Drinking Act regulates only 91 different toxins .
Many of these are regulations have not been updated since the 1980s or even since the law was first passed in 1974 .
The law does not take into account newer findings that certain chemicals can be more toxic in combination than separately .
To top it off , not a single chemical has been added to the law since 2000 .
Science has passed the law by , as researchers have identified hundreds of new chemicals that can cause cancer or other diseases if consumed in tap water .
Many of these chemicals are even regulated by some federal agencies , yet are still allowed in tap water .
An analysis by theof 19 million drinking - water tests found that since 2004 , more than 62 million people have consumed fully legal tap water that contained contaminants at levels violating at least one federal health guideline .
Likewise , numerous scientific studies suggest that millions of people a year become sick from toxins contained in drinking water
Yet many of these diseases take a long time to appear , and can never be definitively linked to tap water .
" These chemicals accumulate in body tissue .
They affect developmental and hormonal systems in ways we do n't understand , " said Linda S. Birnbaum , director of the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences .
" There 's growing evidence that numerous chemicals are more dangerous than previously thought , but the EPA still gives them a clean bill of health .

' Murdered just for being black ' Segun Shitta Bey is comforted by friends after the murder of her son Toyosi on Friday night in Tyrellstown Toyosi 1
2
The parents of a 15 - year - old stabbed to death in Tyrrelstown , west Dublin , have condemned his murder as a racially motivated killing as gardaí last night continued to question two brothers in relation to the fatal knife attack .
Toyosi Shitta Bey ( 15 ) , from Mount Eustace in Tyrrellstown but originally from Nigeria , was fatally stabbed in the heart as he walked through his estate towards home with a group of friends at 8 pm on Friday night .
" They killed my son because he was black .
God has taken him from me but in my dreams I can see my son , " his mother Segun Shitta Bey told the Sunday Tribune .
" He never did anything to anyone .
All he did was play football , that was his life .
Is it a crime that he is black ?
My life is finished in Ireland .
I regret ever coming here . "
Toyosi was one of six children and has lived in Ireland since he was five years old with his siblings , his mother , and father Bola Shitta Bey .
He was a talented footballer and played for Shelbourne football club under 15s .
Yesterday , at their home in Tyrellstown , his family expressed their anguish and deep sense of loss over the teenager 's murder .
" Does black mean nothing to some people ?
Why anyone would hurt my son ?
This time yesterday he was alive and now we can never be the same again , " his mother said .
A senior garda source said they were still trying to establish a motive but they were aware of the allegations of racism .
Specialist officers from the Garda Racial and Intercultural Office are assisting local detectives .
Toyosi had been to a local swimming pool in Blanchardstown with friends on Friday evening .
Afterwards , he was walking home with his friends in the Mount Eustace estate in Tyrellstown .
He was in the company of two other male teenagers originally from Nigeria , two teenage boys originally from the Congo and two Irish teenage girls .
Two Irish brothers , aged 23 and 38 , were standing on the street outside their home in The Boulevard , Mount Eustace estate .
They were living in Tyrellstown but were originally from Dublin 's south inner city .
One of the teenage girls asked one of the brothers for a cigarette .
Both men then began to abuse Toyosi and his friends about the colour of their skin and called them " niggers " several times , according to a local source .
A brief altercation ensued before Toyosi and his friends walked away .
But the two brothers then went into their house and got a knife .
Both men had been drinking , according to a garda source .
They then got into their car and drove after the teenagers .
When the men approached the teenagers again , Toyosi , who was known as ' Toy ' , told his friends not to get involved in a confrontation and to keep walking .
But the man armed with the knife stabbed the teenager through the heart .
" It was a racist attack .
He was a lovely , happy - go - lucky boy , " said Marian Salami , who lives in the same housing estate and knew the teenager well .
There is a sizable African community in the middle - class housing estate .
" At first , I was worried it was my brother , he is a good friend of his .
Football was his life and he was very popular .
His friends are very angry .
I have tried to calm them . "
Korede Salami , a good friend of Toyosi's who was not present when he was stabbed , said everyone was still in shock .
" He always had a smile on his face .
He always stuck up for people .
I think he was trying to help his friend when he was stabbed , " he said .
An Auckland church is hoping its Easter message will prove " interesting " to the public , but does n't expect it to match its controversial Christmas billboard , which led to complaints to the Advertising Standards Authority ( ASA ) .
The ASA backed St Matthew - in - the - City , ruling that the Christmas billboard outside the Anglican church last December was not offensive .
The billboard , which attracted attentions overseas , showed a picture of Mary and Joseph in bed and carried the caption : " Poor Joseph .
God was a hard act to follow " .
It was vandalised several times and , after a woman attacked it with a knife , the church removed it out of concern for public safety .
Spokesman the Rev Clay Nelson said the church was pleased but not surprised by the ASA decision .
" We feel our case was strong and they agreed , " he said .
" We can move on now from Christmas and get ready for Easter . "
Mr Nelson said the Easter poster was still being worked on , but " a good billboard is a hard act to follow " .
" We hope it will be interesting , " he said .
" We really do n't try to provoke for provocation 's sake , but if it 's interesting , we 're pleased , because it gets people talking . "
However , the Easter billboard was unlikely to elicit the strength of reaction that the Christmas one did .
" We 've been putting up billboards for some time and we thought some of them were equally creative but this one got the attention , " he said .
" It would be wonderful if it 's equally interesting as the last one , but I 'm not holding my breath . "
Among the complaints the ASA received was that the billboard was insensitive , blasphemous and ridiculing of Christian beliefs .
However , the ASA said the billboard might have been controversial , but it was n't offensive .
It depicted no naked people or sexual acts , and " had been prepared with a due sense of social responsibility to consumers and to society " .
It also said St Matthew 's was entitled to put forth and advocate a message about the beliefs held by the church .

When a car dealership offers you a trade - in price , you can easily compare and even show the dealer what the Fair / Good / Excellent offers are ( under the SELL tab , see screenshot attached , the lower three sets of text ) .
If their offer is below even the lowest range ( which it most often is ) , you have a bargaining chip for negotiating a higher , more fair price for your used car trade - in .

I used this just yesterday while negotiating at a dealership when they offered me $ 600 below the lowest Fair trade - in price .
The dealership gave me a lowball offer ( I already looked up trade - in values the night before ) , so I pulled up Kelly Blue Book on my iPhone , selected my options , and entered in my mileage .
They brought the offer up $ 1 k after seeing their offer was over $ 600 below the lowest possible offer on KBB for the same car ( " with significant defects " ) .
If you ’re a BlackBerry fan , there is probably not a single thing you have been looking forward to more than what we have right here — screenshots and full details of RIM ’s upcoming operating system , OS 6.0 .
One of our AT&T sources has not only showed us the brand new OS , but has also given us some screenshots that we could share .
Since we have seen OS 6.0 in action first hand , we will break it down for you guys , along with all the other screenshots , after the break !
You can see the new browser that RIM has skinned up , complete with tab switching , new favorites , and multitouch .
Yes , multitouch .
The browser looks like it ’s coming along quite nicely , all WebKit !
Here ’s the actual tab switcher view , with nice transparent overlay .
No word on how many open tabs you can keep simultaneously .
Finally , a redone media player , and it does n’t look half bad , right ?
The navigation in this view is done by using your finger to browse the album art work and then touching the specific album cover to start playing .
Here is what we can tell you about OS 6.0 that we saw in action …
RIM has finally implemented system - wide kinetic scrolling with rubberbanding .
This makes the experience a bit more fluid when scrolling through lists , web pages , emails , and the like .
There is also multitouch system - wide , from the web browser to the photos application , and yes , pinch to zoom is in there .
Looking at the actual message inbox , things look a bit cleaner , and a bit more modern , but it ’s obviously not a huge departure from what we have now , just another evolutionary upgrade which is par for the course with RIM .
But , we definitely do like the look of the new inbox .
It also features larger thumbnails to the left of each message to identify the type of message ( Facebook , Twitter , etc. ) and we even saw RSS feeds built right in which looked great .
We ca n’t describe this part … but the new inbox feels right .
It ’s not all work and dry , and it ’s not over the top with cheesy graphics or animations , rather a nice compromise of the two .
Something big for OS 6.0 is the homescreen .
While we did n’t see any sort of widget support , it appears RIM has made the homescreen completely customizable with pages .
You can have your applications on the main page , then slide left or right to another page with different applications and browse that way .
In the homescreen screenshot above , you ’ll see a sliding field towards the bottom , and you can slide that up , and reveal the first page of applications , and you can then slide that to show the different groups which correspond to the different homescreen page .
Favorites , all , home , etc .
Another big thing for OS 6.0 is modal popups with gestures .
If you tap and hold ( obviously a touchscreen device is required ) , you ’ll get a 9 icon group centered on the screen which is basically a pretty context menu .
For instance , you could be composing an email , and instead of pressing Menu +
Send , you could tap and hold on the email , see the popup window , and hit the send icon there .
Another use would be when emailing photos or videos from your device , just tap and hold on an item there , see the popup , and then just send the item .
That way you do n’t have to deal with going through the normal menu options which has gotten convoluted with all the various social services / networks available .
The photos application we saw looks quite a bit like the iPhone ’s layout , big tiled square photos that appear in thumbnail view with very small borders , that you can flick that list up or down to navigate .
Pictures also appeared on screen instantly , not loading one by one by one until you give up .
Once you tap a specific photo , you ’ll see the picture slide in from the right , sort of like the current animation now when navigating pictures on the BlackBerry .
The usual top and bottom UI bars are still here , but if you tap once , just like the iPhone , that view will hide and you ’ll have a fullscreen shot of the picture you ’re looking at .
There was pinch to zoom on the touch screen device we saw ( sorry , we ca n’t comment on the device ) , but there was absolutely no fluidity when panning around photos .
That ’s something a lot of manufacturers miss , but , it ’s obviously not the end of the world .
Composing an email looks to be a little bit more straight forward .
The UI has nice , clean gradients and a very modern web 2.0 - feel .
Definitely refreshing .
There ’s also universal search across the system on here …
If you have n’t got the point yet , OS 6.0 looks to be a very clean and arguably sexy UI for the BlackBerry platform , let ’s just hope there are some under the hood changes as well .
Our source says there are many changes we ca n’t see .
In terms of a release timeframe , we are sure you ’ll be pleased as punch to find out that we have been told BlackBerry OS 6.0 will be in market in the June / July timeframe , 100 % .
I said on Twitter I thought RIM was announcing OS 6.0 at WES ( not having heard that at the time ) , and it looks like I might have been right .
RIM needs to knock this one out of the park , and you ’ll know we ’ll be rooting for them .
A variety of businesses and tax - deprived governments would love to know the answer .
Unfortunately , there is n’t a simple one .
By its taboo nature , marijuana consumption and demand is not well - measured .
Economists , reformists , law enforcement authorities and the pro-marijuana lobby , however , have come up with a variety of estimates .
Put them all together and you get a range of $ 10 billion to over $ 120 billion a year .
Such a wide spread is hardly a solid answer .
But some calculations may be better than others .
All estimates begin with some key assumptions on the basic economic theory of supply and demand , thus laying the foundation for the size of the pot market .
Demand - Based Models : How Much Do People Consume ?
Demand - based models use consumption volumes and price to estimate the size of a total market .
Here , the tricky part is coming up with exact figures on how much pot is consumed and how much it costs .
Opinions differ .
The US Department of Health & Human Services ' Substance Abuse & Mental Health Administration conducts a National Survey on Drug Use and Health .
This survey , among others like it , states that roughly 10 percent of the population above the age of 12 has used marijuana in the past year , while 6 percent has used it in any given month .
Of all monthly users , 15 percent use marijuana on a daily basis .
By comparison , 52 percent of Americans above the age of 12 have had an alcoholic beverage and 28 percent have used tobacco in any given month .
While tobacco use has drifted downward from over 30 percent of the population per month , the marijuana percentages have been roughly consistent for at least the past ten years , according to H&HS data , and have varied by less than 1 percent over a two - decade period .
Alcohol consumption has also been relatively constant , hovering around 51 percent .
On price and volume , various reports and studies conclude a typical marijuana cigarette , or joint , contains between 0.5 - 1.0 grams of the drug .
The price of a gram can vary from $ 5 - $ 20 , or even more depending on potency and origin .
Among others , " High Times " magazine conducts a monthly survey of its readers to aggregate prices from around the country .
See its current survey results here .
Based on this data , most demand - based studies put the market at $ 10 - $ 40 billion .
If a sensitivity analysis is applied to consumption and price variables ( that is , testing different combinations of price and use ) , the market can reach as high as $ 100 billion ( see chart ) .
It all depends on what you believe , given the number of variables involved .
Are more consumers smoking more frequently and at higher prices or less frequently at lower prices ?
The answer is probably somewhere in the middle .
A section describing survey results about the American public 's beliefs about evolution and the Big Bang was removed from the 2010 edition of Science and Engineering Indicators .
According to a post on the AAAS 's Science Insider blog ( April 8 , 2010 ) and a subsequent report in Science ( April 9 , 2010 ; subscription required ) , although survey results about evolution and the Big Bang have regularly appeared in the National Science Board 's Science and Engineering Indicators , its biennial compilation of global data about science , engineering , and technology , they were absent from the 2010 edition .
NCSE 's Joshua Rosenau decried the decision , saying , " Discussing American science literacy without mentioning evolution is intellectual malpractice ...
It downplays the controversy . "
Also reportedly dismayed by the decision was the White House .
" The Administration counts on the National Science Board to provide the fairest and most complete reporting of the facts they track , " Rick Weiss , a spokesperson and analyst at the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy , told Science .
Previous editions of the Indicators reported the data about the public 's beliefs about evolution and the Big Bang , and moreover highlighted the discrepancy between the overwhelming acceptance of evolution by the scientific community and the prevalence of doubt among the general public .
The 2008 edition of the Indicators featured a sidebar on " Evolution and the Schools , " for example , and the 2006 edition similarly featured a sidebar entitled " More Than a Century After Darwin , Evolution Still Under Attack in Science Classrooms . "
The lead reviewer of the chapter , John Bruer , told Science that he recommended deleting the section because the questions seemed like " blunt instruments " for assessing public understanding .
When asked whether people who reject evolution and the Big Bang could be considered to be scientifically literate , he replied , " There are many biologists and philosophers of science who are highly scientifically literate who question certain aspects of the theory of evolution , " but conceded that they would not be likely to regard the statement about humans having evolved from earlier species as false .
Officials at the National Science Board defended the decision .
Louis Lanzerrotti , chair of the board 's Science and Engineering Indicators committee , told Science that the questions were " flawed indicators of science knowledge because the responses conflated knowledge and beliefs . "
George Bishop , a political scientist at the University of Cincinnati who is familiar with the difficulties of polling about evolution , regarded that position as defensible , explaining , " Because of biblical traditions in American culture , that question is really a measure of belief , not knowledge . "
Jon Miller , a science literacy researcher at Michigan State University who originally devised the question about evolution , disagreed , however , asking , " If a person says that the earth really is at the center of the universe , even if scientists think it is not , how in the world would you call that person scientifically literate ? "
According to Science , " Miller believes that removing the entire section was a clumsy attempt to hide a national embarrassment .
' Nobody likes our infant death rate , ' he says by way of comparison , ' but it does n't go away if you quit talking about it . ' "
Carbon dioxide ( C02 ) is the most prevalent greenhouse gas that is trapping heat in the atmosphere , warming the planet to what most climate scientists consider dangerous levels .
But methane , a greenhouse gas that is 25 times more powerful than CO2 , has also been growing at an alarming rate , with concentrations more than doubling since pre-industrial times .
A paper published Thursday in the journal Science reveals that parts of the East Siberian continental shelf , which extends up to 1000 miles out into Arctic waters , show concentrations of methane in surface waters that are 100 times higher than expected .
And in the air , more than 5,000 measurements taken by scientists on Russian icebreakers and on helicopters document methane levels more than four times higher than elsewhere in the Arctic basin .
The researchers , led by Natalia Shakhova of the University of Alaska , along with Swedish and Russian colleagues , found that the amount of methane seeping into the atmosphere from below the Arctic Ocean is comparable to previous emissions estimates for all the world 's oceans .
The Arctic is warming faster than any other part of the planet , and scientists fear that methane emissions could rise even more dramatically in a feedback loop :
As the atmosphere warms , the permafrost that has locked in methane gas in wetlands and beneath continental shelves melts , releasing more methane , which then warms the planet more .
" Wetlands and permafrost soils , including the subsea permafrost under the Arctic Ocean , contain at least twice the amount of carbon that is currently in the atmosphere as carbon dioxide , " Martin Heimann wrote in an article accompanying the paper .
" Release of a sizeable fraction of this carbon as carbon dioxide and / or methane would lead to warmer atmospheric temperatures , causing yet more methane to be released . "
The researchers recommend that their data be immediately incorporated into current assessments of how fast the Arctic is likely to warm in the near future .

An historic law that protects gay , lesbian and transgender people from discrimination in Salt Lake City went into effect on Friday .
Gay rights advocates and city officials joined Mayor Ralph Becker at City Hall to celebrate the ordinances ' implementation .
“ These ordinances demonstrate our determination to foster an environment of good will and acceptance welcoming every member of the community as an integral part of our Great American City , ” Becker said in a statement .
“ Everyone in Salt Lake City will benefit from the protections these ordinances provide . ”
Becker , a Democrat , introduced in October the two ordinances that make it illegal to discriminate based on sexual orientation or gender identity ( transgender protections ) in the areas of employment and housing .
At the time , passage appeared iffy as socially conservative state lawmakers and Governor Gary Herbert , a Republican , denounced the measures .
“ I do n't think the discrimination they scream about is really real , ” conservative State Senator Chris Buttars , a Republican from West Jordan , told Salt Lake City - based KCPW radio .
“ I 'm watching that to see what they try to do , and if they keep pushing it , then I will bring a bill about it . ”
Herbert agreed , saying the measure would put the city on a “ slippery road . ”
“ Where are you going to stop ?
I mean that 's the problem going down that slippery road .
Pretty soon we 're going to have a special law for blue - eyed blondes … or people who are losing their hair a little bit , ” Herbert , a Republican , said .
“ There 's some support for about anything we put out there .
I 'm just saying we end up getting bogged down sometimes with the minutiae of things that government has really no role to be involved in . ”
But an eleventh - hour endorsement from the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter - day Saints ( the Mormons ) sealed the deal and appears to have subdued opposition .
“ The church supports these ordinances because they are fair and reasonable and do not do violence to the institution of marriage , ” spokesman Michael Otterson told city leaders before they unanimously approved the measures .
Gay activists who continue to blast the church for its role in approving Proposition 8 , the 2008 voter - approved ballot initiative that outlawed gay marriage in California , were left stunned .
In approving the law , Salt Lake City became the first city in Utah to ban such discrimination , a move the Utah Legislature has refused to do .
Several state lawmakers at first threatened to take down the law , but eventually agreed to put gay rights legislation – both for and against – on the back burner for a year .
Under the plan announced in early March , Democrats agreed to drop three previously publicized pro-gay bills in exchange for a promise from opponents not to attempt to prevent local governments from approving similar measures .
EqualityUtah , the state 's largest gay rights advocate , has since launched Ten in 2010 , with the goal of adding 10 more cities or counties to the list of municipalities with such protections in place .
So the World Health Organization says that 25 % of boys and 30 % of girls spent three or more hours a day watching TV , playing computer games , or chatting with friends .

Now the article did not specifically say that video games were making kids fat , but they did list is as a major contributor towards this sedentary lifestyle .
Personally , I would n’t considered video games or anything listed above as a contributor .
These kids made their own decision to sit on their ass and not go out .
What they spent doing during this time is irrelevant .
For example :
If the majority of husbands who cheat on their wives do so with younger woman does that make younger woman a contributing factor ?

Middleware and Section 3.3.1
Miguel de Icaza wrote a thoughtful , informative piece this week regarding how MonoTouch works , and how it might avoid conflicting with Apple ’s new Section 3.3.1 .
It was published two days ago , thus , before Steve Jobs ’s “ Thoughts on Flash ” essay was published .
De Icaza ’s theory on the business case for the new , more restrictive Section 3.3.1 was pretty much flat - out confirmed by Jobs —
Apple does n’t want cross-platform lowest - common - denominator apps built on top of Cocoa Touch .
De Icaza ’s second theory regards the UI case for the new Section 3.3.1 :
As I mentioned before , using cross-platform solutions like Flash or Silverlight would make every application look alien .
But also like Steve Jobs alluded to , developers would not have access to new features on the iPhone OS if they had chosen a technology that did not expose it .
For example , when Apple introduced in iPhone OS 3.2 the new split views that the iPad uses extensively when rotating your screen , that functionality would have taken too long to bring in a satisfactory way to say Silverlight on iPhone or Flash on iPhone .
Or when Apple introduced the UIView that can be used to render maps , it would also have been challenging to embed this control .
Or when Apple introduced GameKit , an API to connect iPhones and exchange messages between them .
Flash ’s cross-compiler , we know , is explicitly ruled out by the new Section 3.3.1 .
Where MonoTouch stands , however , is not yet clear .
As de Icaza explains , MonoTouch , unlike Flash , is n’t about creating write - once run-anywhere cross platform UIs :
MonoTouch brings the C# language and the core of .NET to the iPhone , but does nothing to provide a cross- platform UI experience or for that matter any sort of mobile device cross-platform APIs . [ … ]
We released the iPad support 24 hours after Apple released the SDK .
We released the iPhoneOS 4.0 support within days of the release ( mostly because every one of us was pretty bummed out ) .
Our APIs are a 1:1 mapping to the iPhone APIs .
Just like C and C++ , if developers want to reuse code between MonoTouch , Windows 7 or MonoDroid , they will have to split their UI and device - specific code from their business logic .
MonoTouch does not provide such an abstraction layer .
MonoTouch is not in the same boat as Flash ’s iPhone compiler , as it ’s not a cross- platform framework .
It ’s a lighter shade of gray , if you will .
But it ’s still a layer of middleware between developers and Apple ’s own APIs .
Yes , MonoTouch is keeping up to date with Apple ’s native APIs today , but what happens three , four , five years from now if MonoTouch stops keeping up and hundreds ( or thousands ) of popular iPhone OS apps are dependent upon it ?
That ’s the scenario Apple wants to avoid .
Here ’s a bit from Jobs ’s “ Thoughts on Flash ” :
We know from painful experience that letting a third party layer of software come between the platform and the developer ultimately results in sub-standard apps and hinders the enhancement and progress of the platform .
If developers grow dependent on third party development libraries and tools , they can only take advantage of platform enhancements if and when the third party chooses to adopt the new features .
We can not be at the mercy of a third party deciding if and when they will make our enhancements available to our developers .
One such “ painful experience ” , from Apple ’s perspective , would be Metrowerks ’s PowerPlant framework .
PowerPlant was a GUI toolkit and application framework for the classic Mac OS , which shipped with Metrowerks ’s CodeWarrior compiler and IDE .
It was very good , and very popular — many popular Mac apps were built using the PowerPlant framework .
The problem came several years later , with the move to Mac OS X.1 PowerPlant was n’t designed with Mac OS X in mind , and did n’t take advantage of Mac OS X ’s latest advances .
For example , Carbon Events support did n’t come to PowerPlant until 2004 .
There was no easy or straightforward way for PowerPlant - based apps to make the transition to best - of - breed native Mac OS X apps .
Leaving Cocoa aside , PowerPlant apps could n’t take advantage of the latest and greatest the Mac OS X Carbon APIs had to offer .
Now , the comparison is n’t quite apples - to - apples , because one of the biggest differences between classic Mac OS and Mac OS X is that classic Mac OS did n’t have a built - in One True App Framework like Mac OS X does with Cocoa .
( And , it ’s worth emphasizing that Carbon was a first class toolkit for Mac OS X for the first half of the decade — Cocoa was n’t really officially positioned as the One True Framework until , arguably , WWDC 2007 , when Apple abruptly cancelled 64 - bit Carbon , which had been announced for Mac OS X 10.5 just 9 months earlier at WWDC 2006 . )
The Metrowerks developers who created PowerPlant could n’t have foreseen Carbon and Mac OS X , let alone foresee Cocoa , and the Mac developers who decided to use PowerPlant were n’t spurning any sort of “ No , this is what you should be doing ” advice from Apple .
But because PowerPlant ( a ) was popular and ( b ) did n’t keep up with the latest platform advances in Mac OS X , it became an anchor attached to Apple , which slowed them down .
Apple expended significant time , money , and effort trying to support PowerPlant developers and bring them forward to where Apple wanted to take the platform .
So my comparison here is n’t to say that PowerPlant was bad or that developers who depended upon it did anything wrong .
Rather , it ’s that Apple learned that there were significant risks to letting any technology get between Apple ’s APIs and third - party developers .
Apple could n’t fix PowerPlant .
They could n’t port it to Mac OS X themselves .
It was out of their hands , and Motorola ( which bought Metrowerks in 1999 ) had other priorities .
De Icaza argues that this is the sort of decision that should be up to third - party developers :
As a developer , I feel that I should be responsible for my technological choices .
If I pick a cross- platform toolkit that looks horrible on the iPhone , it will just leave the space open for a competitor to do a better job .
Or if my application does not take advantage of a new API in iPhone OS , I am also leaving a flank open for a competitor to take over .
Apple does not need to intervene with guidelines as the application quality , the App Store , magazines , reviews and word of mouth are creating the conditions for an all - out darwinian survival of the fittest .
I think the above paragraph expresses very well the sentiment of many developers who strongly oppose , and in many cases are downright offended by , Apple ’s new Section 3.3.1 restrictions .
“ Let me take the risk of a chasm opening between the middleware I want to use and the underlying Cocoa Touch frameworks , ” more or less .
And that ’s totally reasonable .
But Apple ’s perspective is reasonable too — they have suffered in the past when popular developer tools and frameworks have been out of their control .
At this moment , Apple has the clout to forbid these “ third party layers of software between the platform and the developer ” by fiat .
If they waited until actual compatibility problems arise in the future , it might be too late — at that point , if the incompatible middleware systems are popular enough , the clout will reside with the collective third - party developers relying upon the middleware , not with Apple .
Apple can ban them by fiat now ; they ca n’t ban them by fiat in a future where they ’re in widespread use .
With middleware layers , the underlying platform can get stuck with the way things are .
Apple wants to maintain as much control over native iPhone apps as it can , and it ’s using this control to push forward on , in Jobs ’s words , “ the enhancement and progress of the platform ” .
John Siracusa hit these same points two weeks ago , in a piece titled “ Apple ’s Wager ” :
Like the Mac , the iPhone debuted with a huge technical lead over its competitors .
But this time , Apple is determined not to squander its advantage .
Instead , it ’s front - running as hard as it possibly can .
Anything that has any chance of slowing down “ the progress of the platform ” has simply got to go .
And the best way Apple knows to ensure platform progress is by controlling its own destiny in every way that it can .
That means , among other things , no middleware vendors , no encouragement of cross- platform development ( either explicit or implicit ) , and complete , arbitrary control over every application ’s presence on the platform .
It ’s Apple ’s contention that other mobile platforms that allow these things , most of which developers adore , do so at the cost of slowing the speed with which they advance upon their competitors .
I do n’t know that Apple is right .
As I said above , de Icaza ’s perspective — that these decisions and risks should be up to individual developers to make — is utterly sensible .
Siracusa is exactly right that this is a wager from Apple .
Apple is betting its entire mobile future that their developer platform is better than everyone else’s .

Feathers flew in Paris , Brussels , Berlin , and Madrid as crowds turned out to celebrate international pillow fight day .
Locals and tourists threw themselves into what many described as stress - relieving fun .
Wendy Urquhart reports .
They were a little fatty - and a little too much for my little slow cooker !
But they turned out great - so easy to do before work and something great to come home to .
The ribs had to do two layers , as opposed to just one on the bottom .
The mushrooms were probably not necessary , and ( because of my love of tomatoes ) I used a full 28 oz can .
AND I followed the recipe in Bon Appetit for tomato sauce - and it was AMAZING .
I combined onions , garlic over heat , and added the meat ( which I hand shredded ) and a can of whole tomatoes .
I then served over fresh homemade pasta ( papperdale ) .
I made two great dishes from this one short rib recipe , both of which i could eat again and again and again .
TMZ has learned Tito Ortiz was just arrested for felony domestic violence at the home he shares with Jenna Jameson .
We 're told when cops arrived at the couple 's home in Huntington Beach , CA -- Jenna Jameson had " visible injuries . "
We 're told someone called 911 today at 9:53 AM and reported a " disturbance . "
Tito is currently in custody and on his way to a Huntington Beach jail in Orange County , CA .
Operating a vehicle or machinery while under the influence is a serious matter .
And while getting a DUI is also no laughing matter , watching funny DUI arrest videos can be - when the possible consequences are mitigated to goofy behavior and a serious hangover .
These videos should be enough to show you why it 's a bad idea to get behind the wheel after a night , a day , or even a morning of drinking .
These drivers illustrate the softer side of why you should n't drink and drive .
These videos of police apprehending people for driving under the influence are entertaining because it 's funny to see individuals who thought they were okay to drive ... a horse and a lawnmower .
The videos are intended to be good - humored , not to downplay the seriousness of such offenses .
But vote up the videos you think are the funniest .
Vitamin D is quickly becoming the " go - to " remedy for treating a wide range of illnesses , from osteoporosis to atherosclerosis .
However , new evidence from a Wake Forest University School of Medicine study suggests that supplementing vitamin D in those with low levels may have different effects based on patient race and , in black individuals , the supplement could actually do harm .
The study is the first to show a positive relationship between calcified plaque in large arteries , a measure of atherosclerosis or " hardening of the arteries , " and circulating vitamin D levels in black patients .
It appears in the March issue of the Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism .
" In black patients , lower levels of vitamin D may not signify deficiency to the same extent as in whites , " said the study 's lead investigator , Barry I. Freedman , M.D. , John H. Felts III Professor and chief of the section on nephrology at the School of Medicine " We should use caution when supplementing vitamin D in black patients while we investigate if we are actually worsening calcium deposition in the arteries with treatment . "
Vitamin D is widely used to treat patients with osteoporosis and / or low vitamin D levels based on a medically accepted normal range .
This " normal " range is typically applied to all race groups , although it was established predominantly in whites .
It is thought that as low vitamin D levels rise to the normal range with supplementation , protection from bone and heart disease ( atherosclerosis ) may increase , as well .
Blacks generally have lower vitamin D levels than whites , partly because their darker skin pigmentation limits the amount of the vitamin produced by sunlight .
Blacks also consume fewer dairy products and ingest less dietary calcium than whites , said Freedman , an affiliate of the Maya Angelou Center for Health Equity , part of the School of Medicine .
Despite these lower vitamin D levels and dietary calcium ingestion , blacks naturally experience lower rates of osteoporosis and have far less calcium in their arteries .
Studies further reveal that black patients with diabetes have half the rate of heart attack as whites , when provided equal access to health care .
This shows that lower levels of calcified atherosclerotic plaque in blacks are associated with a lower risk of heart disease .
However , blacks in the general community have higher rates of heart attack than whites , potentially due to unequal access to medical care , Freedman said .
The research team determined the relationship between circulating vitamin D levels and arterial calcium in 340 black men and women with type 2 diabetes .
Calcium can deposit in blood vessel walls forming a bone - like material called " calcified atherosclerotic plaque " and this plaque can be detected by computed tomography ( CT ) scans .
Calcified atherosclerotic plaque is a reliable predictor of risk for heart attack and stroke .
The investigators measured vitamin D levels in all study participants and then performed a CT scan to detect calcium in the heart and major arteries .
" We found that higher circulating levels of vitamin D in blacks were associated with more calcium in the artery walls , " Freedman said .
" This is the opposite effect of what is felt to occur in white patients and shows that the accepted " normal " range of vitamin D may be different between blacks and whites .
" Many of these study patients would be placed on supplemental vitamin D by their physicians simply because their levels were felt to be in the low range . "
Freedman added that physicians should use caution in supplementing vitamin D levels in blacks -- especially if they do not have weak bones or other reasons to take this vitamin -- until the effects of supplementing vitamin D on blood vessels and heart disease are better understood .
" Doctors frequently prescribe supplemental vitamin D , " Freedman said .
" However , we do not know all of its effects and how they may differ between the races .
The bottom line is that racial differences in calcium handling are seen and black and white patients have differing risk for bone and heart disease .
We should more clearly determine the effects of supplementing vitamin D in black patients with low levels based on existing criteria and should not assume that the effects of supplementation will be the same between the races . "
Co-authors of the study , which was funded by the National Institutes of Health , were Lynne E. Wagenknecht , Dr.P.H. , Kristen G. Hairston , M.D. , Donald W. Bowden , Ph.D. , J. Jeffrey Carr , M.D. , R. Caresse Hightower , Ethel J. Gordon , Jianzhao Xu , Carl D. Langefeld , Ph.D. , and Jasmin Divers , Ph.D. , all of the School of Medicine .
Film director Sam Taylor - Wood , 42 , pregnant by her 19 - year - old actor fiancé
She 's already caused more than a little consternation by becoming engaged to a boy 23 years her junior .
But artist turned film director Sam Taylor - Wood , 42 , has another surprise for the showbusiness world .
She is expecting a child by her 19 - year - old fiance Aaron Johnson .
Pregnant : Sam Taylor - Wood and fiancé Aaron Johnson arrive for the London Film Festival 's closing night film of Nowhere Boy in October last year
A spokesman for the pair said : ' We can confirm that Sam is pregnant with her and Aaron 's first child .
Both are very , very happy .'
Johnson plays John Lennon in Miss Taylor - Wood 's film Nowhere Boy , which was released at the end of last year .
They fell in love during filming and were engaged in October .
Miss Taylor - Wood , a successful artist , already has two daughters - Angelica , 12 , and three - year - old Jessie - from her marriage to art dealer Jay Jopling .
They split up in September 2008 .
It emerged last May that Miss Taylor - Wood and Johnson had begun a relationship during the filming of Nowhere Boy in Liverpool .
The movie charted the young life and rise to fame of the Beatle and was Miss Taylor - Wood 's directorial debut .
She received widespread acclaim for the work , as did Johnson for his portrayal of Lennon .
Johnson played John Lennon in the movie Nowhere Boy , directed by Taylor - Wood
She has told how she felt she and Mr Johnson ' had quite a psychic link ' .
She has also dismissed the large age gap between the pair , saying : ' I 've always lived my life as fearlessly as possible .
' I do n't really listen to other people 's opinions , just follow my heart and my instincts . '
The former Turner Prize nominee , who is also known for her video ' portrait ' of David Beckham , fought colon cancer in 1997 and breast cancer three years later .
She twice had chemotherapy and is believed to have refused one course of drugs , fearing they would make her infertile .
She was married to Mr Jopling , the owner of the fashionable White Cube art gallery in East London , for 11 years .
Taylor - Wood on set shooting the movie where she fell in love with Johnson
They have remained friendly , with Mr Jopling and the couple 's daughters joining Miss Taylor - Wood and Johnson at the premiere of Nowhere Boy at the London Film Festival in October .
Angelica played Lennon 's sister in the film while Jessie also had a small role .
Speaking of the relationship between her daughters and Mr Johnson , Miss Taylor - Wood said : ' They get on really well .
It all felt strangely natural .'
Johnson - who won his first film role when he was 12 - has also dismissed concerns over the age gap .
He said : ' To be honest , I 've never really lived by the rule book .
We just have a huge connection and we talk through a load of things .
We just enjoy life and what 's around us now . '
He started acting at the age of six and appeared in a series of TV films before landing the Lennon part .
Last year Mr Jopling , 46 , briefly dated pop singer Lily Allen - who is 22 years his junior .
MINNEAPOLIS --
The rain came down , the crowd cheered , and the Red Sox and Twins kept playing .
" Out - door base - ball , " some fans chanted Wednesday in the second game at Target Field .
John Lackey did n't seem to mind getting wet , either .
Lackey turned in a second strong start and Jeremy Hermida gave Boston room with a three - run double in the eighth inning , leading the Red Sox past Minnesota 6 - 3 .
For the first time in 29 years , rain fell on the Twins at home .
" It held up pretty good .
We did n't slip or anything , " Twins center fielder Denard Span .
The crowd of 38,164 , more than 1,000 below capacity , rediscovered baseball 's unique relationship with the weather .
Temperature at first pitch was 73 degrees , but raindrops fell intermittently from the third through the eight innings .
Some fans scurried for the concourses and others hastily put up their umbrellas , but the first shower led to another celebration of Minnesota 's move out of the Metrodome to an open - air facility .
Lackey ( 1 - 0 ) lasted 6 2/3 innings for his first Red Sox victory , lifted early by Marco Scutaro's two singles and Dustin Pedroia 's RBI double and solo home run .
Scutaro batted leadoff again for the injured Jacoby Ellsbury , and Hermida filled in as the left fielder .
" Honestly , there was probably one inning there where it was kind of pretty slick , " Lackey said .
" Once they fixed it , it was great the last two innings that I was out there . "
Twins starter Kevin Slowey ( 1 - 1 ) inched through five , giving up three runs and taking the loss after several discussions on the mound with Joe Mauer about pitch selection .
" He wanted to do something , and I wanted to do something else , " Mauer said .
" We 're both in it to try to get outs .
So go out there and talk about it and come up with a plan . "
After a sharp start last week in a win over the Los Angeles Angels , Slowey never found his footing -- even literally in the fifth following Pedroia 's two - out shot .
Slowey gave up a single and a walk after the homer , prompting pitching coach Rick Anderson to the mound .
He asked the umpires to check the mound , and the grounds crew guys hustled out for their first critical in - game task .
While they sprinkled fresh dirt on the front of the mound and behind the plate , Slowey spent a few minutes cleaning the mud out of his cleats .
He got the last out of the inning , but his day was done with 98 pitches , five hits and four walks .
" I wish we had been able to smooth that out a little earlier , but a lot of that is on me really , " Slowey said .
" It 's up to me to talk to Joe about what I want to do .
He has to worry about all the pitchers on the staff . "
Lackey walked Span on four pitches in the third and gave up consecutive RBI singles to Orlando Hudson and Mauer , but retired Morneau on a long fly to center and settled in after that despite the mucky mound .
The sun came out when Mauer came to the plate in the seventh , ending Lackey 's afternoon , but he was intentionally walked to load the bases after a passed ball with two outs .
Justin Morneau hit a weak popup near the mound to end that threat before Hermida 's big hit broke the game open .
Michael Cuddyer homered and Delmon Young doubled to start the eighth , but Daniel Bard finished the inning without more damage and Jonathan Papelbon worked the ninth for his third save .
He got Cuddyer on a long fly to end the game with two on .
Beginning an $ 82.5 million , five - year contract with the Red Sox , Lackey has logged 12 2/3 innings over two starts with only 10 hits and two runs allowed .
" He 's no pushover .
You do n't give ( $ 82.5 ) million to a pushover , " Hudson said .
Red Sox manager Terry Francona joked that he envisioned Lackey yelling at Angels manager Mike Scioscia about taking him out of the game , but Lackey did n't mind letting Hideki Okajima face Mauer instead .
" I 'm just the new guy here , just kind of trying to get things done .
I already faced Mauer three times .
Giving him a new look is probably a good call , " Lackey said .
" I 'll give him a few starts before I start yelling . "
Game notes
The four walks by Slowey tied a career high .
... DH David Ortiz doubled but struck out twice more , giving him 13 in 26 at - bats .
Francona still has faith : " Guys need time to settle in .
If I do n't let 'em settle in , it 's just going to prolong what we 're going through . " ...
Span has only five hits but nine walks through nine games .
" I can't hit , but I can definitely see the ball , " he said .
... Hermida has six RBIs and a hit in all five games he 's played in .
" To go out there and see some consistent pitches for a few days never hurts your timing , " he said .

A COUPLE who have been trying for a baby for eight years are taking legal action against a Welsh IVF clinic which “ lost ” their embryos .
The couple , known only as Clare and Gareth , said staff at IVF Wales , based at the University Hospital of Wales , Cardiff , told them the embryos had been lost just as they were about to be implanted .
But the clinic , which was at the centre of another IVF mistake last year after it implanted a couple ’s last embryo into another woman , said the loss was a well - known complication of embryo vitrification .
This process involves embryos being frozen in liquid nitrogen for storage and thawed for implantation .
The case comes as figures obtained by BBC5 Live show that errors at fertility clinics in Wales and England almost doubled in 12 months .
Clare told the station ’s Donal Macintyre programme last night : “ I was sat there , gowned up , waiting to go in and have a transfer .
They said you ’ve got one embryo remaining , the other two embryos have gone missing .
They said in the next sentence , ‘ I can assure you they have n’t gone into anyone else ’ . ”
She added : “ Those were two potential babies . ”
Cardiff and Vale University Health Board , which runs IVF Wales , compensated a couple from Bridgend last year after the clinic implanted Deborah Hole and Paul Thomas ’ last viable embryo in the wrong woman .
The couple had been hoping to conceive a sibling for their son Jamie .
An investigation found serious failings at the clinic .
Clare and Gareth ’s solicitor , Guy Forster , of law firm Irwin Mitchell , said he has dealt with a dozen couples involved in similar incidents at different clinics around the country in the past 12 months .
He said : “ I am deeply concerned that the same clinic finds itself yet again at the centre of a serious incident .
“ The second error involving Clare and Gareth ’s embryos appears to have occurred just seven months after the first serious incident relating to Paul and Deborah ’s embryo .
“ The incident followed two previous near miss incidents and concerns raised in inspections of the clinic .
“ It seems that lessons have not been learned .
Not only does this raise concerns about the clinic , but also serious questions need to be asked regarding the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority ’s ( HFEA ) ability to properly regulate the IVF industry . ”
But Dr Chris Jones , Cardiff and Vale University Health Board ’s medical director , said : “ IVF Wales has a success rate of 99.5 % in recovering embryos using this complex and technically challenging process , which involves arranging embryos smaller than a full stop on a special cryo leaf , and freezing them by plunging them into liquid nitrogen .
The embryos are subsequently thawed .
“ Unfortunately , the loss of embryos during this process is a known complication and the risk of failure is explained to every patient undergoing the procedure .
“ We understand that , where embryos are lost , this can be distressing for patients and aim to handle such cases with the utmost sensitivity .
“ Counselling is offered to all patients as a matter of course . ”
Figures obtained by the programme reveal the number of mistakes at IVF centres in Wales and England rose from 182 in 2007 - 08 to 334 in 2008 - 09 .
They included embryos being lost or implanted in the wrong woman and eggs being fertilised with another man ’s sperm .
The HFEA said the errors represent less than 1 % of more than 50,000 IVF cycles carried out .
With the future of MGM still uncertain , James Bond producers Michael G Wilson and Barbara Broccoli have suspended development on the next James Bond film previously scheduled for release 2011 / 2012 .
“ Due to the continuing uncertainty surrounding the future of MGM and the failure to close a sale of the studio , we have suspended development on Bond 23 indefinitely .
We do not know when development will resume and do not have a date for the release of Bond 23 , ” stated Michael G Wilson and Barbara Broccoli jointly .
While the next Bond may be delayed for now , the franchise is one of the crown jewels of the MGM library and whoever ends up getting control of the studio will obviously move forward with the next installment the day after the paperwork is signed .
After all , the last Bond film cost $ 200 million and it made $ 586 at the worldwide box office .
IT should have been one of the most joyous moments of her life , but Rebecca Doig was tragically indifferent when she became a mother last week .
At just 31 , Mrs Doig has rapid - onset Alzheimer 's disease .
She is one of the youngest sufferers in the world and the first to give birth , The Sunday Telegraph reports .
So fast has been her mental degeneration that the once - vibrant young woman , who found out she was expecting while having scans to investigate her memory loss , has little comprehension of giving birth .
Her healthy daughter Emily was delivered by caesarean section at Hornsby Hospital on Tuesday .
Rebecca has n't been able to hold her yet .
Husband Scott , who helplessly watched his wife 's health deteriorate for nine months , now has the burden of caring for his child and a mother who can no longer care for herself .
" Emily is perfect , " Mr Doig said .
" She 's a very beautiful little thing and very healthy .
" The road ahead is going to be extremely difficult - there 's no two ways about it .
We take every day as it comes because there is not a lot that we can do about it .
" If you sit there and start thinking about things , you will just get depressed .
I can't do that because I 've got a wife and now a little girl to look after . "
Mrs Doig was diagnosed with an extremely rare form of Alzheimer 's last August .
She is believed to be the first female patient to be afflicted by it .
Emily does not carry her mother 's defective PSEN1 gene that would have predisposed her to the condition .
Mrs Doig was an independent , outgoing and bright young woman until the disease began eating away at her brain .
The signs first showed up when she kept losing her handbag and misplacing other items .
Originally diagnosed with depression , by 2008 she was losing jobs because of mistakes .
She continued seeking work up until nine months ago when she was diagnosed .
The part of Mrs Doig 's brain that controls emotion has shrunk , leaving her isolated from friends and family .
" It 's hard to see your wife lose that , " Mr Doig said .
" Once she was so energetic and youthful .
But she 's my life and I 'm not giving up on her . "
The couple , who had planned to have children , are struggling financially with a mortgage , growing needs for care and only one wage .
Mrs Doig has been refused a disability pension .
Mr Doig 's colleagues at Hornsby Council have organised a fundraiser for the family next weekend .

A laser scanner enables this uncrewed helicopter to fly low and dodge obstacles in its path
Flying low to the ground is a pilot ’s nightmare : buildings , trees , and power cables all threaten to put an early end to the flight .
But now the first large robotic aircraft able to fly at low levels and weave around such obstacles has been developed by US engineers .
Giving uncrewed aerial vehicles ( UAVs ) this ability could aid military operations in urban areas , or help search - and - rescue efforts after disasters .
Most UAVs do not have the capacity to sense and avoid obstacles at all – a significant barrier to their being allowed to fly in civilian airspace .
But now engineers at Carnegie Mellon University , Pittsburgh , have modified a commercial civilian UAV helicopter made by Yamaha to be able to see obstacles it encounters .
Advertisement
The helicopter ’s “ eye ” is a custom - built 3D laser scanner , which sweeps an oval path ahead of the 3.5 - metre long craft .
The scanner can detect objects as hard to see as power lines from 150 metres away .
Twin strategy
The helicopter uses two navigation strategies .
First , a long - range planning algorithm uses an existing 3D map to work out a general course that avoids large obstacles like buildings and trees .
That map can be preloaded , or built up by the helicopter as it explores a new area .
When the aircraft flies a route , its scanner looks out for other obstacles .
As these appear , a local planning system takes over and plots a detour .
The UAV can fly between two obstacles with only around 3 metres clearance on each side .
The same two - part navigation strategy has been used successfully on wheeled robots in the past , developing the laser scanner made it possible on aircraft too .
The helicopter was put through its paces at a fake urban environment in Fort Benning , Georgia , including buildings and wires only 6 millimetres thick .
Over 700 missions , the system successfully navigated at speeds up to 36 kilometres per hour and altitudes of between 5 to 11 meters .
Jean - Christophe Zufferey , an engineer at Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Lausanne , Switzerland , says that the Carnegie Mellon aircraft is the only large UAV in existence capable of flying so low and planning its way around obstacles .
Robotic rescuer
“ If you look at UAVs in general , they are not able to fly at low altitude around obstacles .
Most are flying above in the free sky , ” Zufferey says .
“ So trying to get closer to obstacles , to an urban environment , and to people in general is something that is very useful for a range of applications , ” he says .
Sanjiv Singh , the Carnegie Mellon roboticist leading the project , told New Scientist it was developed for a now - defunct initiative from DARPA , the US defence research agency tasked with protecting the country from “ technological surprise ” ( see Fifty years of DARPA : A surprising history ) .
The research group also has a smaller version , a 1.5 - kg “ quadrotor ” with its own , smaller , laser scanner .
They hope to eventually equip a full - size helicopter with their technology , to perform as a robotic air ambulance to retrieve wounded soldiers from combat zones .

Bob Dylan 's planned tour of east Asia called off after Chinese officials refuse him permission to play in Beijing and Shanghai
Aged 68 and almost half a century past the zenith of his angry , protest - song youth , Bob Dylan must almost have forgotten what it was like to be deemed a threat to society .
But it seems at least one place still sees him as a dangerous radical .
Dylan ’s planned tour of east Asia later this month has been called off after Chinese officials refused permission for him to play in Beijing and Shanghai , his local promoters said .
China ’s ministry of culture , which vets planned concerts by overseas artists , appeared wary of Dylan ’s past as an icon of the counterculture movement , said Jeffrey Wu , of the Taiwan - based promoters Brokers Brothers Herald .
[ See footnote . ]
Dylan fans denied the chance to see their hero might also blame Björk , who caused consternation among Chinese officials two years ago by shouting pro-Tibet slogans at a concert in Shanghai , Wu told Hong Kong ’s South China Morning Post .
The verdict scuppers Dylan ’s plans to play his first dates in mainland China .
The singer , who plays around 100 concerts a year on his Never Ending Tour , had hoped to extend a multi-city Japanese leg with concerts in Beijing , Shanghai , Taiwan , South Korea and Hong Kong .
All these would now be called off , Wu told the newspaper .
“ With Beijing and China ruled out , it was not possible for him just to play concerts in Hong Kong , South Korea and Taiwan , ” he said .
“ The chance to play in China was the main attraction for him .
When that fell through everything else was called off . ”
Wu said officials had become more cautious since Björk , the Icelandic singer , chanted “ Tibet ! Tibet ! ” after performing a song called Declare Independence in Shanghai in 2008 .
China has ruled Tibet since invading it in 1950 and views the Himalayan territory as an integral part of its national territory .
“ What Björk did definitely made life very difficult for other performers .
They are very wary of what will be said by performers on stage now , ” Wu said .
Last year , Oasis were told they were “ unsuitable ” to play in Beijing and Shanghai as Noel Gallagher had appeared at a Tibet freedom concert 12 years earlier .
• Note added 19 October 2018 : More than a year after this article was published Bob Dylan made a written statement about the issue , which the Guardian reported at the time .
Canada ’s Immigration and Refugee Board has been slow to accept what international aid agencies have been saying for years : Women are at high risk for being raped in Haiti .
In several recent decisions , the board has turned down refugee claims from Haitian women who fear becoming victims of sexual violence if deported , despite a significant body of evidence that rape has long been a systemic problem in the country and has worsened since January ’s earthquake , with criminal gangs roaming camps .
Critics suggest some board adjudicators are falling victim to rape myths debunked by the Supreme Court of Canada more than 20 years ago .
In many cases , adjudicators have concluded rape is a crime much like any other , and men and women are equally at risk of being victims .
Other adjudicators , however , have accepted there is a high risk that female refugee claimants , if returned to Haiti , would be persecuted simply because they are women , resulting in a patchwork of decisions by the board .
The issue reaches the Federal Court of Canada on Wednesday in a case involving Elmancia Dezameau of Toronto , who fears she and her four daughters , ages 11 to 2 , will be subjected to sexual violence if ordered to return to Haiti .
Dezameau also worries she will be attacked by armed gang members as she was before she fled the island as a 19 - year - old in 1994 .
Dressed in military fatigues , members of a group called Vengeance descended on her home because her father , as a practitioner of voodoo , was suspected of being a typical working - class supporter of deposed Haitian leader Jean - Bertrand Aristide .
After beating her father , Dezameau recounted , they dragged her across the ground , tied her to a tree and set fire to the family ’s house .
“ I ’m sorry , but I ’m not lying , ” she said .
In the dining room of her Flemingdon Park home , Dezameau , 36 , who supports her family by working as a hotel maid , lifted her skirt to reveal deep purple scars on both her upper legs .
“ There and there , too , ” she said , pointing to her ankle and shoulder .
A medical report has corroborated the scars are consistent with such an attack .
But in a decision last July , refugee board adjudicator Michael Hamelin did n’t believe her claim that she was politically active as a teenager and this , in turn , motivated the attack , placing her at risk of being targeted by political opponents in Haiti again today .
As for her fears about rape , Hamelin said while there is evidence that violence against women is a problem in Haiti , there are also “ laws against committing acts of violence such as rape . ”
But Lindsay Mossman , a women ’s human rights campaigner for Amnesty International Canada , said Haitian women who report rape are often not believed and attackers are seldom charged .
“ Perpetrators know for the most part they will not be facing prosecution for these crimes , ” she said .
Doctors Without Borders , Human Rights Watch , the British medical journal The Lancet and the U.S. State Department have also found that violence and social discrimination against women are human rights problems in Haiti , with rape in particular being used as a tool of repression and perpetrators often members of the military .
But in a brief filed with the court for Wednesday ’s hearing , the federal government said Dezameau is essentially arguing that all female refugee claimants from Haiti are automatically entitled to refugee protection because they face the possibility of sexual assault .
“ Logically , this would mean that refugee hearings are unnecessary once the claimants have established their identity as females from Haiti , ” Crown counsel Asha Gafar said in the document .
Raoul Boulakia , Dezameau ’s lawyer , said human rights groups have very rarely identified rape as being a systemic problem as they have in Haiti .
One other example might be the Democratic Republic of Congo .

Despite this , the Federal Court has also issued conflicting decisions on whether women are at particular risk of sexual violence in Haiti or whether their situation differs little from that of all Haitians who are at risk of becoming crime victims .
There is currently a moratorium on deportations to Haiti , Boulakia noted .
While that would protect Dezameau from immediate removal , it could also leave her in a state of limbo , unable to apply for permanent resident status and entitled to only emergency health care .
Some of the US ’s highest profile governors have made a list they ’d probably rather stay off of — the country ’s worst .
A report from political watchdog Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington ( CREW ) lists what it calls the 11 “ worst governors ” in America , and among them are California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger , New York Governor David Paterson and Texas Governor Rick Perry .

Of the 11 governors , all but two are Republicans .
Paterson and New Mexico Governor Bill Richardson were the two Democrats named .
“ We considered whether governors had violated ethics , campaign finance and personal financial disclosure rules as well as whether they had complied with state transparency laws , ” CREW stated .
Among the others named is South Carolina Gov. Mark Sanford , who became a household name last year when he disappeared for a week and returned to announce he had been having an affair with an Argentinian woman .
CREW accuses Sanford of “ abus[ing ] his office for his personal benefit and the benefit of his friends , violat[ing ] campaign finance laws by failing to report in - kind contributions and improperly converting campaign funds for personal use , subordinat[ing ] his responsibilities to his pursuit of an extramarital affair , ” and “ endanger[ing ] his stateÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s economy by threatening to refuse stimulus funds . ”
Also on the list is Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal , who last year was tipped as a potential future leader of the GOP , but whose star sank after his lackluster televised response to President Obama ’s address to a joint session of Congress .

Jindal , says CREW , “ prevented the public release of government records and has fought legislation to make government more transparent , weakened the authority of the state ethics board , refused to accept federal stimulus funds to expand unemployment insurance and to fund other important programs , rewarded campaign donors with government jobs and contracts , ” and “ has been fined for ethics violations . ”
Rounding off the list — which is not ranked but ordered alphabetically — are Gov. Haley Barbour of Mississippi , Gov. Donald Carcieri of Rhode Island , Gov. Jim Gibbons of Nevada , Gov. Sonny Perdue of Georgia , and Gov. Mike Rounds of South Dakota .
Read the full CREW report here ( PDF ) .

“ There has been a great deal of focus on the ethics of Congress over the past few years , but CREW ’s report shows that state governments are not immune to ethics problems , ” said CREW executive director Melanie Sloan in a statement .
“ Too often — whether in Washington , D.C. or in South Dakota — our country ’s political leaders are more focused on what ’s best for the favored few , rather than on improving the lives of Americans . ”
Sloan continued , “ From Gov. Jindal ’s hundreds of campaign - contributing state appointees to Gov. Paterson ’s efforts to pressure a domestic violence victim to stay silent , ” the report “ leaves you wondering if these really are the people best equipped to handle the complicated problems faced across the nation . ”

Two of the governors listed are running for re-election this year .
Gov. Perry of Texas holds a slim lead over his Democratic rivals , while Nevada ’s Jim Gibbons has been described as “ deeply unpopular ” in the state but recently saw himself leading in the polls , by a slim margin , for November .
News of CREW ’s worst governors list has already started making waves in the governors ’ home states .
CREW also put together a list of statistics ( PDF ) on the governors .
Among the facts cited : Five of the governors “ threatened to reject stimulus funds ” but “ took the stimulus anyway ” ; seven have been investigated by ethics commissions ; and nine were “ subject to federal or state investigations . ”

CREW notes that , because of differences between states on ethics policies , it ’s difficult to compare governors .
“ It is nearly impossible to compare governorsÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢ adherence to the laws because state rules and laws vary so widely .
Each state has its own ethical rules and standards , ” the watchdog group said .

Zacarias Moussaoui , dubbed the " 20th hijacker " by federal prosecutors , would have been released from federal custody before the 9 - 11 attacks if not for the heroic persistence of field agents in the FBI 's Minneapolis office .
Agent Coleen Rowley and members of her FBI team carried on a running fight with top FBI and Justice Department officials who tried to stop the Minnesota investigation and prevented a search of his laptop computer until after his fellow conspirators crashed their hijacked planes on September 11 .
Moussaoui , a French citizen of Moroccan descent , was arrested by the local FBI agents after investigating a tip from Minnesota flight school operators who were suspicious over the nature of his requests for training on a 747 simulator .
He has admitted to being a member of Osama bin Laden 's al - Qaeda terrorist group , but denies that he was part of the 9 - 11 conspiracy .
His trial has been delayed by his erratic behavior and numerous appeals .
There are many important , unanswered questions concerning Moussaoui .
For instance :
Why have federal officials pointedly ignored publicly available facts showing that most of the $ 64,000 he received from al - Qaeda sources was spent in the Oklahoma City area , where he attended the Airman Flight School in nearby Norman and had tics to a top suspect in the 1995 bombing of Oklahoma City 's Murrah Building ?
The largest chunk of Moussaoui 's funds , $ 35,000 , was provided by al - Qaeda paymaster Yazid Sufaat , one of the principal hosts of the secret al - Qaeda planning meeting for 9 - 11 in Malaysia .
Moussaoui , according to federal authorities , was operating under the direction of al - Qaeda mastermind Khalid Shaikh Mohammed , who met in the Philippines with his nephew , World Trade Center bomber Ramzi Yousef , during the same time period that Yousef was meeting with Terry Nichols .
September 11 hijacker Ziad Jarrah 's ticket ( United Airlines Flight 93 ) was purchased from a computer terminal at Oklahoma University in Norman .
Moussaoui was a frequent visitor to the OU campus , worked out at the OU gym and recruited OU student Hussain Al - Attas .
September 11 hijacker Mohammed Atta , a member of al - Qaeda 's cell in Hamburg , Germany , visited the same Norman , Oklahoma , flight school that Moussaoui attended .
Fellow Hamburg Cell hijacker Marwan Al - Shehhi also came to the Oklahoma City area , where he got a speeding ticket in 2001 .
According to the testimony of the owner of a small motel in Oklahoma City , Moussaoui , Atta and Al - Shehhi all came to his motel together to rent a room about six weeks prior to the 9 - 11 attacks .
Six years earlier , Oklahoma City bombing conspirators Timothy McVeigh and Nichols also were guests at the same motel , along with several Middle Eastern men , weeks prior to the OKC bombing .
Terrorist , Informant or Agent Provocateur ?
Perhaps the most important and purposely neglected " coincidence " concerning Moussaoui is his connection to convicted felon Melvin Lattimore , a convert to Islam who now goes by the name Majahid Abdulquaadir Menepta .
The unwillingness of federal authorities to hold Lattimore / Menepta as a 9 - 11 suspect in the case is stunning .
Equally stunning is the fact that he was never arrested as a suspect in the Oklahoma City bombing .
Here are some key facts concerning Menepta tying him to the biggest terrorist events in U.S. history : * Lattimore / Menepta 's credit card was used to help finance the 1993 World Trade Center bombing directed by Ramzi Yousef . *
Federal ATF
Agent Jeffrey
Whitney has testified in court that one day after the Oklahoma City bombing , an FBI informant told FBI superiors that Menepta should be considered a top suspect in the Oklahoma attack . *
Several employees at Travelers Aid , one block from the Murrah Building , identified Menepta as entering the Travelers Aid office with three other men the day before the Oklahoma City bombing .
Two of the men accompanying Menepta were identified as closely resembling associates of McVeigh , and one of the witnesses positively identified the vehicle that the group drove away in as McVeigh 's beat - up Mercury Marquis . *
Menepta was a member of a militant mosque in St. Louis and is now a member of a radical mosque in Norman , where he says he saw Moussaoui on a daily basis .
According to Oklahoma news accounts , Menepta and Moussaoui were roommates in Norman , while Moussaoui attended flight school . *
Menepta 's roommate , Al - Attas , drove Moussaoui from Oklahoma to Minnesota to begin flight school there .
When Al - Attas was arrested , Menepta drove to Minnesota and posted $ 5,000 bail for his release . *
When Menepta and Al - Attas returned to Norman on August 21,2001 , more than three weeks before 9 - 11 , agents from the Oklahoma City FBI office knocked on their apartment door .
According to the agents , several men fled the apartment and exited the building before the agents could react .
Also , according to FBI documents , 9 - 11 hijacker Salem Al - Hazmi was seen in Menepta 's Norman apartment in April 2001 .*
Menepta was arrested one month after the 9 - 11 attacks as a material witness and possible co-conspirator .
Menepta vigorously defended Moussaoui as a " scapegoat . " *
Menepta was prosecuted for illegally possessing weapons as a convicted felon .
( He had been convicted of robbery in 1971 and served four years in prison . )
He was sentenced in 2002 to 15 months in prison and is now back on the street .
THE NEW AMERICAN interviewed Gloria Smith , a manager at Travelers Aid in Oklahoma City , who is positive that Menepta / Lattimore is one of the men who came into her office the day before the Oklahoma City bombing .
The men had asked for gasoline money or vouchers and had become loud and argumentative when the receptionist explained that they would have to first provide a valid driver 's license .
Mrs. Smith stepped out of her office to reinforce her besieged receptionist and to emphasize the company policy requiring photo I.D. before aid could be given .
The men left in a huff , and Mrs. Smith watched them through the office window as they got into the car and drove off .
She told THE NEW AMERICAN that the man who had done most of the talking , and who had long , reddish - blonde hair , " flipped me ' the finger ' " as he got into the cat ' .
He had also cursed her in the office , just a few feet from her face , so she had good reason to remember him .
She is fairly certain , she says , that the man is James Rosencrans , based on photos she has examined of Rosencrans .
Mr. Rosencrans is a former associate of Timothy McVeigh and the Kingman , Arizona , neighbor of Michael Fortier , McVeigh 's fellow bombing conspirator who turned witness for the government in exchange for leniency for himself and his wife , Lori Fortier .
Of two things Mrs. Smith is " very certain " :
The black man in the group who came to her office is Menepta , and the car they drove was McVeigh 's Mercury Marquis .
She says she got a good look at Menepta .
And , she notes , as soon as McVeigh 's car appeared on television news broadcasts , she knew instantly it was the one that had been in her parking lot .
She recalls : " I said to the receptionist when they pulled out , ' No wonder they did n't give I.D. , there 's not even a tag on the car . ' "
When McVeigh was arrested the next day , shortly after the bombing , there was no license plate on the vehicle .
Mrs. Smith and other employees at Travelers Aid were interviewed several times by the FBI , in Mrs. Smith 's case about 10 times .
One of the things that she says has troubled her most about the investigation is that rather than simply asking her and the other witnesses what and who they saw , on several occasions the agents were very insistent on convincing the witnesses that they could not have seen a black man ( Menepta ) with the suspects .
At any rate , the FBI Travelers Aid interviews , recorded in written form on the FBI 's " 302s , " should have shown up in the documents that the government was required to turn over to the defense teams in the McVeigh and Nichols trials .
They never were turned over , and now they seem to have disappeared .
It 's understandable that Nichols ' defense team would not want to open up the Oklahoma City - Middle East connection , since so much of it leads to their client .
But why have federal officials gone to such extraordinary lengths to obstruct every effort to expose these connections ?
And why are they protecting Lattimore / Menepta ?
Is he a terrorist , a federal informant , an agent provocateur -- or all of the above ?
After reading about E's new reality series , Pretty Wild , about a Playmate mother and her playmate / jewel thief daughters I was filled with my usual mix of emotions that surface every time I learn of a new reality show filled with shallow lowlifes : / / ( fear of the future , fear of the present , fear of getting sucked into said show during an innocent trip to the gym ) .
When I find myself getting too worked up over the popularity of trashy reality television , and shudder at its potential influence on my children or the culture at large , I remind myself that some of these shows are valuable learning tools of " what not to be . "
Do n't get me wrong , I do n't want my kids * to watch this stuff , but if they do , why not use it to my advantage ?
I dedicate several pages in my book , " Raising the Perfect Child Through Guilt and Manipulation , " to this very topic .
I remind my readers that if you walk in and your child is watching a disgusting reality show ( Jersey Shore comes to mind ) instead of sprinting to shut it off , shouting , " This is n't appropriate ! "
A better choice might be to walk in , look at the television for a beat , and then proclaim something along the lines of , " What the hell is this ... seven people showering together ?
They might as well be scrubbing themselves with a loofa full of Gonorrhea ! "
Then , instead of shutting off the TV , you leave it on and just walk out of the room , allowing the and to wash over them like a tidal wave .
At the end of the day , your kids might watch that trashy show again , but they 'll never be on that trashy show , and that 's all you really care about .
* I use the term " my kids " very loosely , since my children are only 4 and 2 and this is not currently an issue -- if my tiny kids were regularly watching Jersey Shore , our problems would be much larger than the scope of this blog post !
There is no question about it ...
Cheech & Chong are comedy legends !
The pot -smoking duo began their career as stand - up comics in the early ' 70s and gained attention for a string of popular comedy albums , which featured hit songs like " Basketball Jones . "
However , it was their feature film debut in ' 1978s Up In Smoke that made them icons to stoners all around the world .
The two broke up in the mid ' 80s and with rumors of bad blood between the former friends ; fans thought that they would never see they 'd see the dynamic duo of dope together again .
Chances started to look even slimmer in 2003 when Tommy was unjustly arrested and incarcerated for " conspiring to distribute drug paraphernalia , " but upon his release in 2004 rumors started to fly about the two comedians finally reuniting .
In 2008 , the team publicly announced that they would be reuniting for an upcoming tour , titled " Cheech & Chong Light Up America / Canada . "
While out on tour last year the two recorded several shows that can now be seen in a brand new concert comedy film called , Cheech & Chong 's Hey Watch
This , which will be a multi- platform release opening in limited theatres across the country as well as on DVD / Blu-ray , Video On Demand service , and available to stream through PS3 and Xbox360 Networks on April 4th , ironically 4/20 .
We recently had the rare honor of sitting down with the two pot-icons and having a candid conversation with them about Cheech & Chong 's Hey Watch
This , reuniting on tour together after all these years , legalizing marijuana in California , making Up in Smoke 2 and how they created their most famous comedy bit , " Dave 's not here ! "
To watch our exclusive interview please click on the video clip below .
Cheech & Chong are back in an all - new adventure as they bring their hilarious antics on stage across America in Cheech & Chong 's Hey Watch This .
The new concert film was shot while the two were on their reunion tour last year , Cheech & Chong Light Up America / Canada , which was a resounding success with sellouts at almost every venue in every major city in the U.S. and Canada .
The hilarious footage in Cheech & Chong 's Hey Watch
This , captures the essence of the Cheech & Chong live show , which has made the two comedians legends , icons and fan favorites across all demographics and generations for decades .
The Clojure macro binding is frequently handy for mocking out functionality during testing , but this sometimes does not behave as desired in multi- threaded context .
Fortunately , there 's a solution ...
For example , at work we have unit tests on functions that may attempt to talk to network services , which we 'd rather they not do :
( defn send - request [ request server ] '( ... do real RPC stuff here ... ) ) ( defn average - timestamp [ time - servers ] (/ ( apply + ( map #( send - request : get- timestamp % ) time - servers ) ) ( count time - servers ) ) )
In order to test average - timestamp , we need a " mock " function that will stand in for send - request .
This must be a function that takes a request and a server and returns a timestamp , just like the real send - request .
For this example , it can take the timestamp itself as the " server " and simply return that timestamp .
For bonus points we can make sure the request parameter is what we expect :
( defn mock - send - request [ request server ] ( assert ( = request : get - timestamp ) ) server ) ; assume " server " is actually the timestamp ( mock - send - request : get- timestamp 5 ) ;=> 5
Using binding we can temporarily replace send - request with mock - send - request :
( binding [ send - request mock - send - request ] ( send- request : get- timestamp 5 ) ) ;=> 5 ( binding [ send - request mock - send - request ] ( average - timestamp [ 5 15 ] ) ) ;=> 10
So there 's the background : a pretty normal way to mock out stuff in Clojure .
What this does n't address is when some clever co-worker ( hi , Nathan ! ) realizes that average - timestamp would work better if it talked to multiple time - servers in parallel , and that this could be easily accomplished by replacing the use of map with pmap :
( defn average - timestamp [ time - servers ] (/ ( apply + ( pmap #( send - request : get- timestamp % ) time - servers ) ) ( count time - servers ) ) )
This is an easy single - letter change that indeed works quite well with the real send - request .
But when we try to use binding to mock it out , we run into problems :
( binding [ send - request mock - send - request ] ( average - timestamp [ 5 15 ] ) ) ; java.lang.ClassCastException : ; clojure.lang.PersistentList cannot be cast to java.lang .
Number
It 's not obvious from the error message , but what 's happening is our original un-mocked send - request is getting called .
This is because binding only has an effect on the current thread , but pmap causes send - request to be called in other threads .
The solution is simple enough in Clojure 1.0 -- you simply mock out pmap as well , and since the API is identical to map , it 's quite easy to do .
But as you can see , this does us no good at all in recent versions of Clojure :
( binding [ send - request mock - send - request pmap map ] ( average - timestamp [ 5 15 ] ) ) ; java.lang.ClassCastException : ; clojure.lang.PersistentList cannot be cast to java.lang .
Number
The reason is that starting with Clojure 1.1 , most clojure .core
Vars are linked directly into code that uses them .
This means that our definition of average - timestamp above links directly to the actual definition of clojure .
core / pmap , not just the Var that points to it , thus attempts to rebind the Var with binding are futile .
But do not despair , there is a solution even for this .
All you need to do is tell Clojure not to directly link pmap when it compiles average - timestamp .
This is done by adjusting pmap 's metadata before average - timestamp is compiled , like so :
; Set pmap to be dynamically linked ( alter - meta ! #' pmap assoc : dynamic true ) ;
Must now re-define the function that uses pmap ( defn average - timestamp [ time - servers ] (/ ( apply + ( pmap #( send - request : get- timestamp % ) time - servers ) ) ( count time - servers ) ) ) ;
Finally , our mocking out of pmap works ( binding [ send - request mock - send - request pmap map ] ( average - timestamp [ 5 15 ] ) ) ;=> 10
The best place to put the alter - meta !
depends on your particular use case .
You might want to figure out how to do the alter - meta !
only when in testing and not in production .
Remember that the metadata on pmap is global -- you 're changing the only metadata that clojure .
core / pmap has , so the namespace you 're in when you do it makes no difference at all .
In our case at work however , the performance impact of leaving pmap dynamic all the time was not enough to worry about .
Dynamic linking is still pretty fast and is fine even for our production uses of pmap in this particular code base .
So we simply put the alter - meta !
at the top of the file that used pmap and got on with our unit testing .
The Joy of Clojure Thinking the Clojure Way
by Michael Fogus and Chris Houser
A series of anxious shadow ministers have warned the Tory leadership in private that David Cameron 's central general election message – devolving power to create a " big society " – is crashing on the doorstep as candidates struggle to explain the idea to voters .
As Cameron 's circle intensify their preparations for Thursday 's television debate , by issuing pleas at Tory HQ for fresh ideas , shadow ministers have told the leadership that their " big idea " is too vague and needs to be scrapped in favour of practical policies .
The nervous discussions come as party officials experience a rollercoaster ride in the face of conflicting opinion polls .
A ComRes poll for ITV / the Independent gave the Tories , on 35 % , a nine - point lead over Labour and the Liberal Democrats on 26 % .
Other polls indicated that Nick Clegg was still on a roll after his success in last week 's television debate .
The ComRes poll went some way to soothing frayed nerves among Tories who believe that the apparent Lib Dem surge has highlighted deep flaws in the Conservative campaign .
Criticism is focusing on Steve Hilton , the director of strategy , and Oliver Letwin , the shadow cabinet policy co-ordinator , who were the main brains behind last week 's Tory manifesto .
This was entitled Invitation to Join the Government of Britain and was designed to illustrate the " big society " idea of handing power to people to set up schools and sack police chiefs .
But shadow ministers say the Letwin and Hilton approach is difficult to sell on the doorstep .
" Oliver Letwin had this great ' big society ' idea , though it might have been an idea to share it with the rest of us , " one normally loyal shadow minister said .
" People do n't really follow Oliver 's philosophical discourse . "
Another shadow minister echoed this criticism .
" The ' big society ' needs to be turned into more practical , voter - friendly language .
We need to turn Oliver Letwin 's Hegelian dialectic into voter friendly stuff . "
A third Tory source was even blunter .
" The ' big society ' is bollocks .
It is boiled vegetables that have been cooked for three minutes too long .
It tastes of nothing .
What is it ? "
Tories are agreed that it would be wrong for Cameron to embark on the sort of lurch to the right that destroyed William Hague 's leadership .
They say that the ' big society ' strategy is right but needs to be illustrated with specific policy proposals .
The leadership appeared to respond to these criticisms today by unveiling a hardline poster featuring the party 's policies to crack down on benefit cheats .
" Let 's cut benefits for those who refuse to work , " the poster says next to a picture of Cameron .
Tim Montgomerie , the founder of the ConservativeHome wesbite , wrote tonight : " It 's good to see the party getting specific about what ' change ' means . "
The new Tory poster
Cameron himself embarked on a slight change of tactics todaywhen he began a walkabout in the marginal seat of Tamworth , where he said he wanted to answer " the questions real people want to ask " .
He took questions about free care for the elderly , immigration , the impact of fuel prices on hauliers and the future of the NHS .
The Tory leader , who will tomorrow visit the Lib Dem stronghold of the south west , gave his strongest warning of the danger of voting for Clegg .
A hung parliament would " lead to a sort of stagnation to a sort of haggling and a bickering among politicians and we wo n't get done what so badly needs to be done in our country " .
His tough language will please internal critics who are annoyed that the leadership is not selling flagship policies .
" We have some great policies but we 're not talking about them , " said one Tory .
" I had no idea that we have a great idea to give 1 million more people access to an NHS dentist .
What a great idea .
Why are n't we shouting about that ? …
It is a great policy and nobody knows about it . "
The criticism of the election campaign came amid the first signs of whisperings about Cameron 's leadership .
There was disbelief among some Tories when the leader responded to Clegg 's strong performance by decreeing last Friday that nothing needed to change .
The leadership embarked on a rethink at the weekend , resulting in a hastily filmed personal statement by Cameron for an election broadcast on Monday night , when the Lib Dems surged in the polls .
One senior figure said : " The project is all about Dave .
So if he succeeds it is about him .
But if he fails it is about him . "
The source was clear about what would happen if Labour and the Lib Dems formed a coalition in a hung parliament to push through electoral reform .
" By then we would have murdered our leader and his head would be on a stake .
The last week shows how thin our support was .
There is no great enthusiasm for Cameron . "
Last July , a blogger named Carles , writing for the site Hipster Runoff , clustered together a handful of up - and - coming bands with a similar sound and recording approach and , by most accounts , birthed a new genre : chillwave .
It didnt take long for other music sites to start throwing around the term .
About six months removed from the summer of chillwave , Toro Y Mois debut LP is being released in the dead of winter , read a recent Pitchfork review of an album by multi-instrumentalist Chaz Bundick , who performs under the name Toro Y Moi .

A former immigration judge has been found guilty of trying to coerce sex from a South Korean refugee claimant in return for a favourable ruling on her case .
“ He knew that what he was doing was wrong , ” Ontario Superior Court Justice Thea Herman said Wednesday in finding Steve Ellis guilty of breach of trust and an Immigration and Refugee Protection Act charge of bribery .
“ Mr. Ellis abused his position to his own advantage . ”
Ellis , 51 , who is also a former Toronto city councillor , showed little reaction to Herman ’s ruling at first , but at one point raised his head and sighed .
Ellis presided over Ji Hye Kim ’s refugee hearing in July 2006 , reserving his decision .
Two months later , he twice visited the Korean restaurant where she worked and arranged to meet her for coffee to discuss her case .
Suspicious of Ellis ’ intentions , Kim ’s then - boyfriend and now - husband , Brad Tripp , recorded the Sept. 26 , 2006 meeting at a Starbucks patio on Bloor St. near Bathurst .
Tripp wired Kim for sound and parked across the street with a video camera , filming the meeting until dark .
The resulting 43 - minute sound tape , 28 minutes of which had corresponding video , was the centrepiece of the Crown ’s case .
The tape shows Ellis telling the slender , 25 - year - old South Korean that he still had not decided on her claim but was leaning toward approval .
“ I really like you , and I really want to be friends with you , ” Ellis said .
Ellis asked if she had a boyfriend .
When she said she did , he told her that was okay because he had a wife and they “ can be secret on this too . ”
He warned her not to tell her boyfriend about their meeting because he might try to make trouble .
“ He ’ll say , ‘ Oh yeah , you know that guy . . . she ’s f---ing him and that ’s why he said yes . ”
Ellis told Kim he had a loveless marriage and was planning to dump his Filipina mistress .
“ Do n’t worry .
I ’m not going to be demanding .
I ’m not going to ask you to move in with me or anything like that .
. . .
I ’m not going to fall in love with you . ”
John Rosen , Ellis ’s lawyer , had argued that his client might have behaved inexcusably toward Kim , but he never actually asked for sex in exchange for giving her refugee status .
But Crown attorney Lynda Trefler alleged that Ellis , named to the federal refugee board in 2000 , plotted the woman ’s seduction from an early stage .
He had “ a detailed and deliberate plan to manipulate her psychologically ” and get her into bed , Trefler said .
The judge said although Ellis never directly told Kim he would change his decision from a no to a yes if she had a relationship with him , his intentions were clear .
“ There is no doubt that Mr. Ellis intended to use his public office — in particular , his considerable power over Ms. Kim — for his own benefit , that is , for an intimate relationship with Ms. Kim , ” Herman said .
“ Mr. Ellis literally held Ms. Kim ’s life in his hands , ” Herman said .
“ He toyed with her right up to the end . ”

Kim told reporters outside court that she was very happy with the result , which shows that Canadian justice applies to immigration adjudicators too .
“ I ’m just glad that no one will have to go through what I went through , ” said Kim , now a landed immigrant .
Rosen said that he and his client were disappointed with the decision but will not decide whether to appeal until reading it in its entirety .
Ellis will be back in court for a sentencing hearing on June 4 .
Both offences carry maximum sentences of five years .

Sen. Scott Brown ( R - MA ) continued to distance himself from the members of the fringe right by refusing to call President Barack Obama a Socialist today on CBS ’ Face The Nation .
When asked the Socialism question , Brown said , “ I think the President is a good man … I know he cares deeply about our country .
But it – it ’s just different priorities . ”
Brown also took a swipe at the birthers by saying that he knows that Obama is an American .
Here is the video from CBS News :

When asked by host Bob Schieffer whether he thought Obama was moving the country towards socialism , Brown said , “ I do n’t think he ’s making proper choices when it comes to dealing with the– the free market and free enterprise and allowing businesses to– to really run themselves and create jobs .
And as a result , larger government is happening and we ’re creating jobs but they ’re all government jobs .
And the private sector is definitely – definitely suffering . ”
He clarified his answer when he was asked about Sarah Palin and the right wing ’s charge that Obama does n’t share American values , “ I– I think the President is a good man .
He ’s– has a good family .
He has two wonderful daughters .
And I recognize that challenge what– what that can hold and –and I respect the office of President .
And I ’ve always said that , you know , he is an American .
I know he cares deeply about our country .
But it – it ’s just different priorities . ”
These are the statements of new senator who knows that he represents a Blue state where President Obama is popular .
It is obvious now that Scott Brown is no Tea Party member , and certainly not a birther .
He intentionally distanced himself from the rhetoric of Sarah Palin and the far right .
There seems to be a push back going on from a small group of moderate Senate Republicans who are rejecting the extreme attacks against President Obama .
These comments are smart politics for Scott Brown .
The fastest way for him to lose his Senate seat in a couple of years would be for him to move to the far right , and be totally out of step with his constituents in Massachusetts .
Brown is not a radical Republican .
He is a fiscally conservative moderate , who took the money and support of the Tea Party , but probably never had any intention of implementing their agenda .
Brown is definitely more Mitt Romney than Sarah Palin and the Tea Party .

SAN FRANCISCO —
By day , they dealt with risk .
At night , it got risqué .
Financiers , lawyers , traders and accountants gathered this week at the annual International Swaps and Derivatives Association conference here to discuss “ Collateralization and Netting — the Impact ” and “ Systemic Risk : Advances and Challenges in the Wake of the Crisis . ”
By Thursday night they needed to put out of their minds the specter of sweeping legislation to regulate the derivatives .
They escaped to Supperclub , a bar and restaurant , where some plopped on the beds that covered the floor while a waiter in denim short shorts , suspenders and a scarf delivered drinks .
The truly relaxed turned over on their tummies and received back massages from a dreadlocked member of the Supperclub staff .
By midnight , others ended up in the S & M chamber with a bed - to - ceiling stripper pole and videos of dominatrixes playing in the background .

Here 's another view of what we 've been calling the " Scariest Jobs Chart Ever . "
It 's from Calculated Risk , and it shows the percent of job losses since the peak for all the post - war recessions .
In this version of the chart , the job losses are aligned at the month of peak job loss .
( In the previous versions we 've shown , the job losses are aligned by the month in which the recession started ) .
Two things to notice here :
First , again , this ( red line ) is by far the worst job loss since the Great Depression .
And we 're still bumping along the bottom .
Second , the two most recent recessions , 1990 ( black line ) and 2001 ( burnt sienna line ) , both saw jobless recoveries ( it took years for the jobs to come back ) .
If the recovery from our current recession is similar to the earlier recessions , we will see a sharp snap - back .
If the recovery is similar to the two most recent recessions , however , recovering all those lost jobs is going to take several years .

Why ?
Because I hate Oracle .
I hate how it works .
I hate its name .
I hate the logo .
I hate Larry Ellison .
I even hate The Oracle from The Matrix .
Good to get that out of the way .
But I figure , with all of the people out there touched by Oracle , there 's gotta be a whole lot who hate it as much as I do .
Or , a the very least , have an utter discontent for it .
So that 's what this is all about : sharing your ramblings about the product / company or , if you 're brave , sticking up for the absurdity that has become Oracle .
If you want to become an official member , simply reply here .
And believe it or not , I actually have some rational reasons to hate Oracle .
So , let me start out by sharing just a few of them them
It ’s from the world of UNIX and makes sure you know it
UNIX is n’t just another platform , it ’s a whole set of cultural values .
Although I respect the other side , I just prefer move , copy , and delete instead of mv , cp , and rm .
But not Oracle , goodness no ; it came from UNIX , and by golly , it ’ll act like it .
It insists on a root directory “ C: \Oracle ” instead of recognizing the decade - old “ Program Files . ”
Its screens do n’t look like normal windows .
It even refuses to put itself in just as old “ Add / Remove Programs ” list .
And the list goes on .
Just to contrast , look at Microsoft ’s Office : mac ; even the website does n’t look like Microsoft .
Now that ’s respect for another culture .
Just use the command prompt , sissy
Oracle is in their tenth revision .
Why do they refuse to ship a tool other than a SQL command - prompt ?
Because real developers do n’t need no stinkin’ tool .
Unless you ’re a “ real ” developer , you ’re forced to use a third party tool .
And just take a quick look at the number one tool .
Seriously .
Do n’t let the “ I let my kid design my brand ” look fool you , it ’s like $ 1,500 or so .
The site does n’t list prices , so I think we know what that means .
I can’t figure the damn thing out
Oracle was kind enough to send a personal edition of their product for me to try out .
I installed the whole 2GB bloatware package , guessing on most of the configuration options which provided no defaults .
It had a handful of programs it installed , but knowing none actually do anything database - wise , I went directly into the SQL * Plus command prompt .
After an hour of figuring out how to connect to myself , I still could n’t figure out how to get the thing to connect as a SYSADMIN to so I could run some DDL SQL scripts .
I do n’t think it ’s even necessary for me to mention I learned all I need to know about being a DBA ( from creating maintenance plans to replication ) by just clicking around in Enterprise Manager and reading context - sensitive help .
Optimize it yourself , idiot
I ’m going to write a whole separate post going into more detail than this .
But , it would seem that real developers do n’t need no stinkin’ query optimizer guessing which indexes to use where .
I ca n’t tell you how many times I ’ve had to terminate TOAD or SQL * Plus because I accidentally had a non-indexed column in the SELECT list , causing a FULL TABLE scan .
Apparently , it ’s not up to the database to use an index to filter by row , then select columns from the filtered rows .
The VARCHAR2 Type
Seriously .
Thank goodness they do n’t have power to name types outside of their database .
I could just picture it , a String6 is just like a String4 , but concatenates differently ( like the now - obsolete String2 did ) .
The regular “ Health Check - Ups ” best - practice
I ’m going on the word of a few Oracle DBA here , but they claim that it ’s a best - practice to have a high faulting consultant ( an Oracle Oracle if you will ) , come in semi-annually and check the health of your database .
I ’m all about going to the auto mechanic regularly and having the HVAC guy come over once in a while .
But that ’s because those cars and heaters cannot possibly maintain themselves .
Should n’t advanced software be able to perform self - maintenance ?
It ’s an insult to Computer Science and the Relational Model
As our favorite Oracle guru puts it , “ One of the remarkable extensions of the Oracle database is the ability to reference Oracle objects directly by using pointers as opposed to relational table joins . ”
I ’m sure I ’ll write about this more later , but the insults continue with the instance of using row numbers and the abomination of nested tables .
Yes , it takes a lot to create something that does n’t adhere to First Normal Form .
No wonder Mr. Burleson needs consultants like himself to come in later and fix the mess he made .

It would be understating matters to say that Thackeray rather looked down on Dickens , but , even as Vanity Fair was first being serialized in 1847 , he picked up the fifth installment of Dombey and Son and then brought it down with a smack on the table , exclaiming the while , “ There ’s no writing against such power as this — one has no chance !
Read that chapter describing young Paul ’s death : it is unsurpassed — it is stupendous ! ”
Almost a decade later , Dickens was dispatching an admiring note to George Eliot on the publication of her very first fiction , Scenes of Clerical Life .
He felt he had penetrated the guileless disguise of her nom de plume : “ If [ the sketches ] originated with no woman , I believe that no man ever before had the art of making himself , mentally , so like a woman , since the world began . ”
So I find the plan of my original enterprise falling away from me ; I must give it up ; there is something formidable about Dickens that may not be gainsaid .
He may not have had Shakespeare ’s or Eliot ’s near omniscience about human character , but he did say , in an address on the anniversary of the Bard ’s birthday : “ We meet on this day to celebrate the birthday of a vast army of living men and women who will live for ever with an actuality greater than that of the men and women whose external forms we see around us . ”
As Peter Ackroyd commented in his Dickens ( 1990 ) , he must have been “ thinking here of Hamlet and Lear , of Macbeth and Prospero , but is it not also true ” that in Portsmouth in February 1812 were born “ Pecksniff and Scrooge , Oliver Twist and Sairey Gamp , Samuel Pickwick and Nicholas Nickleby … the Artful Dodger and Wackford Squeers …? ” I cite this occasion for a reason .
In Michael Slater ’s volume , we learn only that on April 22 , 1854 , Dickens chaired “ a Garrick Club dinner to celebrate Shakespeare ’s birthday . ”
This is of course worth knowing in its own right , but is perhaps a little bloodless by comparison .
Slater is invariably flattering toward Ackroyd ’s work , but could perhaps have taken a leaf or two from its emotional eloquence .
Who does not know of the formative moments in the life of Dickens the boy ?
The feeble male parent , the death of a sibling , the awful indenture to “ the blacking factory , ” the pseudo - respectable school where the master slashed the boys with a cane as if to satisfy what was later identified in Mr. Creakle as “ a craving appetite . ”
The sending of the father to the Marshalsea debtors ’ prison , the refuge taken by a quakingly sensitive child in the consoling pages of fiction … all this we have long understood .
So great was the dependence of Dickens on his own life experience that he almost resented the fact and was very guarded , even with his loyal biographer , John Forster , on the question , as if unwilling to admit such a ( very non -Shakespearean ) limitation .
This is why it is so good to have the “ autobiographical fragment ” that Forster preserved and later published , which formed a sort of posthumous codicil to David Copperfield and still helps explain why that novel above all others was its author ’s favorite .
Forster diagnosed in his subject a syndrome of “ the attraction of repulsion , ” which , while simple enough in its way , goes far to explain why Dickens was at his best when evoking childhood misery , incarceration , premature mortality , hard labor , cheating and exploitation by lawyers and doctors , and the other phenomena that were the shades of his own early prison house .
With these , as we now slackly say , he could “ identify . ”
If valid , this analysis would also go some distance to explain the very severe constraints on Dickens ’s legendary compassion .
This is the man who had a poor woman arrested for using filthy language in the street ; who essentially recast his friend Thomas Carlyle ’s pessimistic version of the French Revolution in fictional form in A Tale of Two Cities ( Slater is especially good on this ) ; who dreaded the mob more than he disliked the Gradgrinds .
It would also account for his weakest and most contrived novel , Martin Chuzzlewit , and its companion nonfiction compilation , American Notes .
Genuine radicals and reformers in mid-19th - century England were to be defined above all as sympathizers with the American Revolution and with the cause of the Union in the Civil War .
Dickens was scornful of the first and hostile to the second .
His exiguous chapter on slavery in American Notes was lazily annexed word - for - word from a famous abolitionist pamphlet of the day , and employed chiefly to discredit the whole American idea .
But when it came to a fight on the question , he was on balance sympathetic to the Confederate states , which he had never visited , and made remarks about Negroes that might have shocked even the pathologically racist Carlyle .
I had not understood , before Slater ’s explanation , that the full title , American Notes for General Circulation , was a laborious pun on the supposed bankruptcy of the whole “ currency ” of the United States .
Karl Marx , that great supporter of Lincoln and the Union , was therefore probably lapsing into a rare sentimentality when he wrote to Friedrich Engels that Dickens had “ issued to the world more political and social truths than have been uttered by all the professional politicians , publicists and moralists put together . ”
( Ackroyd mentions this letter , while Slater does not . )
Over the past 12 years , the government has spent billions on tackling problem drug use .
Has it been money well spent ?
The official answer , we learn today , is " have n't the foggiest " .
Today an influential all - party Commons committee said it was " unacceptable " that the government has never bothered to evaluate the measures on which huge sums have been lavished as part of its drugs strategy for England and Wales ( see Tackling problem drug use [ 647 KB PDF ] ) .
In a short but pithy report , the MPs simply state that the Home Office " does not know how to most effectively tackle problem drug use " .
The report concludes that :
" The Government spends £ 1.2 billion a year on measures aimed at tackling problem drug use , yet does not know what overall effect this spending is having . "
Why ?
The Treasury demands that value for money audits are conducted on almost every aspect of public spending - except , it seems , when dealing with the " evil " of drugs .
On this , it would seem , ministers have preferred to rely on instinct .
Twelve years after launching the first drugs strategy , the Home Office has now agreed " to produce an overall framework to evaluate and report on the value for money achieved from the strategy , with initial results from late 2011 " .
What will be interesting is whether the demand for evidence in this area will prompt ministers to consider ideas which , in Britain at least , are regarded as politically off - limits .
The billions which have been spent on the government " strategy " are based on the belief that the way to reduce drug - related crime is to get problem users into treatment .
But the Home Office has been forced to admit that the theory is no more than that - an unproven theory .
" The Department said that it did not know whether the strategy had reduced the £ 13.9 billion cost of crimes committed by problem drug users and it could not prove a causal link between the measures in the strategy and the levels of offending by problem drug users . "
This is a far cry from the mantra which for years underpinned the entire drugs strategy ( see Tackling drugs , changing lives [ 289 KB PDF ] ) :
" Every £ 1 spent on treatment saves at least £ 9.50 in crime and health costs . "
It was a no - brainer for ministers desperate for an answer to the drugs crisis and the phrase popped up all over the place .
But even while home secretaries were using the line to justify massive investment in the drug treatment programme , internal government documents admitted the claim was " out of date " .
Many would argue that drug treatment is clearly better than no drug treatment and , for many people in crisis with their addiction , the support and help offered under the NTA scheme can be a life - saver .
It must also be true that , if someone is committing crime to fund a drug habit , an intervention which reduces or eradicates that addiction will probably reduce their crime .
But are we spending the money on the right kind of treatment for the right people ?
And , perhaps more importantly , is the answer to almost £ 14bn worth of drug - related crime simply more treatment or something more radical ?
The National Treatment Agency ( NTA ) , which runs the treatment programme for drug users in England and Wales , was asked whether their work cut crime .
NTA Chief Executive Paul Hayes replied that it had produced " very significant reductions in crime , and that is what has justified the huge increase in investment in drug treatment we have seen since 2001 " .
However Sir David Normington , the top civil servant at the Home Office , was asked for proof that recent falls in acquisitive crime could be attributed to treating addicts .
" I cannot prove an absolute causal link but it is a fair bet " , he replied .
When pressed , the NTA acknowledged that " over one - quarter of problem drug users showed a sharp increase in the volume of offending after entering treatment through the Drugs Intervention Programme " .
Interestingly , for this group of largely heroin addicts , the Commons committee latched on to the idea of giving them free heroin .
Here is the exchange between committee member Ian Davidson MP and Sir David :
Mr Davidson : " Have you considered giving them free drugs as a means of cutting crime in order to make everybody else 's lives better ? "
Sir David Normington : " There are those who think that should happen .
That , of course , is absolutely not the Government 's policy .
I think it is a sort of counsel of despair because it does not take you anywhere .
It means that you leave these people on drugs forever . "
Mr Davidson : " It is not a counsel of despair for the people who are living beside them , whose houses are getting broken into , with respect . "
The report also asserts that " measures to reduce problem drug use by young people have had limited impact " .
The most recent strategy published in 2008 , the MPs note , " reported that the prevalence of Class A drug use by young people has stayed relatively unchanged since the first strategy in 1998 " .
Another example of how hard it has proved to reduce drug harms is the recent rise in the number of people who die from illegal substances .
" The number of deaths among problem drug users has increased over the last five years to 1,620 in 2008 - 09 " , the report 's authors point out , although the NTA suggested to them that " there would have been 2,500 drug related deaths in that year if drug treatment had not been increased over this time . "
We are not to know what would have happened if the strategy had not existed , of course , but this is yet another report which questions whether our approach to drugs is actually the best way forward .
It is a vital debate for Britain and yet , as I suggested here yesterday , I doubt it will be discussed with any vigour during the election campaign .
Gordon Brown said today he intends to " keep going " as Labour leader even if the party loses the general election .
The prime minister signalled his intention to carry on in the event of a drubbing at the polls as part of a wide - ranging interview with BBC Radio 4's Woman 's
Hour programme this morning , in which he also admitted that allegations that he sometimes bullied his staff had been " damaging " .
The prime minister was put on the spot over his plans amid growing speculation that voters could return a minority government after the general election , which is expected to take place on 6 May .
Two polls at the weekend provided further evidence that the Tory lead is shrinking .
YouGov in the Sunday Times gave the Tories ( on 37 % ) a four - point lead over Labour , down one point on the Conservative lead in the Sunday Times poll the week before .
ICM in the Sunday Telegraph gave the Tories ( on 38 % ) a seven - point lead over Labour , down two points from the Conservative lead in the ICM poll for the same paper seven days earlier .
Brown insisted he would " keep going " in response to being asked whether he owed it to Labour to quit as leader if he failed to secure a decent majority .
He told the programme : " I owe it to people to continue and complete the work that we 've started of taking this country out of the global , financial recession .
To be honest , going around the country , I feel there 's more to do to improve the health service , more to do to give people better opportunities , more to do for women on maternity pay and equal pay , more to do against the discriminations that still exist .
We 've got this campaign to get more women in the boardroom as well . "
Pressed on whether he would quit , he said : " No , I 'll keep going because I want a majority .
I 'll keep going . "
His comments followed a report in today 's Times which quoted an unnamed senior minister suggesting that Brown would hope to remain Labour leader in the event of defeat at the polls .
The minister was quoted as saying : " Do n't underestimate Gordon .
Unless the rejection at the polls is large and personal , there is no reason for him to go quickly . "
Brown was pressed on the programme about the extent of detail voters could expect on public spending before the general election .
He said there would be " more information " in the budget , but admitted there was " uncertainty " because of unemployment .
" We have announced cuts and there will be more information in the budget , " he said .
He added : " At the moment we are not absolutely sure what 's happening to employment and unemployment .
We do n't know yet what savings we can get from cutting or keeping unemployment down , but that runs into billions of pounds .
If we have these savings , we can use them to fund departments .
If we do n't have these savings , it makes it more difficult .
So there is a degree of uncertainty at the moment about what we can do in the future . "
He insisted that hospitals , schools and policing would have their funding protected .
He acknowledged that was only for two years , but sought to reassure voters that the protection would remain after that period .
" I think you can be reasonably sure that the protection for health and education and policing will be continued , " he said .
" You will get the spending round in due course . "
Brown also told the programme that his decision to begin talking publicly about his personal life , which included a recent TV interview with Piers Morgan in which he talked about the death of his baby daughter , Jennifer Jane , was because the way he was represented in the press " is just not me " .
He had decided to open himself up to any questions to show " that there is no way I can be as one - dimensional as the newspapers are presenting so I decided that was the best thing to do " .
The Morgan interview was watched by 4.2 million people , twice the number who watched David Cameron feature in a fly - on - the - wall documentary on the same channel and Sunday evening slot last night .
The prime minister admitted that allegations in a book by the Observer 's Andrew Rawnsley that he had bullied staff had been " damaging " but defended his behaviour in the job and indicated he had not modified his conduct since .
" I'm a very tough person , " he said .
" I do n't think you can be in a job I am coming from a pretty ordinary background ... without being strong - willed and determined . "
He also rejected claims that he treated female colleagues as " little more than window dressing " – an accusation levelled at him by Caroline Flint when she stepped down as Europe minister last summer – or that he felt more comfortable with men than women .
" No , I feel more comfortable with women , " he laughed , " and I have worked very closely with the women who have worked with me . "

This gaming generation seems to be one of the most mainstream ever seen .
Consumer interest in video games has become ever growing , mainly thanks to Nintendo for rapidly expanding the market by bringing new gamers into the mix .
As the industry becomes more commercial , the amount of hype that circulates big game releases has been magnified a tremendous amount .
There are certain games that have received a huge amount of hype , but not necessarily lived up to it .
That ’s not to say the games are bad , but maybe the hype surrounding the game was blown a little bit out of proportion .
The following are games that I ( and a few other people whom I consulted ) feel has received a preposterous amount of hype for no real reason .
I created this list after asking the opinions of many different gamers , so you can be sure that there are many out there who will feel the same way .
Once again the point is not that these games were poor .
Just think of it as , there may have been other games that deserved some shine but we ’re sidelined by the hype of these .
Being over - hyped is very different from being overrated .
The term overrated refers to games which have been deemed better than they actually are .
The term over - hyped refers to games that got more attention than they possibly should have .
As long as you understand the difference , you can confidently agree with the list below .
—
Too Human
The fact that Silicon Knights spent over ten years developing this game automatically put a pressured amount of hype on Too Human .
People were feeling like a game being developed for that long had to be something unseen before in the gaming industry .
I actually own this game , and for the most part I enjoyed playing it .
RPG lovers who enjoy raiding areas and collecting loot should be very drawn to the experience that Too Human has to offer .
However given its hype , the game clearly does not match up .
Little Big Planet
Even though I am a big fan of this game , and fully respect what Media Molecule have done .
After speaking to numerous people on the issue , I have to agree that this game was indeed hyped to an unexplainable degree .
Though I believe that it was more the sales of the game that let down the game , as far as living up to the hype .
I believe Little Big Planet did show a lot of innovation , and it managed to build a community on a console similar to a PC game community .
However when you consider how humongous the hype around Little Big Planet was , the pay off should have been much bigger for both Sony and the gamers themselves .
Halo 3 : ODST
It is a very controversial decision to put this game on the list , and I am sure many will hurl insults at me for including it .
Halo 3 : ODST had some very tricky circumstances to consider .
However when you take into account the fact that this was genuinely being treated like a full successor to Halo 3 , you cannot ignore the fact that there was indeed way to much hype over it .
The game basically offers a new campaign , from the perspective of a completely different character to which we are used to .
Not to mention that the campaign was deemed way too short by many fans ; and although the game featured a new co-operative multiplayer type , it is hard to ignore that you are also being sold a disk with exactly the same multiplayer included in the original Halo 3 .
In Bungie ’s defense ; they do n’t think of ODST as a completely new addition to the Halo franchise , but then why did it have the same amount of hype that a completely new Halo should receive ?
Dark Void
Perhaps this one was down to the usability being unable to match the mass market appeal .
After all when you think of mass market appeal , you have to consider the fact that the product has to be able to translate well to all audiences .
Many casual gamers felt that Dark Void was too complicated to get to grips with , and therefore chose not to bother with it .
Which was in fact a shame because there was a lot of attention surrounding this game for a while , and then once it was released consumers chose not to act upon it .
M.A.G
Ever since gamers heard that a shooter would accommodate up to 256 players , the hype instantly materialized .
M.A.G was in many ways being seen as the military shooter that could possibly topple Call of Duty ’s online presence .
Although the game was indeed enjoyable , it failed to give shooting fans the kind of engagement that Modern Warfare ’s online mode provides .
Being a part of a squad in a game of over 200 gamers is definitely a thrilling concept ; the problem was that the aims of each squad we ’re not direct enough to force players to get strategic .
For the amount of hype the game received , M.A.G should have been groundbreaking .
—
Many games have been hyped and given a substantial amount of attention , where as other deserving games suffer .
This is the main reasoning for me to write an article like this .
The purpose of creating a game is to entertain people , and no matter what level of hype they receive they are all capable of doing so .
The main thing that makes us deem a game complete garbage is games that set the bar so high , it becomes hard for anyone to appreciate anything which offers less .
As usual I like to hear opinions of others , as it is not just my opinion that counts .
So please leave your comments letting us all know what you think .
Feel free to disagree with me if need be , as discussing games is also a part of the entertainment they provide .

Firefly type TV Show network Fox
Image Credit : Dark HorsePatton
Oswalt is a bigger Firefly geek than you .
The stand - up comic and actor was so taken with the canceled Fox series , he could n’t stop pestering creator Joss Whedon with questions about it on the set of Dollhouse , on which Oswalt appeared for two episodes .
Instead of getting fired , Oswalt got another job out of it .
He ’s writing the Wash - centric Serenity : Float Out , a Dark Horse comic coming out on June 2 that picks up where Serenity — the big screen version of the series — left off .
Oswalt recently talked with PopWatch about his love for Firefly — which was clearly evident in his voice — what readers can expect in Float Out , what makes Whedon so brilliant , and why Dr. Horrible is an “ asshole . ”
ENTERTAINMENT
WEEKLY : I had no idea you were a Firefly fan .
PATTON OSWALT : Man , I really loved that show .
It was such a bummer when it got canceled .
Joss
Whedon keeps creating these zeitgeist - grabbing , fun , brilliant shows that then Fox —
It ’s like he hands them over to an angry punk that throws them against the wall and ruins them .
[ Laughs ]
I do n’t understand why he has this relationship .
It ’s so odd .
So you watched it when it was on Fox ?
You were a lover from the start ?
Yes .
I watched the first two episodes .
This was just before I got my TiVo .
They kept moving it around and I would miss it because I ’d be traveling and doing stand - up .
Then I watched the whole [ thing ] on DVD .
Seeing it all like that , it made me love it .
Then it made me love it defensively because at that point , it was already dead .
It was like I was mourning this great thing that got beaten to the ground for no reason .
What did you love about the show ?
Clearly , he was sweating blood over creating this universe and then knew it so well that the characters could talk about it almost casually .
The way that he would toss off phrases and slang .
He loves science fiction and action and spaceships , so that ’s great .
But he also has , I think , such a good ear for how someone ’s slang can tip off where they ’re from , who they stand with , what kind of person they are .
I just love all that stuff .
I just want the brains and the fun behind it .
Usually , you get one without the other .
He ’s one of those few guys where you get both .
You get the brains and you get the fun .
Do you have a favorite episode ?
Favorite episode is definitely “ Out of Gas . ”
It ’s just a brilliant episode !
Favorite character ?
Kaylee .
She ’s so cute and so cool .
That actress was so amazing at talking the way that people would actually talk in panicky situations .
When they ’re trying to get ready to do the Crazy Ivan , she ’s like , “ Push the button ! ”
Jayne says , “ What button ? ”
She goes , “ Look at where I ’m pointing ! ”
Like , “ Look at me !
I ’ll tell you what to do ! ”
It felt like how people would actually act .
She took that character , who is so positive , and really made it fun and funny .
So upbeat .
Usually , in the space opera , people want to play the Han Solo character and she took what could have been a thankless role and made it amazing .
How did this Firefly comic come together ?
Did you approach them or did they come to you with it ?
I was on an episode of Dollhouse .
Joss and I could not have more interests in common .
I was talking to him like an annoying fanboy about Firefly and I think he was being very tolerant of me .
I was like , “ Do you remember in that one episode when … ” I had read the Firefly comics that they did for Dark Horse .
It ’s like being a Wire fan .
Any extras that are out there , you want them because there ’s such a finite amount of the thing that you love .
The fact that he was expanding on the story about the man with the blue hands in the comics , it just made you go , “ Oh , hey , what about … ? ”
He said , “ If you have an idea for a story , pitch me some stories . ”
I pitched him three stories and he really liked the Wash one , so that ’s the one we did .
What ’s the premise of the story ?
It ’s called Float Out .
“ Float out ” is an actual nautical term .
When you christen a ship , you knock a champagne bottle against it , give it its name , and then you float it out of dry docks .
It ’s three friends of Wash , who we ’ve never met , but they ’ve all worked with him in his wild past .
They have pooled up enough money to get their own ship , a class - four Firefly ship , which is the next generation of the Firefly .
They ’re going to call it The Jet Wash .
They ’re christening it after him and they ’re going to float out and start whatever their adventures are .
Without saying much more — just because there ’s a lot of surprises in the story — it ’s three pilots telling Wash stories .
Obviously , you have a background in comedy and Alan Tudyk was really funny in the role .
Are the stories humorous or will it be more nostalgic in tone ?
I hope that it ’ll be in the tone of Firefly .
Firefly had a lot of humor .
It had a lot of horror .
It had a lot of heartfelt stuff .
It had a lot of cynicism about religion and life and interpersonal relations and survival .
I hope that I ’ve wrapped up all those elements in it .
It ’s not a goofy , Mad Magazine - type story .
I hope that it could almost stand as a short episode of Firefly .
I would hope .
I do n’t know if it ’s up to the standards of Joss and his writers .
That ’s up to the readers to decide .
Was it difficult channeling Joss ’ voice ?
No .
You know what ’s really cool about Joss ?
Yeah , he does have a voice , but what I ’ve noticed is , if you watch Buffy and then Angel and Firefly and Dollhouse , he is maturing as a writer .
He listens .
He really does want to listen to other people and learn different kinds of voices .
The “ Joss Whedon voice ” is to have a very open and nonjudgmental ear .
That , to me , would be the Joss Whedon voice .
Will we see any characters from the show in the comic ?
I ’m not going to say .
Did you cross paths with Alan on Dollhouse ?
We did cross paths on Dollhouse .
He ’s a genuinely , really funny guy .
A lot of actors , you see them on the show and they ’re really funny because they have a funny or witty script .
But then just hanging out with him , he ’s a really genuinely , witty guy .
What you realize is that ’s why he gets those roles .
He knows what wit sounds like .
He knows how it rolls off the tongue .
The thing about the character of Wash that I thought Alan brought to it is he has Kaylee ’s almost pathological [ optimism ] , but it is laced with some cynicism .
It almost feels like he puts the positive outlook over panic , which I really like .
Do you remember what your reaction was when Wash died in the film Serenity ?
I know that Joss kills off a lot of your favorite characters because that ’s how life goes .
But I was just like , “ Really ? ”
The kind of sunniest person …
Just , “ Really ? ”
That was almost crossing the line for me .
That really sucked , but then I said , “ Thank God .
It could have been Kaylee , ” which would have been inexcusable .
[ Laughs ]
I remember I gasped and then I went , “ Of course . ”
Yes !
That ’s exactly what I did !
I was like , “ Oh , wait a minute .
It is Joss . ”
That was my reaction when I saw Dr. Horrible ’s Sing - Along Blog too .
I should have known .
Of course .
Although that was , I felt , way more justified because this is about a supervillain finally committing to what being a supervillain is .
What he comes to realize , which I thought was so genius , is the reason supervillains are supervillains is because they had a hand in destroying their own hope .
If you look at the origin of any supervillain , that ’s where they come from .
It ’s their fault .
They drive themselves to the point where they go , “ There ’s no rhyme or reason .
It does n’t f—ing matter .
I ’m going to destroy everything now . ”
Which is a horrible place to find yourself in .
That last , single line where he says , “ Me . ” You ’re like , “ Yep .
Take a bow , asshole .
You ’re a supervillain now . ”
That was brilliant .
Are you going to write more Firefly comics in the future ?
I hope so .
I ’ve pitched a few more comics to Dark Horse that I want to do .
We ’ll see .
I ’m so busy doing this play right now in New York and then I ’m writing a book for Scribner .
If a good story suggests itself to me the way that it did with Firefly where I ’m like , “ Oh , I ’ve got to tell that ! , ” then yes , I ’ll totally do that .
NEW YORK -- New York environmental regulators have denied a key water - quality certification Entergy Corp. needs to extend by 20 years its license to operate the 2,000 - megawatt Indian Point nuclear - power plant .
The New York Department of Environmental Conservation said in a letter to Entergy dated April 2 that the two units of the plant " do not and will not comply with existing New York State water quality standards , " even with the addition of a new screening technology favored by Entergy to protect aquatic life .

HELSINKI — President Obama learns with interest that Europe now has a phone number .
He ’s told that , responding at last to Henry Kissinger ’s famous jibe , the European Union has appointed a President named Herman Van Rompuy from Belgium and given him a 24/7 phone line .
So , Obama decides to try out Europe ’s phone number .
Henry will be tickled .
But the president forgets about the time difference and gets an answering machine :
“ Good Evening , you ’ve reached the European Union , Herman Van Rompuy speaking .
We are closed for tonight .
Please select from the following options .
Press one for the French view , two for the German view , three for the British view , four for the Polish view , five for the Italian view , six for the Romanian view . ... ”
Obama hangs up in dismay .
This self - deprecating little story was told by the Finnish foreign minister , Alexander Stubb , during a meeting here last week on NATO ’s future .
NATO , which is to define a new doctrine this year , wants to work more closely with the E.U. , but of course it would help if Europe first defined what its strategic priorities are .
The Obama presidency has been a shock to Europe .
At heart , Obama is not a Westerner , not an Atlanticist .
He grew up partly in Indonesia and partly in Hawaii , which is about as far from the East Coast as you can get in the United States .
“ He ’s very much a member of the post - Western world , ” said Constanze Stelzenmüller of the German Marshall Fund .
WikiLeaks has just published video of US Military killing 12 individuals in Iraq , two of whom were later revealed to be staff members of the Reuters news organization .
Wikileaks has previously been labeled a “ muckraking ” website by some in the press , and indeed the graphic video is presented by the site as an “ indiscriminate ” killing , when it clearly appears to be a grave and horrible mistake — there was a clear military procedure followed .
Warning , the following video is graphic in nature .
In the past few weeks , the Pentagon has been waging battle on a whole new front : classified information that ends up on the Internet .
A primary target this brave new war is a website called WikiLeaks is a website that , according to the NY Times , is viewed as a real threat to national security , according to the Pentagon .
Now we have a much clearer understanding of why WikiLeaks is considered a threat .
In the following video , US Military in an Apache helicopter gravely mistake a group of Iraqi men for insurgents ( what appears to be a camera is viewed by those in the helicopter to be a RPG . )
Warning , the video below is graphic in nature .
The video is presented thusly :
WikiLeaks has released a classified US military video depicting the indiscriminate slaying of over a dozen people in the Iraqi suburb of New Baghdad — including two Reuters news staff .
Reuters has been trying to obtain the video through the Freedom of Information Act , without success since the time of the attack .
The video , shot from an Apache helicopter gun-site , clearly shows the unprovoked slaying of a wounded Reuters employee and his rescuers .
Two young children involved in the rescue were also seriously wounded .
While in some respects , WikiLeaks should be lauded for getting information out , the way that this is presented goes beyond responsible .
“ Indiscriminate ” implies hit - or - miss or thoughtless .
But this video clearly demonstrates that not to be the case .
The military personnel recorded on the tape audibly mistook the camera for an RPG , a weapon that can , and has , taken down Apache Helicopters .
While this is a horribly sad and terrible instance of the horrors of war , the military personnel were clearly fearing for their own lives .
Not to diminish the tragedy , but to present it as indiscriminate reveals a larger agenda that belittles everyone involved .
It is easy to explain why things worked out or did n’t go according to plan in hindsight .
But the brave men and women put their lives on the line , and often do n’t have the time to consider every possible angle .
Put another way , what if that were an RPG and they took more time to consider the options – they could have very likely ended up dead .
War is hell , and to pretend that this sort of thing does n’t happen more often , or to claim that the actions took were indiscriminate , is an affront to every member of the US Military .

The Sun has reported that four year - old Riley Brown of West Sussex found a little something extra in the used copy of Fight Night Round 4 his father bought from him from a local Blockbuster Video : A tiny bag of cannibis tucked behind the instruction manual .
Has outrage ensued ?
That was a rhetorical question .
What 's so funny to me about this story is the reaction of the father when the boy brought him the baggie : " I checked and realised .
I was horrified and took it off him straight away .
But what if he'd thought it was sweets , and started munching away ?
It does n't bear thinking about , " said the boy 's dad .
Really ?
Okay , I might not know a ton about kids , but I do know something about the smell of marijuana .
I think the odds of a child putting that in their mouth thinking it was a tasty snack are pretty low .
I 'd be more concerned about encouraging a child that age to mercilessly pummel someone with their fists , but I 'm not a boxing fan .
That said , I 'd just like to express how deeply , deeply disappointed I am in the employees at that Blockbuster Video .
There 's absolutely no excuse for that product to have made it's way out to the sales floor with the marijuana still in the box .
Where I come from , that stuff would have disappeared instantly , right into the pocket of a cheerful staffer .
Boy of 4 in Xbox game drugs find [ The Sun ]
In a bold predawn attack , gunmen stormed a hotel Wednesday in the heart of the northern city of Monterrey and kidnapped at least three people , officials said .
Mexican media said up to 50 hooded gunmen arrived in a convoy and burst into the downtown Holiday Inn , seizing guests and employees .
Law enforcement officials , offering only scant details by late afternoon , said it was not immediately clear whether a fourth person was seized or how many gunmen took part in the 3 a.m. attack .
Authorities offered no motive for the kidnappings , but the attack bore the hallmarks of Mexico ’s drug gang violence .
Monterrey ’s mayor , Fernando Larrazabal , said police had trouble reaching the scene because the attackers commandeered cars and used them to block surrounding streets .
Larrazabal told a radio interviewer that the kidnappers had disappeared in less than 20 minutes .
Authorities dismissed news reports that the kidnappers had seized another person from a hotel across the street .
Initial news accounts here said seven people had been kidnapped .
Violence related to drug gangs has spiked in recent months in northeastern Mexico , including around Monterrey , a business hub that is Mexico ’s third - largest metropolitan area .
Hit men have slain police officers and members of rival groups .
A shootout in Monterrey between gunmen and Mexican soldiers last month killed two university students outside their school , Monterrey Tech .
Much of the recent mayhem across the state of Nuevo Leon , of which Monterrey is the capital , and the nearby state of Tamaulipas stems from fighting between the Gulf cartel and former allies , known as the Zetas .
That feud has drawn in other trafficking groups , spreading chaos along the U.S. border near the Gulf of Mexico .
The Holiday Inn , with 390 rooms , sits in a downtown zone with numerous high - rise hotels .
The website of the daily Reforma newspaper quoted an unidentified witness as saying the hotel erupted in shouts and the sound of people being beaten .
It said gunmen fired when a captive tried to escape , but that it was not clear if the person was hit .
A security guard was reportedly pistol - whipped .
Calls to the hotel were not answered .

Sen .
John McCain endorsed a tough Arizona anti-immigration bill Monday , despite his history of support for comprehensive immigration reform .
McCain tacks right on immigration
Sen .
John McCain praised a tough Arizona anti-immigration bill that will let police arrest people who are n’t carrying identification , the latest move in McCain ’s rightward shift in advance of a tough Republican Senate primary this summer .
“ I think it ’s a very important step forward , ” McCain said Monday .
“ I can fully understand why the legislature would want to act . ”

It ’s a dramatic switch for a senator who supported comprehensive immigration reform with Democratic lion Sen .
Ted Kennedy ( D - Mass . ) just four years ago .
McCain is facing a primary challenge from the right in former Rep. J.D. Hayworth .
His office later said his comments did not represent an endorsement , though a spokeswoman would not condemn the bill , either .
Immigration reform advocates were bewildered .
“ He risked his political career for immigration reform , and now he is compromising his principles to fight for his political life , ” said Frank Sharry , executive director of America ’s Voice and a longtime immigration reform advocate .
Under the Arizona law , which passed the state Senate today and sent to Gov. Jan Brewer ( R ) , police can arrest anyone on “ reasonable suspicion ” that they are an illegal immigrant .
If they ’re not carrying a valid driver ’s license or identity papers , police can arrest them .
Hayworth called McCain ’s Monday comments “ political gamesmanship …born of political convenience - driven by his need for personal political gain . ”
Under current law , illegal immigration is a federal crime , and state law enforcement officials can only ask about it if a person is suspected of another crime .
Backers say the package of tough new rules will give police and other law enforcement the tools they need to combat increasingly violent immigration violations .
Opponents say the law essentially legalizes racial profiling .
“ If you look brown , you ’re going to get asked for papers , ” Sherry said .
If Brewer signs the bill , he said , “ she ’ll go down George Wallace of our generation . ”
The bill passed the state ’s House on a largely party - line vote last week , and is set for a vote in the Arizona Senate Monday .
McCain ’s comments to reporters came as he and fellow Republican Arizona Sen .
Jon Kyl unveiled a 10 step plan to secure Arizona ’s border with Mexico .
McCain and Kyl want to send 3,000 National Guard troops to help an overstretched border patrol curtail increasingly violent incidents along the border , among other measures .
McCain said the plan did not need to move in tandem with a potential federal immigration reform bill .
“ The lesson is clear : First we have to secure the border , ” McCain said .
" If you want to enact some other reforms , how can that be effective when you have a porous border ? "
" So we have to secure the border first , " he said .
McCain asked the federal government for more National Guard troops last year , but the request was not granted .
The National Guard has been deployed to protect the border before , Kyl said , but troops were moved out as the war in Iraq escalated and their capabilities were needed elsewhere .
Sens. Charles Schumer ( D - N.Y. ) and Lindsey Graham ( R - S.C. ) are writing a bipartisan immigration bill the administration says it wants to push through Congress this year .
Lawmakers have been meeting with business and labor interests to try and hash out an agreement .
Schumer argued Monday that his proposal is actually more stringent than Arizona’s .
“ We believe our blueprint is even stronger than the Arizona senators ’ proposal in stopping the flow of illegal immigrants because our plan both increases border security and prevents employers from hiring illegal immigrants , ” Schumer said in a statement Monday .
“ The only way to combat illegal immigration is through comprehensive reform because that is the only solution that can get through both the House and the Senate .
We would certainly be open to negotiating a comprehensive bill that requires completion of border security measures before any other measures take effect . ”
McCain was a key author of immigration reform during President George W. Bush ’s second term , and has previously championed many of the border security measures included in the package he unveiled Monday .
But with the Senate still bitterly divided in the wake of health reform and heading toward a broad array of other major legislation , there is little appetite for an issue as divisive as immigration .
“ There ’s still a shot , and I ’ll leave it at that , ” Sherry said .
I discussed the ‘ no statistically significant warming since 1995 ’ talking point in this post .
For those who came in late , this talking point has been around the delusionist blogosphere for some time , though with a lower profile than ‘ global warming stopped in 1998 ’ , and was put as question to Phil Jones of UEA in a BBC interview .
Jones answered honestly , if a bit clumsily , that the data period since 1995 is marginally too short to derive a statistically significant trend , a response which was headlined by the Daily Mail as “ Climategate U - turn as scientist at centre of row admits :
There has been no global warming since 1995 ? ” and became the talking point of the day .
As has been widely noted , confusing not statistically significant ’ with ‘ not significant ; in the ordinary sense indicates either deliberate dishonesty or ignorance of a point covered in excruciating detail in every introductory stats course .
But where did this silliness come from ?
I ’d seen Janet Albrechtsen quote Lord Monckton on the point , and it seemed about right for him , an innumerate debating point that would take a fair while to refute , during which time he could move on to the next one .
Imagine my surprise , then , when I discovered the point being made ( and apparently originated ) by Richard Lindzen of MIT who is ( or ought to be ) by far the most credible figure on the delusionist side .
In a piece published on “ Watts Up With That ” Lindzen says ‘ There has been no warming since 1997 and no statistically significant warming since 1995 ’ and in this piece for Quadrant he gives a variation , saying “ has been no statistically significant net global warming for the last fourteen years ” and “ the fact that warming has ceased for the past fourteen years is acknowledged ” .
Note the slide from “ has been no statistically significant net global warming for the last fourteen years ” to “ warming has ceased ” , committing the basic newbie error against which all budding stats students are warned .
Lindzen has published a couple of hundred papers in climatology , so I think we can assume he knows that the statement “ there has been no statistically significant warming since 1995 ” means nothing more than “ given the variability in the data , we need at least 15 observations to reject the null hypothesis at 95 per cent confidence ” , a fact so trite as not to be worth mentioning .
It is sad to see a respected scientist reduced to this kind of thing .
And as far as I can tell , all this is simply to avoid admitting that he backed the wrong horse back in 1990 , when he bet that he was smarter than the majority of climate scientists who thought humans were ( probably ) causing global warming .
The data since then has supported the majority view , but instead of revising his position , Lindzen has resorted to dishonest statistical trickery .
To quote The Economist , with respect to the Daily Mail
Since I ’ve advocated a more explicit use of the word “ lie ” , I ’ll go ahead and follow my own advice : that Daily Mail headline is a lie .
But at least the Daily Mail headline writer could plead ignorance .
Lindzen has no such excuse .

There is a sort of practical irreverence about Tough Mudder , the race and the company , which sublets half of an office nearly under the Manhattan Bridge in Brooklyn ’s Dumbo neighborhood .
Tough Mudder exudes a mix of Gen -Y cool and Harvard - style rootedness , infused with British sensibility and humor .
When Dean looked for a business partner last fall ( his Harvard contest teammates scattered to other postgraduate opportunities ) , he contacted Guy Livingstone , a friend from boarding school .
“ We knew each other when our voices broke , ” Dean said .
Dean worked for several years for Britain ’s Foreign and Commonwealth Office , akin to the State Department in the United States , bouncing around the world in its counterterrorism policy department .
Hoping to hone his entrepreneurial spirit — he previously ran a T - shirt operation and a Bollywood poster business —
Dean left in 2007 to pursue his M.B.A. at Harvard .
He earned it last spring .
Livingstone , meanwhile , felt he was shortchanging his life as a corporate lawyer in London and wanted to stretch his comfort zone .
He was learning Arabic in Damascus , Syria , when Dean called .
He crossed the ocean to be Tough Mudder ’s chief operating officer .
Dean and Livingstone , both 29 , seem bent on running a serious business aimed at testing athletes who do not take themselves too seriously .
Participants will recite a prerace promise to help others and not whine .
On - site artists will ink free Tough Mudder tattoos .
Dogfish Head Brewery will provide free beer for a postrace party .
Finishers will receive an orange headband , like something seen on a 1970s - era basketball player , that they will be encouraged to wear as a badge of honor .
“ But not at work , ” Dean said in his usual deadpan .
“ That ’s showing off . ”
Dean and Livingstone spent last Thanksgiving weekend touring potential sites , mainly ski resorts and racetracks , within two hours of New York .
TORONTO – Toronto FC ’s win over Montreal Impact at BMO Field Wednesday night came at a cost .
Ty Harden and Nick Garcia both left the match in the first half due to injury .
Harden was injured in a scramble for Toronto FC ’s first goal scored by Dwayne De Rosario .
He was taken to hospital to get stitches for a gashed leg .
Coach Preki told the media after the match that he expects that Harden could be out of action for a while .
Harden returned to BMO
Field following the end of the match having received 22 stitches .
Nick Garcia was hurt in an incident that saw Impact striker Roberto Brown sent off for violent conduct .
The veteran defender appeared to take a blow to the head and will be assessed further on Thursday .
According to Einstein's theory of general relativity , a moving mass should create another field , called gravitomagnetic field , besides its static gravitational field .
This field has now been measured for the first time and to the scientists ' astonishment , it proved to be no less than one hundred million trillion times larger than Einstein 's General Relativity predicts .
This gravitomagnetic field is similar to the magnetic field produced by a moving electric charge ( hence the name " gravitomagnetic " analogous to " electromagnetic " ) .
For example , the electric charges moving in a coil produce a magnetic field - such a coil behaves like a magnet .
Similarly , the gravitomagnetic field can be produced to be a mass moving in a circle .
What the electric charge is for electromagnetism , mass is for gravitation theory ( the general theory of relativity ) .
A spinning top weights more than the same top standing still .
However , according to Einstein 's theory , the difference is negligible .
It should be so small that we should n't even be capable of measuring it .
But now scientists from the European Space Agancy , Martin Tajmar , Clovis de Matos and their colleagues , have actually measured it .
At first they could n't believe the result .
" We ran more than 250 experiments , improved the facility over 3 years and discussed the validity of the results for 8 months before making this announcement .
Now we are confident about the measurement , " says Tajmar .
They hope other physicists will now conduct their own versions of the experiment so they could be absolutely certain that they have really measured the gravitomagnetic field and not something else .
This may be the first empiric clue for how to merge together quantum mechanics and general theory of relativity in a single unified theory .
" If confirmed , this would be a major breakthrough , " says Tajmar , " it opens up a new means of investigating general relativity and its consequences in the quantum world . "
The experiment involved a ring of superconducting material rotating up to 6 500 times a minute .
According to quantum theory , spinning superconductors should produce a weak magnetic field .
The problem was that Tajmar and de Matos experiments with spinning superconductors did n't seem to fit the theory - although in all other aspects the quantum theory gives incredibly accurate predictions .
Tajmar and de Matos then had the idea that maybe the quantum theory was n't wrong after all but that there was some additional effect overlapping over their experiments , some effect they neglected .
What could this other effect be ?
They thought maybe it's the gravitomagnetic field - the fact that the spinning top exerts a higher gravitational force .
So , they placed around the spinning superconductor a series of very sensible acceleration sensors for measuring whether this effect really existed .
They obtained more than they bargained for !
Although the acceleration produced by the spinning superconductor was 100 millionths of the acceleration due to the Earth 's gravitational field , it is a surprising one hundred million trillion times larger than Einstein 's General Relativity predicts .
Thus , the spinning top generated a much more powerful gravitomagnetic field than expected .
Now , it remains the need for a proper theory .
Scientists can also now check whether candidate theories , such as the string theory , can describe this experiment correctly .
Moreover , this experiment shows that gravitational waves should be much more easily to detect than previously thought .

( CNN ) --
The massive earthquake that struck Chile on Saturday may have shifted Earth 's axis and created shorter days , scientists at NASA say .
The change is negligible , but permanent : Each day should be 1.26 microseconds shorter , according to preliminary calculations .
A microsecond is one - millionth of a second .
A large quake shifts massive amounts of rock and alters the distribution of mass on the planet .
When that distribution changes , it changes the rate at which the planet rotates .
And the rotation rate determines the length of a day .
" Any worldly event that involves the movement of mass affects the Earth 's rotation , " Benjamin Fong Chao , of NASA 's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt , Maryland , said while explaining the phenomenon in 2005 .
Scientists use the analogy of a skater .
When he pulls in his arms , he spins faster .
That 's because pulling in his arms changes the distribution of the skater 's mass and therefore the speed of his rotation .
Richard Gross , a geophysicist at NASA 's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena , California , used a computer model to determine how the magnitude 8.8 quake that struck Chile on February 27 may have affected Earth .
See scenes of devastation from the quake
He determined that the quake should have moved Earth 's figure axis about 3 inches ( 8 centimeters ) .
The figure axis is one around which Earth 's mass is balanced .
That shift in axis is what may have shortened days .
Such changes are n't unheard of .
The magnitude 9.1 earthquake in 2004 that generated a killer tsunami in the Indian Ocean shortened the length of days by 6.8 microseconds .
On the other hand , the length of a day also can increase .
For example , if the Three Gorges reservoir in China were filled , it would hold 10 trillion gallons ( 40 cubic kilometers ) of water .
The shift of mass would lengthen days by 0.06 microsecond , scientists said .
Here are two versions of the same story .
The way the authorities tell it , London 's " cycle revolution " is set to intensify thanks to the brilliant innovations of its mayor , Boris Johnson .
May 's completion of two of his promised dozen " cycle superhighways " linking the capital 's suburbs with its core will be followed by the summer launch of his central London bike hire scheme .
Mindful that apprehension deters many potential converts to pedal - power , he has just produced a cycle safety plan that firmly asserts that " Cycling levels in London have increased sharply in recent years while the rate of casualties has declined , " and that Johnson wants these parallel trends maintained .
But some of London 's two - wheel travellers relate the tale differently .
One has made a video of riding a stretch of one of the superhighways - in - progress and is n't impressed .
It seems to amount to a long , narrow strip of Smurf - blue where there were previously shorter narrow strips of green .
I posted the clip here and high - grade comments ensued .
All were critical , not least because the lanes are n't wider or more protected against incursions by motor vehicles .
" I 've yet to hear a single experienced cyclist say anything good about the ' superhighways " wrote JimG , who linked to this critique of Transport for London 's plans .
Its author , Dave Hembrow , was born in the UK but lives in the Netherlands .
He says they do city cycling much better there .
And then there are the deaths .
There were 13 in London last year and 15 in 2008 .
One took place near Guy 's hospital on Tuesday , coinciding with the cycle safety plan 's appearance .
Another happened in Hackney the following day .
Both followed collisions with tipper trucks .
Lethal contact with large commercial vehicles is cyclists ' greatest safety fear , one Boris Johnson surely shares given his " near - death experience " in Limehouse .
The safety plan points out that a " significant growth " in the number of cycle journeys between 2003 and 2008 was accompanied by a relatively small increase in the number of cycling casualties of all kinds , but also acknowledges that collisions involving cyclists are " still one of the most serious challenges to road safety in the capital " .
Recorded injuries ranging from fatal to slight totalled 3,409 last year .
Anxiety about safety is a major obstacle to maximising cycling in London .
Around half a million journeys are made on a bike each day , double the number in 2000 .
Yet this is a fraction of the number made by car , and Boris has argued that many of those could be cycle ones instead : a daily 2.4 million in the 12 Outer London boroughs alone – around half .
His safety plan lists training courses , better information and education , improved vehicle technology and stronger action against irresponsible road - users as aspirations .
His goal is for the present number of cycling journeys to have quadrupled by 2026 .
He 's obviously working on it , not least by setting a conspicuous example .
The London Cycling Campaign seems broadly behind him .
But should he be doing more ?
As a bus addict I 'm unlikely to ever switch to two wheels in a big way , but until London 's roads feel far less hostile to cyclists I remain reluctant to even sample joining their ranks .
When commenters at my blog – enjoy their insights here and here – advocate doubling the width of cycle lanes , bold adjustments to road rules , markings and architecture or doing far more to highlight safe routes , it strikes a chord .
I start imagining a future in which cars and trucks are minority road transport modes and buses and bicycles dominate .
To reach it , though , would require the political will and skill to persuade voters to support bolder measures .
The present mayor , mindful that motorists regard him as their friend , seems prepared to go only so far .
Until a successor goes much further , the term " cycle revolution " will sound more like hype than reality to me .

Smashing Magazine Freebies
http://www.smashingmagazine.com/tag/freebies/
Smashing Magazine ( other than being a pretty good design blog ) regularly publishes high quality freebies , in the form of icon packs , images and themes ( e.g. for Wordpress ) .
They are generally to give exposure to a given designer and made available for any sort of commercial or non-commercial endeavor .
In particular the " Flavour " icon pack is very nice , but I 'd highly recommend mining their archives as they have some very good " domain specific " icon and vector packs .
$ 99 Designs , $ 99 Logo Store
http://99designs.com/logo-design/store
Of all the graphic resources in your app , your logo is probably the most important .
It 's your branding , your ID and the way you build association with your users .
If you 're designing on a budget , or building something as an experiment , then $ 99 is not much to spend on a high - quality and professional logo for your site .
Having bought two logos from the site and having them customized to my request within the day , I 'd say this is a great one - stop shop for getting something in place that will serve you well until you really need to spend more on it .

Both Mr Ahmadinejad ( left ) and Mr Mugabe ( right ) are under Western sanctions
President Robert Mugabe has backed Iran 's " just cause " on seeking nuclear power , as President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad continues his Zimbabwe visit .
Zimbabwe 's leader said both countries had been " unjustly vilified and punished by Western countries " .
Iran is subject to a range of UN diplomatic and trade sanctions , although it insists its nuclear project is for energy , not to build a weapon .
Mr Ahmadinejad has opened a trade fair in Zimbabwe 's second city , Bulawayo .
The only sin ... we have committed is the cancelling of the concessions that the West had in our country
President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad Iran 's leader also castigated Western nations , saying : " They want to seize the markets of the countries [ Iran and Zimbabwe ] and destroy their economies , " reports the AFP news agency .
The visit has exposed the deep divisions in Zimbabwe 's power - sharing government .
The Movement for Democratic Change of Prime Minister Morgan Tsvangirai has condemned the visit and did not send anyone to welcome Mr Ahmadinejad at Harare 's airport on Thursday .
It said inviting him to open a trade fair was like " inviting a mosquito to cure malaria " .
Uranium deposits
The leader of oil - rich Iran is due to travel to Uganda later on Friday .
Oil has recently been discovered in Uganda , which currently holds a seat on the UN Security Council .
DIFFERENT SANCTIONS IRAN - General sanctions
Block on import / export of " sensitive nuclear material and equipment "
Ban on supply / sale of equipment / technology aiding nuclear programme Arms - export ban Assets freeze and travel restrictions on people involved in nuclear programme ZIMBABWE - Targeted sanctions EU : Assets freeze and travel ban on some Mugabe allies , arms - sale ban US : Trade ban on 250 Zimbabwean individuals and 17 companies Other countries : Canada , Australia and UK among nations to have imposed their own targeted sanctions Sources : EU , Reuters , US treasury , UK Foreign Office
UN sanctions against Iran
At a state dinner in honour of Iran 's leader in Harare , Mr Ahmadinejad said : " The only sin ... we have committed is the cancelling of the concessions that the West had in our country .
" The United Nations ' organ of the Security Council is being used to serve the powerful countries to put pressure on the smaller countries like Iran and Zimbabwe . "
Zimbabwe is believed to have uranium deposits in the north of the country , but as yet no exploration contracts have been awarded and the size of the deposits are unknown , according to the Reuters news agency .
Foreign Affairs Minister Simbarashe Mumbengegwi , an ally of President Mugabe , said Zimbabwe would benefit from the Iranian leader 's visit by signing several trade and co-operation agreements .
Mr Mugabe and some of his closest allies are subject to targeted sanctions by several Western nations .
These include a travel ban and an assets freeze but not trade measures .
The MDC has expressed concern that the trip could affect attempts to improve relations with the West .
Mr Tsvangirai was due to visit Europe for talks this week on getting the sanctions lifted but his trip was delayed by the volcanic ash flight ban .
The MDC joined a power - sharing government in 2009 in an attempt to revive the ruined economy .
Mr Mugabe previously tried to portray the MDC as a stooge of the former colonial power , the UK .
He has criticised it recently for failing to get the sanctions on him lifted .
They were imposed after the US and the EU accused Mr Mugabe of rigging elections .
He says they were really a punishment for his policy of seizing land from white farmers .

* Big hedge funds taking positions against euro- WSJ
* SAC , Soros , others attend private dinner in NY - WSJ
* Some managers say euro may hit parity with dollar - WSJ
* Traders also make bearish bets on euro- WSJ
NEW YORK , Feb 25 ( Reuters ) - Some major hedge funds are making substantial bets against the euro as Greece ’s debt crisis rages , the Wall Street Journal reported on Thursday .
Representatives of SAC Capital Advisors LP , Soros Fund Management LLC and others attended a private dinner in New York on Feb 8 at which a small group of hedge fund managers argued that the euro EUR= would likely fall to parity with the U.S. dollar , the newspaper said , citing people close to the situation .
The “ idea dinner ” was hosted by boutique research and brokerage firm Monness , Crespi , Hardt & Co .
Three portfolio managers at the dinner spoke about investments related to the European debt crisis , the Journal said .
The euro has lost over 10 percent since late November as fiscal woes in Greece intensified , leading to a huge sell - off by investors .
SAC manager Aaron Cowen said all possible outcomes from the Greek debt crisis would drive down the value of the euro further , according to the newspaper report .
But it added that SAC ’s trading position on the euro was unclear .
Brigade Capital hedge fund head Donald Morgan said the Greek crisis will likely spread and eventually affect U.S. companies , municipalities and Treasury securities .
David Einhorn , president of Greenlight Capital Inc , told the dinner he was bullish on gold because a pick - up in inflation was likely , according to the report .
An unidentified Soros manager said interest rates would likely increase , the Journal said .
Einhorn , George Soros of Soros Fund Management , SAC Capital Advisors , Monness , Crespi , Hardt & Co , and Brigade Capital were not immediately contactable for comment on the article .
Last week traders at Goldman Sachs & Co GS.N , Bank of America Corp 's BAC.N Merrill Lynch unit and Barclays Plc BARC.L placed bearish bets on the euro on behalf of investors in a move separate from the hedge fund dinner , the Journal reported , citing traders .
The euro hit a one - year low against the yen EURJPY=R on Thursday and lost 0.4 percent against the dollar at $ 1.3485 concerns over a potential downgrade of Greece 's debt , while borrowing costs for peripheral euro zone countries rose .
Safe - haven government bonds firmed .
Credit agency Standard & Poor ’s said on Wednesday it may downgrade Greece ’s BBB - plus rating by one or two notches within a month , citing downside risks to growth that could hinder the country ’s deficit - cutting plan .
Moody ’s Investors Service said Athens would need to enact its fiscal reform plans as promised if it was to avoid a downgrade and Fitch Ratings said that , barring surprises , it expected to keep its BBB - plus rating unchanged for the next few months .

The retail games industry is no different than any other business battleground .
Life in the ( mostly ) free - market economy is many times a matter of survival of the richest .
When the Gamestops and big chain sellers of the world have enough clout to shape the opinions of the consumer , many people stop looking for alternatives , if they 're even aware they exist .
Being a gigantic fan of the underdog in most scenarios and entrenched in my hometown's ( Austin ) mentality of supporting originality , the local economy , and independent ownership , I was happy to find recently that my city plays host to one of the exceptions to the casualty statistics .
Searching online for a place to find older games and systems locally , I stumbled across the Web site for Game Over entirely by accident .
When I discovered that they were independently owned and had survived for five years , I raised an eyebrow in curiosity .
When I found out that they had expanded from one location to three over that time while Game Crazy had lost four locations in that same period , I raised the other eyebrow in surprise .
And when I walked into their main location recently and saw that their store contained games and systems from every generation , hosted retro game tournaments and events , and has a videogame museum in the back complete with a Power Glove signed by Fred Savage ... let 's just say that something else raised of its own accord .
I was immediately possessed with questions .
In a world that crushes the little guy , I just had to know exactly how this local retail rebellion was not only surviving but thriving in a cutthroat market during the worst economic downturn in recent history .
I was lucky enough to convince the owner of Game Over , David Kaelin , to take some time away from fighting the good fight to sit down with me and shed some light on exactly what the secret of his success is .
A transcription of excerpts from that interview follows below !
David Kaelin in the videogame museum , rightfully proud of his signed Power Glove and copy of The Wizard .
SC : David , I really appreciate you taking time to talk to me about your business , and let the folks who are reading know more about what you 're doing and why you do it .
DK : Thanks !
We appreciate any exposure we can get .
Running this kind of business is an uphill battle for any industry , any person .
And we certainly appreciate that , and strive to overcome all those hurdles .
And so far , we 've been here five years , so we 're doing pretty well .
SC : So , I 'd like to start by springboarding off of what you said .
You mentioned hurdles .
What are the hurdles that have gotten in the way of you growing your business ?
DK : I think more in general , just starting a business is really hard .
You know , people are trained to go to the GameStops and Walmarts and a lot of times they think that 's the only option .
So , even if you do n't find the old games you wanted at GameStop , you still go there first because that 's pretty much the only game store there is .
And , people need to take the time to research and find those little out of the way places in whatever town they live in .
They 're still out there ; there still are some independent stores out there , and they need the support more than GameStop does .
In this area , our stores have done really well because we not only have gone the independent route , obviously , but we specifically target everything GameStop does n't have .
You know , everything people hates about Gamestop , we do the opposite .
We have tournaments on classic games .
We have fun events , like concerts .
We have a videogame museum in this store .
We carry every single type of game and console ever made .
You can sell every single game and console ever made here for cash or store credit .
So , anything you 're looking for , it 's worth checking in this store .
At a GameStop , if you 're looking for something that 's like an older title or more rare title , odds are , you 're not gonna really find it there .
And then t-shirts and keychains and all the collectible things that we sell -- the imported type items -- we have videogame sound tracks and DVDs .
Just anything cool about videogames , we try to take part in that .
We 're just more about the culture and the fans of videogames than the people who just want to buy Madden 2010 .
I purchased the green Atari shirt from the bottom center , because I 'm old .

SC : Fair enough !
So , you began in 2005 with one location , and now you 've spread out to three locations .
You 've been able to capture those things that GameStop has n't done .
Is that a unique thing to Austin , this kind of retrolust ?
Or do you think this kind of business model would be transferable to another city , another place ?
DK : I think it 's definitely transferable .
I think every city out there needs , and can benefit from somebody selling retro games .
I think there are places out there .
The problem that a lot of people run into is , those places are pawn shops , or those places are independent game stores that are not run well , that are not merchandised well .
Maybe they have some old games , but they do n't run it like a business .
They run it like a hobby shop , like , it 's just an independent owner , and the same guy's in the store every time you go in , and it 's just his little collection of games .
Sometimes you get a deal , sometimes you do n't , but normally the shopping experience and the selection is not worth the trouble of finding that independent store and going in there .
We try to run ours like a GameStop in just one sense -- we run it like a chain .
Each store has the personnel , the customer service ; everything is always alphabetized , priced clearly , and merchandised well .
We take pride in the fact that we 're an independent , and that we 're a small company , but when you come into our store , there 's nothing unprofessional about the way you 're treated or the way that the store looks , and the experience you have .
So , it 's not just some little shack of old games in a stack with no price tag , and you have to ask the guy " how much for this game ? " , " I do n't know , I 'll go check the book or check in the back and ask the manager " .
You know , everything 's clearly marked and we run it like a business .
SC : So you mentioned running it more professionally and more of a business as opposed to an enthusiast or hobby type shop .
With that in mind , how do you go about setting pricing in terms of what you take in ?
Are you basing that on what your competitors are doing , and using that as a model for trying to bring in additional business ?
Or , is there a ' Blue Book ' standard ?
What resources do you draw from to set that pricing ?
DK : Well , it 's a lot of different things .
We can't go into too much specific detail on that , obviously , but generally speaking we take trade - ins , so you can sell any game here .
You get a cash or store credit value -- store credit 's higher .
The difference between what you get for it when you trade it in vs. what we sell it for , there 's obviously a gap there that in some cases is significant .
But , it just has to be that way .
Our standard is , we try to be at or below our competitors for a similar item , which , when we carry everything , makes it kind of hard to use one standard .
For current gen games , we use kinda the GameStop model .
We try to pay a little more than they do for stuff , we sell it for at or below what they sell it for , so that way those customers that are into that generation of games -- there 's no disadvantage for shopping here .
You know , a lot of independent stores either by choice or by force end up selling new games for , say $ 5 more than everybody else , and then they wonder why their shop goes out of business .
New games are not extremely profitable .
So , if that 's all you 've got going in your store , that 's probably just not a good idea to be in business .
We have all the different systems and so , new games aside , looking at the older games , then you have to compare it against what people can get those games for .
Plushies - you break 'em , you buy 'em .
Harsh policy .
We also use eBay and Amazon as a kind of benchmark .
Say for example , an old PlayStation 1 game , you know , nobody else sells it anymore , so we can't price check a store in town .
But we 'll see what it 's going for on eBay or Amazon , including the shipping , and we 'll try and be at or below that .
So if it 's $ 40 on eBay , with $ 10 shipping , we might sell it for $ 50 .
It 's not more expensive than it'd be if you bought it online , but it 's not dirt cheap , necessarily .
We try and do a fair trade price and a fair sale price , you know , I feel , for everything we have [ smiling ] .
That being said , of course , nobody is really happy with the trade - in price .
SC : EVER .
DK : Whether you 're at GameStop or with us at Game Over , or anywhere else in another town or a pawn shop or whatever , everybody has that mentality of " I paid $ 50 for it , I should get at least $ 49 back ! "
It 's like , no , because now we 're selling that game for $ 15 , so , we can't give you even $ 14 , we might only give you a couple of bucks for it .
Then after a while , your stock builds up , and there may be certain games that we may have 20 , 30 , 40 of -- systems too .
PlayStation 1s , N64s , some of that generation of systems we have ... tons .
When you have a couple hundred of something , your desire to pay a lot of money for the 203rd is , you know , not very high .
So , it 's based on competitive markets ; eBay and Amazon for the older stuff , GameStop for the newer stuff , and also based on , you know , how much we have .
It 's really the only fair way to do it .
SC : So , you mentioned eBay and Amazon .
Obviously that 's a large percentage of your competition for the used consoles and older games and systems .
I noticed that you 're offering a lot of your stuff online now .
How recent is that ?
How successful has that been for you , and what percentage of your business comes from the online store as opposed to the physical store ?
DK : Yeah , that 's a good question .
I mean , our competition is definitely more online than it is GameStop or anybody else because that 's what we do -- the classic stuff .
That being said , we have a Web site , but we have n't had a webstore before last December .
That 's when we first remodeled our Web site and got the webstore up .
We still have not really aggressively promoted that yet , because we 're still kind of tweaking the inventory on it .
We 're still adding pictures , so it 's not what I would call a finished product yet .
Right now , we 're a drop in the bucket next to eBay .
SC : What percentage of your business is serious collectors who are looking for specific items to complete a set as opposed to regular old retro enthusiasts who are looking to just experience the nostalgia of an older game or system ?
DK : I would say the majority is just the casual enthusiast , honestly .
We do have , maybe 20 % or less who are hardcore collectors .
Those , we refer to as " the people with lists " .
They come in and they have a list , and they like " I 'm looking for these 7 NES games . " and the implication is that they have the other 600 , 700 .
Depending on if they collect all the unlicensed ones or not , it could be 700 to 800 games , and yeah - there was someone in our Round Rock store last week , I was visiting up there , and while I was there a customer came in and they had literally 7 things on their list .
And they 're like " This is all I need for NES . " , and we had like 2 of them !
So that was nice .
Wall to wall games in this place .
Every system you can think of .
I was wise to not come on payday .
SC : You 've stated that getting the word out is one of the difficult parts of running a successful independent store -- is community building how you do that ?
Does most of your advertising consist of word of mouth ?
DK : Yeah , that 's probably the hardest thing for any small business .
Getting the word out that you exist ; what we do , this store , in fact , with the video game museum and the events that we put on are really exciting and people want to come participate in them .
Letting them know that we have them is the hard thing .
We do some print ads , we do some radio ads , we do TV commercials , but only on a small scale , because the expense is just astronomical .
Yeah , social media , internet , email , and word of mouth is how we really get the word out .
We just had a rash of donations that we 've done lately , for school fundraisers , things like that .
We have one going on this weekend with the Make - A - Wish Foundation .
That 's a way we can double up with giving back to the community in a charitable way -- I want us to be a friend of the community and reach out in that way , but obviously it also gets our word out about our stores and who we are .
Somebody may see the item up for auction at a fundraiser and say , " Oh , Game Over ?
What 's that ? " and go to the Web site and say " Oh , that looks pretty cool . " and then they come in the store and say " Oh , that 's REALLY cool ! " .
You stand before the portal to retro heaven .
What do you do ?
> OPEN DOOR
SC : You 've got a little bit of everything in here .
Is there one system or era that generates the highest volume of trade - ins or purchases ?
DK : Yeah , it 's really strange the way trade - ins work , and in this type of store , we can get everything from Virtual Boy games to Wii games in the same day .
Just a total mismash of items .
Our general bestsellers tend to be Nintendo and Super Nintendo .
Those tend to be the most collected , the most played by the retro gamers , and even the casual collectors and enthusiasts just want to play an old game of Smash Bros. or Mario Kart on N64 .
SC : Mario Kart .
Yeeeeeeeaaaah !!!
DK : [ laughing ]
But yeah , it 's amazing how much of it is just Nintendo and Super Nintendo cartridges , I mean , they truly created some classic games and system back then , in the 80's and 90's .
SC : Let 's get to some more fun stuff .
Out of all the stuff you have in here , what are your favorites ?
If you had to pick 3 , what are your 3 favorite systems to play on ?
DK : [ facepalming ]
I wish I had time to play !
That 's my own personal torture , being surrounded by games , working in a game store day in , day out .
From morning to night , all I do is video games , and there 's not enough time left to play them .
It 's the curse of my life .
SC : " Water , water , everywhere , but not a drop to drink . " ?
DK : That 's right , exactly .
It 's all salt water , kid !
But , I would actually classify myself in the casual collector category , where my personal collection and my desire to play runs the full range .
I do n't have , probably , more than 20 games for most systems outside of Atari , NES , and Super NES .
But , I like certain games on each system .
Probably my fondest memories and my best experiences with games happened on the Atari 2600 and the NES , because those are the 2 I had as a kid .
Mario Monopoly ?
I really hope one of the properties is Rainbow Railroad .
SC : How has the recession impacted your business ?
Has it hurt your business , or have you actually seen more people walk in the door because they 're looking for a gaming experience that they do n't have to invest as much money into ?
DK : I think both , actually .
We specialize in used games , and used games are cheaper than new , so there 's definitely a benefit to being in this business in a bad economy .
If you 're just buying for your kids and they just want something to mess around with and they do n't really care if it's the latest and greatest , you know you can get some older systems at a bargain .
In that way , I think it helps , but as successful as we are , I know we'd be even more successful if the economy was n't crappy .
We 're really looking forward to getting through this year , getting the economy back on its feet , and then we 're looking to expand and we 're looking to grow even more .
SC : What does that mean ?
More locations , more cities , all of the above ?
DK : Both !
I 'd love to say that we'd be everywhere in the country , but it 's definitely a slow process being an independent .
We at this point , are wholly owned , so we 're not doing franchising .
Franchising would grow us a lot faster , but then you can't control as much .
You do n't want everybody who has a little bit of money or a few games to open up a game store .
We 're looking to open at least a store a year for the next couple of years , and then we 've got our online store , and we 're looking to develop that into a destination type website to buy games .
It 's admittedly a very small selection right now , but we are adding to it all the time to bulk that up so that we 'll compete on both fronts .
As I said , being an anti-GameStop ... nothing against GameStop ... just the opposite of a GameStop .
I want to be really careful not to offend GameStop -- I love you GameStop !
They do help us out , you know .
I came from there , from that corporate culture of the games store on the EB side of it .
I have no ill will towards them , but we just do a different thing , we go for a different customer .
SC : You 've mentioned several times how you differentiate yourself from GameStop , and specifically about the experience you create in your store being one of the things that keeps building your customer base .
How do you drive the focus on customer service and ensure it 's better than your competitors ' ?
DK : I definitely think you 've got to preach to it and make it a priority in your business .
But I can't be in front of every customer , and I do n't have time or want to watch every interaction , so getting the best employees is very important .
All the employees first of all love games , and then they also love working at the stores , and I think that translates into how they treat the customers .
We all have a stake in seeing Game Over succeed , and so I trust them to treat customers the right way .
SC : How do you get the best employees , and why do the employees enjoy working here ?
DK : Well , on one end , we pay either at or above what GameStop pays their employees , and that means there 's a lot of competition for our openings , and at the other end we 're a much less ' corporate ' environment .
We still run it like it's a business , but it 's about the love for games and I think we 're more concerned with that then trying to drive profits up artificially .
That makes people feel good about working here , and that 's , you know , what drives them to treat the customers right because they believe in it and want it to succeed .
When a spot opens up here we get flooded with , like , 60 applications immediately .
Most of our people came to us from GameStop or Game Crazy originally , and their friends who still work there can't wait to jump over and be a part of what we 're doing .
That helps make a great experience for our customers when the employees feel fortunate to be there in our stores .
Is it just me , or does the DK on the left have a different expression ?
OMG , they 're becoming sentient !
SC : Is there anything else you 'd like to share , or get out there , or wish people knew about what you 're doing right now ?
DK : Just being aware of us .
If you 're reading about this and you 're in the Austin area , I think you 'll find a better selection , better service , and better prices here than any other used game store .
For the rest of the country , we 're getting our website going , and if you live in a place where there 's just no other option you can try and seek it out .
Check out pawn shops , check out eBay ; if you have an independent store there you should at least give them a try .
If they do n't do a good job , or do n't have good selection or service or whatever then you do n't have to go there again .
But those independent game stores who are doing it right really need your support , or else they 're not going to be there .
It 's the same way the music stores were 10 years ago .
There was a used CD store on every street corner , and so they were n't that big of a deal .
Then people stopped going there and they disappeared .
You really need to support those local businesses , because they 'll never get better and bigger unless people go there .
SC : David , thanks so much for being so generous with your time , and talking to me about all of this .
I hope you get some time to actually play some games sometime in the near future !
DK : Thank you very much , I appreciate it !
He had not been feeling well for some time .
When he woke up he was feeling sore and was sweating .
He thought i t was reflux but it was not , My mother called an ambulance and it turned out he had a heart attack .
He was flown to Christchurch , from Greymouth ( which is a town of 12,000 ) .
Christchurch is the main city in the South Island with excellent heart doctors .
There are none in Greymouth .
He now needs a double bypass and two vents inserted since two arties had completely collapsed .
He is apparently going to be fine .
My father is in his 60's .
I am pretty shaken up at the moment but this was not a suprise .
He had been going downhill for a while .
But noone could work out why .
He will be having a double bypass in about two weeks .
They are waiting for a lung infection to clear up first .
He should be in hosptial for about a month .
The one thing missing in this discussion is the cost .
In New Zealand there is no cost for this treatment .
It is paid by the Goverment through the tax system .
Here it would be thousands of dollars : the airplane flight , and the care and treatment .
As upset as I am right now , thats one thing my mother does not have to worry about .
I wish it was the same for everyone in this country .
I would like to say thank you to everyone for all the wonderful comments and if i can't say it everyone invividually i would like to say it here .
You guys are the best .
Thank you very much .
Your support means the world to me .
Update :
Thank you to everyone again for the wonderful words .
I have to go out and get somet things done .
Its hard not being able to do anything from here but i guess keeping busy is the only way to go .
Will be back a bit later to read all your wonderful comments .
thank you again very much .
I often feel like this comes off as so much whining , but to explain where I ’m coming from , what ’s happening in my head , I need to keep saying it : I am having a lot of difficulty transitioning with this blog .
I am always having those difficulties – this thing is an ever - changing beast .
Now that I ’m making an effort to adjust myself rather than adjust my blog , I ’m getting some valuable perspective on some shit what ’s gone on here .
Specifically , I ’ve got a better idea of what was going on with me when I bungled this post .
See , the other day , I had the singularly exciting opportunity to see my blog come up as a suggested feed for me in my RSS .
“ Harriet ! ” my RSS says , “ You might enjoy these blog articles by Harriet ! ”
Well , yes , I agree !
Checking it out , I saw just how many people are subscribed .
It did n’t seem like an objectively large number ( though it still tickled me pink ) , but then , on a whim , I ran it against the subscribers on some of the other feminist blogs I read .
You know , the ones I consider to be “ real ” blogs , with real writers , real readership , real effect on the blogosphere .
And I was blowing most of them out of the water .
These are blogs I consider important .
Worthwhile .
These are the blogs that have helped create the bulk of my post - college feminist theory .
When I want to give a friend Feminism 101 , I refer them to these articles , these writers .
These are my academics , the people that I consider to be out there , doing real things , making real changes .
I do n’t feel that way about myself .
Not because I do n’t value my abilities enough ( though that ’s also true ) , but because I value their abilities so much .
These are people who have put far more dedication , passion , and just plain old fucking work into their little piece of the good fight ; I know I ’ve got raw writing talent , but in my mind , I just shlubbed onto the scene , said , “ What ’s up guys , let ’s talk about me for a while , ” then fell over backwards into some butterscotch fame .
I did n’t start this blog to be a feminist mouthpiece .
I did n’t start it to fight the good fight .
I did n’t start this blog to create anything other than a safe space for me to go “ BLAH BLAH BLAH ” all day .
As my blog started getting popular , people started commenting and emailing me , telling me that I was all these things I had never wanted or asked to be .
I was a voice for others .
I was putting out little ripples of good .
I ’ve really resisted giving in to that .
Whatever others are finding to value in my voice , that ’s only coming from my ability to speak freely and for myself .
I do n’t know how to speak for others , or stake a claim outside my body and defend it .
I freeze up .
I do poorly .
I get red - faced and talk for hours and do n’t say anything .
I do n’t want to be anybody ’s Internet role model .
That ’s too much responsibility , too much obligation , too much that hems me in .
I should be able to just have a blog and talk about what I want , and everybody should just realize that they ca n’t expect anything else out of me .
Just because other people look up to me does n’t mean I ’m a role model .
The other day , I got into a fight with my boss , which is new to me .
At my last job , I never raised a peep .
But the dynamics here – though still pretty dysfunctional – are nowhere near abusive , and suddenly I ’ve found myself opening my mouth and adamantly disagreeing , only later to wonder , “ Who the fuck was that who just told off her boss ?
Holy shit , it could n’t have been me . ”
Anyway , my boss and I were fighting about how to process a certain objective in the office .
The way they ’ve done it in the office , for years , has never worked , and costs an arm and a leg more than it should .
I was arguing for another way , a way that requires much more administrative presence upfront , and much more managerial oversight , but will result in lots of savings .
My boss was arguing for the old way , saying , “ If we just tell people to do it this way , that should work . ”
And she was right – it should work .
It would be the easiest and the best if it did work that way .
But it has never worked yet , and it was n’t working now , so I was arguing , “ Whether it should work has no bearing on whether or not it does .
And it does n’t .
So we can keep doing it wrong because it should work , or we can find a way that does work and do it right . ”
Suddenly , I was thinking about my blog .
I should n’t have to take responsibility for being a representative of somebody ’s voice in the wilderness .
That ’s not what I created this space for , and that ’s not what I wanted .
I should n’t be expected to change my way of living because other people look up to me .
Other people should realize that I am not a role model .
That ’s how it should be , but that ’s not the way it ’s working .
So I can keep doing it the way it should be , and keep fucking some crucial things up , or I can find a way that works and do this right .
Since I do have significant readership , disproportionate to how much I feel I deserve from the work I put in here , and since that ( very likely ) comes with readers who are looking to me to set a certain tone and standard , I have to start acting like the kind of person who deserves all that .
When the trans argument popped up initially , I could tell I was not handling myself well .
I froze up .
There was a lot going on there , and I really could n’t separate any of it out : just one big teeming rubberband ball of privilege , confusion , ignorance , sudden comment moderation , social anxiety , and unspoken expectations about my blog .
At that point , I was still really viewing Fugitivus as a livejournal .
I did not think of myself as somebody in the class of big - name bloggers , somebody who was Doing Something About Feminism ‘ N Stuff or generally accepting a role within a community .
Not that feminism does n’t become inherently personal at points , but I really felt that this space was purely personal .
I was unable and unwilling to view myself through the perspective of my readers , who considered me something more than an online diary .
So , people coming here to tell me , hey there , that thing you said is really douchey ?
Okay , fair enough – I can say douchey things and be called out on it , or I can not say douchey things , but I ca n’t say douchey things and expect nobody gets to call me a douche .
But having people come in and argue that I need to change my tone , my thoughts , my blog , is based on a premise that my tone , thoughts , and blog are worth way more than I ’m willing to believe .
“ You , personally , are saying shitty things , ” is something I can deal with ( with varying levels of success ) .
“ You are part of and responsible for a community , you set the tone , you create something larger than the sum of its parts with your work , and you have an obligation to do right by that , ” was something I was not able to deal with .
So , rather than deal with the problem from Perspective 2 , wherein my blog is meaningful and part of a wider discourse , I dealt with it from Perspective 1 , where this is a personal problem .
It was a big personal problem – running headfirst into a wall of privilege usually is – and I was wandering around in a daze for a while .
I did what I usually do when I ’m confused and unbalanced ; I retreated .
I added my cis privilege to the list of things to keep thinking about until it ’s been untangled , and I have been doing that slowly and privately , in the safety of my own head .
That ’s how I handle personal issues that come up between me and another person .
I apologize , I fix it if I can , and if I can ’t , I promise to not forget , to keep thinking about ways to fix it , and then I take a really long , patient , quiet time to do this .
Which is all well and good for me personally , and for those who want to hang out with me .
But this blog is n’t a personal thing anymore .
If it ever really was , it was back in the days when I got five hits a day .
Even the rules I ’ve enacted on this blog are primarily personal rules .
I conduct my comments the way I conduct my life , and I ban or delete the kind of shit I ’m not willing to hear IRL .
I give some passing thought to what other people might or might not want to hear , but I do n’t think about this as a community , or a real place that I am responsible for .
The bigger this has gotten , the more apparent it ’s become that the personal approach is n’t enough anymore .
This is bigger than me now , bigger than I could ever purposefully make it .
I ’m trying to wrap my head around all the big and little things that changes – like my definition of being a writer , being a success , or doing something with my life – and this just goes on the list .
Here ’s the reason all this came up .
I was reviewing a bunch of my link trackbacks .
I get a fair amount , and about 50 % are ending up in shitty , ugly places , forums that are all “ ha ha she got raped ” or “ that is n’t racism , that ’s just good sense , ” etc .
I ’m not the kind of person who enjoys or is able to tolerate hanging out in enemy camp , so I do a lot of skimming to quickly determine if I ’m at a generally feminist or anti-racist website , or at a place awash in pearl - clutching terror and historical fugue .
If it ’s generally feminist , I might skim a little harder , but usually not too much .
Most places do n’t have the very strict moderation that I have , and I do n’t enjoy flamewars at all – some people do , and that ’s okay , it ’s just not for me .
I usually skim just enough to pick up the gist of a conversation , but not get involved in anything that makes my blood pressure rise .
So , I find myself linked on what appears to be a generally feminist site .
I ’m skimming around to find where I ’ve been mentioned , and it looks like I ’m somewhere in the comments .
The commenter has accompanied my link with something about how this is an example of how things go wrong , and since she ’s linking to a post about rape , I assume she ’s saying something about rape culture – that ’s where I get most of my trackbacks .
I scroll up to skim the original post , and it ’s something vaguely feminist enough , about The Vagina Monologues .
I skimmed even more vaguely because unpopular feminist confession : I do n’t care for The Vagina Monologues .
I think they ’re pretty cool , but honestly , I just do n’t like monologues .
I see , in my skimming , that the poster is discussing trans women performing The Vagina Monologues .
I ’ve heard of this before , and I think it ’s pretty neat .
In the adoption world , I got used to referring to adopted or foster kids as having “ complicated ” relationships to family .
It ’s a generally value - neutral way to acknowledge the ways losing their first family has affected them , without neglecting to mention that these kids are perfectly capable of loving , being loved , and creating new families around them .
It ’s complicated .
I like people who have “ complicated ” relationships to anything , because it usually means that they ’ve spent a lot more time dissecting , analyzing , understanding , and seeking out these objects of their desire than anybody with a “ normal ” relationship .
When I first heard that trans women were putting on The Vagina Monologues , I thought it was really going to add something to hear from women who have complicated relationships with vaginas .
Not that cis women do n’t , obviously , but like with foster or adopted kids , there are things trans women have to grieve and have to gain , things they lose and things they build , that cis women do n’t necessarily ever have to confront .
Check out my privilege : I totally thought all the other feminists felt this way , so I did n’t skim very hard , and assumed this article was also , “ Yay trans Vagina Monologues ! ”
I ’ve always considered myself a feminist , but college is where I really learned all the ideological background and academics .
And we had little trans units , here and there , where we all discussed how trans stuff just blew the fucking top off gender tropes , and that was the awesomest thing ever .
It did n’t occur to me , at the time , that we were a bunch of cis women sitting around discussing how the existence of trans people was a useful ideological tool for our own agendas .
There was n’t any discussion of transfolk as , you know , real people , just discussions of what transfolk represented , and what that representation could do for us .
What we learned , though very privileged , was still generally on a positive tone : our professors actively encouraged us to celebrate the gender diversity that transfolk brought into the world .
We were n’t to consider transfolk as obstacles in the way of feminism ’s rolling bus , or separate issues that would be dealt with once the revolution had come .
But we were n’t taught to consider transfolk as folk – they were essay titles , intriguing theses , ideological termites , eating away at the patriarchy ’s gendered framework and bringing us awesomely helpful pronouns in the meantime .
Us being everybody else , because despite the general positivity and tolerance ( rather than acceptance ) , transfolk were still clearly them .
I received my college education not more than four years ago , from a generally liberal field in a generally liberal school , so I assumed that I had been taught whatever the general liberal feminist beliefs at this time were .
I mean , yeah , of course , we were also taught that unfeminist people were all trans - hating , and we were definitely taught about trans panic , about murders , about BATHROOM TERRORS , but those were all things that ordinary people did .
Not feminists , not anymore .
Those days ?
So behind us .
So , back to this blog .
I skim the section on The Vagina Monologues , assuming it ’s all “ Yay trans women ! ” , because the world I live in is nice and easy like that .
I skim through the comments and find some keywords that indicate a faptrot has begun – words like “ always ” and “ never ” and “ all you people ” and “ censorship ! ” and “ ruining our space . ”
So I figure , because my world is nice and easy , that some assholes came in and had a trans - terror , and all the usual commenters jumped in to start shouting them out .
I go back to the comment area where I am mentioned to see where I fit in to all this .
I read a comment that is about as shitty as I can imagine .
Like , if I were writing a novel with a character called Stereotype McDouchington , this is what they would say about transfolk .
Ah!
I think .
This must be the person causing all the trouble here .
Let ’s see how somebody jumps in to shut them down , yes yes , because that will be satisfying !
And as I keep reading , the comments keep coming .
Things I could n’t even imagine that people – that feminists !
– were still saying , in this day and age , about transfolk .
About anybody !
On my blog , I would n’t let people talk about Ann Coulter that way , because it is So. Fucked .
Up .
I do not even want to repeat these things , because I read them enough , in the comments I delete , and they ’re horrible and sickening .
Of course , I expect those things in the comments I get – boys with the Hulk Rage come here to try and make me fear for my life , because my existence punches their privileged belly .
I do not expect to read those things from feminists .
I do not even expect to read those things from feminists talking about the unfeminist world , because I expect that feminists have a basic understanding ( even if it ’s a spotty application ) of the concept that a rotten principle is a rotten principle .
If it ’s not okay for Defenders of the Patriarchy to advocate that you oughta get raped so you know what it ’s like to be a real woman , then it ’s not okay for you to advocate that the Defenders get raped in turn .
Master ’s tools , master ’s house .
Check .
Out. My. Privilege .
So I go back to the place I ’ve been linked and read the comment more carefully .
I am an example of how things go wrong .
I am an example of a feminist discussion that was ruined – RUINED – by trans women .
I am an example of a woman who was SILENCED .
I am a reason why trans women need to sit down , shut up , and possibly do us all a favor and die , because Harriet over at Fugitivus was so oppressed by you .
Fuckin ’ ouch .
I knew I did n’t handle myself well in that post that was linked .
I knew I was making mistakes .
I knew I was too ignorant to get it together , and that ignorance was a reflection of what I had , up till that point , considered important enough to learn about .
But approaching it from a personal perspective , I allowed myself the privilege of taking a long and quiet time of reflection .
I did n’t step forward quickly with an apology , I did n’t challenge some comments I should have , because I was busy thinking and not talking .
And because this was all personal , there was nothing wrong with that .
But from the other perspective , where this is a community where I am the most powerful representative , I created a certain kind of atmosphere .
It was n’t , I hope , an atmosphere where questions could n’t be asked , disagreements raised , or conversations had .
But I did the thing that I loathe so much in other situations , though it always sounds like such a good idea : I refused to take sides .
That seemed like a perfectly appropriate way to handle things when I ’m talking about my personal space , and the time I need to work things out .
There ’s nothing appropriate about that in a public space , where the fucked members of the kyriarchy come to be safe .
By refusing to take sides , by refusing to take a firm position , I created an image of myself that let a bigot identify with me .
I created an event that other bigots can point to and say , “ See ?
See how you ’re ruining everything ? ” I ca n’t take responsibility for every bigot out there .
People see what they want to see , and I have seen some of my posts go to really weird places , full of wild speculations and TimeCube logic .
But I ca n’t honestly say that my actions here have been patently misinterpreted .
I can see pretty clearly how they got from Point A to Point B , and I did n’t really offer anything up in between to derail that train .
I do n’t have a good conclusion here .
Things are n’t all different now , and I have n’t got a plan for how I ’m going to fix this .
I ’m trying to educate myself more .
I do n’t know where that will lead .
I ’m still very uncomfortable talking about anything that is n’t cis , because I do n’t think I have a right to assume I can be an authority on anything that is n’t cis .
But there is a conversation I ’ve been having over and over with some no -name bloggers I ’m soliciting .
I ask them what they want to write about , and they say , “ I have n’t been raped , so obviously I ca n’t write about that . ”
Nobody has to write about rape here , but I do n’t want to let that statement go by unchecked .
So I tell them , you do n’t have to be raped to be affected by rape .
There are a thousand ways rape has limited or damaged your life , too , even if you ’ve never known a rape victim .
You live in the same pond the rape victims do , and you ’re drinking the same water .
You know what we ’re thinking because you ’ve thought it about us , about yourself , about others , because we all grew up with the same toxic thoughts about rapists and rape victims .
But I understand why the no-name bloggers believe this .
I imagine my awareness sometimes like a big bubble surrounding me .
The more I learn , the bigger my bubble gets , and new things end up inside , bouncing around .
Inevitably , every time my bubble has expanded , the “ new ” thing that shows up turns out to be not so new at all .
Before I became aware of the thing , I thought of it as something out there , independent , floating around in the World I Do Not Understand .
After I become aware of the thing , I realize that it was actually another bubble , surrounding me and mine .
Like a big failure of a Venn diagram .
Suddenly , I can look through the keepsakes in my bubble and see all the different moments in my life that were touched by this “ new ” thing , because it was never new or different .
It was always there , but unconnected , without a name .
My new awareness is actually just a new name .
Intellectually , I understood a lot about rape before I was ever raped .
Only afterwards did the personal start to reconnect itself , reform under this new name : This Is What Rape Looks Like , Harriet .
I was able to see all these little times and places in my life that were a part of what I experienced , finally , at the hands of my husband .
My life had been filled with rape , but I had been calling it jokes , drunk assholes , catcalls , bad sex , fear out of nowhere , self - injury , self - hatred , eating disorders , locker room conversations of “ what did she expect ? ”
Before I was raped , though , if you were to tell me , “ You have lots to say about rape ! ” I would have parroted back some statistics I ’d read .
Certainly , I have no personal investment in this word , this concept .
It exists out there , for the people who know something about it .
All those moments in my life ?
They belong under different names .
So I ’m trying to apply that to this .
I ’m cisgendered , and I do n’t have any right to talk about a transgender experience .
But I do have a right – and now an imperative – to talk about the ways in which strict gender roles have limited or damaged my life .
These are things that have always fallen under the concept “ Feminism , ” but that ’s a word that very obviously is n’t specific enough , because it ’s a word that allows transphobic bigots to spread their wings .
I need to find ways to understand , personally and politically , how my freedom rests on the freedom of transfolk , that these things can not be divided .
I know I have these experiences – I know many people have – and have just never believed that they had anything to do with transsexuals .
A brief example : at the start of junior high , my grandmother chopped all my hair off against my will .
It ’s a longer story than that , but to shorten it , I had n’t really developed yet , and I was going into a new school and a new period of my life looking like a boy .
Girls would n’t let me into the bathroom unless I stripped .
Boys made gay sex jokes around me , and simulated anal rape in the halls .
Teachers frequently called me by the wrong pronoun .
People who knew my mother was a lesbian told me that must be why I thought I was a boy .
None of this was helped by the fact that , in real life , I have a somewhat gender ambiguous name .
I ’ve often thought about those experiences under the umbrella of “ feminism . ”
I surprised myself , considering this the other day , when I realized that I ’d never thought about this when reading about trans issues .
I ’ve never read a news story about the Bathroom Panics and remembered being followed into stalls .
I ’ve never heard a transgendered person describe the personal pain it causes them when they ’re called by the wrong pronoun and remembered what it was like to have shopkeepers address me as “ little boy , ” and then treat me with open hostility when I corrected them .
I ’m amazed at my lack of empathy with so much opportunity to connect .
But this is why it ’s important to call a thing by the proper name .
It ’s not just confusion , ignorance , or foolishly good intentions that kept me from pulling on my own experience .
It ’s bigotry .
And it ’s bigotry that feminism is still happily flirting with , bigotry that will cause future generations to call this a part of our dark age ( if we ’re lucky ) .
END OF SQUALID INTROSPECTION
Now a solicitation .
I am seeking a self - identified transgendered no -name blogger to make a post .
Let me know if you ’re interested !
PLEASANT MOUNT , Pa. ( AP ) 
A few hundred yards from Louis Matoushek 's farmhouse is a well that could soon produce not only natural gas , but a drilling boom in the wild and scenic Delaware River watershed .
Energy companies have leased thousands of acres of land in Pennsylvania 's unspoiled northeastern tip , hoping to tap vast stores of gas in a sprawling rock formation — the Marcellus shale — that some experts believe could become the nation 's most productive gas field .
Plenty of folks like Matoushek are eager for the gas , and the royalty checks , to start flowing — including farmers who see Marcellus money as a way to keep their struggling operations afloat .
" It 's a depressed area , " Matoushek said .
" This is going to mean new jobs , real jobs , not government jobs . "
Standing in the way is a loose coalition of sporting groups , conservationists and anti-drilling neighbors .
They contend that large - scale gas exploration so close to crucial waterways will threaten drinking water , ruin a renowned wild trout fishery , wreck property values , and transform a rural area popular with tourists into an industrial zone with constant noise and truck traffic .
Both sides are furiously lobbying the Delaware River Basin Commission , the powerful federal - interstate compact agency that monitors water supplies for 15 million people , including half the population of New York City .
The commission has jurisdiction because the drilling process will require withdrawing huge amounts of water from the watershed 's streams and rivers and because of the potential for groundwater pollution .
The well on Matoushek 's 200 - acre spread in the northern Pocono Mountains is up first .
The commission is reviewing an application by Stone Energy Corp. of Lafayette , La. , to extract gas from the well — the first of what could be thousands of applications by energy companies to sink wells in an area roughly the size of Connecticut .
Stone Energy 's application has already generated more than 1,700 written comments to the DRBC .
The company , which paid a $ 70,000 penalty for drilling the Matoushek well without DRBC approval in 2008 , has already received a permit from the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection .
Eager gas companies have leased more than 300 square miles of watershed land , conservation officials estimate .
" This is certainly just the start .
There 's a lot of acreage out there , and a lot of people interested in leasing their land , " said Tracy Carluccio , deputy director of the anti-drilling Delaware Riverkeeper Network .
The Marcellus shale is a rock formation 6,000 to 8,000 feet beneath Pennsylvania , New York , West Virginia and Ohio , including about 36 % of the Delaware River basin .
New drilling techniques now allow affordable access to supplies in the Marcellus and other shales in the U.S. that once were too expensive to tap .
Energy companies combine horizontal drilling with hydraulic fracturing , or " fracking , " a technique that injects vast amounts of water , along with sand and chemicals , underground to break up the shale and release the gas .
While gas companies refuse to identify the chemicals they use — claiming that is proprietary information — critics cite contamination problems in other natural gas drilling fields .
They worry that unregulated fracking can taint drinking water , deplete aquifers and produce briny wastewater that can kill fish .
In Dimock , Pa. , about 40 miles west of the Matoushek well but outside the Delaware basin , state environmental regulators say that cracked casings on fracked wells have tainted residential water supplies with methane gas .
The Environmental Protection Agency announced last month that it will study the impact of fracking on the environment and human health .
The EPA said in 2004 there was no evidence that fracking threatens drinking water quality , but critics , including a veteran engineer in the Denver regional EPA office , argued that report 's methodology was flawed .
The industry contends environmental concerns are overblown .
It says the drilling techniques are safe and that there has never been a proven case of groundwater contamination caused by fracking — in part because fracking occurs far below the water table .
Congress exempted hydraulic fracturing from federal oversight in 2005 .
Dozens of people told the DRBC at a recent public hearing why they oppose the watershed drilling .
A few supporters called it an economic boon and a property - rights issue .
Richard Kreznar , who owns property in the Pennsylvania riverfront community of Damascus , said gas drilling primarily benefits large landowners and exploration companies .
" After the Delaware River and the stream next to my house are messed up , what compensation will I get ?
Who will put it back together again ? " he asked DRBC staff .
Lee Hartman , the Delaware River chairman for Trout Unlimited , worries that large water withdrawals required for fracking will create low stream flows in the Delaware 's tributaries , damaging fish habitat .
For the Matoushek well , Stone Energy wants to take 700,000 gallons a day from the Lackawaxen River 's narrow west branch .
Hartman and others say the DRBC should first study the cumulative environmental impacts of drilling in the Delaware watershed , and pass drilling regulations , before it allows any gas extraction to take place .
The agency has asked for $ 250,000 in federal funds for a study , but commissioners have not said whether they will wait before voting on Matoushek 's well .
Opponents say they will sue if Stone Energy 's application is approved .
Downstream communities that rely on the Delaware for drinking water are worried about the coming gas boom .
New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg opposes any drilling in the watershed , while the Philadelphia City Council has asked the basin commission for an environmental study .
New
York state regulators have put a moratorium on drilling in the Marcellus region , saying they wo n't approve permits until they are finished drafting new regulations .
Back in northeastern Pennsylvania , Matoushek , 68 , a semiretired farmer who signed a lease with Stone Energy three years ago , said he is counting on royalty checks from gas production to help fund his golden years and secure the land for future generations of his family .
As far he 's concerned , the benefits far outweigh any theoretical harm .
" Without the approval , you 're depriving me of the opportunity to derive an income from my land , " he said .
His neighbors , Amy and Chuck Theobald , straddle both sides of the debate .
The longtime dairy farmers —
Amy is fourth - generation — take pride in running their 200 - head operation in an environmentally sustainable way .
They worry that drilling will ruin the water , and that state government does n't have the resources to adequately police the industry .
They believe landowners who signed up early got fleeced .
But Amy also sees the Marcellus gas field as a way to reduce the nation 's reliance on foreign sources of energy .
And , with dairy prices in freefall and the Theobald farm hemorrhaging $ 6,000 a month , the couple are thankful they signed a 5 - year lease with Chesapeake Energy Corp .
that paid them $ 1,850 an acre .
" I 'm not sure what we would have done to keep our heads above water , " she said .

I thought I ’d do something different and write a blog post about the iPad .
Why add to the noise ?
Because my beloved publishing industry , my source of professional identity and income , is on the verge of blowing it .
Let me run it down for you .
Sometime around 2002 , in boardrooms of publishing companies throughout the world , executives began to fret over the downward flow of advertising dollars from their magazines and newspapers .
They ’d built websites , sure , but those were barely breaking even .
There was no clear path forward for the business .
So we panicked and froze in place for eight years .
Think Austin Powers .
Or Han Solo .
Fast forward to January 27 , 2010 .
Steve Jobs plops himself down on a couch and begins spinning a 10 - inch aluminum pop tart on his finger .
As if emerging from hypnosis , the executives miraculously awaken and a collective chorus of hallelujah spontaneously erupts and echoes down the halls of 6th Avenue .
“ We are saved , ” the executives yell !
“ All hail Steve ! ”
Now let me be clear .
I was home from the Apple store last Saturday morning by 10:30 , package in hand .
And from that point on I saw nary a second of light of what I ’m told was a glorious spring weekend .
I was too busy downloading apps , surfing the web with my finger , and salivating over the clarity of streaming movies from Netflix .
I love my iPad .
I think it heralds a completely new era in computing .
I think it could present a much more engaging , compelling , and more personal way to consume and interact with ideas than any digital form that has preceded it .
And I think the way publishers are approaching it so far all but obviates every one of its assets .
How so ?
By assuming that two mature media – print and desktop websites – can simply be retrofit and forced onto this very immature medium .
Here ’s how it went in the minutes and hours after the publishing executives became aware of the iPad :
“ It ’s digital print ” they cheer !
“ Our magazines will look fabulous ” they sing !
“ Our readers will love it , ” they say somewhat more tentatively .
“ Will they really , ” some ask ?
“ They did n’t seem to be loving the print version of our print all that much . ”
“ Hmm , ” they pause .
“ Maybe you have a point . ”
“ But wait , ” in rushes another , “ The circulation numbers will count if we make it look and act like print ! ”
“ And better yet , ” chimes in yet another .
“ We can kill this ‘ free ’ thing once and for all , and start charging for digital content .
Maybe more than ever ! ”
“ Hooray , hurrah ! ” We are saved .
“ Screw the consumer .
Save the business model ! ”
And so we have the publishing industry ’s strategy : create products and experiences that so mimic print that we are able to extend its dying advertising and subscription models .
The magazine apps on your iPad seemingly represent no significant thought on how to serve the reader ; they are about serving the business model .
The websites you view on your iPad were built for the era of mice ‘n monitors , not touch screens you hold in your laps .
These are not the answers .
We do n’t know what the answers are yet .
Look , print - based apps can serve a purpose in all of this , as can our existing web properties .
We can use them to learn , to experiment , and to get feedback .
But we need to remind ourselves that they are not the destination ; they are just a starting point to discovering how to create customer value in an entirely new environment .
If we lose sight of that and allow ourselves to assume the answer is from the past , our futures are bleak .

It was rumored for a long time that Twitter would be releasing an app for Android .
Well the wait has ended as Twitter ’s official app was finally released a few minutes ago and is available on the Android market right now for free .
While this is great news at first , there is a catch - it is only for Android 2.1 and above .
Anyone with 2.0 or lower will have to stick with their current Twitter app and wait till 2.1 hits their phones ( I 'm looking at you , Hero users ) .
Alternatively , you could grab a 2.1 custom ROM for your phone if you do n't feel like waiting around .
So far , from what I ’ve seen , there is no multiple account support and I hope it will be added in the next update .
Here is part of the official press release talking about some of the features you will find :
Twitter for Android is a fantastic application to use , and sharing any link or photo is super simple too – just look for the share button in your favorite application and choose Twitter .
Reading tweets is easy in a bunch of places on your phone .
Quickly access your timeline with the home screen widget , view a tweet location on a map , and see your friend ’s latest tweet in your phonebook , GoogleTalk list or any application that uses Android ’s QuickContact bar .
Features
This app comes with all the features you would need to handle your Twitter business in a slick looking UI .
It is even animated at the bottom where the blue bird is , quietly flying in the sky .
You will also notice in the main options window trending hashtags flying in and out .
Main Screen
The main screen of the Twitter app lets you access your settings by pushing the menu button .
You will also be able to access Tweets , Lists , Mentions , Retweets , Direct Messages , and your profile .
You will also see the trending topics I mentioned showing up at the bottom to the left of the blue bird .
Settings
Here are the available settings :
Turn off the animated background
Filter Notifications
Turn On / Off Vibrate
Sync with your Contacts
Sync with Twitter
Set your Sync intervals
Set Notification ringtones and Trackball light
Set your picture upload service ( TwitPic or yfrog )
Set your URL shortening service ( Bit.ly ot TinyURL )
Main Tweet Screen
When on your main tweets screen ( where all the tweets will show up ) , you can press on those arrows next to each tweet to get a handy shortcut menu with options to Reply , Retweet , Favorite , or Share that tweet .
Clicking a URL inside the tweet will open up the browser and load the page .
Some other Twitter apps make you go into another window to tap on a link to open it , so this is a lot more user friendly .
Integration
You will notice that this app can sync up with your contacts , but that ’s not all .
It also comes integrated with Google Maps as well as an ability to share pictures over twitter ( using the picture uploading service ) right after taking them .
Those of you who prefer to monitor Twitter via widgets are able to add one to the home screen ( both small and large size ) .
Tapping on the widget will take you right to the main Twitter screen .
You can also tap on the arrow beside the tweet in the widget and it will open up the Twitter app onto the reply screen for some quick reply action .
Overall
Overall the Twitter app feels complete , polished , and packed with enough features that any Twitter fanatic will enjoy without being bogged down by too much customization .
The absence of multiple account support , however , is a big omission , so other Twitter clients still stand a chance .
Twitter has also done a great job with the official app keeping it running smoothly .
I noticed no lag when selecting options or flipping through menus and screens .
Final Note On Open Source
One final note of interest , and a very important one : the app will apparently go open source soon .
As the app is free and Twitter is already the underlying service behind it , both Twitter and us , users , will only gain from this move .
Twitter wo n't have to get involved with the development as much while we will benefit from the collaborative power of the open source community .

Where do you turn for inspiration for your next website design ?
If you ’re like many , you probably head straight for a design gallery .
Read these tips and techniques on the right way to browse a design gallery and I ’m sure you ’ll find your browsing experience to be more valuable and pleasant .
Where do you turn for inspiration for your next website design ?
If you ’re like many , you probably head straight for a design gallery .
Just fire up your browser and choose from any one of the hundreds of web design galleries available .
In an age of information overload , the design community is churning out more content than ever .
Every day , hundreds of sites will go live across the globe .
Many of the best will be collected , tagged , and put up for display in any number of the countless design galleries .
Design blogs will round up the best of the best for catchy list posts aimed to inspire more designers to create even more websites .
It can be overwhelming sometimes to wade through the endless pages of designs in these galleries .
Read these tips and techniques on the right way to browse a design gallery and I ’m sure you ’ll find your browsing experience to be more valuable and pleasant .
Have a Plan
Before you even open your browser , make sure you know what you ’re looking for .
Having your eyes set on a certain element ( i.e. footer design ) will help make your time productive and meaningful .
While it ’s okay to browse just to “ be inspired ” , targeted browsing will help reign in your focus and will improve the learning and browsing experience .
Here are a few strategies / targets :
color schemes
specific page elements ( footers , primary navigation , buttons , etc. )
layouts ( contrast and arrangement )
typography
textures
You can also browse for certain “ types ” of websites .
For instance , if you ’re designing a site for an insurance company , be on the lookout for insurance sites and other related businesses .
Having a good plan will ensure that you come away from your browsing experience with some targeted results and ready to use what ’s inspired you .
Set a Time Limit
Many of the web galleries that I frequent have dozens and dozens of pages of designs ; several of the sites are even updated daily .
It can be easy to lose track of time while browsing , and setting a time limit will be helpful .
There is such a thing as design overload where your senses have been stimulated beyond what they can take .
Attempting to take in inspiration beyond this point may negatively affect your browsing experience .
I try to spend no more than 20 - 30 minutes at a time browsing a gallery .
If I ’ve set myself up with a goal for the browsing session , it should be no trouble to get in and get out with some great ideas in that amount of time .
Now I may go back and take a closer look at sites that I ’ve tagged in my browser session , but my initial look - through should be focused and constrained .
Some designers make it a habit to spend XX minutes every day browsing design galleries or other forms of inspiration .
I think this is a great tactic , especially if you are willing to step out of your design comfort zone and look at designs that would be of a completely different style than what you ’re used to designing .¬†
Again though , be cautious to not fall into the mode of glazed - over browsing where you click for 2 hours and do n’t remember a single design .
Examine and Inspect
Now that we ’ve got our goals and our time limits in order , we can get to the task at hand of actually browsing the gallery .
Besides the obvious of moving site by site and looking at your predetermined area of focus , there are several methods or tricks that I like to use to learn and explore .
First Impressions
This is exactly what it says it is .
When you move to each new design , take count of what your first impression .
What emotions does it conjure up ?
What elements attract your eye ?
What does n’t feel right ?
These are just a few questions to ask after first glance .
One thing I like to do is open the page up for 5 - 10 seconds and then close it and jot down what I remember , what I like , what I do n’t like .
First impressions can lead to only impressions when your dealing with the web so learning from other designs what works and what does n’t in a matter of seconds can be extremely valuable .
Another valuable experiment is to see how quick and thorough the design explains the brand .
In other words , after 5 seconds of viewing the page , how much can you tell me about the company / organization / service that you did n’t know before .
Identifying trends such as bold typography in various websites can help you sell your own brand when it comes to your own designs .
Bit by Bit
The First Impressions test is great for examining the effectiveness of a site as a whole .
Picking the site apart bit by bit is more appropriate when you ’re looking for a particular style or element .
For this exercise , use the zoom functionality of your browser and focus in on a certain piece of the design .
By focusing in on a specific element , perhaps a site ’s themed buttons , you can start to break apart the design and see what went into creating it from the ground up .
Take special notice of designs that are perfect down to the pixel level .
Many finely - crafted websites will show little intricacies that make them stand out from the crowd .
Take these bits and think about what their purposes .
If you move from element to element , notice how a good designer will borrow colors , textures , and shapes from other parts of the site to bring about cohesion and balance to the overall experience .
Take note of site wide trends .
Using consistent elements across your design will help take your sites to another level of professionalism .
The Blur Test
A third experiment , the blur test , will take a little more work .
Take a screen grab of a design you like into Photoshop and apply a slight blur to the image .
You want the text and images to blur together into a mass of colors and shapes .
In this exercise , it is not important to be able to read anything .
What you ’re looking for is more general elements : contrast , focus , layout , and color schemes .
It ’s amazing what perspective you ’ll gain from taking designs out of focus .
An easier alternative to the Photoshop route is just squinting your eyes and blurring the sites naturally .
This method is not recommended if someone is in the room with you as they may start to look at you funny or suggest you take a trip to the eye doctor .
Compare and Contrast
Another great tool I use is a side - by - side comparison of two sites that I ’m interested in .
I ’ll open them in separate windows and look at details that are similar or methods the two designers differed on to arrive at a similar goal .
This is extremely handy in finding multiple ways to achieve an effect , emotion , or layout .
Take Notes
Throughout all of your browsing , be active in taking notes .
Jot down layouts that interest you .
Make notes of color schemes through the use of a color picking tool .
Take screen shots of certain design elements that you want to remember .
The goal here is to take away from your browsing experience something that you can use in your own designs .
I keep a design notebook that has sketched - layouts , lists of things I want to incorporate in future designs , and trends that I notice in certain web industries .
When I need to refer to something I saw in a design gallery , I can refer to my notes for quick access .
Bookmark the Best , Forget the Rest
In the same sense , bookmarks should also be used in every browsing session .
Making notes is great but it ’s also handy to have your designs stored somewhere for quick review .
This can be done directly in the browser although there are a few other tools that I use that make sorting and tagging easier .
Delicious provides online tagging and bookmarking that can be accessed from any computer within reach of the Internet .
Tags and notes will help you remember why you wanted to save the site in the first place .
Another tool that I use very frequently is Evernote .¬†
Among other things , Evernote allows me to snap sections of a website and save them as tagged and filed bookmarks in a notebook .
It too is accessible from multiple computers and offers a great way to keep my inspiration organized for future projects .
One last note on bookmarking .
There are so many sites out there that are good , you may not need to bookmark every one .
An overstocked library of web designs may seem appealing but sometimes it can be overwhelming .
Take care in bookmarking with a purpose and resist the urge to save every site .
If you need to , you can always return to the gallery later to track down that missing design .
The Wrong Way to Browse
I wanted to leave you with a thought about what web design galleries are not .
They are NOT a stock library of designs that you can rip and reuse in your own works .
It may seem easy to just do what the best do and copy their work .
This is lazy and it hurts not only the designer of the original work but also your own design ability .
If you ’re unable to creatively produce original designs , maybe you should rethink your role in the production of websites .
I hope you ’ve learned a few things about browsing web design galleries .
If done correctly , with the right motive , browsing a gallery can offer you information and inspiration to make your next design stand out and impress ( and maybe find its way into a design gallery itself ) .

USA TODAY OPINION USA TODAY OPINION About Editorials / Debate Opinions expressed in USA TODAY 's editorials are decided by its Editorial Board , a demographically and ideologically diverse group that is separate from USA TODAY 's news staff .
Most editorials are accompanied by an opposing view — a unique USA TODAY feature that allows readers to reach conclusions based on both sides of an argument rather than just the Editorial Board 's point of view .
The news came just in time to surprise and anger taxpayers sweating to get their 1040s done by Thursday 's deadline : Almost half of individuals and households owe no taxes for 2009 .
Could that be true ?
OTHER VIEWS : ' Reverse this trend '
Contrary to what you might have heard on talk radio or TV , it 's not quite that simple .
What 's true is that the Tax Policy Center , a well - regarded think tank , calculated that 47 % of Americans would owe no federal income taxes for 2009 , up from the usual 38 % who typically owe no income tax on April 15 .
Most still pay Social Security taxes , Medicare taxes , sales taxes and property taxes ( if they own any property ) .
So they 're paying taxes , but the fact that 47 % pay no federal income tax is nonetheless disturbing — not for what it says about the non-payers but for what it says about the nation 's broken tax system and how hard it will be to fix it .
The people who pay no income tax are n't freeloaders or evaders ; virtually all are simply doing what the law allows .
That there are so many of them is the result of decades of deliberate , bipartisan tax policy .
That includes an appropriately progressive income tax that levies a heavier burden on better - off taxpayers , and little or none on those with the smallest incomes .
It includes tax credits such as the ones that reward people for having children and help lift some people above the poverty line by rewarding them for working .
And it includes President George W. Bush 's tax cuts , which removed 5 million people from the tax rolls while giving big cuts to upper - income people as well .
More people owe no income tax this year because the recession has cost many people their jobs , and the tax cuts in the stimulus act — an idea conservatives preferred to spending programs — were potent enough to help push some people 's tax liability to zero .
Once the stimulus expires and the economy recovers , the number of non-payers should fall back toward the typical 38 % .
Even that number , however , strikes us as too high .
It 's not healthy for society if somewhere between a third and half of all potential tax filers do n't help share the cost of most of government , from defense to highways to national parks .
Everyone above the poverty level should have at least a minimal stake in financing the nation .
The fact that so many people have no income tax liability is a reflection of a leaky , dysfunctional tax system .
The code is absurdly complex .
( Some Americans have to pay hundreds of dollars to preparers just to find out that they do n't owe any taxes . )
It 's riddled with loopholes and excessive social engineering .
It 's undermined by spending programs that masquerade as tax credits .
It even fails at its basic function of raising revenue , taking in barely $ 1 for every $ 2 the government spends .
That 's an unsustainable gap .
Virtually every budget expert agrees that closing it will require trims in popular programs , particularly the underfunded Medicare and Social Security systems .
That 's a matter of math , not ideology , because that 's where the rising costs are .
It will require higher taxes on middle - and upper - income people .
It will require narrowing loopholes and perhaps even some sort of national sales , or value - added , tax .
In short , it will require a shared national sacrifice .
When nearly half of households do n't pay federal income taxes , it makes consensus harder to achieve by undermining the sense that we 're all in this together .

Opening The CPU Bottleneck
What does it mean to run face - first into a bottleneck ?
When we talk about bottlenecks here on Tom's Hardware , we 're usually referring to a single component that 's preventing the rest of a PC from reaching its full performance potential in any given benchmark .
For games , that component is usually either the CPU or graphics card , depending on how much performance the other part provides .
Our System Builder Marathon machines often expose CPU limits when multiple graphics processors are combined , but most gamers begin their builds with only a single GPU .
Among these , AMD ’s $ 320 Radeon HD 5850 represents the highest performance most gamers will want to spend money on .
The argument , of course , is that as you start shopping for more expensive alternatives , like a $ 700 Radeon HD 5970 , consoles start looking a lot more attractive .
With our best bang - for - the - buck graphics card fairly well defined , the question becomes : how much CPU do we need to milk the last ounce of performance from this pixel - spewing beast ?
Would a dual - core CPU do the job or , given that today ’s games are ever - more multi- threaded , would a triple - or even quadruple - core processor be needed ?
How much could overclocking help ?
Must we spend all of the money saved on the CPU to purchase a big cooler ?
Knowing that all of the subsequent questions must be addressed to completely answer the first , we gathered our Intel and AMD processor samples and began testing .
( CNN ) -- Actress Dixie Carter , best known for her role as Julia Sugarbaker on the TV show " Designing Women , " has died , her agent said Saturday .
She was 70 .
She was 70 .
Carter died from complications arising from cancer , her publicist , Steve Rohr , said Sunday .
Carter was drawn to roles portraying steely Southern women .
One of her more recent roles included a guest appearance on the show " Desperate Housewives , " for which she was nominated for an Emmy in 2007 .
" This has been a terrible blow to our family , " her husband , the actor Hal Holbrook , told " Entertainment Tonight . "
" We would appreciate everyone understanding that this is a private family tragedy . "
Carter and Holbrook met while filming the CBS - TV movie , " The Killing of Randy Webster . "
Carter was born in 1939 in McLemoresville , Tennessee .
In addition to her role as feisty Julia Sugarbaker , she 's been on other television series including " Family Law " and " Diff'rent Strokes . "
She also had a long career on Broadway and appeared on stage in " Southern Comforts " with her husband in 2006 .
In addition to Holbrook , to whom she has been married since 1984 , Carter is survived by two daughters , Mary Dixie and Ginna .
According to Rohr , Carter suffered from endometrial cancer , which forms in the the tissue lining the uterus .
On February 20 , a meeting took place in Washington , D.C. , between progressives , libertarians , and conservatives who deviate from the bipartisan foreign - policy consensus and favor an antiwar , anti-imperial alternative .
Participants were indeed all over the ideological map , as these interesting summaries ( 1 , 2 ) reveal .
( I was invited to attend but could not make it ; I ’d already been at CPAC and needed to get home to my wife and our new baby . )
Does this mean a genuine cross-ideological coalition against war is brewing ?
I would like nothing more than to think so .
I am confident that many libertarians and conservatives would welcome it .
But I am not so sure about the progressives .
We Who Dared to Say No ... Best Price : $ 2.50 Buy New $ 14.75 ( as of 08:10 EST - Details )
Do not misunderstand me : I am all in favor of such a thing .
Here ’s my article on a great model such a coalition might follow .
And it was in this spirit that Murray Polner ( a man of the Left , who did attend the February 20 meeting ) and I wrote our book We Who Dared to Say No to War : American Antiwar Writing from 1812 to Now ( Basic Books , 2008 ) .
As I wrote when our book came out , " Our aversion to mass murder was the common personality quirk that drew us together , and we decided that that was a pretty good basis for a fruitful collaboration .
It ’s a privilege to know Murray , and I ’m happy to say our joint efforts have borne some good fruit indeed . "
The book includes ( but is far from limited to ) contributions from Daniel Webster , John Randolph , John Quincy Adams , Charles Sumner , Julia Ward Howe , Lysander Spooner , Stephen Crane , William Graham Sumner , William Jennings Bryan , Robert La Follette , Randolph Bourne , Helen Keller , Jeanette Rankin , David Dellinger , Robert Taft , Murray Rothbard , Russell Kirk , George McGovern , Philip and Daniel Berrigan , Butler Shaffer , Country Joe & the Fish , Andrew Bacevich , Pat Buchanan , Bill Kauffman , Paul Craig Roberts , Howard Zinn , and Lew Rockwell .
Now that ’s a diverse coalition .
Murray and I brought these great people together between the covers of a book .
But can they be brought together under the aegis of an activist organization ?
The jury is still out .
For example , an organization called Historians Against the War ( HAW ) began auspiciously enough in 2003 , as a group of , well , historians against the war .
People of all political persuasions were welcome .
With the passage of time , though , being against the war was no longer enough .
You had to hold particular economic views , be a " progressive , " and support Obama .
It was insufficient simply to hold the libertarian position against corporatism , the warfare state , and the military - industrial complex .
( Chalmers Johnson evidently likes my article on the subject , which he calls an " important exegesis , " but although I was never an active member of HAW , my work would apparently not have satisfied its more exacting standards . )
The Politically Incorr ... Thomas E. Woods Jr. Best Price : $ 1.51 Buy New $ 8.71 ( as of 06:15 EST - Details )
And thus began the purges of those who did not conform , and in particular of those who scolded the organization for softening its antiwar rhetoric following the election of Obama .
Instead of viewing Obama as merely a left - variant of the bipartisan foreign - policy establishment , which he obviously is , these critical thinkers bought into the pretty speeches and left it at that .
Thaddeus Russell is a progressive historian who is friendly with libertarians , and with whom I myself have had some valuable correspondence .
He was purged from the blog .
He wrote :
As a member since the earliest days of the organization ( I signed on shortly after the Iraq invasion ) , I ask — and am on the verge of very publicly demanding — that the HAW steering committee clarify whether the organization is limited to “ progressive ” historians ( as the AHA flyer as well as many other statements made by the steering committee strongly suggest ) or just historians who are AGAINST THE WARS .
If the former , I will resign immediately since I refuse to identify myself with Wilson , the Roosevelts , Truman , Kennedy , Johnson , and the “ progressive ” tradition that is responsible for the largest imperialist wars in U.S. history .
[ Emphasis added . ]
That is what an actual progressive would say .
Now try to imagine the phonies at the Huffington Post or TalkingPoints Memo saying it .
Why , it ’s not respectable !
And it is mainstream respectability more than anything else that these left - wing phonies crave .
Who Killed the Constit ...
Thomas E. Woods , Kevin ... Best Price : $ 1.96 Buy New $ 9.00 ( as of 12:05 EST - Details )
Part of my skepticism about the interest of progressives in a left - right coalition derives from my own fate at the hands of those who are supposed to be so devoted to the antiwar cause .
Just weeks ago , Think Progress , after a one - sentence summary of my career that ( as usual ) left out the past 16 years , actually quoted Max Boot against me , as if Boot ’s opposition to my work was sufficient to bury me forever .
So instead of an antiwar libertarian , these progressives prefer neocon Max Boot , who according to Juan Cole “ never saw a war he did n’t love , never saw a conquest he did n’t find exhilarating , never saw an occupied land he did n’t think could be handled . ”
They approvingly quoted Boot ’s dumb - guy propaganda line that “ Woods ’ sympathy extends not only to slave - owning rebels but also to German militarists ” ( because , like 99 percent of people who have studied the matter , I think Woodrow Wilson ’s conduct during the early years of World War I was based on a double standard between Britain and Germany ) .
This is the same sense in which Ron Paul “ sympathizes ” with al - Qaeda because he does n’t buy U.S. war propaganda .
( I did reply to Boot , by the way . )
And these are the progressives ?
( Note to real progressives : now you know what libertarians go through , when spokesmen for a cause are more eager to curry favor with the regime than to stick to their principles and let the chips fall where they may . )

I have a book coming out toward the end of June that might have had some appeal to progressives in the tradition of Kirkpatrick Sale and William Appleman Williams , two scholars whom modern progressives , who know nothing of their own history , have never heard of .
The sellouts and phonies who populate the official precincts of modern progressivism , on the other hand , will greet the book with a vicious smear campaign .
Mark my words .
Thankfully , the Internet is the great equalizer .
Any fair - minded person anywhere can review my work and background for himself , and see if it sounds like the ogre they ’ll be describing .

In the midst of the last such smear campaign , economist Robert P. Murphy wondered if the person the so - called progressives were calumniating could really be me .
Funny Tom Woods is actually an enemy of mankind and an oppressor of society ’s most vulnerable ?
Both of us concluded that we would never again form our opinions of anyone on the basis of two sentences uttered by his enemies , even if we might happen to be ideologically sympathetic to those enemies .
Now if you actually do care about war and peace , and would in fact like to work with people of varying political persuasions , I recommend the Antiwar League .
Although started by a man on the Left , it genuinely welcomes everyone .
In principle , then , and even to some extent in practice , it can be done .
But many obstacles remain .
We have been trained to treat each other as categories rather than as human beings .
We have been conditioned to point and shout slogans at those who deviate from the mainstream — that glorious continuum ranging from Mitch McConnell to Hillary Clinton .
Never answered , because never asked , is why we should want to belong to a mainstream that has yielded us a century of war , propaganda , and fiscal ruin .
The so - called mainstream is where the real extremists are to be found .
Libertarians understand that .
Once the progressives do , we ’ll be getting somewhere .
The Best of Tom Woods
California is in a split market .
In some areas , buying a home makes economic sense and the numbers actually workout even with a conservative financial budget .
But in other markets , you have people delusional about prices and thinking that somehow prices will remain high even though many areas are mired with foreclosures and toxic Alt - A and option ARM products .
Yet somehow bubble prices will remain .
We always hear that California home prices are more expensive than the overall U.S. market and are somehow expected to take this at face value .
They mention the sun .
Arizona has sun .
They mention the good weather .
Florida has good weather .
They talk about beach front property .
South America has gorgeous beaches too .
So there has to be other reasons .
This current bust should tell you that in fact California prices can crash significantly .
For example , the national median home price is now at $ 173,500 .
Two counties in Southern California in the Inland Empire , Riverside and San Bernardino , are near or below that mark .
So in many cases , California homes are even cheaper than the national median price .
Yet in many other cities in the mid to upper tier markets prices are still with bubble valuations .
People have a hard time visualizing what a bubble city looks like versus a more normal market so we ’ll use an example today .
Today we salute Culver City with our Real Home of Genius Award .
Culver City Rent or Buy Analysis
How do you know if a home is priced at a right level ?
We have various metrics that we can use including common sense which seems to run in short supply .
That is how we spotted the epic California housing bubble years ago while the real estate denial cheerleading crew thought that prices would simply continue to go up .
In these mid-tier markets underlying incomes do not support current prices .
It really is that simple .
What is happening in these markets is this ; homes are building up in the shadow inventory since fewer homes are actually selling but defaults are still rising as many Californians are unable to make their payments .
The above home is an excellent example in mid-tier Culver City .
This home is a 3 bedroom and 2 baths home that was built in 1950 .
This is what many would consider a starter home .
The above home has been listed on the market for nearly 60 days .
The last sale price on this home takes us way back in history :
11/02/1972 : $ 27,500
Now what is the current sale price ?
The current sale price is $ 744,500 for a 3 bedroom in Culver City .
The median sale price for this zip code in Culver City is $ 540,000 so I ’m not sure exactly what pricing angle they are going for here .
Now prices like this are common .
These are the markets where people really think this price point is “ fair ” and what the cheerleading crew will try to tell you is the market value is what anyone is willing to pay .
This to a certain extent is correct .
Yet that does n’t make financial sense in the long - run .
It means another sucker is lining up to buy like many that took on Alt - A and option ARMs and now find themselves massively underwater .
And those that think prices are without bubble valuations rarely use thorough analysis or market valuation methods because their analysis falls apart when you think of more macro issues .
We ’ll look at a rental right on this street to prove our point but also , interest rates :
One flaw used in many current analyses is assuming the current mortgage rate is going to stay static .
It will not .
We are at historical lows .
The average 30 year rate over 40 years of data is 9 percent .
We are a long way from that .
But let us assume you buy this above home with an FHA insured loan with a 5 percent down payment :
Down payment : $ 37,225
Monthly PITI : $ 5,015
Needed Income to qualify : $ 214,000
Now something tells me that a person or couple making $ 214,000 a year is not going to buy this home ( by the way , the median household income for Culver City is $ 82,000 ) .
Even if they did , are they willing to shell out $ 5,015 in a monthly nut for a 3 bedroom home in Culver City ?
And let us hypothetically say that things somehow change in the next five years forcing rates up .
Let us now assume mortgage rates are back to their historical average .
How do the numbers workout ?
And here is where people miss the point .
Say you want to sell the home in the future , say 5 to 7 years but rates are up to 9 percent .
Now , to sell for the same price ( no increase in home price ) a prospective buyer will need an income of over $ 277,000 to buy this home !
Their monthly payment shoots up to $ 6,400 just because rates went up by 3 percent .
Of course , this part of the analysis is missed by those cheerleaders .
These markets are littered with examples like this .
Alt - A and option ARMs were tools used for people to buy homes like this during the peak with teaser rates .
After all , over 93 percent of option ARM borrowers went with the minimum payment .
But you want more data right ?
Okay , let us look at a rental on this same exact street :
You can see the home we ’ve been talking about highlighted above in red with the $ 744,500 listing price .
I ’ve circled the other home on the same street that is currently a rental in this market .
The rental listing has the place at 2 bedrooms and 2 baths .
Only a few houses away and 1 bedroom less .
What is the monthly rental price ?
$ 2,250 .
You can rent two of these places for the price of the mortgage on the other place !
This is the kind of metrics that scream housing bubble .
And keep in mind rental prices are more sensitive to monthly data because you are paying this amount out of your net income .
No tax breaks , toxic mortgages , or any other gimmick .
One simple rule when evaluating real estate is trying to figure out a home price based on rental income .
One I use is the following :
$ 2,250 x 12 months x 10 = $ 270,000
Now this is a quick analysis that I use when viewing potential investment properties and trying to gather a starting price point ( other factors will shift the price up or lower but not by much ) .
So what we do is multiply the annual net rent income times ten to get a rough estimate of value .
Now of course , the other home is a 3 bedroom but here we are being told that we should n’t expect much more than say $ 2,250 in rents for a 2 bedroom .
Let us guess high and say we can rent the home for $ 2,750 because of the extra room :
$ 2,750 x 12 months x 10 = $ 330,000
$ 330,000 is a long way from $ 744,500 .
There are places in the Inland Empire where these numbers actually work on certain homes .
I ’m not sure if I would buy them as rentals given the local economies but if you live there and your income is secure , then buying might make sense .
But not in Culver City .
And keep in mind the California unemployment rate is up to 12.4 percent , a number unseen since the Great Depression .
The actual underemployment rate is up to 22 percent and the California budget is in such a deep mess , that it is hard to see what will be done to remedy the shortfall .
It should be obvious that prices are much too high in these market .
Plus , people do n’t even have the income to support these levels !
A couple making $ 100,000 or $ 120,000 trying to buy this home is way out of their league .
This is n’t stretching your budget but more like putting a financial albatross around your family budget .
No matter how you slice it , the above home does not make sense .
Yet this is real market data .
The MLS lists 93 homes for sale in Culver City .
Yet the shadow inventory is much higher :
Notice of defaults : 79
Auctions scheduled : 90
Bank Owned : 18
On the MLS only 2 foreclosures show up and 17 short sales show up ( most of the short sales are condos ) .
Yeah , this looks like a healthy market .
Today we salute you Culver City with our Real Home of Genius Award .

It 's the kind of good publicity Apple could n't buy — ABC 's terrific new comedy Modern Family made the quest to buy a launch - day iPad the main plot of last week 's episode .
Three lines into the opening scene , the plot becomes clear — and the unabashed iPad praise begins in earnest ( Steve Jobs and God are also linked ) .
Gadget hound and all - around " cool dad " Phil wants an iPad for his birthday ; his wife Claire is skeptical , but open to learning more !
Phil : " The iPad comes out on my actual birthday .
It 's like Steve Jobs and God got together to say , ' We love you , Phil . ' "
Claire : " What 's so great about that doo - hickey , anyhow ? "
Phil : " Doo-hickey , Ellie May ?
It 's a movie theater , a library , and a music store all rolled into one awesome ... pad . "
That little dig at the iPad 's name is as close as the episode comes to criticism of the " magical " device .
By the show 's last scene , Phil has secured his iPad after trials and tribulations , and he sits on his couch rubbing his fingers across the glossy screen .
" I love you , " he whispers .
Claire , who walks in behind him , mistakenly thinks he is referring to her .
Ha-ha ?
Phil blows out the candles on his " cake "
Product placement and its discontents
Did we say that Apple could n't buy this kind of publicity ?
The truth is that it can , and did .
Viewers would know this only by watching the credits .
Near the end of the credit roll , a quick note flashes up on the screen : " Products provided by Apple . "
Perhaps the Modern Family writers are just huge Apple fanboys .
In past episodes , MacBook Pros and iMacs do litter the background scenery , but there are no dialogue references to them , no linkage of Jobs and God , and no plot point centered on buying Apple hardware .
Oh , and there 's a final indignity — when Apple does n't contribute to the production , all Apple hardware gets a nasty grey sticker slapped right over the iconic Apple logo .
Do n't pay , and the apple goes away
Apple clearly rolled out the full - court PR push for the iPad .
Fawning , almost cringe - worthy coverage of the device appeared to be the goal .
Apple got what it wanted through exceptionally tight control over prerelease hardware units for reviewers , with its gifts of iPads to people like Steven Colbert , and by doling out access to Jobs ( his partner , God , was apparently too busy with Easter prep to do interviews ) .
UK renaissance man Stephen Fry — whom we love — indulged in one of the most shameless pro-Apple rants ever to sully the pages of Time magazine , and it was all done " at Apple 's invitation . "
Then there 's Modern Family .
Sure , it was product placement , and yes , everyone knows it happens .
Shows like The Office regularly feature shots of the Hewlett - Packard logo , and that 's no accident .
But this was something more , pitching a real product that you could really go out and buy that very weekend ; it was something that might have seemed more usual decades ago , but it stands out today .
Shows used to be completely underwritten by sponsors in a way we do n't see so obviously anymore .
We 've written about the history of product placement , and how the 1949 TV show Man Against Crime was bankrolled by Camel cigarettes .
What 's the problem with that ?
It 's the free market at work !
Yes , it is , and Camel instructed the shows producers in how cigarettes should be depicted .
Many years after the series faded from popular memory , TV historian Erik Barnouw found an old mimeographed set of instructions from MAC 's producers on how to deal with various themes , including cigarette smoking .
He summarized the document in his classic tome Tube of Plenty : The Evolution of American Television .
Because smoking was integral to the show , it had to be managed .
First and foremost , the instructions told the program 's writers which characters could not puff on coffin nails .
" Do not have the heavy or any disreputable person smoking a cigarette , " the memo warned .
" Do not associate the smoking of cigarettes with undesirable scenes or situations , plot - wise . "
Actors should smoke cigarettes gracefully , the instructions continued , without even a hint of agitation .
No character should ever smoke one to " calm his nerves , " it dictated .
Other verbotens : arson should not take place on Man Against Crime .
This might remind viewers of the fire risks posed by cigarettes .
And no one could cough on the program , obviously .
Camel 's people had " already heard rumors about impending research that would suggest cigarettes , when used as instructed , kill people , " so the show was told to portray doctors in " the most commendable light , " to keep from irritating them .
This sort of thing had been a staple of radio , and continued for years on TV ( there 's a reason they 're called " soap operas " ) .
By the dawn of our century , product placement had retreated a bit .
Used in the background of shows like American Idol , products like Coke were still present , especially in " reality " - style shows .
In scripted dramas , which still employed teams of writers who ( sometimes ) felt bad about all this shilling , the way forward was to ironically acknowledge the placement , mocking the practice while at the same time benefitting from it .
One could see this approach on hip , quirky shows like Arrested Development and 30 Rock .
Arrested Development enjoys Burger King ( and a side of winking irony )
But Modern Family reminds us what TV can become when a promising show is taken over wholesale by advertisers .
Not everyone likes the reminder .
Consumer groups have argued for years about tougher standards for disclosure .
Back in 1989 , for instance , the Center for Science in the Public Interest told the FCC that it should require " a conspicuous disclosure every time a paid product placement is depicted . "
Simply slapping a corporate name into the end credits was said to be inadequate .
In 2008 , the FCC returned to this issue with its embedded advertising proceeding .
In public comments , groups like Commercial Alert asked for the same thing : " simultaneous disclosure " of embedded placements .
" Product placement advertisements should be disclosed at the time they occur , " the group wrote , " with the word ' advertisement ' appearing on screen during the airing of a product placement . "
This would probably kill the market for placement , especially in scripted drama , but Commercial Alert said that such notices were crucial .
To skeptics who argued that most people know a product placement when they see one , Commercial Alert responded that it is just not true .
The advertising industry likes embedded ads , they charged , precisely because TV viewers do n't mentally filter them out like commercials .
Placements often portray what consumers see as an " authentic use of a product . "
Such placements rely by definition on " deception , " said the group .
The downside of DVRs
Technology was one of the forces that brought us this 30 minute iPad commercial — specifically , the DVR .
Back in 2002 , an FCC report recognized that DVRs would put pressure on broadcasters as viewers started skipping commercials .
" If , as expected , integrated PVRs become popular , broadcasters must find additional revenue streams , " said the report , " Proactive advertising companies , for example , are already looking at future opportunities within sponsorship and product placement .
Increasingly , marketers are shouldering production expenses in return for benefits or rewards that may include product placement , sponsorships , and in some cases , sweepstakes ....
One reason television and cable networks are chasing such partnerships is to help offset rising production costs in a weak advertising environment .
These networks are eager to capitalize on the fastgrowing demand from marketers to push beyond the limits of traditional commercials . "
Produce a sucky , skip - worthy ad and pay through the nose ; produce something that grabs DVR viewers and get a big discount .
Translation : if people skip ads , we 'll make the ads unskippable !
This was n't a problem for libertarian - leaning think tanks like the Progress and Freedom Foundation .
In 2008 , the group submitted comments to the FCC arguing that " the ' harm ' posited by the Notice is an imaginative fiction — a fiction driven entirely by the paternalistic view that an enlightened few , who happen to be ensconced on the 8th floor of a federal building in Southwest DC , see the truth while the public at large is made up of mindless sheep being duped at every turn by advertisers .
In fact , of course , those who hold this view are themselves victims of the so - called ' third - person effect ' : ' People tend to think that other people are fooled by what they themselves understand perfectly . '
A rich literature exists on the myriad ways in which the third - person effect has predicated calls for speech controls and media regulation . "
" In fact , of course ... " !
But this is n't at all obvious to groups like Commercial Alert , which complain that most viewers do n't watch end credits , do n't notice the " promotional consideration " disclosure , and may not be aware of many subtle product placements embedded in their TV shows .
One might expect that such critics would actually be pleased by Modern Family 's approach , which in eschewing subtlety leaves not doubt in the viewer 's mind that the show has been sponsored .
In any event , the FCC still has interest in this area .
Next week , the agency hosts an public seminar by Duke professor Kenneth Wilbur called " Effects of Advertising and Product Placement On Television Audiences . "
What will Wilbur say ?
It 's not a surprise ; his new research paper makes it clear .
Wilbur 's idea is to keep the current 30 - second ad format but make it more efficient .
Right now , such ads shed DVR viewers , who reach immediately for the 30 - second skip button .
Wilbur did research quantifying this audience loss and suggests that the best strategy is for networks to reward advertisers who put out better ads , rather than charging everyone a similar rate to advertise on a particular show .
" For example , an ad creative could be vetted by an online consumer panel or inserted into network programming online ( e.g. , on Hulu.com ) , and observed viewer reactions would be used to measure viewer response to the ad , " he writes .
" Given enough consumers in the panel and a standard approach toward testing creatives , a formula could be devised to adjust the advertiser ’s price .
The attraction of this idea is that it would give advertisers an increased incentive to produce engaging advertising , and could possibly correct the currently unpriced externality in which an ad ’s audience loss harms subsequent advertisers in the commercial break . "
Produce a sucky , skip - worthy ad and pay through the nose ; produce something that grabs DVR viewers and get a big discount .
Even if successful , such approaches wo n't kill product placement , which has existed for as long as television has .
But anything which keeps placement to a discreet minimum and allows TV shows to maintain some semblance of editorial integrity sounds like a better approach to us than a return to the bad old days of advertiser - controlled content .

Will survey results and straw poll victories spur Congressman to run ?
Steve Watson

Wednesday , April 14th , 2010
A major national poll of voters has found that a hypothetical 2012 election race between president Obama and Texas Congressman Ron Paul results in an almost dead heat .
The Rasmussen survey of likely voters finds Obama with 42 % support and Paul with 41 % of the vote .
Eleven percent ( 11 % ) say they prefer a different candidate , with 6 % declaring themselves undecided .
Though there are mixed feelings about the Congressman among Republican voters , independent voters , those not affiliated with either major party , give Paul a 47 % to 28 % edge over the president .
According to Rasmussen , 39 % of all voters have a favorable opinion of Paul , while 30 % view him unfavorably .
This includes 10 % with a very favorable opinion and 12 % with a very unfavorable one .
Twenty six percent ( 26 % ) of GOP voters think Paul shares the values of most Republican voters throughout the nation , while 25 % disagree .
Forty - nine percent ( 49 % ) are not sure .
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
Thirty - four percent ( 34 % ) of nationwide voters see the Congressman as a new direction for the GOP , according to the poll .
At the weekend , the Congressman virtually tied with Mitt Romney in a GOP leadership 2012 straw poll at the Southern Republican Leadership Conference .
Romney received 439 votes to Paul ’s 438 .
Paul trounced Sarah Palin and Newt Gingrich who received 330 and 321 votes respectively .
Despite this the mainstream media ran with headlines akin to “ Romney defeats Palin in straw poll ” , completely ignoring Ron Paul and his supporters .
Prior to the SRLC poll , in February , Paul walked away with the most support for a 2012 presidential bid in a straw poll at the Conservative Political Action Conference .
The Congressmen attracted 31 percent of the vote .
The results of the survey and the straw polls are sure to spur Ron Paul supporters to renew calls for the Congressman to mount a presidential run in 2012 .
In recent months Paul has said that he does not plan to repeat his 2008 campaign , dubbed the “ Ron Paul Revolution ” by supporters .
At the height of the campaign in late 2007 , the Congressman smashed the all - time record for political donations on one day , beating John Kerry ’s previous effort as he hauled in over $ 6 million dollars during a 24 - hour period that coincided with the 234th anniversary of the Boston Tea Party .
Indeed , as we have continuously highlighted , The Tea Party movement , originally Libertarian in origin , grew out of this trend of honouring the anniversary of the Boston Tea Party .
An event held in 2006 was repeated in 2007 with the Ron Paul Money bomb , and the movement evolved from there over the following three years .
Whether neocon and corporate Republicans like it or not , Ron Paul has had and continues to have a far reaching impact upon the direction of the party .
Every intelligible thing that Sarah Palin has said regarding limited government , fiscal economic policy and the restoration of freedom is taken straight from the Ron Paul handbook .
The core difference between Paul and Palin is that the Congressman has built a real grass roots following over the course of several decades .
Paul is the real deal , while Palin , Romney and Gingrich , on the other hand are all neocons at the core , supporting the invasion and occupation of sovereign nations in step with the grossly bloated empire building military industrial complex .
Never pandering to the crowds , Paul has consistently hammered home this key difference , once again doing so last weekend at the SRLC .
Of the current crop of possible 2012 GOP presidential candidates , Ron Paul is once again the only one truly in step with the majority anti-war , anti-big government sentiment in America .

Rome , Italy ( CNN ) -- Italian officials are investigating reports that an infant survived an abortion , living for " a whole day " after having been left to die by hospital staff , the Italian Ministry of Health said .
The " premature newborn ... survived an abortion at 22 weeks of pregnancy , " the ministry said , citing " media reports . "
Pregnancy normally lasts about 40 weeks .
" If the news turns out to be true , we are dealing with a very grave case of ... abandonment of a premature newborn , probably also with some form of handicap : an act which is contrary to the sense of human piety and to any medical practice , " the ministry said in a statement released Monday , two days after the abortion was performed .
The Rev. Antonio Martello , a hospital chaplain , discovered that the infant was still alive on Sunday , 20 hours after the abortion , according to the assistant bishop of Rossano , where the incident took place .
Martello was praying in front of the infant when he saw that it was breathing , according to the assistant bishop , the Rev. Santo Battaglia .
Martello immediately alerted doctors , who took the baby to a bigger hospital in the nearby town of Consenza , Battaglia said .
It died there hours later .
Italian law allows women to have abortions past week 20 of a pregnancy if the fetus appears to show defects , or if the physical or mental health of the mother requires it .
The Roman Catholic Church opposes abortion .
Three separate investigations are looking into the incident .
Local health authorities are holding one inquiry to determine if the mother 's health was really at risk , exactly how many weeks pregnant she was , how long the baby lived , and if the doctors were negligent , the head of that investigation told CNN .
That investigation started Monday and is ongoing , its leader , Dr. Arcangelo Fonti , said .
Separately , legal authorities in Rossano are investigating the incident as a possible manslaughter .
Their probe will include an autopsy to determine how developed the baby 's lungs were , which should help determine its exact age , a health ministry representative said on behalf of under - secretary Eugenia Roccella , who handles medical - ethical issues for the department .
The health ministry 's own investigation will start Monday to determine if abortion law was breached , and will take the findings of the other two probes into account , the ministry representative said .
You know , there are these two guys working in broad daylight on Bundler , Yehuda and Carl ( he ’s the one in the sidecar ) , but I do n’t think people have really grasped the importance of what they are doing .
Bundler is just as mind blowing a development for Rails 3 as any other change in the Rails framework .
As the wycats states ; “ Bundler manages an application ’s dependencies through it ’s entire life across many machines systematically and repeatably ” .
To me , bundler takes the guess work out of dependency management , it simply provides you with a way to know what gems you are distributing with your application , we ( as a Ruby community ) have never had such a comprehensive solution to gem management before .
But like any new tool , it is going to go through some growing pains .
To my surprise , ( and the credit of the authors ) the growing pains have been short and sharp , rapidly fixed as bundler grows to whole new levels of reliability .
And also like any new tool , it is optimised for certain environments , in bundler ’s case , USE RVM !
If you are not using RVM and you are running multiple rubies with Bundler , honestly , you ’re mad .
Do yourself a favour , download RVM and use it .
You can then specify sand boxes of gem sets for each ruby or application you have , goodbye incompatible gems conflicting with each other .
To give you a taste of just how awesome the Bundle RVM marriage is , check this out :
After you install RVM , go into the directory of each app you want to have their own private gem sets and create a file called .rvmrc and put in there :
rvm ruby - 1.8.7@railsplugins
Which is what I have on my RailsPlugins.org repository .
Then change into the directory , and RVM will tell you it does n’t know about the gemset :
$ cd railsplugins Gemset ' railsplugins ' does not exist , rvm gemset create ' railsplugins ' first .
OK , so go ahead and create the gemset and have a look at what gems you have installed :
$ rvm gemset create ' railsplugins ' Gemset ' railsplugins ' created .
$ gem list *** LOCAL GEMS *** $ ruby - v ruby 1.8.7 ( 2010-01- 10 patchlevel 249 ) [ i686-darwin10.2.0 ]
Good … see ?
A clean ruby 1.8.7 , as if you just bought the computer .
Now go ahead and install bundler for this clean gemset :
$ gem install -- no - rdoc -- no - ri bundler Successfully installed bundler - 0.9.14 1 gem installed
Cool , now all that we have left is to give bundler the reins and tell it to do what it does best :
$ bundle install < lots of output >
Now when you gem list for that directory you will get all the gems in your gem file , and when you move to a different directory ( with a different .rvmrc ) all your gems get magically switched out for the new set .
Honestly , with the number of different clients I am coding for and the number of libraries I am working on , I ca n’t imagine being any where near as productive without the RVM and bundler team .
Yehuda has made a fairly comprehensive guide to bundler at the Gem Bundler site which you should read through and understand , and I have only brushed the surface of RVM , you should check it out as well at the RVM site

Just to emphasize the partisan split at the SEC , first reported by Bloomberg , we now know that NO republican voted to go after Goldman Sachs ( GS ) .
Among the SEC's Republicans : Kathleen Casey , a George W. Bush appointee who previously worked for Sen.
Richard Shelby , a somewhat populist , anti-bank Republican .
Bottom line : elephants love the squid .

Using Clojure to Connect to GMail via IMAP
I had to dig through quite a few docs to get a couple of raw emails from my IMAP account so I am posting the snippet for future reference .
I have uploaded necessary jars to clojars under the group org.clojars.nakkaya.javax.mail , in case anyone wants to play with it .
( ns gmail.core ( :use clojure.contrib.java-utils ) ( :import ( javax.mail Session Folder Flags ) ( javax.mail.search FlagTerm ) ( javax.mail Flags$ Flag ) ) ) ( defn store [ protocol server user pass ] ( let [p ( as- properties [ [ " mail.store.protocol " protocol ] ] ) ] ( doto ( .getStore ( Session / getDefaultInstance p ) protocol ) ( .connect server user pass ) ) ) ) ( def gmail ( store " imaps " " imap.gmail.com " " nurullah@nakkaya.com " " super_secret_pass " ) )
Opening a connection is quite simple , we ask for a session instance and connect to the store ( IMAP server in JavaMail lingo ) .
( defn folders ( [ s ] ( folders s ( .getDefaultFolder s ) ) ) ( [s f ] ( let [ sub ? #( if ( = 0 ( bit - and ( .get Type % ) Folder / HOLDS_FOLDERS ) ) false true ) ] ( map #( cons ( .get Name % ) ( if ( sub ? % ) ( folders s % ) ) ) ( . list f ) ) ) ) )
Now that the connection to the store is ready , we need to get a list of folders ( Labels in GMail ) , to get a list of folders , first get the users default folder , that will give us the top level folders we recursively check each folder for sub folders returning a list of all folders and subfolders .
gmail.core= > ( folders gmail ) ( ( " Fatura " ) ( " INBOX " ) ( " [ Gmail ] " ( " Starred " ) ( " Trash " ) ) ( " clojure " ) ( " compojure " ) ( " firmata - devel " ) ( " help - gnu-emacs " ) ( " ikiteker " ) ( " incanter " ) ( " java - dev " ) ( " jna-users " ) ( " leningen " ) ( " metasploit " ) ( " neurobotics " ) ( " org- mode " ) ( " pen-test " ) ( " ring - clojure " ) )
A folder name and a connection to the store is all that is needed to interact with messages .
( defn messages [s fd & opt ] ( let [fd ( doto ( .get Folder s fd ) ( .open Folder / READ_ONLY ) ) [ flags set ] opt msgs ( if opt ( . search fd ( FlagTerm . ( Flags. flags ) set ) ) ( .getMessages fd ) ) ] ( map #( vector ( .getUID fd % ) % ) msgs ) ) )
Before interacting with a folder we need to open it , either in read only mode or read / write mode .
Without the optional parameters , messages just returns a sequence of messages , optional parameters allows us to search for messages using flags such as seen , deleted etc .
gmail.core= > ( take 3 ( messages gmail " INBOX " ) ) ( [ 8709 #<IMAPMessage com.sun.mail.imap.IMAPMessage@1320a41 > ]
[ 8712 #< IMAPMessage com.sun.mail.imap.IMAPMessage@3f4ebd > ] [ 8713 #< IMAPMessage com.sun.mail.imap.IMAPMessage@4a5c78 > ] ) gmail.core= > ( messages gmail " clojure " Flags $ Flag / SEEN false ) ( [ 11401 #<IMAPMessage com.sun.mail.imap.IMAPMessage@13b5a3a > ]
[ 11402 #< IMAPMessage com.sun.mail.imap.IMAPMessage@1a0b53e > ] )
The whole reason , I came up with this snippet was to get a copy of raw messages , saved using their IMAP UID ,

HTC
Hero owners in Europe will have to wait a bit longer to get their phones bumped up to Android 2.1 .
At an event focusing on Google Maps Navigation ( which hit UK Androids today ) , HTC slipped in the announcement that the upgrade process for all European HTC Hero variants will begin in June .
An initial update will be required to prep the phone for 2.1 , followed shortly after by the OS update .
The Hero has been out for a while running on 1.5 , so owners have been getting restless after updates have been continually delayed .
Of course , we just heard Android 2.1 would be available by the end of April , so that seems to not be the case anymore .
Time will only tell if June eventually becomes July , or August , or Q3 2010 , or who knows with the rate of delays recently .

The Mustache of Understanding :
I ’ve been trying to understand the Tea Party Movement .
Sounds like a lot of angry people who want to get the government out of their lives and cut both taxes and the deficit .
Nothing wrong with that — although one does wonder where they were in the Bush years .
Never mind .
I ’m sure like all such protest movements the Tea Partiers will get their 10 to 20 percent of the vote .
But should the Tea Partiers actually aspire to break out of that range , attract lots of young people and become something more than just entertainment for Fox News , I have a suggestion : Become the Green Tea Party .
I ’d be happy to design the T - shirt logo and write the manifesto .
The logo is easy .
It would show young Americans throwing barrels of oil imported from Venezuela and Saudi Arabia into Boston Harbor .
The manifesto is easy , too : “ We , the Green Tea Party , believe that the most effective way to advance America ’s national security and economic vitality would be to impose a $ 10 “ Patriot Fee ” on every barrel of imported oil , with all proceeds going to pay down our national debt . ”
They were n’t around protesting during the Bush years BECAUSE THE TEA PARTY IS REPUBLICANS .
They do n’t care about the deficit .
They care that a Democrat ( and a black “ Muslim , ” to boot ) , is in the White House .
They do n’t care about fiscal restraint , they care that a Democrat is in the White House .
They do n’t , as some foolishly pretend , care about the Wall Street excesses .
Certainly Cenk
Uyger is not the only one who has noticed that the tea party bubbas could all be shipped to protest HCR , but the big money boys are n’t running the buses to protest Wall Street .
They care that there is a Democrat in the White House .
And those crowds of angry white old people screaming “ keep government out of my medicare ” and waving signs of “ Drill , baby , drill ? ”
They sure as hell do n’t care about the environment and are not going to become some sort of “ Green Tea Party . ”
All they care about is that there is a Democrat in the White House .
In this undated frame grab provided by WLBT TV , Ceara Sturgis is shown in a proof of her desired yearbook photo .
Everyone at Wesson Attendance Center knows Sturgis is gay because she 's never tried to hide it .
But when Sturgis - an honor student , trumpet player and goalie on the school 's soccer team - wanted her senior photograph in a tuxedo used in the 2009 - 10 yearbook , school officials balked .
( ( WLBT TV / Associated Press ) )
A lesbian high school student in Mississippi who fought with education officials over her wish to wear a tuxedo in her yearbook photograph has found herself left out of the book entirely .
Veronica Rodriguez opened the yearbook last week only to find no reference of her daughter Ceara Sturgis , a lesbian and a graduating senior at Wesson Attendance Center in Wesson , Miss .
" They did n't even put her name in it , " Rodriguez told the Jackson Free Press .
" I was so furious when she told me about it .
Ceara started crying and I told her to suck it up .
Is that not pathetic for them to do that ?
Yet again , they have crapped on her and made her feel alienated . "
Back in October 2009 , Sturgis and Rodriguez enlisted the help of the American Civil Liberties Union after officials said Sturgis could not submit a photograph of herself in a tuxedo for the yearbook .
The ACLU wrote a letter demanding that the submitted photo be allowed in , but officials with the Copiah County School District refused .
School district officials have referred to prior legal cases in their decision to refuse the photograph .
Rodriguez said she expected the school district to downplay her daughter 's presence in the yearbook , but not to erase it entirely .
Do you own a pet dog ?
Do you eat meat ?
No , this is n't yet another lecture about how you 're damaging the planet .
It 's a question about morality , and the question is this .
If you had a dog , and it died a natural death , how would you feel about roasting and eating it ?
Utterly revolted ?
You 're not alone .
Yet why the objection ?
Your dog 's dead ; you 're doing it no harm .
It 's deceased , not diseased , so eating it wo n't harm you .
In other cultures people eat dog meat .
It 's nourishing protein : fine with a decent sauce , I 'm told .
To most westerners these arguments make no difference .
Eating your dog is an abomination , end of story .
It 's an instant judgment , unimpressed by the lack of harm , impervious to reason .
Both secular and religious teachings struggle to make sense of such oddities of moral decision - making .
Meanwhile , different cultures are perennially revolted by each others ' customs .
The profound moral instincts which stop us eating dead pets are fuelled by the emotion of disgust .
We do n't like to dwell on that feeling – it 's disgusting !
– but it 's hugely important to our moral lives .
Physically , disgust keeps us healthy by steering us away from sources of infection .
It warns of dangers we can't see : pathogens and poisons .
The same signal 's just as effective when it comes to invisible social and moral dangers .
Disgust is contagious .
We catch it easily from others , and it tells us what 's acceptable and what is n't .
Eating chicken : yes .
Eating your pet dog : no , abomination .
That 's the rule our culture happens to follow .
Eating Fido violates the rule and risks your being made a social pariah for having broken the moral code .
It makes you untrustworthy , likely to break other , more important rules .
Disgust , by contrast , keeps you clean and pure , up on the moral high ground .
It thereby protects you from being punished by your community – or worse , being seen as disgusting yourself .
That 's the dark side of disgust : its ability to dehumanise .
Disgust destroys empathy and mutuality , pushing people apart , making any disgusting person very vulnerable .
Psychologist Jonathan Haidt used hypnosis to make people feel disgust without realising why ; their moral judgments became much more severe .
That has major implications .
It 's why politicians who benefit from anti-immigration feeling dwell so much on migrants who do dirty , unpleasant jobs , not on immigrant doctors or academics .
Instincts kick in , and revulsion builds up an impregnable layer of prejudice .
( Or , as we call it when enough of us acquire it , moral principle . )
There 's more .
Disgust , you recall , signals invisible threats , like viruses .
That 's very useful in certain unpleasant kinds of politics , because disgust can make a problem , or an enemy , seem dangerous even when there 's little real danger .
That 's why you 'll find the language of disgust littering the path to every mass killing and genocide in history .
It calls its victims plagues and cancers , rats , cockroaches , filth – with what terrible results we all know .
Revulsion can bring out the worst in human nature .
Disgust can make people good or bad , moral or murderous .
Like other emotions , it can appear incomprehensible or go unrecognised , leaving us at a loss to explain ourselves .
Yet this vulgar reminder of fleshy weakness and corruption is central to what makes us human beings .
We 're social creatures , and morality is inescapably social .
Moral systems , religious and secular , struggle with disgust 's dangerous double - sidedness , but struggle we must : globalisation and burgeoning populations demand we somehow learn to live with this most social of emotions .
Moral judgments draw , of course , on empathy , generosity , loving - kindness .
But they also grow out of disgust .
The two hand - written notes from Apollo 13 crew that show how astronauts saved stricken space mission
These two bits of paper with notes hastily scrawled across them are actually part of the emergency checklist that helped save the crew of the doomed Apollo 13 space mission .
Astronauts marked the cards with critically important instructions after an explosion crippled their craft , prompting the famous ' Houston , we have a problem ' line .
The record is a real time step - by - step account of how the crew set about powering down the craft in order to conserve enough power for them to get back to Earth .
Critical : Two notes written by astronauts on board the stricken Apollo 13 space mission recount the dramatic steps they took to safely return to Earth
Jim Lovell , Fred Haise and Jack Swigert all survived the 1970 mission , which was later made into Hollywood blockbuster Apollo 13 starring Tom Hanks .
The emergency power down checklist was kept by Fred Haise for years afterwards and has now come to light for the first time after being made available for sale .
Described as an ' amazing part of space history ' , it comes with a letter of provenance from Mr Haise and is expect to sell for up to £ 50,000 .
Apollo 13 was Nasa 's third space mission to the moon , but two days after the launch it suffered an oxygen tank explosion which lead to a loss of power , oxygen and heat .
Checklist :
The notes detail in step - by - step detail how the crew powered down their craft to conserve enough power to get home
The crew had to abandon the main command module and use the moon - landing Lunar module as a lifeboat to coast back to Earth .
Nasa experts had to very quickly recalculate the emergency procedures which they later radioed through to the crew .
Haise and Lovell marked the checklist accordingly in black and red pen while in space .
They opened and closed various circuit breakers in order to shut down and conserve battery power and marked on the list ' close ' or ' open ' on the appropriate circuit .
Haise made the first changes 79 hours into the mission and Lovell updated the list as he implemented further changes 82 hours in .
Safe :
The relieved astronauts are rescued after their command module lands in the Pacific Ocean and , right , mission commander Jim Lovell who wrote some of the notes
The Apollo 13 mission was turned into a 1995 Hollywood film starring Tom Hanks as Jim Lovell
Lovell , who commanded the mission , had written a reminder of what antennas should be used when they saw the Earth or the moon in a certain window .
There was also a note reminding him how much time it should take mission control to make a link to the antenna .
In his letter , Haise wrote : ' This sheet played an important part during the emergency conditions of the Apollo 13 flight .
' It is a record of the real time steps the Nasa and industry team developed for us to perform ensuring our safe return to Earth . '
The document was signed by both astronauts when they returned to Earth .
It is being sold by a private space collector , who acquired it from Haise .
Matthew Haley , of Bonhams auctioneers , said : ' The auction features items that hark back to the first golden age of space exploration .
' It serves as a poignant reminder of the precarious state the three astronauts ' lives were in .
' Their survival and safe return to Earth is one of the most celebrated triumphs of 20th century space flight .
' We expect the lot to entice international interest . '
Andrew Currie , a spokesman for the auctioneers , added : ' These are fascinating documents that were right at the heart of the crew 's battle against time to get safely back to Earth .
' In these notes you see the real life drama unfolding line by line . '
It follows the sale of the flight plan for the first moon landing on which astronaut Neil Armstrong wrote his famous phrase ' one small step for A man , one giant leap for mankind ' .
The document , believed to be the only time he ever wrote the phrase , is set to sell at auction for £ 55,000 .
The phrase - one of the most memorable of the 20th Century - has been subject to years of debate over what Armstrong actually meant .
It was inscribed and signed by the Apollo 11 mission leader whilst he was in quarantine and handed to Nasa press officer John McLeaish .
Mr McLeaish later authenticated it and wrote a declaration on the back .
Another new feature that will be available in the upcoming version of IDA Pro is the ability to create and render custom data types and formats .
( Embedded instructions disassembled and rendered along side with x86 code )
What are custom types and formats
Custom data type : A custom type is basically just a way to tag some bytes for later display with custom format , when the built - in IDA types ( dt_byte , dt_word , etc ) are not enough .
For example : an XMM vector , a Pascal string , a half - precision ( 16 bits ) floating - point number , a 16:32 far pointer ( fword ) , uleb128 number and so on .
To define a custom type , you need to provide its name , size ( fixed or dynamically calculated ) , keyword for disassembly and a few other attributes .
For example : an XMM vector , a Pascal string , a half - precision ( 16 bits ) floating - point number , a 16:32 far pointer ( fword ) , uleb128 number and so on .
To define a custom type , you need to provide its name , size ( fixed or dynamically calculated ) , keyword for disassembly and a few other attributes .
Custom data format :
The custom data format allows you do display a custom or built - in data type in any way you like .
You can register several formats for each type and switch the representation .
For example , you might want to switch the display of the same 16 - byte XMM vector between four floats or two doubles .
A format definition includes callback for printing ( to display ) and scanning ( used during debugging to change the register values ) .
For example , here is a custom MAKE_DWORD format applied to the built - in dword type :
Its implementation is very simple :
Next we illustrate some possible usages of custom types and formats .
Other uses are also possible too , it is up to your imagination .
Decoding embedded bytecodes
Imagine you are debugging an x86 program that implements its own VM and embeddes them in the program .
The classical solution for this problem can be :
Write a dedicated processor module and then load the extracted bytecodes separately
Or define the bytecodes as bytes and then use comments to describe the real meaning of those bytecodes .
With this new addition , one can just write a custom data type to handle the situation :
And if you happen to have a situation where the bytecodes are operands to instructions ( as means of obfuscation ) , you can still apply the custom format on those operands :
The previous blog entry showed how to write processor modules using Python .
What if one simply uses the “ import ” statement to import a full - blown processor module script and use it in the custom data types / formats ? 😉
Displaying resource strings
When reversing MS Windows applications , one can encounter string IDs , but then how to easily and nicely go fetch the data and display it in the disassembly listing ?
Normally , one would have to use a resource editor to extract the string value corresponding to the string id , then to create an enum in IDA for each string ID with a repeatable comment :
That works , but what about writing your own custom format instead :
And then applying it directly without having to use a resource editor to extract the string value , have the custom format do that programmatically for you :
This is how a resource string custom format handler can look like :
To take a closer look at it , you can download the custom data type handler script along with the source code of the simplevm assembler / disassembler and the C program that was used in this article .
Enlarge By Eppo Eerkes Jamaican musher Newton Marshall begins his first Iditarod on Saturday .
Newton Marshall trained for sled - dog racing with stray mutts pulling a sled on wheels through the streets of Jamaica .
Now he 's poised to begin the grueling Iditarod race across the snow - streaked interior of Alaska , where he faces fierce weather and competition from a world - class field of 70 other mushers .
The Iditarod starts Saturday in Anchorage and will cover more than 1,100 miles .
The hope among Marshall 's supporters is that he will inspire others who might see his accomplishments and believe they can also do great things .
Singer Jimmy Buffett is among Marshall 's strongest supporters .
" He 's absolutely a hero to kids in Jamaica , " Buffett said .
Buffett 's Margaritaville restaurants are key sponsors for Marshall 's dog-sled team , and the famed songwriter says he did not hesitate to back Marshall after learning of his story .
Buffett first heard of the Jamaican after meeting Danny Melville , who runs a family - owned tour business in Jamaica where Marshall was employed as a guide .
" I thought from the beginning it was just very cool what he was doing , " Buffett said .
" I thought it was so far out there , but it made people smile when they heard about it . "
Marshall , who turned 27 Tuesday , once trained with mutts from the Jamaica Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals but now runs with some of the best dogs from three - time Iditarod champion Lance Mackey 's kennel .
Marshall has been training with Mackey in Alaska in recent months .
During previous races over the last two years , the Jamaican 's mettle has been tested .
" He works very , very hard at his craft , " says Chas St. George , spokesman for the Iditarod .
" He ran the 2009 Yukon Quest , and as a rookie he finished that race .
It 's a 1,000 - mile race .
Many rookies who later on in their careers have run all kinds of races have failed to finish that particular race . "
Marshall became the first Jamaican to finish the Yukon Quest , coming in 13th out of a field of 29 mushers .
His journey to the Iditarod began in Edmonton , where Melville was looking for dune buggies for his tourism business .
He spotted a sled with wheels , " and I thought , we could do that , we 've got thousands of dogs in Jamaica that have no home , " Melville says .
In Jamaica , Marshall was guiding tours and met Shelly Kennedy , a retired school principal from Michigan who moved to Jamaica with her husband .
She taught Marshall to read during tutoring sessions after his workday ended .
When Hurricane Ivan threatened Jamaica , Kennedy fled her home with jewelry , cash and other belongings .
" All Newton took was his books , " she says .
" He 's motivated , and I think that 's the main thing with him . "
Melville met Buffett in 2005 and told him about the dog sled on wheels .
Buffett recalls how tears came to his eyes when he watched a documentary film about Marshall .
" He has some kind of fortitude that is unexplainable , " Buffett says .
In the run-up to the Iditarod , Marshall says he 's been listening to reggae music while sledding near Fairbanks .
His favorite artist is Jamaican Buju Banton .
" One of his songs — All Will Be Fine — that one touched me to the bone , " Marshall said .
He loves the lyrics : " Today you 're down , comes tomorrow Chances of rising again seems hollow Doubt may be in your mind oh , oh give it time And all will be fine . "
Marshall is somewhat concerned about the cold , given that frostbite attacked his nose during a previous race .
As the Iditarod approaches , though , " I do n't see any big worries .
I just can't wait to get there , " he says .
" I 'm planning on finishing the race . "

Healthy Skepticism among News Executives about Government Subsidies
Good to see so many media industry executives expressing skepticism about the idea of government subsidies for the press .
Danny Glover brought to my attention this new survey by the Pew Research Center ’s Project for Excellence in Journalism in association with the American Society of News Editors ( ASNE ) and the Radio Television Digital News Association ( RTDNA ) .
It revealed that , “ Fully 75 % of all news executives surveyed — and 88 % of newspaper executives — said they had ‘ serious reservations , ’ or the highest level of concern , about direct subsidies from the government . ”
A smaller percentage ( only 46 % ) had serious reservations about tax credits for news organizations , then again , only 13 % said they “ would welcome such funding ” and just 6 % said they were “ enthusiastic ” about it .
This is encouraging news as many government officials at the FCC , FTC , and in Congress are currently considering whether government should steps to prop up failing media entities or promote certainly types of content .
Berin Szoka and I have been working on a series of essays about the wrong ways to go about reinventing media [ see Part 1 , Part 2 ] and plan several more installments leading up to a big filing in the FCC ’s “ Future of Media ” proceeding ( the deadline is May 7th ) .
Here ’s a chart from the Pew survey illustrating funding alternatives and the percentage who had “ serious reservations ” about each option :
At the Southern Republican Leadership Conference in New Orleans yesterday , former disgraced House speaker Newt Gingrich , a twice - divorced Catholic convert who now touts “ America ’s Godly heritage ” as the solution to the country ’s woes , declared that President Barack Obama ’s administration to be a “ secular , socialist regime ” and “ the most radical administration in U.S. history . ”
While Gingrich was in New Orleans , David Barton , who serves on the board of Gingrich ’s Renewing American Leadership ( ReAL ) , appeared on Glenn Beck ’s program to promote his theocratic claims about constitutional history and the intent of the founders .
In a statement promoting Barton ’s appearance on the program , ReAL maintained ( emphasis in original ) :
David ’s appearance builds on the mission of ReAL .
We work to protect our God -given freedoms in Washington , D.C. and around the country .
Educating Americans is critical to preserving those freedoms and spreading the truth about our Judeo - Christian heritage .
Charles Johnson , the conservative blogger now considered a heretic by the right and by Beck himself , wrote after last night ’s appearance :
Beck ’s show today featured a full hour promoting the agenda of extreme fundamentalist / creationist / theocrat David Barton of Wallbuilders , one of the main forces behind the recent outrageous historical revisionism perpetrated by the Texas State Board of Education .
Barton and Beck are old pals , with Barton headlining Beck ’s recent “ American Revival ” events .
Will Bunch reported for the Philadelphia Daily News from the Florida revival :
But from the stage , the seven - hour event was little about Obama – and a lot about God .
The kickoff speaker was David Barton – a leader in the recent fight to push conservative and Christian themes into Texas textbooks – and Beck ’s own stage appearances , including a long closing speech , were larded with references to finding Jesus and his 12 - step recovery from alcoholism in the 1990s .
Gingrich and Barton have long traversed the country promoting that “ Godly heritage ” — in fact , the idea for ReAL was hatched at the secretive Pastors ’ Policy Briefings held in various states during the 2008 presidential campaign season .
The purpose of the briefings was , according to David Lane , one of the organizers , the “ mobilization of pastors and pews to restore America to her Judeo - Christian heritage .
That ’s our goal . ”
Her name is Anna Paquin , she ’s bisexual , and yes , she gives a damn .
In a new public service announcement to spread awareness for hate crimes , provided by the Cyndi Lauper - backed organization We Give a Damn , the “ True Blood ” actress revealed her sexuality along with a host of other celebrities , gay and straight .
Paquin , who is currently engaged to her “ True Blood ” co-star Stephen Moyer , joined Wanda Sykes , Elton John , and Whoopi Goldberg to encourage others to speak up on the need for equality .
And those are far from the only A - listers attached to the project .
In a separate PSA , featuring Jason Mraz , Kim Kardashian and Cynthia Nixon , Paquin says , “ imagine going to work everyday and not being able to share your life with your co-workers out of fear of being let go . ”

Learning basic motorcycle operation is similar to learning how to drive .
Both can be a little intimidating at first .
But if you approach riding a motorcycle with care and caution , you can make the learning process less intimidating .
Once you 've settled on the type of motorcycle you want to ride , purchased adequate safety gear , including a well - fitting helmet , and taken care of licensing and insurance , you 're almost ready to ride .
While there is no substitute for a Motorcycle Safety Foundation course , these 10 tips will help reinforce what you learn .
01 of 10 Before You Get Started Hero Images / Getty Images
Make sure to give your motorcycle a thorough inspection before hitting the road .
Let the Motorcycle Safety Foundation 's acronym for their checklist , T - CLOCS , guide you .
You want to make sure the following are in good working order , and not just the first time you hit the road but every time you go for a ride .
T : Tires and wheels
C : Controls , including levers , pedal , cables , hoses , and throttle
L : Lights , including battery , headlights , turn signals , mirrors , etc .
O : Oil fluid levels
C : Chassis , including the frame , suspension , chain , etc .
S : Stands , including the center stand and / or kickstand
02 of 10 Safety Gear Hero Images / Getty Images
Even at parking - lot speeds , it 's easy to seriously scrape yourself up in a motorcycle accident .
Make sure you 're protected by wearing as much safety gear as possible , including gloves , armored clothing , and boots .
Even if you do n't live in one of the states that require some or all motorcycle riders to wear a helmet , it 's always a good idea to wear one .
Once you 're dressed for the part , you 're ready to get on the bike . ​
03 of 10 Mounting the Motorcycle Getting on a bike can be a great test of flexibility , but do n't let this stage intimidate you .
This is the most you 'll have to bend your body during the riding process .
© Basem Wasef
Depending on how tall you are , mounting a motorcycle can be awkward the first couple times you do it .
With a bit of practice , this will soon be second nature .
Stand on the left side of your bike with your knees slightly bent and your weight centered over your legs .
Reach over and grab the right handle with your right hand , then place your left hand on the left handle so that you 're slightly leaning toward the front of the bike .
To mount the bike , shift your weight onto your left leg , then kick your right leg back and then up and over the bike .
Be careful to lift your leg high , or it might get caught before reaching the other side of the bike .
Once you 're straddling the bike , sit down and acquaint yourself with the motorcycle 's controls .
Note the foot peg position and the location of turn signals , horn , and lights .
Remember to make sure your mirrors are adjusted — you 'll rely on them quite a bit while riding .
04 of 10 Throttle and Brakes tillsonburg / Getty Images
When riding a motorcycle , your right hand is responsible for two crucial functions : acceleration and braking .
By twisting the grip toward you ( so that your wrist moves down ) , you apply the throttle .
A little twist goes a long way , so be delicate with this control because revving the engine can lead to instability or cause the front wheel to leave the pavement .
Your right hand also controls the front brakes , whose lever is located in front of the throttle , much like on a bicycle .
Smoothness is crucial here as well .
Yank the brake lever too hard , and the front brakes can lock up , causing the bike to skid and even crash .
Though most brake levers only require two fingers to operate , some require you to use your entire hand .
Your right foot , meanwhile , controls the rear brake .
Which brake is the best to use ?
Safety experts say that , in most situations , gently applying the rear brake first , then easing off and slowly applying the front brake is the most effective means of stopping .
But braking safely also depends on the kind of bike you 're riding .
If you 're on a sport bike , you may be able to get away with just using your front brake most of the time .
If you 're on a heavy cruiser , you 'll rely more on your rear brake .
05 of 10 Clutch
The top half of the image shows a two - fingered clutch technique ( which is common with sportbikes ) , while the lower half shows a four - fingered technique that is usually employed with other types of bikes .
© Basem Wasef
The clutch is the lever just ahead of the left - hand grip .
Most sport bikes require only two - fingered operation .
Touring , cruising , and other motorcycles often require the whole hand to grab the lever .
The clutch on a motorcycle does the same thing that a car 's clutch does ; it engages and disengages the transmission and engine .
When you squeeze the clutch lever , you 're effectively putting the bike in neutral ( even if the shifter is in a gear ) .
When you let go , you 're engaging the engine and transmission .
Practice pulling the clutch with your left hand slowly .
Imagine it 's a dial with a range of power , rather than an on / off rocker switch , and you 'll be able to engage gears more smoothly .
06 of 10 Shifting Stephan Zabel / Getty Images Motorcycles shift differently than cars .
While operating on the same principle , motorcycle shifts are executed by moving a lever up or down with the left foot .
A typical shift pattern , called " one down , five up , " looks like this : Sixth gear ( if applicable )
Fifth gear
Fourth gear
Third gear
Second gear
Neutral
First gear Finding neutral with your left foot takes some getting used to .
Practice by clicking the shifter back and forth ; look for a green " N " to light up on the gauges .
While some motorcycles can be shifted without using the clutch , make it a habit of using the clutch every time you shift .
As with the manual transmission on a car , begin by disengaging the clutch , then shift gears and slowly re-engage the clutch .
Feathering the throttle with the clutch adds smoothness to the shifting process .
Be sure not to over - rev in each gear and to shift before the engine starts to work too hard .
07 of 10 Starting the Motorcycle Thomas Barwick / Getty Images Unless you own a vintage motorcycle , your bike has an electronic ignition that makes starting the engine as easy as starting a car .
Your bike wo n't start unless the kill switch is in the " On " position , so flip it down before you turn the key ( the kill switch is usually a red rocker switch operated by the right thumb ) .
Next , turn the key to the " Ignition " position , which is typically to the right .
Make sure you 're in neutral , then use your right thumb to push the start button , which is typically located below the kill switch and marked by a logo of a circular arrow surrounding a lightning bolt .
Many bikes require you to disengage the clutch while you start the engine .
This is simply a precaution to prevent the bike from accidentally lurching forward because it 's in gear .
As you hold the start button , the engine will turn over and start to idle .
Carbureted bikes might need a slight twist of the throttle as the engine turns over in order to get fuel into the cylinders .
Fuel - injected bikes do n't need this .
08 of 10 Warming Up the Engine Basem Wasef
The practice of warming up car engines has largely become obsolete , but warming up a motorcycle engine is still a crucial part of the riding ritual , particularly when a bike is carbureted .
Doing so ensures that the engine will provide smooth , consistent power as you begin your ride .
You should idle for anywhere from 45 seconds to several minutes , depending on factors such as ambient temperature , engine displacement , and oil capacity .
Use the temperature gauge as a general guide , and avoid revving the engine .
09 of 10 The Kickstand or Centerstand Basem Wasef Most modern bikes automatically shut off if the kickstand is still down when the bike is put into gear .
If your bike is n't equipped with this feature , make sure you retract the kickstand by literally kicking it up with your left foot and allowing it to tuck underneath the underbody of the bike .
Not doing so can be a serious safety hazard .
Center stands , mounted beneath the motorcycle , require the bike to be rocked forward .
Stand to the left of the bike , place your left hand on the left handle and straighten the front tire .
Place your right foot on the center stand 's tang to make sure it 's flush on the ground , then push your bike gently forward .
The center stand should then click and pop up .
De sus 56 años , 28 los había vivido en México .
De aquí es su esposa y aquí nacieron sus dos hijos .
Vivía en la ciudad norteña de Chihuahua , donde era dueño de varios aparcamientos .
Y fue en la puerta de uno de sus garajes , llamado King Kong , donde tres desconocidos lo asesinaron el miércoles de varios disparos a bocajarro .
Se llamaba Joan Sarroca Punsola .
Había nacido en Vall de Cardós , un pueblo de Lleida .
No se sabe mucho más .
De hecho , la embajada de España en México ha reconocido hoy no tener ni un dato más de los publicados por los diarios del estado de Chihuahua .
Y los diarios de Chihuahua no tienen tiempo de indagar demasiado en las circunstancias ni en los porqués .
Tampoco la policía .
Porque , sólo en las últimas horas , en el estado norteño al que pertenece Ciudad Juárez - la ciudad más violenta de México y tal vez del mundo- fueron asesinadas 16 personas .
Dieciséis más que añadir a las 530 que han muerto de forma violenta desde que empezó el año .
O a los más de 5.000 caídos en ese rincón de la frontera con Estados Unidos desde que , hace tres años , el presidente Felipe Calderón declarara una guerra frontal al narcotráfico que ya ha causado 18.000 muertes en todo el país .
¿ Tendrá que ver el asesinato de Joan con el narcotráfico ?
Tal vez sí , pero no porque el empresario de origen catalán estuviese metido en algún negocio turbio .
Más bien porque los carteles de la droga ya no solo se dedican a introducir cocaína y marihuana a la Unión Americana , sino a extorsionar a cualquier empresario , por pequeño o grande que sea .
A los que no pagan el llamado aquí " derecho de piso " , la licencia de la mafia para seguir operando , les sucede en muchos casos lo que a Joan Sarroca Punsola .
Unos disparos a bocajarro , una camioneta huyendo del lugar y unos investigadores que apenas tienen tiempo de colocar unos triángulos amarillos junto a los casquillos de bala antes de marcharse a toda prisa hacia la escena de otro crimen .
Diez , quince o veinte al día ...
Joan Sarroca , según los pocos datos que han trascendido sobre su vida en el norte de México , estaba tan integrado en la ciudad que formaba parte de la unión de Comerciantes del Centro , a los que representaba en un proyecto de Movilidad Urbana .
Será enterrado en Chihuahua .
Sean Lind over at Positively Nerd Street did a nice writeup on Excel formatting tips and tricks for poker players .
Because yes , even in this era of PokerTracker and Hold 'em Manager goodness , Excel still has its uses :
Tracking live play .
Graphing PokerTracker data .
So I thought I 'd pick up on that theme and talk about an interesting PokerTracker +
Excel graph I put together a while back , which gets to the heart of one of the major problems facing online poker today : the prevalence of short - stacked " nit " multitablers in today 's games .
Here 's a graph of player VP$ IP vs. PFR in the $ 1/ $ 2 NLH games on one of the major sites ; does n't matter which one ; all major online poker sites show the same pattern , as anybody can verify for themselves by heading over to PokerTableRatings.com and downloading a couple million hands , as I did .
[ Update : Somebody just emailed me asking " hey , forget about your rant , but how do I build a graph like that ? "
Stay tuned and I 'll show you one of several ways to graph any PokerTracker data set .
The Subscribe button is to your left . :) ]
[ Update : Several people have complained that a couple major online poker sites recently changed their formats specifically to address this problem .
I mentioned this below , but it 's sort of secondary to the point , which is that the MT effect is a natural " phenomenon " that happens in any poker economy whenever the conditions are right : widespread multitabling , wide range of legal buy - ins for a given table , and volume - based " player points " . ]
For those of you who do n't have the PokerTracker database schema or statistical reference guide tattooed to the back of your eyelids , interpret the graph as follows :
Each player is a dot .
The vertical axis measures the frequency with which the player raises preflop ( PFR ) .
The horizontal axis measures the frequency with which the player voluntarily puts money into the pot preflop ( VP$IP ) .
Those of you who do have the PokerTracker statistical reference guide tattooed to the back of your eyelids will recognize the clustering of tight " nit " players towards the bottom - left of the graph , with VP$IP / PFRs of 10/10 , 12/15 , 14/14 , etc .
Nit city .
Furthermore , these players are drastically under - represented in this graph , because a majority of players who play this way usually play multiple tables .
Which means that when you actually log on to a poker site and start playing , those players are 4 x or 8 x or 12 x or 16 x as common as shown here .
That 's the Monkeytabling Effect—er , Multi-Tabling Effect — in a nutshell .
The Multitabling Effect :
The propensity of players to play ever more tables with ever shorter stacks in order to limit their downside , minimize variance , and maximize the accrual of player points .
Now , different players have different opinions about what the Multitabling Effect 's actual effects are .
Some players even think short - stacked multitabling is good for the game !
View : Playing against uber - tight , uber - aggressive short - stacks is equally profitable , or even more profitable , than playing against " normal " players who buy - in for a respectable amount .
View : Anybody who buys in short - stacked is a fish , therefore , I can take their money .
The first viewpoint is naive .
The second is downright arrogant .
First of all , slick , the guys who are playing 8 x or 12 x tables with a 20 BB short stack are not fish .
You might be a fish .
Those guys are some of the hardest - working people in poker , and they 're mostly playing a solid , strategically sound game .
Second , there are few difficult decisions and no big mistakes in short - stacked poker .
Which is why I have repeatedly and endlessly stated that poker bots are most effective in short - stacked games .
Ad nauseum .
So :
You 've got a bunch of tough angle - shooters who know the game , play eight times your volume , never risk more than 20 BB in a single throw , and are playing a style of poker which gives them fundamental advantages vis-a - vis the medium and large stacks at the table .
And you think you 're going to pay your rent off these guys ?
You think these guys are good for poker , long - term ?
This is why I believe , and others believe , that the Multitabling Effect is a killer of online poker profitability .
( For the players .
For the sites , it may well have the opposite effect — in the short - term . )
Which is why threads like this crop up on TwoPlusTwo and other poker forums all the time :
View : 20 bb minimum tables are destroying the profitability of online poker
Which is also why , when Full Tilt and some other sites recently increased their buy - in minimums on certain tables , it made some players very , very happy .
Because aside from its harmful side - effects : playing against short - stacks is n't a lot of fun .
It 's a great way to leech all the sublety and much of the skill out of the game .
And if you 're accustomed to playing deep , and everybody else is playing short , you 're not really playing deep at all .
Effectively , you 're being forced to play short by fiat , because nobody will pony up and play big - boy poker with you .
Congratulations , you 've just been banished to the realm of dweeb poker :
" Hey , I 've got two high cards .
Do you have two high cards ?
Maybe a pair ?
Let 's put all our money in and see who wins .
ICM says I 'm good here .
Now let 's flirt and be coy and Hollywood about it , even though we 're two grown - ass men playing a $ 0.25 / $ 0.50 game of no-limit Hold 'em 20 BB deep .
Tee - hee ! "
Short - stacked cash games ( tourneys of course work a little differently ) should be a way for new players to get acclimated to the game , not a way for pros and wannabe pros to angle - shoot , maximize their FPPs and VPPs and FTPs , and completely sidestep the elements of large - grained risk and variance which are crucial to a properly functioning game of poker .
And for those who disagree ?
Fear not .
A long and rewarding career in lotto , slots , and bingo awaits , once the rest of us have come to our senses and done what we should 've done from the beginning : enforce mandatory 50 BB or 100 BB minimum buy - ins on all cash game tables except those exclusively earmarked for beginning players .
And if not ?
Then ask not for whom the bell of online poker unprofitability tolls : it tolls for thee .
There have been two features that regularly mark the history of U.S. public schools .
Over the last century , our education system has been regularly captivated by a Big Idea -- a savant or an organization that promised a simple solution to the problems of our schools .
The second is that there are no simple solutions , no miracle cures to those problems .
Education is a slow , arduous process that requires the work of willing students , dedicated teachers and supportive families , as well as a coherent curriculum .
As an education historian , I have often warned against the seductive lure of grand ideas to reform education .
Our national infatuation with education fads and reforms distracts us from the steady work that must be done .
Our era is no different .
We now face a wave of education reforms based on the belief that school choice , test - driven accountability and the resulting competition will dramatically improve student achievement .
Once again , I find myself sounding the alarm that the latest vision of education reform is deeply flawed .
But this time my warning carries a personal rebuke .
For much of the last two decades , I was among those who jumped aboard the choice and accountability bandwagon .
Choice and accountability , I believed , would offer a chance for poor children to escape failing schools .
Testing and accountability , I thought , would cast sunshine on low - performing schools and lead to improvement .
It all seemed to make sense , even if there was little empirical evidence , just promise and hope .
Today there is empirical evidence , and it shows clearly that choice , competition and accountability as education reform levers are not working .
But with confidence bordering on recklessness , the Obama administration is plunging ahead , pushing an aggressive program of school reform -- codified in its signature Race to the Top program -- that relies on the power of incentives and competition .
This approach may well make schools worse , not better .
Those who do not follow education closely may be tempted to think that , at long last , we ’re finally turning the corner .
What could be wrong with promoting charter schools to compete with public schools ?
Why should n’t we demand accountability from educators and use test scores to reward our best teachers and identify those who should find another job ?
Like the grand plans of previous eras , they sound sensible but will leave education no better off .
Charter schools are no panacea .
The nation now has about 5,000 of them , and they vary in quality .
Some are excellent , some terrible ; most are in between .
Most studies have found that charters , on average , are no better than public schools .
On the federal tests , known as the National Assessment of Educational Progress , from 2003 to 2009 , charters have never outperformed public schools .
Nor have black and Latino students in charter schools performed better than their counterparts in public schools .
This is surprising , because charter schools have many advantages over public schools .
Most charters choose their students by lottery .
Those who sign up to win seats tend to be the most motivated students and families in the poorest communities .
Charters are also free to “ counsel out ” students who are unable or unwilling to meet expectations .
A study of KIPP charters in the San Francisco area found that 60 % of those students who started the fifth grade were gone before the end of eighth grade .
Most of those who left were low performers .
Studies of charters in Boston , New York City and Washington have found that charters , as compared to public schools , have smaller percentages of the students who are generally hardest to educate -- those with disabilities and English - language learners .
Because the public schools must educate everyone , they end up with disproportionate numbers of the students the charters do n’t want .
So we ’re left with the knowledge that a dramatic expansion in the number of privately managed schools is not likely to raise student achievement .
Meanwhile , public schools will become schools of last resort for the unmotivated , the hardest to teach and those who did n’t win a seat in a charter school .
If our goal is to destroy public education in America , this is precisely the right path .
Nor is there evidence that student achievement will improve if teachers are evaluated by their students ’ test scores .
Some economists say that when students have four or five “ great ” teachers in a row , the achievement gap between racial groups disappears .
The difficulty with this theory is that we do not have adequate measures of teacher excellence .
Of course , it would be wonderful if all teachers were excellent , but many factors affect student scores other than their teacher , including students ’ motivation , the schools ’ curriculum , family support , poverty and distractions on testing day , such as the weather or even a dog barking in the school ’s parking lot .
The Obama education reform plan is an aggressive version of the Bush administration ’s No Child Left Behind , under which many schools have narrowed their curriculum to the tested subjects of reading and math .
This poor substitute for a well - rounded education , which includes subjects such as the arts , history , geography , civics , science and foreign language , hits low - income children the hardest , since they are the most likely to attend the kind of “ failing school ” that drills kids relentlessly on the basics .
Emphasis on test scores already compels teachers to focus on test preparation .
Holding teachers personally and exclusively accountable for test scores -- a key feature of Race to the Top -- will make this situation even worse .
Test scores will determine salary , tenure , bonuses and sanctions , as teachers and schools compete with each other , survival - of - the - fittest style .
Frustrated by a chronic lack of progress , business leaders and politicians expect that a stern dose of this sort of competition and incentives will improve education , but they are wrong .
No other nation is taking such harsh lessons from the corporate sector and applying them to their schools .
No nation with successful schools ignores everything but basic skills and testing .
Schools work best when teachers collaborate to help their students and strive together for common goals , not when they compete for higher scores and bonuses .
Having embraced the Republican agenda of choice , competition and accountability , the Obama administration is promoting the privatization of large segments of American education and undermining the profession of teaching .
This toxic combination is the latest Big Idea in education reform .
Like so many of its predecessors , it is not likely to improve education .
Diane Ravitch , a historian of education , is the author of “ The Death and Life of the Great American School System : How Testing and Choice Are Undermining Education . ”
In Texas , the party of Jefferson Davis wins
Texas is a red state on the road to becoming a purple state .
The question is whether Gov. Rick Perry ’s easy victory in Tuesday ’s Republican primary will accelerate that trend .
The remarkable thing about the Texas primary is that Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison , whom Perry trounced , came to be seen as some kind of liberal by Texas Republican primary voters .
Hutchison was endorsed by , among others , Vice President Dick Cheney , hardly a friend of the squishy soft left .
Her record is solidly conservative .
But Perry , knowing that voters perceived him as a lackluster governor , knew his only hope was to blast through by using ideological dynamite .
So a man who has been in office for nearly a decade cast himself as an anti-Washington hero and even once suggested that secession was a reasonable course given the policies that President Obama was pushing in Washington .
Not only did Perry do well , but Debra Medina , an extreme right - wing Tea Partier , racked up close to a fifth of the vote .
Perry avoided a runoff with just over half the vote , leaving Hutchison -- well - liked and once the favorite -- with a paltry 30 percent .
How far right can the Republican Party go before it starts losing the more moderate sorts conservatives ?
These are voters who may not like taxes but also do n’t like talk of secession and expect their government to accomplish a few practical things .
That ’s what will be tested this fall .
The Democrats nominated moderate Bill White , the former Mayor of Houston who is perfectly positioned to win votes from non-ideologues in all parties .
Over time , Texas is destined to become less solidly Republican .
The state ’s Latino vote will continue to grow , and newcomers will change the state ’s political character , as they have changed Virginia , North Carolina and Florida , the three southern states carried by Obama in 2008 .
It may still be too early in that transition process for Democrats to expect victory in Texas , but a Perry - White faceoff is about the best matchup Democrats could have hoped for .
It ’s also worth noting an interesting pattern .
Twice now , Bush presidencies have been followed by a reaction on the right .
The first President Bush , a genuinely moderate sort of conservative , raised taxes to balance the budget -- a courageous act -- and alienated the right end of his party .
Republicans became more conservative under the leadership of Newt Gingrich and swept to their 1994 midterm victory .
George W. Bush hoped to learn from his father ’s problems .
He cut taxes and cut them again and tried not to get crosswise with the party ’s right wing .
But now conservatives view even the second Bush as a sellout , and so they move , inexorably it seems , ever farther to the right .
Perry owes his career to W. , who worked hard to make sure Perry was elected Lieutenant Governor in 1998 .
Now , Perry is happily moving beyond his patron and occupying ground on the right end of the Texas GOP that W. himself found uninviting .
And , yes , there remains that matter of secession .
How many Republicans can be happy that a wing of the party of Abraham Lincoln seems so eager to turn the GOP into the party of Jefferson Davis ?
STORING energy is one of the biggest obstacles to the widespread adoption of alternative sources of power .
Batteries can be bulky and slow to charge .
Hydrogen , which can be made electrolytically from water and used to power fuel cells , is difficult to handle .
But there may be an alternative : magnesium .
As school chemistry lessons show , metallic magnesium is highly reactive and stores a lot of energy .
Even a small amount of magnesium ribbon burns in a flame with a satisfying white heat .
Researchers are now devising ways to extract energy from magnesium in a more controlled fashion .
Engineers at MagPower in White Rock , British Columbia , for example , have developed a metal - air cell that uses water and ambient air to react with a magnesium fuel supply , in the form of a metal anode , to generate electricity .
Doron Aurbach at Bar - Ilan University , Israel , has created a magnesium - based version of the lithium - ion rechargeable cell , a type of battery known for its long life and stability .
It would be ideal for storing electricity from renewable sources , says Dr Aurbach .
And Andrew Kindler at the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena is developing a way for cars to generate hydrogen on board by reacting magnesium fuel with steam .
The reaction produces a pure form of hydrogen suitable for fuel cells , leaving behind only magnesium oxide , a relatively benign material , as a by - product .
But there is , of course , a catch .
Although magnesium is abundant , its production is neither cheap nor clean , says Takashi Yabe of the Tokyo Institute of Technology .
Various industrial methods are used to extract magnesium , ranging from an electrolytic process to a high temperature method called the Pidgeon process , but the energy cost is high .
Producing a single kilogram of magnesium requires 10kg of coal , says Dr Yabe .
To change this , he is developing a process using only renewable energy .
Dr Yabe 's solution is to use concentrated solar energy to power a laser , which is used to heat and ultimately burn magnesium oxide extracted from seawater — where , he says , there is enough magnesium to meet the world 's energy needs for the next 300,000 years .
A solar - pumped laser is necessary , he says , because concentrated solar energy alone would not be enough to generate the 3,700 ˚C temperatures required .
Dr Yabe calls his approach the Magnesium Injection Cycle .
The pure magnesium can then be used as a fuel ( its energy density is about ten times that of hydrogen ) .
When the magnesium is mixed with water , it produces heat , boiling the water to produce steam , which can then drive a turbine and do useful work .
The reaction also produces hydrogen , which can be burned to produce even more energy .
The byproducts are water and magnesium oxide , which can then be converted back into magnesium using the solar laser .
The trouble is that concentrated solar collectors tend to be huge and costly , and solar - pumped lasers are normally very low powered .
Dr Yabe 's trick is to use relatively small Fresnel lenses — transparent and relatively thin planar lenses made up of concentric rings of prisms .
These are commonly found in lighthouses to magnify light in a way that would normally require a much larger , thicker lens .
His other trick is to boost the output power of the lasing material , neodymium - doped yttrium aluminium garnet .
It normally only absorbs about 7 % of the energy from sunlight , but when doped with chromium this figure increases to more than 67 % .
Dr Yabe has built a demonstration plant at Chitose , Japan , in partnership with Mitsubishi .
It is capable of producing 80 watts of power from the laser , enough to cut steel and extract 70 % of the magnesium in seawater .
The process will , says Dr Yabe , become commercially viable when the laser power reaches 400 watts , which could happen later this year .
“ As a starting point we are planning to use 300 lasers to produce 50 tonnes of magnesium per year , ” he says .
After that , it is just a small matter of convincing the world to start thinking about a magnesium economy instead of hydrogen one , he adds .

About Easy Java / Javascript Simulations
Easy Java / Javascript Simulations , also known as EJS ( or Ejs , or EjsS ) , is a free authoring tool written in Java that helps non-programmers create interactive simulations in Java or Javascript , mainly for teaching or learning purposes .
EJS has been created by Francisco Esquembre and is part of the Open Source Physics project .
The Javascript ' flavour ' of EJS is possible thanks to the collaboration of Félix Jesús Garcia Clemente , coauthor with Francisco of the Javascript library that supports this flavour and main developer of the Reader Apps .
A brief historical and naming remark : Before release 5.0 , EJS could only create Java simulations .
Hence , its former name was " Easy Java Simulations " and its acronym just " EJS " .
Now , since release 5.0 , EJS can create ( also ) simulations that use Javascript and HTML5 , and hence can be run on tablets and smartphones ( see our Before release 5.0 , EJS could only create Java simulations .
Hence , its former name was " Easy Java Simulations " and its acronym just " EJS " .
Now , since release 5.0 , EJS can create ( also ) simulations that use Javascript and HTML5 , and hence can be run on tablets and smartphones ( see our Reader App ) .
This major change explains why we have renamed EJS as Easy Java / Javascript Simulations , and its acronym can be either EJS or EjsS .
Java EJS and Javascript EJS : Since Java has been evolving on its own and EJS moving towards Javascript more and more , for release 6.0 we decided to split the versions of EJS that generate Java and Javascript simulations .
The main reason being that the current release of EJS requires Java 8 to generate Java simulations , while EJS can generate Javascript simulations with the latest Java version .
Hence , from now on , we may refer to the Java EJS and Javascript EJS ( or , shorter , Js EJS ) to refer to each one of the ' flavours ' of EJS .
The philosophy and main architectural structure of EJS remain common , while changes appear due to the differences ( mainly ) in how to construct graphical user interfaces .

Cannabis smokers often report that when stoned , their thoughts have a free - wheeling quality and concepts seem connected in unusual and playful ways .
A study just published online in Psychiatry Research suggests that this effect may be due to the drug causing ‘ fast and loose ’ patterns of spreading activity in memory , something known as ‘ hyper- priming ’ .
Priming is a well studied effect in psychology where encountering one concept makes related concepts more easily accessible .
For example , classic experiments show that if you see the word ‘ bird ’ you will react more quickly to words like ‘ wing ’ and ‘ fly ’ than words like ‘ apple ’ and ‘ can ’ because the former words are more closely related in meaning than the latter .
In fact , it has been shown that the more closely related the word , the quicker we react to it , demonstrating a kind of ‘ mental distance ’ between concepts .
Think of it like dropping a stone into a pool of mental concepts .
The ripples cause activity that reduces in strength as it moves away from the central idea .
‘ Hyper - priming ’ is an effect where priming happens for concepts at a much greater distance than normal .
For example , the word ‘ bird ’ might speed up reaction times to the the word ‘ aeroplane ’ .
To return to our analogy , the ripples are much stronger and spread further than normal .
The effect has been reported , albeit inconsistently , in people with schizophrenia and some have suggested it might explain why affected people can sometimes make false or unlikely connections or have disjointed thoughts .
As cannabis has been linked to a slight increased risk for psychosis , and certainly causes smokers to have freewheeling thoughts , the researchers decided to test whether stoned participants would show the ‘ hyper - priming ’ effect .
The experiment used a classic ‘ lexical decision task ‘ where the volunteers are shown an initial word ( ‘ time ’ ) and then after a short gap are shown a nonsense word ( ‘ yipt ’ ) and a true word ( ‘ date ’ ) at the same time and have to indicate as quickly as possible which is the real world .
The experimenters altered how related the initial word and true word were to test for the semantic distance effect , and also varied the gap between the initial word and the test to see how long the priming effect might last .
Volunteers who were under the influence of cannabis showed a definite ‘ hyper - priming ’ tendency where distant concepts were reacted to more quickly .
Interestingly , they also showed some of this tendency when straight and sober .
Cannabis also had the effect of causing temporary psychosis - like distortions as would be expected from a psychedelic drug , but the smokers did not make more errors and were not more likely to report psychosis - like symptoms when sober , suggesting the effect was not due to general mental impairment and could n’t be explained by underlying tendency to mental distortion .
Although the debate is not completely settled , there is now good evidence that cannabis causes a small increased risk for developing schizophrenia particularly when smokers start young .
In fact , additional evidence on this front was published only this week .
The researchers discuss the possibility that long - term smokers who spend a lot of time in a chronic ‘ hyper - primed ’ state might make psychosis more likely by loosening the boundaries of well - grounded thought , although exactly how cannabis raises the risk of psychosis , and indeed , how exactly it affects the brain , is still not understood well - enough to make a firm judgement .

This week saw a fine example of political gamesmanship from the Obama administration .
He let down his base yet again by opening up certain portions of the U.S. coast to offshore petroleum drilling in an attempt to undercut his ( supposed ) foes across the aisle , and upped CAFE standards .
The former has gotten a lot more press than the latter .
Neither are quite what they seem .
All the opponents he hoped to undercut with the announcement are still unsatisfied , because he left some areas untouchable .
That ’s not going to make his environmentalist supporters feel any better , but no matter as the administration seems to believe that there is an infinite amount of room under the bus .
So to make them feel a little better , he tossed them a bone by raising CAFE standards .
This man knows hollow , political gestures like he was born to make them .
CAFE sucks .
It ’s a system designed to be gamed , and this grand announcement does n’t change that .
The numbers being touted in the press are either the 2016 fleet average for passenger cars ( 37.8 mpg ) or the 2016 average of cars and trucks ( 34.1 mpg ) .
You ’ll have to dig a little deeper to see the truck average ( 28.8 mpg by 2016 ) and understand how CAFE works – along with automotive classifications for the purpose of CAFE – to see how this move is about as substantial as Obama adopting “ Drill , baby , drill , ” will be to our dependence on foreign oil over the short , medium and even long term .
First , even the 37.8 is rather abysmal in the grand scheme of things , but so long as Americans demand obese vehicles in which their Big Gulp is climate controlled ; in which their asses are never too warm nor too cold ; in which they can be wrapped in a cocoon of perfect safety to save them from their own idiocy ( or that of others ) ; and that require little actual driving , we wo n’t see good numbers .
It ’s the market for the lowest , common denominator , stupid .
Second , it ’s worth going to the EPA ’s fuel economy site and clicking on the lineup for individual automakers .
The EPA divides the lineups into cars , minivans , trucks and SUV’s .
For most manufactures , trucks and SUV ’s account for at least half the lineup .
In more than a few cases , trucks outnumber passenger vehicles in the fleet by two to one .
And , yes , that includes the liberal environmentalists ’ darling Toyota .
So what we ’re really dealing with is an increase to a whopping 28.8 mpg by 2016 .
Third , remember that this is a fleet average number , not a requirement for every vehicle .
The automakers will game this system with America ’s newest class of vehicle , the “ crossover ” .
Sure , the crossover is a step in the right direction and away from the Stupid Useless Vehicle that Americans adore , but it ’s still considered a truck for fuel economy purposes .
Christ , America , drive wagons because they ’re cool .
Do n’t ruin wagons by requiring them to be morbidly obese .
Next time you see an ad for this or that “ crossover ” , replace the marketing brand with “ fat wagon ” because it ’s far more accurate .
For example , “ The brand - new Chevy equinox , America ’s most popular fat wagon , achieves 32 mpg on the highway … your results from equipping it with an automatic transmission and not knowing how to drive may vary … but still , that ’s not bad for a chunker , eh ? ”
Of course , there will be special dispensation in the new CAFE regulations for hybrids , plug - in hybrids and electric vehicles .
We love us some greenwashing , do n’t we ?
Do n’t get me wrong , it would have been awesome if Ford and Edison had pulled off the electric car for the masses in 1914 ; we ’d have a century of electric vehicle technology advancement under our belts and a grid system designed for them .
But they did n’t .
Toyota ’s synergy drive , the industry benchmark , is pointless and serves to do little more than soothe the conscience of people hoping to save the planet by making slightly better consumer purchases .
It contains two complete systems trying to work together .
The end result is two incomplete systems powering a vehicle that can’t match a modern diesel in either efficiency or cleanliness .
The basic concept underlying Chevy ’s Volt is good , because the internal combustion engine never drives the vehicle .
It ’s an electric car with an on - board generator to charge the batteries , meaning that a tiny engine can be tuned for maximum efficiency since the driver will never ask it to speed up or slow down .
Unfortunately , GM ’s making it a technology platform instead of a practical platform and like the behemoth ’s foray into diesel in the 80’s it will probably flop and ruin the idea for a generation .
And of course there will be credits for the grandest boondoggle of them all : E85 .
Yes , that ’s the ticket , a little more socialism for agricultural conglomerates who ’d rather use farmland for growing a terribly inefficient fuel than providing sustenance for the nation .
For all i know , the administration ’s heart is in the right place , but as it seems overly committed to the formalisms of Versailles it does n’t really matter where its heart is located .
The end result are pointless little tweeks around the edges of a broken system that please few and do little for the average American .
* Do n’t look at me , i keep a 24 year old vehicle running .
And if the federal government was n’t so concerned with making sure we all use enough oil to keep corporate profits plump i’d be driving a Kei truck from Japan , as i need to travel several hundred miles to find a speed limit higher than 55 .
I ’ll take 800 lbs of capacity , fold down bed sides , simple construction , off road capability , 40 mpg and right - hand drive , FTW .
US lawmakers Tuesday unveiled plans to block public funding for US - based trials involving Guantanamo detainees who are accused of plotting the September 11 , 2001 attacks .
Republican lawmakers Frank Wolf and Lindsey Graham joined forces to introduce legislation which “ would explicitly block this dangerous and wasteful trial from any domestic civilian court , ” Wolf said .

They also won support from Democrats Jim Webb and Blanche Lincoln , as well as independent senator Joe Lieberman .
If approved , the legislation would stop the Justice Department from using public funds to try the alleged mastermind of the 2001 attacks , Khaled Sheikh Mohammed , and his four co-accused , in domestic US courts .
President Barack Obama ’s administration has announced plans to prosecute the men in New York , just steps from Ground Zero , where the World Trade Center once stood .
The attacks killed almost 3,000 people .
But the plan has been met with howls of protest from lawmakers and New York residents .
“ The whole venue of New York would be a circus .
When you criminalize the war you make a huge mistake , ” Senator Graham said .

And he told a press conference that using a “ civilian trial with the 9/11 conspirators could be dangerous . ”
“ The law enforcement model being used by the Obama administration should be rejected .
We ’re not fighting a crime , we ’re fighting a war .
And to criminalize this war puts our nation at risk . ”
He insisted the system of special military commissions , set up to try detainees at Guantanamo Bay , Cuba , was the best venue to try the alleged September 11 plotters .

Such trials could be held “ quickly , securely and with very little additional cost , ” he said .
The White House said Sunday it was still hoping to bring Sheikh Mohammed and other alleged plotters of the September 11 attacks to trial in New York , despite reservations including from Mayor Michael Bloomberg .

“ We are talking with the authorities in New York , ” spokesman Robert Gibbs said .
“ We understand their logistical concerns and their security concerns that are involved .
We have been discussing that with them . ”
A civilian trial in New York could cost around 200 million dollars a year , racking up a billion - dollar price tag if it extended over five years as a complex case could , according to figures cited by lawmakers on Tuesday .
Graham , who plans to meet with the White House to discuss the legislation , said he was “ confident ” the measure had the support to pass a vote .

Democratic Senator Jim
Webb threw his backing behind the bill saying the attacks should not be prosecuted in a US civilian court .
“ This is not an appropriate type of crime to be tried in an American criminal court , ” he said .
He also warned that Attorney General Eric Holder had yet to give “ a very clear answer ” on what would happen to the accused plotters of the attacks if they were acquitted by a US court .
Meanwhile , the second most senior Democrat in the House of Representatives told reporters that the White House was reassessing a decision to transfer some prisoners from Guantanamo Bay to the Thomson prison facility in Illinois .
ADVERTISEMENT
“ I think the administration realizes that this is a difficult issue , ” said House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer .
“ And I think that they are assessing where they are and where they think we ought to be .
I think that ’s appropriate .
And I ’m looking forward to discussing it with them . ”
On Monday , Obama requested 237 million dollars in his 2011 budget for the purchase and retrofitting of the Thomson facility , where his administration has said they plan to hold some former Guantanamo detainees .
Thomson would be upgraded to a high - security facility with space for federal prisoners and a wing under Pentagon administration for former Guantanamo prisoners .

Obama ’s administration has pledged to close the facility at Guantanamo Bay , located on US naval base on Cuba ’s southern tip .
There are 192 detainees still being held at the prison .
What can a first - time buyer in the South East buy for less than £ 250,000 ?
Most first - time buyers are celebrating the removal in the Budget of the 1 % stamp duty tax on their first house purchase costing up to £ 250,000 .
The stamp duty has been scrapped for two years .
According to the Council of Mortgage Lenders , 92 % of first - time buyers buy properties costing less than £ 250,000 , and these first - time buyers will save up to £ 2,500 when they purchase their home .
In London and the South East , however , first - time buyers are making stuffed straw versions of Alistair Darling and setting them alight with flaming torches fashioned from estate agents ’ listings .
The reason is that in the South East , away from the Labour heartlands , £ 250,000 buys you … not half as much as in Macclesfield .
Properties in or near London costing less than £ 250,000
So what can first - time buyers working in London shoot for ?
A Wendy house ?
A false passport and plane ticket to Australia ?
I poured myself a stiff drink and fired up FindAProperty to see .
Along the way I found some truly dire dwellings , such as :
The crack house with a tenant / customer still in place .
The flat where the owner is currently ‘ negotiating access ’ .
The house whose neighbour has not one but two mattresses in the garden .
The ‘ flexible accommodation ’ in central London that consisted of a 12 - foot room , and a side closet with a loo in it .
( It was flexible in that you needed to be a contortionist … )
But why depress would - be first - time buyers in London even more than they ’re already depressed ?
Especially as I am one .
( Long story … )
Here instead are a few decent looking homes around London suitable for stamp duty dodging first - time buyers .
A one - bed flat in Shepherds Bush , West London
This well - presented one bedroom flat in a decent period building costs £ 249,950 , and is situated on Askew Road – a fairly busy thoroughfare with grimy bits , on the fringes of Acton but essentially in ever almost - trendy Shepherd ’s Bush .
( According to the listing , Askew Road is ‘ pleasant and vibey ’ .
I stand corrected ) .
You get 448 sq feet for your quarter million quid – the two main rooms are a reasonable size , but the kitchen is an alcove .
Never mind , the new Westfield Shopping Centre down the road is full of fancy eateries .
Or , says the listing , there ’s Ravenscourt Park for the more ‘ pastoraly inclined ’ .
( Does that mean a member of the church ? )
A two - bedroom flat in Deptford
Head south of the river to up - and - coming and only mildly dangerous Deptford and you too can live the life of a pixel - perfect 3D model from those computerised images that housebuilders create to advertise their developments .
Down Deptford way you get a two - bedroom flat for your £ 249,950 , albeit it a purple one .
Never mind , it makes it easier for the locals to spot you and mug you welcome you to the area .
In case you were wondering , the flat is ‘ nestled between the vibrant regeneration of Deptford and the cosmopolitan lifestyle of New Cross ’ – which basically translates as ‘ halfway between a knocked - down council estate and a kebab shop ’ .
But seriously , cool people do tell me Deptford is the place right now .
I ’d rather sleep higher than the ground floor though , whatever they say .
A two - bed house in Uxbridge
Move out to Uxbridge ( that ’s in Zone 6 , Londoners ) and this little house can be your very own castle .
I ’m not certain what the snag is here , except for the minor matter of Uxbridge being somewhere that would make you think twice about wasting your bombs on Slough .
I love the way the agent talks about how this little terraced house is ‘ set in leafy grounds ’ , as if you ’ll have to drive down a long gravel road to your front door in a coach , with Mr Darcy trying to cop a feel of your knee .
Cynicism aside , this does appear to be a reasonable starter home , though you probably did n’t expect to pay £ 250,000 to live in what looks suspiciously like sheltered accommodation when you left your provincial village with a pocket full of beans , big ideas , and a condom .
3 - bed house in Romford
Novelists , bankers , and tramps aside , anyone not born in London eventually decamps to the dormitory towns to raise their own children who can one day be amazed at the cost of living in London for themselves .
Cut out a decade and move to Romford , where you can bring up your kids as authentic Essex guys and gals , and get a great deal on chrome hubcaps .
The step up in size to this 3 - bed house is pretty remarkable considering Romford is as close to central London by train as Uxbridge is by tube .
I do n’t know much about Romford except that it has an excellent tropical fish shop – I was once mugged on a train in Stratford on my way there – but we ’re assured this house is in a ‘ popular turning ’ .
Turning into what , guffaw , guffaw .
Also , I do n’t like the agent ’s call for an ‘ internal inspection ’ .
It makes it sound like the house has worms .
A cottage in Wendover
Wendover is a pretty , happy village in Buckinghamshire that will soon be swallowed up by the less pleasant Aylesbury to the North .
It ’s on a cracking little train line out of Marylebone , and has all the essentials a village needs – pub , French restaurant , chocolate shop , and Citybloke ’s wife ’s profit - shirking art gallery .
First - time buyers discovered it years ago , so do n’t expect bargains .
This former farm cottage has two beds and two little reception rooms .
Costing £ 249,950 , I think it looks quite sweet .
And bigger through binoculars .
A two - bed flat in Brighton
Ah , Brighton – I remember when it was all pensioners and junkies as far as the eye could see .
Now it ’s the same , but with some trendy delis and an awful lot of ex-Londoners trying to recreate Camden and Notting Hill by the sea , and getting about as far as a duck pond in Dollis Hill .
I jest , mostly .
Brighton is a pleasant if slightly violent seaside city , with a center full of creative and attractive young people , fringed by criminal and tattooed ones ( and that ’s just the schoolgirls , etc etc ) .
Still , where else in the South East would first - time buyers get to live in a swanky Regency flat within a stone ’s throw of the ocean – or indeed , within a stone ’s throw of a stone thrower .
( I ’m only making fun of Brighton dwellers because I ’m secretly jealous of their pseudo - San Franciscan lifestyle .
And their rock ) .
Conclusion : First - time buyers can buy for under £ 250,000
Yes , even in the South East .
Much as I ’ve been a bit silly in my commentary above , these six properties look reasonable options for first - time buyers – just so long as you do n’t insist ‘ reasonable ’ means ‘ worth £ 250,000 of hard cash in a way your grandparents would have recognised as value for money ’ .
Finally , I would n’t hang about if you ’re determined to buy and you want to avoid paying over the odds .
The not - so - unintended consequence of the Chancellor ’s generosity towards first - time buyers could be a sharp rise in the price of houses approaching the £ 250,000 barrier , as all the good cheaper ones get snapped up .
The Arizona House approved several new changes to Arizona 's new immigration law .
The changes still need final approval from the Senate before being passed along to the governor .
If Gov. Jan Brewer supports them , they would go into effect at the same time the new law would .
The phrase " lawful contact " would be changed to " lawful stop , detention or arrest " to clarify that an officer would not need to question a crime victim or witness about their legal status .
The word " solely " would be eliminated from the sentence " A law enforcement official or agency � may not solely consider race , color or national origin " in establishing reasonable suspicion that someone is in the country illegally .
Bill sponsor Sen. Russell Pearce , R - Mesa , said the intent is to clarify that " this bill prohibits racial profiling in any form . "
Bill opponents had argued that the word " solely " allowed officers to base their reasonable suspicion on race and color as long as it was n't just one of them .
Rep. Kyrsten Sinema , D - Phoenix , said those two changes help clarify the bill , and lighten its impact somewhat .
But she called a third change " frightening . "
That change clarifies that a police officer responding to city ordinance violations would also be required to determine the immigration status of an individual they have reasonable suspicion of being in the country illegally .
City ordinance violations vary by municipality but could include things like loud parties , barking dogs , cars on blocks in the yard or too many renters .
Bill supporters say the addition of the word " ordinance " does not change anything because under the signed law , officers could question the legal status of anyone they come into lawful contact with , whether that lawful contact related to a law or an ordinance .
Exclusive
The peer leading the second Climategate enquiry at the University of East Anglia serves as a director of one of the most powerful environmental networks in the world , according to Companies House documents - and has failed to declare it .
Lord Oxburgh , a geologist by training and the former scientific advisor to the Ministry of Defence , was appointed to lead the enquiry into the scientific aspects of the Climategate scandal on Monday .
But Oxburgh is also a director of GLOBE , the Global Legislators Organisation for a Balanced Environment .
GLOBE may be too obscure to merit its own Wikipedia entry , but that belies its wealth and influence .
It funds meetings for parliamentarians worldwide with an interest in climate change , and prior to the Copenhagen Summit GLOBE issued guidelines ( pdf ) for legislators .
Little expense is spared : in one year alone , one peer - Lord Michael Jay of Ewelme - enjoyed seven club class flights and hotel accommodation , at GLOBE 's expense .
There 's no greater love a Parliamentarian can give to the global warming cause .
And in return , Globe lists Oxburgh as one of 23 key legislators .
At its blog , GLOBE wears its heart on its sleeve
In the House of Lords Register of Lords ' Interests , Oxburgh lists under remunerated directorships his chairmanship of Falck Renewables , and chairmanship of Blue NG , a renewable power company .
( Oxburgh holds no shares in Falck Renewables , and serves as a non-exec chairman . )
He also declares that he is an advisor to Climate Change Capital , to the Low Carbon Initiative , Evo-Electric , Fujitsu , and an environmental advisor to Deutsche Bank .
For a year he was non-exec chairman of Shell .
GLOBE is conspicuous by its absence , however .
Oxburgh joined GLOBE in 2008 .
The University of East Anglia appointed Oxburgh after consulting the Royal Society .
" We are grateful to the Royal Society for helping us to identify such a strong panel and to the members for dedicating their time to this important matter , " said the University in a press statement .
It may not be the smartest advice the UEA has ever received - the Royal Society 's partisanship is well known .
( A parallel enquiry , headed by Sir Muir Russell , is already underway . )
One insider , who declined to be named , described Oxburgh 's appointment as " like putting Dracula in charge of the Blood Bank " .
GLOBE has not returned our request for comment .
Nor has the University .
The network has n't had much luck with its UK appointments , as key figures have become caught up in the MP expenses scandal .
GLOBE 's worldwide secretary Elliott Morley and its British branch secretary David Chaytor were two of three MPs to face criminal charges last week .
Brent MP Barry Gardiner , co-chairman of the GLOBE Dialogue on Land Use Change & Ecosystems claimed for a second home eight miles from Westminster , and worked the system for £ 200,000 .
In 2007 Oxburgh won a Lifetime Achievement Award from Platts .
The judges said they were also impressed by “ his very high ethical standards " . ®

At least 95 people have died in the Brazilian state of Rio de Janeiro after the most torrential rain for decades caused landslides and flooding .
A state of emergency has been declared and officials have warned the death toll may rise as many more are missing .
At least 33 people died in Rio de Janeiro city after 28 cm ( 11 in ) of rain fell in 24 hours , while 33 were killed in the neighbouring city of Niteroi .
Many houses in Rio's hillside shanty towns were buried under mudslides .
Rescue teams have been scouring the city 's hillsides to find missing people and recover bodies buried under the mud .
With no let - up in the rain , President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva has urged residents to leave their homes if they are at risk of flooding .
Otherwise , the authorities have told people to stay indoors and avoid travelling around the city .
Chaotic situation Authorities say the city of Rio de Janeiro 's transport system is close to collapse , after traffic ground to a halt with many streets under water .
ANALYSIS Paulo Cabral
BBC News , Rio de Janeiro
The rain is not so intense but the risk of new landslides remains high , as the soil of the hillsides is extremely wet .
Most of those who died were people in the hillside slums where waves of mud came down destroying everything in their way .
The topography in Rio exacerbates these types of problems .
It 's one of the most beautiful cities in the world because of the mountains in the middle of the town , but it can get nasty when it rains .
Ten years ago a census found 12,000 people lived in high - risk areas , but there have been new developments since then so the number is probably much higher .
" The situation is chaos , " Mayor Eduardo da Costa Paes said in a statement on Tuesday .
" All the major streets of the city are closed because of the floods .
" Each and every person who attempts to enter them will be at enormous risk , " he warned .
Mr Paes said the preparedness for heavy rainfall in Brazil 's second - largest city - which will host the 2014 World Cup and 2016 Olympic Games - was " less than zero " .
Public schools will remain closed until at least Friday .
State governor Sergio Cabral meanwhile declared a state of emergency and urged people in high - risk areas to leave their homes .
He told TV Globo that to stay inside would be " irresponsible " given the risk of new landslides .
The victims of shanty town landslides in the city of Rio de Janeiro included a five - month - old baby and a nine - year - old child , officials said .

Flooding left another 12 people dead in Sao Goncalo , and one in Petropolis .
The continuous rainfall also forced Santos Dumont airport , which handles domestic flights , to close for two hours on Monday night , causing a number of delays .
Many cars were left abandoned on main roads throughout the city .
The head of Rio de Janeiro 's civil defence department told TV Globo the amount of rain that had fallen was " more than any city is capable of supporting " .
Paulo Marqueiro , a reporter for the newspaper O Globo , told the BBC it was like the city had " collapsed " .
Houses had been brought crashing down by the floods and landslides , and there was no public transport whatsoever , he said .
' Pray to God ' BBC
News website reader Antonio Queiroz Junior said it had started raining after 1700 ( 2000 GMT ) on Monday , during the rush hour .
It started raining after 5 pm , right in the rush hour when people were trying to get back home from work .
It has n't stopped raining since then

Your comments " It has n't stopped raining since then , " he said .
" This is the worst storm in decades . "
He added : " The city has been abandoned by our government .
The current situation is unacceptable , with so many people getting killed because of the rain .
" Everybody knows the danger of living in the hills , and the government does nothing to stop more and more people building houses there . "
Another reader in Rio de Janeiro , Duncan Crossley , said he had witnessed Rio de Janeiro " on the brink of collapse " .
He said the power had been cut in his neighbourhood at about midday , and that the storm had brought down huge trees , which along with the flooding were blocking major traffic arteries .
" The streets were thick with mud , " he wrote .
" The city reminded me of a war zone . "
Civil defence authorities in Rio have issued an alert for landslides President Lula , who was visiting the city on Tuesday , blamed local officials for not enforcing adequate building standards in areas prone to landslides , particularly in shantytowns .
" All we can do is pray to God to hold back the rains a little , so that Rio can return to normal , and so that we can set about fixing the things in the city that need fixing , " he told local radio .
The president said the work would include improved drainage systems .
Rio de Janeiro state has experienced a particularly hot and rainy summer this year , and meteorologists have forecast more rain in the coming days .
However , correspondents say heavy rain is more common in January than in April .
In January , at least 39 people were killed by mudslides in the resort area of Angra dos Reis , half way between Rio de Janeiro and Santos .

Fiscally conservative Tea Partiers just can't seem to nail down a message .
They hate government spending , but want Obama to shell out more money so astronauts can play with big , expensive toys in outer space .
Maybe they 're just bored retirees ?
At a demonstration outside NASA 's Kennedy Center in God 's waiting room Florida yesterday , Space Coast Patriots carried birther signs and yelled nonsensical slogans about Obama 's supposed scrapping of America 's space program during his visit there .
From NPR 's Greg Allen :
Although he 's scaled back , all but canceled the Constellation manned mission program , President Obama has actually increased the NASA budget .
And after the outcry about the Constellation , Mr. Obama has proposed pumping more money into the Kennedy Space Center , with programs that the White House says will add some 4,500 jobs .
Like much the president says , [ protester ]
Don Forward says he does n't believe it . "
According to Don Forward : " [...]
It 's not going to help the day to day person who works out at the cape , actually making the cape run , I do n't think it is . "
Another Space cadet , Bonnie Smith , told NPR she thinks this is all part of Barack Hussein 's diabolical plan to destroy the Patriotic resistance : " This area is a Republican area .
You know , I can be conspiratorial and say , is he trying to crush this area ?
You know , you can look at it like that . "
Yes , Bonnie , we can be conspiratorial and suggest you increase your daily Geritol intake .
And retired Kennedy Space Center worker John Schneider thinks the government needs to spend more money , and lots of it , to keep the program running : " When John Kennedy said we 'll be on the Moon in 10 years , we were .
I mean , we did it .
But it took a bunch of money .
They , you know , they did not spare the horses when it came to money . "
Ca n't someone just ship a bunch of backgammon sets and lawn chairs down to these confused old - timers ?

Folks , mark the calendars and snag your White Out tees !
Beaver Stadium is back in the prime time .
Michigan ’s Rich Rodriguez and the Wolverines will make their way to Happy Valley for some Big Ten football action October 30 , which will be the White Out game .
The contest , which earned an 8 p.m. starting slot , will be the last time these two rivals meet until 2013 – something I ’m sure Michigan fans wo n’t mind !
The last time they visited in 2008 , it ended in a 46 - 17 blowout victory favoring the Nittany Lions .
Penn State also walked away from Ann Arbor victorious in 2009 .
However , this year could be different .
Both teams are rebuilding and will rely heavily on their defense .
It ’s too early to say now , but do n’t expect 46 points on the end of the scoreboard .
Do , however , expect a third Penn State victory .
This match - up , which marks the 11th consecutive season with a prime time game at Beaver Stadium , will air on ESPN , ESPN2 , or ABC .
It will look to top 2005 ’s match up with Ohio State , which attracted 4.435 million U.S. cable households .
Customer : “ Oh , I needed help putting in this cat food , and the young man put in the wrong brand ! ”
Me : “ Okay , let ’s go over there and get the right one . ”
( We walk over , and she looks at about five different bags of cat food , then goes to a bag of litter . )
Customer : “ I think it was this one I wanted . ”
Me : “ Wait , did you want cat food or litter ? ”
Customer : “ What ’s the difference ? ”
Meeting between OECD Secretary - General Angel Gurria and Israeli President Shimon Peres. ( 19 January 2010 ) © OCDE
An exclusive club of the world ’s most developed countries is poised to admit Israel as a member even though , a confidential internal document indicates , doing so will amount to endorsing Israel ’s illegal occupation of Palestinian and Syrian territories .
Israel has been told that its accession to the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development ( OECD ) is all but assured when the 30 member states meet in May .
But a draft OECD report concedes that Israel has breached one of the organisation ’s key requirements on providing accurate and transparent data on its economic activity .
The information supplied by Israel , the report notes , includes not only the economic activity of its citizens inside its recognised borders but also Jewish settlers who live in the occupied territories of East Jerusalem , the West Bank and the Golan in violation of international law .
Israel ’s accession to the OECD on such terms threatens to severely embarrass many of the organisation ’s member states , especially those in the European Union that are publicly committed to avoiding collusion with the occupation .
The OECD report proposes that these legal difficulties may be circumvented by asking Israel to produce new statistics within a year of its accession excluding the settler population – even though , an OECD official has admitted , Israel would have the power to veto such a demand after it becomes a member .
“ The OECD seems to be so determined to get Israel through its door that it is prepared to cover up the crimes of the occupation , ” said Shir Hever , a Jerusalem - based economist .
Israel has been lobbying for nearly 20 years to be admitted to the OECD , founded in 1961 for wealthy industrialised democracies to meet and co-ordinate economic and social policies .
It includes the United States and most of Europe .
“ The financial privileges are relatively modest , but there is great prestige to being accepted , ” Mr Hever said .
“ Israel has worked so hard to gain admission because it believes accession will confer international legitimacy on its occupation . ”
Several countries with a lower development level than Israel have already been accepted , including Turkey , Mexico and the Czech Republic .
Israel ’s past rejections , it is widely assumed , were because many states were uncomfortable about admitting Israel while it was occupying the Palestinian territories of East Jerusalem , Gaza and the West Bank and the Syrian - owned Golan Heights .
However , Israel was formally invited to begin discussions about membership in 2007 after intense lobbying by Stanley Fischer , the governor of the Bank of Israel .
Membership is expected to bring financial stability to Israel ’s economy , attract investment and reduce the country ’s risk premium .
Recently appointed OECD Deputy Secretary - General Richard A. Boucher is in charge of finalizing Israel ’s accession to the organization this year .
Ambassador Boucher was the Spokesperson for U.S. Secretaries of State Madeleine Albright , Colin Powell and Condoleezza Rice .
© Département d’Etat
The OECD ’s secretary general , Angel Gurria , visited in January , after a review of Israel ’s economy , and suggested that admission this year was a certainty .
However , a leaked draft report by the OECD ’s committee on statistics , produced last month after the review , shows there are major problems with the data presented by Israel .
According to its rules , the OECD takes account of economic activity outside a candidate state ’s recognised borders in very limited circumstances , such as with remittances from migrant workers .
But given that this status does not apply to the illegal settlers living in the occupied territories , the OECD committee argues that either the settlers be excluded from the data or everyone living in the territories – including Palestinians – should be factored in .
“ Israel has been caught out because it has always refused , even in its own internal data , to differentiate between Israel and the occupied territories , ” Mr Hever said .
Both East Jerusalem and the Golan have been annexed by Israel in violation of international law .
“ The OECD is treating Israel as though it has seven million citizens when , in reality , it has 11 million subjects , of whom four million are Palestinians living under occupation , ” Mr Hever said .
“ If they were included in the figures submitted to the OECD , Israel would have to be refused accession because of the enormous disparities in wealth . ”
Meron Benvenisti , a former deputy mayor of Jerusalem , noted recently that there was a 20:1 ratio in the difference in gross domestic product per capita between an Israeli and a Palestinian living in Gaza .
But rather than conclude that Israel has failed to meet the organisation ’s entry criteria , the committee proposes a workaround : Israel can be accepted to the organisation and given a year to submit new data excluding the settlers .
Tim Davis , an OECD official with the statistics committee in Paris , said he could not comment on the report because its contents were confidential but agreed that there was nothing to stop Israel reneging on such a commitment in the future .
“ In a case like that , nothing could be done in practice .
We work on the basis of co-operation , not pressure . ”
Israel is reported to have failed other entry conditions , including on corruption and copyright violations .
The OECD has required member states to crack down on corrupt practices since it approved a convention against bribery in 1997 .
Israel , however , was ranked in 32nd place in a major index on corruption last year , with much of it relating to the country ’s $ 6 billion arms industry .
European and US defence firms have threatened to derail Israel ’s OECD bid if it does not clean up its act .
Israel is also believed to be violating intellectual property rights , again in breach of OECD rules .
US and Swiss firms have accused Israel of failing to regulate the international marketing of drugs produced by its largest pharmaceuticals company , Teva .
Israel ’s bid for OECD membership has been opposed by the leaders of its Arab minority , one - fifth of the population .
Last month the Higher Follow - Up Committee , the minority ’s main political body , petitioned the OECD to reject Israel .
It has pointed out that half of Israel ’s Arab citizens are living below the poverty line , a rate three times higher than among Israeli Jews , and that on average Arab citizens earn salaries that are one - third less than Jews .
Mohammed Zeidan , head of the committee , blamed the disparities in wealth on what he called Israel ’s “ racist and discriminatory polices ” .
Another OECD report , published in January , showed that , even on the basis of Israel ’s figures excluding the Palestinians , Israel would still have the widest social gaps of any member state if it were accepted .

If you , or someone you know , ever need a property caretaker , we can help .
You can run a free help - wanted ad ( up to 50 words ) in THE CARETAKER GAZETTE .
I 've prepared some info below on the property caretaking field .
Please let me know if I can help answer any property caretaking questions you might have .
Take care , Gary Dunn , Publisher , THE CARETAKER GAZETTE . ( garydunn@pullman.com )
What is a caretaker ? >> >>
For those who are not involved in the profession , the word " caretaker " may >> have numerous meanings .
But for the growing number of people who are >> dedicated to the caretaking profession and land stewardship , a caretaker is > a property caretaker : a person hired by a landowner to care for his or her > property in exchange for compensation . >> >>
What is land stewardship ? >> >>
Land stewardship is the concept of caring for land to ensure that it > remains intact and productive for future generations .
Caretakers act as land > stewards when their responsibilities include preservation and maintenance > activities .
To quote Wendell Berry , author of The Unsettling of America , >" The care of the earth is our most ancient and most worthy , and after all , > our most pleasing responsibility .
To cherish what remains of it , and to > foster its renewal , is our only legitimate hope . " >> >>
Is caretaking a new profession ? >> >>
No , it 's actually a very old profession , rooted in the British tradition of >> land maintenance .
In 1868 The Times of London defined a caretaker as " a >> person put in charge of a farm from which the tenant has been evicted . "
>>
Today , that definition has been expanded to cover a multitude of >> landowner / caretaker relationships .
The number and diversity of these >> relationships has increased during the past decade .
As more and more >> landowners hire caretakers to watch over their property , the caretaking >> profession continues to grow in popularity . >> >>
Who hires caretakers ? >> >>
Many different types of property owners hire caretakers .
Landowners , large >> and small , individuals or institutions , can benefit by utilizing the >> services of a qualified caretaker .
Farmers , ranchers , homesteaders , >estates , camps , parks , lodges , and nature preserves all employ caretakers . >> >>
What skills and experience are required for caretaking ? >> >>
While many landowners seek experienced caretakers with specific skills >( e.g. maintenance , farming , ranching or animal husbandry ) others are willing > to take on and train people with general backgrounds .
As with most other > occupations , such traits as honesty , common sense , and flexibility are key > prerequisites .
For caretakers who live and work alone on the property of an > absentee landowner , the ability to function independently and fulfill one 's > responsibilities without daily guidance and instruction from the landowner > are important qualifications .
Although a love of nature and solitude is > important , having hobbies and interests ( e.g. reading , writing , painting , > photography ) that can be pursued in what are often remote areas is extremely > helpful . >> >>
What are the duties and responsibilities of a caretaker ? >> >>
The duties and responsibilities of a caretaker are as varied as the >> landowners and caretakers themselves .
Caretaking can give one the >> opportunity to work in dozens of areas , among them : groundskeeping , land >> stewardship , farming , organic gardening , forestry , ranching , animal >> husbandry and fisheries .
While some landowners just require a presence on >> their property , others need fences mended , snow plowed , gardens tended , >> animals cared for , and houses , roads and pastures maintained .
Plumbing and >> electrical work may be part of a caretaker 's duties - or the caretaker may > be responsible for hiring competent repairmen . >> >>
What should one consider when applying for a caretaking position ? >> >>
The prudent caretaker sets out to develop a working relationship with the >> landowner , his or her prospective employer .
If the landowner 's goals and >> philosophies are stated in their advertisement , prospective caretakers >> should consider whether these are in harmony with their own beliefs .
While >> skill and experience are important , most landowners are initially concerned > with character references .
When answering an ad , a neatly prepared resume > should be accompanied by photographs of oneself ( and family , if applicable ) > and references .
Landowners often request a personal letter , where the > prospective caretaker discusses such things as interests , goals and reasons > for desiring a caretaking position .
It is helpful to be as open and honest > as possible .
Information regarding any special skills or interests should > also be included . >> >>
What should a landowner look for when hiring a caretaker ? >> >>
A detailed , well - written ad is an important first step toward finding a >> qualified caretaker .
You should be honest about both the situation and >> compensation offered .
The philosophy and goals of the landowner should be >> stated up - front .
This can help alleviate ideological clashes or conflicts .
>>
In addition to the standard resume and references , landowners find it >> helpful to request a personal letter from the prospective caretaker . >> >>
Are there any financial benefits for landowners who hire caretakers ? >>
>>
Putting their property in the hands of a qualified caretaker can free >> landowners from the responsibility of day - to - day maintenance .
This >> arrangement can enable them to increase their profits in the long run .
A >> caretaker who lives on the property ensures that it is kept in good >> condition , secure from vandalism , theft and maintenance problems .
He or she > also makes any necessary improvements or repairs so that the property always > remains in top condition .
Having a qualified caretaker on one 's property > gives the landowner time to pursue other interests or employment . >> >>
Can caretaking provide any special opportunities for travelers ? >> >>
Inveterate travelers have discovered that caretaking enables them to live >> and work in a variety of interesting locales - both in the U.S. and abroad .
> Positions may be for the long or short - term , seasonal or year - round .
Many > newcomers to the caretaking field have been lifelong travelers .
Most are > motivated by the desire to live a simple , rural life or explore another > culture in depth .
Caretaking offers travelers the opportunity to become a > part of a community and experience life as the locals live it .
Travelers can > caretake resort properties during off - seasons , enjoying the use of the > grounds and facilities .
For travelers who are considering a move to another > geographic area , caretaking allows them to experience life in a new location > prior to spending time , money and energy relocating there . >> >>
Can full or part - time RVers find employment as caretakers ? >> >>
Yes. Many RVers are discovering that caretaking is a challenging and >> fulfilling occupation .
It enables them to take some time off the road , >> settle down for a period of time , and enjoy life in another location .
It 's >> an economical way to live as site and utility hookups are provided by the >> landowner .
RVers are often in demand by landowners whose properties do not >> have separate housing for caretakers .
Because RVers have their own housing >> with them , they require only hookups .
While some campgrounds that hire > RVers as caretakers require light duties , others are simply in need of >>" site - sitters . "
In both situations , there is plenty of leisure time to > enjoy the property and its amenities .
RVers can also find employment as > caretakers on properties of landowners who travel .
In this instance , it is > important to maintain the property and make it appear occupied .
Seasonal or > short - term positions permit RVers to maintain their free - wheeling lifestyle . >> >>
Is caretaking suitable for retirees ? >> >>
Yes .
In fact , many landowners specifically request " mature " or " retired " >> individuals or couples when placing their ads .
Retirees bring with them a >> wealth of skills and experience that can be readily used when caretaking >> property .
Landowners like the fact that many retirees have a second income .
>>
In exchange for caretaking responsibilities retirees are able to live >> rent - free and experience life in different geographic areas . >>
>>
The Caretaker Gazette publishes a caretaker profile in each issue .

CARETAKER PROFILE >> >>" A Caretaker with Many ' Bush ' Stories " - A Profile of Mike Peterson >>
Date of Birth : 5/15/51 >>
Interests : Building sailing ship models , creative writing , reading , and TV >> production .
>>
Quote : " If I have a wish for mankind , it is that everyone , everywhere , could >> spend an hour in the calm , quiet evening , and be wrapped in the northern >> lights .
I think peace would follow . " >> >>
Mike Peterson is a very versatile guy .
After growing up on a farm in >>
Wisconsin , spending some time in college , doing a Navy hitch , and getting >> married , he set off on the railroad to become a locomotive engineer .
After >>12 years on the railroad , and a divorce , he traveled the " lower 48 " for >> several years then settled in Alaska .
He 's been there for seven years .
For >> the past five years , Mike has been the winter caretaker at Valhalla Lodge , >> located on a remote lake in western Alaska .
Valhalla Lodge is one of >>
Alaska 's premiere fishing and hunting lodges .
It was built for those who >> truly appreciate the great outdoors .
People from all over the world make the >> trip to experience a real wilderness paradise .
The only access to the lodge >> is by plane , using either floats in the summer or skis when the lake is >> frozen .
Once Mike arrives at Valhalla Lodge , he 's alone for the next seven >> months , except for Bandit , the company dog .
His duties are to " be there , " >> and make sure the lodge and all its belongings are still there when the >> fishing season starts the next spring .
If something breaks , he fixes it .
>>
When it snows , he cleans the wings of the four planes parked there .
Other >> than that , Mike may do nothing for long periods of time .
He 's paid $ 300 per >> month , plus a $ 1,000 bonus at the end of the season .
Mike says " that 's OK >> for a single guy with no bills . "
The two most common questions people ask >>
Mike are , " Have you seen the movie , The Shining ? " ( which he has several >> times ) and , " How can you stand to be out there all by yourself for so long ? " >>
His reply to that question is , " How can you stand to go out every morning in >> the dark , in the cold , shovel off your car , hope it starts , so you can play >>' bumper cars ' to get to a job you probably do not like , where you do n't >> make enough money , so you can pay rent on a place you 're probably not crazy >> about anyway . "
On mornings like that , Mike just makes another pot of coffee , >> puts his feet up on the table , and watches all of Good Morning America on >>RATNET ( Rural Alaska Television Network ) .
As he sits at his table watching >> it get light outside , he can observe a line of caribou crossing the ice , or >> a couple of moose walking along the lake 's shore .
He once watched a fox dig >> up a frozen salmon that had washed up in the fall , then observed as a group >> of ravens drove off the fox and started to pick at the salmon ; finally , an >> eagle dropped out of the sky and flew off with the prize .
Many animals got >> fed from that one magnificent fish and the show was over in less than 15 >> minutes .
It 's things like this that make the long winters worthwhile for >>
Mike .
But the most amazing thing for Mike on those cold winter nights >> continues to be the sight of the northern lights overhead .
If you have never >> seen them , try to imagine a shimmering translucent curtain in shades of >> almost fluorescent greens !
At his latitude , instead of being low to the >> north , they spread like a silken veil straight overhead , from horizon to >> horizon .
Even the snow covered landscape seems to pick up the colors and >> reflect them back .
And the show gets even better .
Like a great movie screen >> curtain being opened , this veil of light is constantly moving .
As near as >>
Mike can describe it , " It is like releasing a silk scarf that floats down , >> but never reaches the ground . "
Mike loves the caretaking life and it shows >> whenever you talk with him ! >>

Where Bytes , Bio , and Healthcare Converge : Introducing Xconomy ’s Health IT News Channel
Xconomy National —
We ’re not much in favor of rigidly categorizing news by industry here at Xconomy , in part because we follow exciting companies that often transcend conventional definitions of what is a software , energy , or biotechnology business .
But we do try our best to deliver breaking news and in - depth coverage to communities of readers , and one such community is clearly coalescing around the use of information technology in healthcare .
To help bring that community more front and center , today we ’re announcing the launch of a sector - specific channel for health IT news .
Our new Health IT channel features healthcare technology news coverage and other features from across the Xconomy network in Boston , San Diego , and Seattle , as well as other important “ national ” stories not specific to one of our cities .
The channel has a new feature not found on our previous Life Sciences and Startups channels : the Health IT AppWatch , a section where we ’re delivering news on applications that help consumers and medical professionals exploit the capabilities of the Web and mobile devices to improve their own well being or the health of those close to them or in their care .
As part of launching the new channel , we ’re also boosting our efforts to provide insights and opinions from top innovators in the field of healthcare technology through our Xconomist Forum ( the equivalent of our Op - Ed page ) , already one of the most popular and most - read portions of our site .
And , as many of you may know , we are bringing our new focus on Health IT live through events on both coasts .
We ’re holding our first dedicated health IT event , Healthcare in Transition , at the MIT Media Lab on April 26 .
A few weeks later , on May 12 in Seattle , we are holding How Information is Transforming Medicine and Healthcare .
Both those events feature leading executives , entrepreneurs , innovators , and investors from some of the most interesting and dynamic health IT startups and large companies around .
Our new channel , therefore , is a vehicle through which we ’re setting out to capture the growing excitement and opportunities around using tech as a tool to revolutionize healthcare .
The U.S. government is pouring billions of dollars into technology for sharing and storing electronic health records , recognizing the value of using information technology to improve the quality and economics of the healthcare system .
But startups and their investors are already looking beyond the forthcoming surge in electronic health records adoption , rushing to fill a bevy of gaps in how information is gathered , analyzed , and shared throughout the healthcare system .
Meantime , large established companies such as the data storage and management giant … Next Page »
It was not absolutely clear whether it was a moment to cheer or cry .
In December , shortly after the participants in a UN conference on family planning had broken up in Kampala , Africa 's billionth baby was born .
In a continent apparently wracked with all the ills of over - population – hunger , poverty and shocking maternal and neo-natal mortality – it might appear a harbinger of disaster .
For within 40 years , that number could almost double .
How then could Africa hope to feed itself , let alone find work and livelihoods for so many ?
" Sexual and reproductive health " – aka population control – has been added to the Millennium Development Goals mainly because it is now understood that without it there is no hope that the other targets will be met .
Africa 's billionth baby , the doom mongers predicted would , if he survived to adulthood , only perish in one of the coming resource wars fought over land or water or oil or minerals , or simply fall victim to the unvarying instability that trails in the wake of over - population .
But there is a counter argument : each new baby is another consumer – and modern economic growth is driven by demand .
The billionth baby is the engine of future prosperity .
As Mo Ibrahim , a Sudanese - born British businessman and philanthropist , points out , each baby is a potential worker : " Africa is underpopulated .
We have 20 % of the world 's landmass and 13 % of its population .
We have a bulge of young people and that brings to the marketplace a huge workforce , whereas Europe 's population is ageing .
We need to focus on education and training . "
It is big , concentrated populations that have contributed to explosive economic growth rates in China and India .
Get the policies right , he suggested ( and his focus is on improving governance ) and the billionth baby could yet enjoy a secure old age .
The argument made by the Mo Ibrahim Foundation is that rising mineral prices will lead to the exploitation of Africa 's vast natural resources .
Put in the right structures of governance and the old post - colonial basket cases like Angola , Democratic Republic of the Congo and southern Sudan will become growth centres .
In the short - term , rising populations may pose economic and social difficulties , but at nearly 5 % a year , Africa 's average economic growth already outstrips the global north and incomes are starting to reflect that .
Analysis of the Asian tiger economies shows a whole series of overlapping change and development that created the ideal circumstances .
The age profile of the population is one of them .
This is the " demographic dividend " , the moment when the economically active in a population outnumber economically inactive dependents , whether young or old .
For that to happen , however , the rate of population growth must slow .
From China 's one - child policy and Mrs Ghandi's forced sterilisations of the mid-70s , powerful forces imposed smaller families .
Smaller families both allow and incentivise parents to earn money rather than to eke out a living from the soil .
Population growth in India has fallen from 4 % in the 1960s to about 1.7 % now .
Policy makers dream of a country with the world 's second largest population at 1.1 billion people by 2050 .
But the average number of children in a family is still too high , some fear .
A " replacement " policy , a " two per family norm " is the policy makers ' objective .
China is at the peak of its population dividend .
The average income for people between 20 and 30 has risen by a third .
There are about 300 million under 30 years old and it is their consumption patterns that stimulate economic development .
China is about to hit the wall of an aging population that by 2030 might begin to slow its growth .
In India , half the population is younger than 25 .
Between now and the moment perhaps in about 20 – 30 years ' time , when rising prosperity starts to raise life expectancy , there is a window where a corner can be turned , where producers become consumers and economic growth takes off .
At the end of the period , if development is to be sustainable , the population needs to be balanced and stable – neither too broad a base at the bottom of the graph , nor at the top .
Slowing Africa 's population growth is the challenge .
" Population growth is a bigger problem than HIV / Aids , " one expert told the UN Kampala conference .
Large families are not just a cultural tradition ; they are evidence of status and masculinity , part of an individual 's identity .
Some speakers ridiculed the idea of " behaving like Europeans " and restricting themselves to one or two children .
There are practical as well as cultural reasons for large families .
For the 80 % in sub-Saharan Africa who are subsistence farmers with no state to support the ill or elderly in their family , to have many children is simply a sensible insurance policy , a source of labour first and an old age pension later .
Uganda is one of a handful of African countries where the population , now 33 million , is predicted at the least to treble in the next 30 years .
Yet like Mo Ibrahim , president Yoweri Museveni calls his country 's population growth " a great resource " .
And when his wife , Janet , in a piece of soaring irony , opened the Kampala conference she spoke hardly at all of the need for contraception beyond ruing the way it was misunderstood in her country .
Mrs Museveni promotes a form of natural birth control called Moon Beads , a system by which women avoid sex at moments of peak fertility .
Many Ugandans feel it is a singularly inappropriate method in a country where women too often have no sexual autonomy and where half of all conceptions are unwanted .
More babies are born in Uganda ( where abortion is still illegal ) than almost any other country , trailing only Somalia , Afghanistan and East Timor .
Educating women is one important strategy for slowing population growth .
There is a direct correlation between the level of education and the number of children a woman has .
Improving maternal health , lowering infant mortality and extending the interval between pregnancies all contribute to smaller families along with raising confidence that babies will survive into adulthood .
Uganda has now introduced universal secondary education and is beginning to improve provision of condoms .
The second element is ensuring that economic growth is equitable .
Inequitable growth can be as destabilising as no growth as excluded groups exacerbate regional and political tensions .
In Uganda , the north and east already feels victim of discrimination .
If southern Sudan ( where regional inequalities are also a major source of unrest ) reverts to civil war , there are some who see conflict spreading across east Africa .
Mo Ibrahim may be right that a growing population could contribute to future prosperity .
But without a sharp fall in the rate of growth , it looks as if getting to it will be a painful journey .

The standfirst and final paragraph were amended on 12 April 2010 to reflect the earlier change .
When then Marine Lieutenant Colone
Roosevelt Lafontant first started pushing the idea of a space plane for the U.S. Marine Corps in 2002 , skeptics did n't even bother to suppress their laughter .
But now , with a Concept of Operations ( CONOPS ) — a formal military document that lays out how a particular weapon system would be used — and a completed , but not yet released Pentagon road map for the technology , people are beginning to take note of the Small Unit Space Transport and Insertion , or SUSTAIN , the notional concept of a Marine space plane .
" Then the laughing subsided , " says Lafontant , who now works at Schafer Corporation .
" People were really talking about it , and then it got serious .
Then we finally got a CONOPS ; the laughter stopped completely , and people started jumping on the technology bandwagon . "
After decades of unsuccessful development , military space planes are finally getting some respect .
On April 19 the U.S. Air Force plans to launch the X - 37B , an unmanned space plane that will circle the planet a classified number of times before making an autonomous landing .
( Popular Mechanics profiled the effort as the magazine 's cover story in April . )
The idea of a pop-up reconnaissance platform , to be used if a satellite is not available or is disabled , is an importantrationale for the Air Force 's project .
The Marines ' space plane takes the Corps ' slogan of " first to fight " to the extreme :
It could transport a squad of Marine riflemen to anyplace on earth within 2 hours , and then extract them after their mission is complete .
Though the goal is appealing — imagine delivering well - armed Marines at hypersonic speed to a suspected Osama bin Laden hideout or besieged embassy — the concept seemed outlandish to many when it was first proposed .
But as strange as sending Marines into space might sound , it would not be the first time that the Marine Corps has succeeded in pushing a seemingly impossible aircraft .
It was , after all , the Marine Corps that pushed the V - 22 , a tilt - rotor aircraft that takes off like a helicopter and lands like an airplane , over the objections of skeptics , even keeping it alive when then defense secretary Dick Cheney tried to kill it .
Similar to the V - 22 , the concept of the Marine space plane has been driven by ardent supporters , and not always with the full support of their superiors .
Along with Lafontant , Franz Gayl , the Marine Corps science and technology advisor , has been another driving force behind the concept .
Though it 's not part of his official portfolio , Gayl has dedicated his spare time to shepherding the concept to completion .
The Pentagon 's National Security Space Office is now putting the finishing touches on a road map for the space plane .
Though SUSTAIN shares some commonalities with the X - 37B space plane , built by Boeing , it has also focused on drawing in the " new space " companies .
At a 2009 meeting sponsored by the National Security Space Office ( NSSO ) and Air Force Security Forces Center at Lackland Air Force Base in Texas , government officials and private industry presented the technologies that could contribute to SUSTAIN .
" We 've batted ideas back and forth , " says XCOR Aerospace CEO Jeff Greason , who was at the meeting .
" It 's an interesting challenge and I 've been thinking about technologically how it might be done . "
The idea , says Greason , is not to think of SUSTAIN as a single vehicle that will do everything .
That would hold well beyond the ability of XCOR 's Lynx suborbital aircraft , or any other private space vehicle .
" But if you break it down , so it 's not one vehicle that does a suite of capabilities , but a set of capabilities that might be done by a suite of different vehicles all working together , it begins to look more practical , " he says .
The current generation of private space planes might be able to fill a suborbital mission , but at least for the time being , reaching low Earth orbit — another goal of SUSTAIN — would be out of reach , even for the most ambitious companies .
Burt Rutan , the founder of Scaled Composites , notes that SpaceShipOne and SpaceShipTwo do n't go anywhere near the Mach 25 needed to get to orbit .
They could be placed atop a booster , but they are not designed to withstand the thermal loads of re-entry .
" They would not be very good at placing satellites in orbit , " Rutan wrote in an e-mail when asked about the possibility .
" A designer would do better to start from scratch . "
The concept also faces major bureaucratic hurdles .
The Pentagon has committed no funding to the concept , nor even developed a formal requirement for such a space plane , a critical prerequisite for getting it funded .
And the National Security Space Office , which created the technology road map , still has n't signed off and released on the formal document .
But for Lafontant , even getting the concept this far is a major accomplishment .
And the plan might serve as a springboard for other space planes to join the Air Force 's X - 37B .
SUSTAIN , Gayl says , is n't primarily about a Marine space plane , it 's about developing reusable launch vehicles .
" The Marines just happened to be the first to document the need formally , " he says .
" SOCOM and Air Force Security Forces have indicated interest ; each has different applications and uses in mind . "

Pink Floyd , pictured in 1967 , the year they signed to EMI Pink Floyd tracks may be removed from digital music services like iTunes after a High Court ruling .
Their latest record deal , signed with EMI before legal downloads came along , said individual songs must not be sold without the band 's permission .
They argued that the same rule should apply to digital sales as well as CDs .
EMI disagreed but a judge has sided with Pink Floyd .
The ruling is part of a long - running battle between the two sides over £ 10 m in unpaid royalties .
EMI said it had not yet been ordered to stop selling single Pink Floyd tracks .
That may come at a later stage in the case , however .
In court , Chancellor Sir Andrew Morritt said the contract contained a clause to " preserve the artistic integrity of the albums " .
He said the contract meant EMI were " not entitled to exploit recording by online distribution or by any other means other than the original album , without the consent of Pink Floyd " .
The band largely avoided releasing singles during their career , instead preferring fans to listen to entire albums such as Dark Side of the Moon , which has sold more than 35 million copies around the world .
Pink Floyd tracks have been available on download stores like iTunes EMI has been ordered to pay £ 40,000 ( $ 60,000 ) costs .
The band were not present to hear the judgment at the High Court in London .
An EMI statement said : " Today 's judgment does not require EMI to cease making Pink Floyd 's catalogue available as single track downloads , and EMI continues to sell Pink Floyd 's music digitally and in other formats .
" This litigation has been running for well over a year and most of its points have already been settled .
" This week 's court hearing was around the interpretation of two contractual points , both linked to the digital sale of Pink Floyd 's music .
But there are further arguments to be heard on this and the case will go on for some time . "
Earlier this week , Robert Howe QC , appearing for the group , said the the band 's deal with EMI stipulated that their " seamless " albums should not be split up and that they " wanted to retain artistic control " .
Elizabeth Jones QC , appearing for EMI , disagreed and said the word " record " in the band 's contract " plainly applies to the physical thing - there is nothing to suggest it applies to online distribution " .
There was a coherence in the content as an album - tracks were dropped because they did n't fit in with the whole thing
Peter Jenner
Former Pink Floyd manager
The issue of selling individual tracks online has been a thorny one for many artists , who want their albums to be seen as complete works .
Bands also receive less money if fans pick and choose tracks instead of buying a full suite of songs .
It is believed to be one reason why The Beatles - whose catalogue is also owned by EMI - have not appeared in download stores like iTunes .
Garth Brooks and AC / DC are among the others who have objected to their albums being split up .
Peter Jenner , who managed Pink Floyd when they first signed with EMI in the 1960s , said releasing complete albums was important to the band .
" Clearly in cases like the Floyd , there was a coherence in the content as an album , " he told BBC 6 Music .
" Tracks were dropped because they did n't fit in with the whole thing .
I think that was quite common , especially in the 70s and 80s . "
Mr Jenner , now emeritus president of the International Music Managers ' Forum , predicted that the ruling would be significant .
" I think it will give the artists some ammunition to get the record companies to be a bit fairer with the royalty treatment they give artists for digital work . "

Jacqui Smith was voted in as Redditch MP in 1997
The people of Redditch want a new MP and are ready to say goodbye to Jacqui Smith , the Conservative and Liberal Democrat candidates for the town say .
Ms Smith won the seat in 1997 with a majority of 6,125 which fell to 2,484 in 2001 .
In 2005 she had a 2,716 majority .
She stood down as Home Secretary last year after criticism over her expenses .
Eight candidates are fighting for the Redditch seat and the Lib Dems and Tories said residents wanted a change .
But Ms Smith said she recognised she had had a " tough year " but was keen to keep serving her constituents .
She said : " I have been immensely honoured to serve the people of Redditch for the past 13 years .
" Despite having had some tough times over the last year , I am very clear it 's up to Redditch people to decide who their MP is , not politically - motivated or newspaper campaigns .
" That 's why I am very happy to be here , out and about , talking to the people about the choice that we face for the future of the town and the surrounding area . "
' Very positive ' Lib Dem candidate Nicholas Lane said he was getting " very positive " feedback about his party when out meeting residents .
" I want to stand up for the people of Redditch in London and look at the issues they want me to look at , " he said .
" I think people are looking for a change and on the doorstep I 'm getting a very positive response about my party and its policies .
" I think the Liberal Democrats stand a very good chance in Redditch . "
Conservative candidate Karen Lumley said last year 's county council election results were a good indicator for her party .
" I think people are ready for a change , " she said .
" We 've seen in county council elections last year that Redditch actually took a full slate of Conservative councillors - the only constituency to do that and that 's because people are up for a change , are up for different people to represent them . "
• Candidates so far announced for Redditch are : UK Independence Party : Anne Davis ; British National Party : Andy Ingram ; Liberal Democrats : Nicholas Lane ; Conservatives : Karen Lumley ; English Democrats : Vincent Schittone ; Labour : Jacqui Smith ; Independent : Paul Swansborough ; Green Party : Kevin White .

What ’s the surest sign that robots aspire to be more like humans ?
They play video games .
The Tetris - Bot operates completely without human interference to play games of old school Tetris on a computer .
Creator Branislov Kisacanin patched together a webcam , a digital signaling processing board , and some NXT Lego as a fun educational project for his kids .
Best . Dad. Ever .
Do n’t worry about your high score just yet though , Tetris - Bot is still stuck on level 1 .
Heh , we ’ve all been there .
Watch the Lego robot demo its burgeoning skills in the video below , with the Tetris - Bot itself appearing around 1:48 .
Released just in time for National Robotics Week , Kiscanin ’s setup is a sweet piece of engineering .
The visual processing takes place in the TI DSP board ( DM6437 ) which analyzes the screen and decides the next move in span of just 1 frame ( ~33 ms ) .
The board then communicates with the NXT robotic components via LED lights .
According to comments on Kiscanin ’s YouTube channel , the key - punching robot is capable of 3 strokes a second , but runs at about half that speed .
Which means that Tetris - Bot has room for easy improvement .
It may soon be seen defeating level one and making its way to the leaderboard .
The Lego Mindstorm series is being used to build some amazing devices .
We ’ve seen robots that can solve the Rubik ’s cube and Sudoku at break neck speeds , as well as Lego ATMs and a Lego Flexpicker !
I know of one researcher who ’s even developing a humanoid face out of Lego that can interact with its environment .
The Tetris - Bot is just one more example of how these “ childhood toys ” have moved out of the range of simple building blocks and become a versatile platform for amateur robotics .
Hopefully they ’ll stay focused on defeating the games of yesteryear and not their human masters .

As part of a show titled Replay on Fox Sports Net , Catholic Central and Trenton High School will re-play a game stopped in 1999 from a gruesome injury that nearly cost Trenton 's Kurt LaTarte his life .
The game was stopped and no winner was declared following the stoppage .
Gatorade and Fox Sports have teamed up to let the teams go at it , 11 years later .
This time around , the coaches will be Detroit Red Wings legends Brendan Shanahan and Scotty Bowman .
I had the great honor of talking to the NHL's all - time leader in wins for coaches , Scotty Bowman , via phone yesterday about the Replay episode and of course the Red Wings .
You can bet I was nervous / thrilled / terrified to talk to the coach with more Stanley Cup rings than the rest of the active head coaches in the league combined .
WIM : You 've coached some of the best teams in the history of the NHL , how does the 2001 - 2002 Red Wings team rank as far as your coaching experiences ?
Scotty Bowman :
It 's not easy in the NHL to go and have a regular season and top it off with a Stanley Cup .
We had great teams before , one in '95 that won 62 games , but you can't say it was as good a team because they did n't win the final game .
The rest of the interview with Bowman is after the jump ...
WIM : How long before the 2002 Cup did you know you were retiring ?
SB : Around February of that same year .
It was an Olympic year and we had an Olympic break for about 10 days and that 's when I kind of decided in my own mind .
I did n't want to have it hanging over everybody 's head for the next couple of months so I just did n't mention it .
WIM : How hard was it coaching the team the season following Vladimir Konstantinov 's injury ?
Surely it was an emotionally charged but also very driven locker room .
SB : It was a tough situation because after finally winning a Stanley Cup after so long and not being able to really have as much fun with it .
The fact that it was within a week after the Cup win that he had that really terrible accident with Sergei Mnatsakanov so it was a tough time for the team .
They rallied behind him and he did appear quite a bit during the next season .
To top it off , in the last game he was there and the players recognized how much he meant to the team and it was a heartwarming feeling for everyone that he was on the ice to share in the Cup win .
WIM : Which Red Wing would you say was the most coachable in terms of doing what was asked of him and a willingness to learn ?
SB : It would not be fair just to name one .
Obviously , the captain Steve Yzerman was a huge part of any team that I was with because of the way he took the opportunity to play offense and defense .
We were fortunate that present - captain Nick Lidstrom has been a standout for the team for the last 18 years .
There were a lot of leaders on that team but Steve was the one that really got everyone going .
They just knew what such an honest player he was .
WIM : Which player had the most impact on you as a coach ?
Throughout your entire career , not necessarily just with the Red Wings .
SB : I had so many [ players ] that it 's hard to pick one because I 've been with different teams .
Every team had leaders and you do n't win without leaders .
Having a Mario Lemieux with you was special as well and Montreal had a lot of great players at the same time so it 's hard to pick out one .
WIM : A lot of the critics have said that the Red Wings " dynasty " is at the end of its run .
Do you see that being the case or is it just a new era of great hockey beginning in Detroit ?
SB : There 's a lot of parity in the league right now and to be able to stay up and be a contender year in and year out .
I do n't know if " dynasty " is a fair word as much as is " consistency " .
It 's not easy now because the system has changed and the game has changed .
Not only has there been a new [ Collective Bargaining ]
Agreement but the game has changed itself with so many different changes in the rules .
When you have all those changes , to keep up the pace is a special feeling .
I think they 've proved they 've got a lot of good players in the system and they make the right changes at the right time .
You need leadership though , your experienced players are so important to the team .
WIM : As some of the Red Wings like Lidstrom , Holmstrom , Draper , Maltby and Osgood are getting towards retirement , where do you see the team going over the next few years ?
SB : You 've got to keep bringing in new players and they do that .
They make them play in the minors and they 've got good players on their list that are n't here now .
Players in college , players in Europe .
Players have to come from everywhere and at the same time you have to let them develop .
All of a sudden if players retire on you , you have to have replacements .
WIM : Along the same lines , which young player on the Red Wings excites you most in terms of his potential future ?
SB : Some of their top players are pretty young .
They 're not old and that 's what people get fooled with .
Obviously , their goaltender has played really well for them , Jimmy Howard is involved in the balloting for top rookie .
WIM : How do you see the rest of the playoffs playing out for Detroit ?
SB : Well you know you go game by game .
The first round is not easy ; you look through the league and you see all those 5 , 6 , 7 game series that are going to be coming up .
There have been a couple of 6's already , with San Jose winning and Pittsburgh beating Ottawa but they went to six games .
There 's a couple that could even go to seven and I think that shows the parity in the league .
Let 's face it , as you eliminate teams , the next team gets tougher .
WIM : Can you talk a little bit about the game being replayed ?
SB : These teams played in ' 99 .
Detroit Catholic Central and Trenton , a big high school rivalry .
The game was called , a 4 - 4 tie with 10 minutes to go due to an injury to a player on one of the team .
Gatorade is running a re-play situation , if you want to know about it , replaytheseries .com tells you all about it .
These players on both teams have been training now for six weeks .
They 're going to rehash the game played in '99 so they 're getting pretty excited about it .
They 're under programs run by Gatorade 's Sports Science Institute .
Ken Holland 's son , Brad Holland , played in the game and he will be playing for Catholic Central .
A huge thanks to Scotty Bowman for taking the time out of his busy schedule to talk with me about the Red Wings and his coaching experiences in the past as well as the new opportunity in the Replay game .
Truly a dream come true to interview a legend such as him .
Starting Tuesday , employed residents of New York City homeless shelters will be charged rent .
A family of three making $ 25,000 / year will have to pay $ 926 / month .
The worst part : Mike Bloomberg is your new landlord .
Take that , homeless people !

Dimona ’s Buried Nuclear Waste Spreads Cancer and Sterility in Southern Hebron and Negev GAZA , July 6 , 2004 ( IPC + Agencies ) - - Nearly 70 cancer cases and the sterile rate soared to 62 % among males and females in the villages south of Hebron was mainly caused by the nuclear waste buried by Israel in Hebron 's mountains .
Many physicians and officials south of Hebron City , adjacent to the Negev Desert , warned of the growing number of people afflicted with cancer and attributed the cause to the nuclear radioactive wind the region .
The Palestinian villages located south of Hebron 's mountains witnessed a growing number of cancer cases and unprecedented mutation rates as most of the specialists said that it is likely due to environmental pollution .
The professor ( Y.A ) of physics and a specialist of atomic science said that the air in southern Hebron is contaminated by the nuclear radioactive leakage as the area is very close to the Israeli Dimona reactor and to the nuclear waste dumps in the area .
There are no cement blocks around the reactor operating to lower the hazardous impacts of such high radioactivity .
The professor recited the case of his mother who died of visceral cancer , and after a check up , the cause was mainly due the high rates of radioactive elements .
The radioactivity has a tremendous power that could penetrates to the genes of the human , affecting the chromosome that are inherited generation after generation .
Dr. Mahmoud Sa’ada , the co-founder of the Palestinian Medical Relief , was quoted by the Al Nakab daily as saying , “ I am a general physician who has been working for 30 years in Al Thaheryia adjacent to Hebron and I could ascertain that during the last years most of the cancer cases has no other diagnosis but nuclear radioactivity . ”
He added , “ now there are 70 cancer cases in Al Thaheryia admitted to Beit Jala hospital .
Recently , a baby was born with red colored half face , and after examining each case it ’s hardly to attribute the case to inherited deformations . ”
Meanwhile , the rate of sterility has been notably increased to 62 % in the villages south of Hebron due to the radioactivity .
Israel has always had a policy of nuclear ambiguity , saying only that it will not be the first country to introduce nuclear weapons to the region .
Late of last June , the Israeli cabinet approved to distribute iodine - based tablets to people living near the Israeli nuclear reactors to give them some protection in case of radioactive leakage .
The pills were to be given to people living near the Dimona reactor , in the southern Negev Desert and those close to the Nahal Sorek nuclear plant , southwest of Jerusalem , officials said on condition of anonymity .
I srael has had nuclear technology for decades but refused to comment on reports of obtaining nuclear weapons .
In 1986 , former Dimona technician Mordechai Vanunu provided photographs and descriptions of the reactor to The Sunday Times magazine in London .
Based on Vanunu 's material , experts said at the time that Israel has the world 's sixth - largest stockpile of nuclear weapons .
The Director of the International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA ) , Dr. Mohamed ElBaradei , is due to arrive in Israel on Tuesday to discuss a nuclear - free Middle East but the Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon said earlier today that Israel has no intentions of deviating from its present nuclear policy .
Sharon spoke to the Israeli Army radio hours before the visit of IAEA director , where he said that Israel 's ' nondisclosure ' policy would be maintained and that Israel has all the weapons it needs to protect itself .

This is a powerful appeal by Gabrielle Bouliane who performs for the audience at the Austin Poetry Slam .
This was her last public performance .
Gabrielle was diagnosed with Stage Four Cancer shortly before this video was filmed .
She died in January 29 , 2010 surrounded by family and friends , and apparently her passing was in a very quiet , peaceful room full of love and affection .
This is one of the “ better ” viral videos as it contains a real message .
Her message is simple : “ Do not wait .
If you do n’t start today , get the fuck up walk out the door and change your life to the best it can be , then when ?.
Do n’t you dare waste your fucking time . ”

BRACE yourself for more winters like the last one , northern Europe .
Freezing conditions could become more likely : winter temperatures may even plummet to depths last seen at the end of the 17th century , a time known as the Little Ice Age .
That ’s the message from a new study that identifies a compelling link between solar activity and winter temperatures in northern Europe .
The research finds that low solar activity promotes the formation of giant kinks in the jet stream .
These kinks can block warm westerly winds from reaching Europe , while allowing …
I am aware of two other movies of the Steffan polyderon that one can find online .
The one on Wolfram Math World is a rather crudely done animation .
There is a movie of a paper or cardboard model on YouTube .
You will find explanations of why this is significant if you search the web .
Here is a brief explanation .
Flexibility and rigidity are intuitive concepts .
Imagine putting together a tinker - toy structure , but with ideal joints so the rods are completely free to pivot .
In spite of that freedom , a triangle so constructed is obviously rigid , but a square is not ; it does n't have enough rods , so we say that it is generically flexible .
That kind of flexibility is too easy and not very interesting , so we use only triangles .
Now imagine building a geodesic - dome - like structure out of triangles such that every joint where triangles meet is completely flexible ( the model used here has duct tape for joints ) .
Cauchy proved in 1812 that if it is convex , it must be rigid - in spite of the flexibility of all the joints .
After that proof , people came to believe that there were no flexible polyhedra at all .
But in 1897 R. Bricard discovered three nonconvex octahedra that are indeed flexible , but at a price .
As the dihedral angles vary continuously , the faces intercross , so these octahedra cannot actually exist as authentic objects in real space .
They resemble some of the unreal objects of M. C. Escher .
An example of a real flexible polyhedron , long thought to be impossible , was given in 1977 by Robert Connelly .
This amazing polyhedron is non-generically flexible : it seems to have enough rods ( constraints ) to be rigid but it is not .
Nonetheless , Bricard 's approach remains useful .
The model here of Steffen 's construction was built by Robert Uhrlass , a student at Fordham University in April 2010 .
It is made of aluminum and duct tape .
Thanks Rob !
Making such a model is not easy .
If you do it out of paper or cardboard , the material is too flimsy , bends easily , and is not convincing ; it ends up looking like origami .
If you use thick cardboard , then it is not realistic , the tolerances are small , and you will have a lot of trouble getting it together .
Solving the problem of the joints is not easy either .
It 's great to have a model of aluminum that one can not only move gingerly , but squeeze .

Grids are an invisible foundation that structure the websites we develop and design .
This invisible foundation makes it possible for rapid development , concise code , and a much more organized layout .
Of course you ’re not obligated to use a grid , and grid-less websites are fine if the random structure is intended , however , if avoidance of a CSS grid is due to lack of planning , then users will be able to pick up on that at an instant .
Once you ’ve defined the elements you ’re going to embed into your layout , then experimenting with a variety of grids is encouraged .
Simply because experimentation and curiosity will allow you to find out which grid systems work best for you and your projects .
Benefits of Implementing a Grid System
A Grid…
Gives your design consistency
Allows flexibility between elements
Can make your designs more usable and legible
Reduces CSS coding errors
For the most part , it eliminates the need for nested HTML tables
Can be used sort of like a wireframe allowing you to plan
“ Blesses ” you with cross - browser support
Streamlines your development process for future projects
Acts as an adhesive and encourages the correlation between separate page elements
Makes it easier to embed images , text , and other visual aesthtics

960 Grid System
The 960 Grid System is an effort to streamline web development workflow by providing commonly used dimensions , based on a width of 960 pixels .
There are two variants : 12 and 16 columns , which can be used separately or in tandem .
Download
1 KB Grid
The basic configuration is a 12 column grid system spread out over 960 pixels .
Each column is 60 pixels wide with a 20 pixel gutter in between .
As you would expect , there is a class that corresponds to each of the possible column widths , units 1 through 12 .
The HTML is as minimal as the CSS .
Each column contains a class indicating its width .
Columns are then contained by a row , which serves to clear the floating columns .

The poll , conducted April 8 to 12 , asked residents of Toronto and other GTA communities if they support or oppose privatization of several services , including garbage collection .
Of the 431 Torontonians surveyed , 64 per cent said they support a private company being hired to take away the trash — 41 per cent “ strongly ” favour it — compared with 36 per cent opposing it .
The margin of error for the Toronto sample is plus or minus 4.8 per cent , 19 times out of 20 .
“ We ’re particularly open to the garbage proposal , given the extent to which we felt stung by our public system last summer , ” said Jodi Shanoff , senior vice president of Angus Reid Public Opinion .
“ I would suggest the city ’s experience with the ( CUPE ) unions last summer has left us ... skeptical regarding arguments in favour of unionized jobs and the efficiencies therein .
Recent experiences with the TTC do n’t help either . ”
Currently , curbside residential garbage is collected by a private contractor in Etobicoke , with city employees doing pickups in the rest of Toronto .
Across the GTA as a whole , support for trash pick - up privatization was 65 per cent of 1,351 respondents .
The margin of error for that sample size is plus or minus 2.7 per cent , 19 times out of 20 .
Communities surrounding the city generally contract out more municipal services than Toronto , including curbside garbage pickup in Vaughan .
But that may change .
Privatization has emerged as a big issue in the Toronto mayoral race , with only one of the main contenders , deputy mayor Joe Pantalone , not calling for at least considering it .
Some argue that it would both save money and increase efficiency .
The poll ’s respondents were n’t as strongly in favour of privatizing other services cited — selected TTC bus routes , Toronto Hydro and ski hills — but it ’s far from a taboo subject .
“ When you look across each of the proposals for privatization , there ’s more than an appetite there to discuss them , ” Shanoff said .
Some 37 per cent of the Torontonians polled support privatizing Toronto Hydro , with 63 per cent opposing any notion of selling off the utility .
Mayoral candidate Rocco Rossi has promised to sell Toronto Hydro , which could fetch $ 1 billion , to help pay down Toronto ’s debt .
The poll found people are wary of a proposal Toronto candidate George Smitherman has mused about — having some bus routes operated by a private company .
Fifty - eight per cent of Torontonians opposed that , with only 17 per cent strongly in favour .
Across the GTA , 56 per cent rejected the notion .
“ Even the people who express dissatisfaction with their transit experience are very much on the fence on this issue .
This one ’s not a slam - dunk , ” Shanoff said .
But there is strong support for letting private contractors run municipally owned ski hills .
In Toronto , 66 per cent were in support , while the GTA figure was 67 .

Shanoff noted that , in March , when the City of Toronto proposed contracting out the operations of hills at Centennial Park and Earl Bales Park , there was n’t much backlash .

Abstract
The growing competition and “ publish or perish ” culture in academia might conflict with the objectivity and integrity of research , because it forces scientists to produce “ publishable ” results at all costs .
Papers are less likely to be published and to be cited if they report “ negative ” results ( results that fail to support the tested hypothesis ) .
Therefore , if publication pressures increase scientific bias , the frequency of “ positive ” results in the literature should be higher in the more competitive and “ productive ” academic environments .
This study verified this hypothesis by measuring the frequency of positive results in a large random sample of papers with a corresponding author based in the US .
Across all disciplines , papers were more likely to support a tested hypothesis if their corresponding authors were working in states that , according to NSF data , produced more academic papers per capita .
The size of this effect increased when controlling for state 's per capita R&D expenditure and for study characteristics that previous research showed to correlate with the frequency of positive results , including discipline and methodology .
Although the confounding effect of institutions ' prestige could not be excluded ( researchers in the more productive universities could be the most clever and successful in their experiments ) , these results support the hypothesis that competitive academic environments increase not only scientists ' productivity but also their bias .
The same phenomenon might be observed in other countries where academic competition and pressures to publish are high .

Introduction
The objectivity and integrity of contemporary science faces many threats .
A cause of particular concern is the growing competition for research funding and academic positions , which , combined with an increasing use of bibliometric parameters to evaluate careers ( e.g. number of publications and the impact factor of the journals they appeared in ) , pressures scientists into continuously producing “ publishable ” results [ 1 ] .
Competition is encouraged in scientifically advanced countries because it increases the efficiency and productivity of researchers [ 2 ] .
The flip side of the coin , however , is that it might conflict with their objectivity and integrity , because the success of a scientific paper partly depends on its outcome .
In many fields of research , papers are more likely to be published [ 3 ] , [ 4 ] , [ 5 ] , [ 6 ] , to be cited by colleagues [ 7 ] , [ 8 ] , [ 9 ] and to be accepted by high - profile journals [ 10 ] if they report results that are “ positive ” – term which in this paper will indicate all results that support the experimental hypothesis against an alternative or a “ null ” hypothesis of no effect , using or not using tests of statistical significance .
Words like “ positive ” , “ significant ” , “ negative ” or “ null ” are common scientific jargon , but are obviously misleading , because all results are equally relevant to science , as long as they have been produced by sound logic and methods [ 11 ] , [ 12 ] .
Yet , literature surveys and meta- analyses have extensively documented an excess of positive and / or statistically significant results in fields and subfields of , for example , biomedicine [ 13 ] , biology [ 14 ] , ecology and evolution [ 15 ] , psychology [ 16 ] , economics [ 17 ] , sociology [ 18 ] .
Many factors contribute to this publication bias against negative results , which is rooted in the psychology and sociology of science .
Like all human beings , scientists are confirmation - biased ( i.e. tend to select information that supports their hypotheses about the world ) [ 19 ] , [ 20 ] , [ 21 ] , and they are far from indifferent to the outcome of their own research : positive results make them happy and negative ones disappointed [ 22 ] .
This bias is likely to be reinforced by a positive feedback from the scientific community .
Since papers reporting positive results attract more interest and are cited more often , journal editors and peer reviewers might tend to favour them , which will further increase the desirability of a positive outcome to researchers , particularly if their careers are evaluated by counting the number of papers listed in their CVs and the impact factor of the journals they are published in .
Confronted with a “ negative ” result , therefore , a scientist might be tempted to either not spend time publishing it ( what is often called the “ file - drawer effect ” , because negative papers are imagined to lie in scientists ' drawers ) or to turn it somehow into a positive result .
This can be done by re-formulating the hypothesis ( sometimes referred to as HARKing : Hypothesizing After the Results are Known [ 23 ] ) , by selecting the results to be published [ 24 ] , by tweaking data or analyses to “ improve ” the outcome , or by willingly and consciously falsifying them [ 25 ] .
Data fabrication and falsification are probably rare , but other questionable research practices might be relatively common [ 26 ] .
Quantitative studies have repeatedly shown that financial interests can influence the outcome of biomedical research [ 27 ] , [ 28 ] but they appear to have neglected the much more widespread conflict of interest created by scientists ' need to publish .
Yet , fears that the professionalization of research might compromise its objectivity and integrity had been expressed already in the 19th century [ 29 ] .
Since then , the competitiveness and precariousness of scientific careers have increased [ 30 ] , and evidence that this might encourage misconduct has accumulated .
Scientists in focus groups suggested that the need to compete in academia is a threat to scientific integrity [ 1 ] , and those guilty of scientific misconduct often invoke excessive pressures to produce as a partial justification for their actions [ 31 ] .
Surveys suggest that competitive research environments decrease the likelihood to follow scientific ideals [ 32 ] and increase the likelihood to witness scientific misconduct [ 33 ] ( but see [ 34 ] ) .
However , no direct , quantitative study has verified the connection between pressures to publish and bias in the scientific literature , so the existence and gravity of the problem are still a matter of speculation and debate [ 35 ] .
To verify this hypothesis , this study analysed a random sample of papers published between 2000 and 2007 that had a corresponding author based in the US .
These papers , published in all disciplines , declared to have tested a hypothesis , and it was determined whether they concluded to have found a “ positive ” ( full or partial ) or a “ negative ” support for the tested hypothesis .
Using data compiled by the National Science Foundation , the proportion of “ positive ” results was then regressed against a sheer measure of academic productivity : the number of articles published per-capita ( i.e. per doctorate holder in academia ) in each US state , controlling for the effects of per-capita research expenditure .
NSF data provides an accurate proxy of a state 's academic productivity , because it controls for multiple authorship by counting papers fractionally .
Since the probability for a paper to report a positive result depends significantly on its methodology , on whether it tests one or more hypotheses , on the discipline it belongs to and particularly on whether the discipline is pure or applied [ 36 ] , these confounding effects were controlled for in the regression models .
Discussion
In a random sample of 1316 papers that declared to have “ tested a hypothesis ” in all disciplines , outcomes could be significantly predicted by knowing the addresses of the corresponding authors : those based in US states where researchers publish more papers per capita were significantly more likely to report positive results , independently of their discipline , methodology and research expenditure .
The probability for a study to yield a support for the tested hypothesis depends on several research - specific factors , primarily on whether the hypothesis tested is actually true and how much statistical power is available to reject the null hypothesis [ 38 ] .
However , the geographical origin of the corresponding author should not , in theory , be relevant , nor should parameters measuring the sheer quantity of publications per capita .
Although , as discussed below , not all confounding factors in the study could be controlled for , these results support the hypothesis that competitive academic environments increase not only the productivity of researchers , but also their bias against “ negative ” results .
All main sources of sampling and methodological bias in this study were controlled for .
The number of papers from each state in the sample was almost perfectly correlated with the actual number of papers that each state produced in any given year , which confirms that the sampling of papers was completely randomised with respect to address ( as well as any other study characteristic including the particular hypothesis tested and the methods employed ) , and therefore that the sample was highly representative of the US research panorama .
The total number of papers , total R&D and total number of doctorate holders were completely uncorrelated to the proportion of positive results , ruling out the possibility that different frequencies of positive results between states are due to sampling effects .
Although the analyses were all conducted by one author , expectancy biases can be excluded , because the classification of papers in positive and negative was completely blind to the corresponding address in the paper , and the US states ' data were obtained by an independent source ( NSF ) .
We can also exclude that the association between productivity and positive results was an artifact of the effects of methodologies and disciplines of papers ( which are elsewhere shown to be significant predictors of positive results [ 36 ] ) , because controlling for these factors increased the size and statistical significance of the regression , suggesting that the effect is truly cross-disciplinary .
In sum , these results are likely to represent a genuine pattern characterising academic research in the US .
An unavoidable confounding factor in this study is the quality and prestige of academic institutions , which is intrinsically linked to the productivity of their resident researchers .
Indeed , official rankings of universities often include parameters measuring publication rates [ 39 ] ( although the validity of such rankings is controversial [ 40 ] , [ 41 ] ) .
Therefore , it could be argued that the more productive states are also the ones hosting the “ best ” universities , which provide better academic structures ( laboratories , libraries , etc … ) and more advanced and stimulating intellectual environments .
This could make scientists better at picking up the right hypotheses and more successful in testing them , increasing their chances to obtain true positive results .
Separating this quality - of - institution effect from that of bias induced by pressures to publish is difficult , because the two factors are strictly linked : the best universities are also the most competitive , and thus presumably the ones where pressures to produce are highest .
However , the quality - of - institution effect is unlikely to fully explain the findings of this study for at least two reasons .
First , because if structures and resources are really important , then positive results should also tend to increase where more R&D expenditure is available , but a negative ( though non statistically significant ) trend was observed instead .
Second , because the variability in frequency of positive results between states is too high to be reasonably explained by the quality factor alone .
At one extreme , states yielded as few as 1 in 4 papers that supported the tested hypothesis , at the other extreme , numerous states reported between 95 % and 100 % positive results , including academically productive ones like Michigan ( N = 54 papers in this sample ) , Ohio ( N = 47 ) , District of Columbia ( N = 18 ) and Nebraska ( N = 13 ) .
In absence of bias of any kind , this would mean that corresponding authors in these states almost never failed to find a support for the hypotheses they tested .
But negative results are virtually inevitable , unless all the hypotheses tested were true , experiments were designed and conducted perfectly , and the statistical power available were always 100 % – which it rarely is , and is usually much lower [ 42 ] , [ 43 ] , [ 44 ] , [ 45 ] , [ 46 ] .
As a matter of fact , the prestige of institutions could be expected to have the opposite influence on published results , in analogy with what has been observed by comparing countries .
In the biomedical literature , the statistical significance of results tends to be lower in papers from high - income countries , which suggests that journal editors tend to reject papers from low - income countries unless they have particularly “ good ” results [ 47 ] .
If there were a similar editorial bias favouring highly prestigious universities in the US – and some studies suggest that there is [ 9 ] , [ 48 ] – then the more productive states ( prestigious institutions ) should be allowed to publish more negative results .
A possibility that needs to be considered in all regression analyses is whether the cause - effect relationship could be reversed : could some states be more productive precisely because their researchers tend to do many cheap and non-explorative studies ( i.e. many simple experiments that test relatively trivial hypotheses ) ?
This appears unlikely , because it would contradict the observation that the most productive institutions are also the more prestigious , and therefore the ones where the most important research tends to be done .
What happened to the missing negative results ?
As explained in the Introduction , presumably they either went completely unpublished or were somehow turned into positive through selective reporting , post - hoc re-interpretation , and alteration of methods , analyses and data .
The relative frequency of these behaviours remains to be established , but the simple non-publication of results is unlikely to be the only explanation .
If it were , then we should have to assume that authors in the more productive states are even more productive than they appear , but wastefully do not publish many negative results they get .
Since positive results in this study are estimated using what is declared in the papers , we cannot exclude the possibility that authors in more productive states simply tend to write the sentence “ test the hypothesis ” more often when they get positive results .
However , it would be problematic to explain why this should be the case and , if it were , then we would still have to understand if and how negative results are published .
Ultimately , such an association of word usage with socio-economic parameters would still suggest that publication pressures have some measurable effect on how research is conducted and / or presented .
Selective reporting , reinterpreting and altering results are commonly considered “ questionable research practices ” : behaviours that might or might not represent falsification of results , depending on whether they express an intention to deceive .
There is no doubt that negative results produced by a methodological flaw should either be corrected or not be published at all , and it is likely that many scientists select or manipulate their negative results because they sincerely think their experiments went wrong somewhere – maybe the sample was too small or too heterogeneous , some measurements were inaccurate and should be discarded , the hypothesis should be reformulated , etc …
However , in most circumstances this might be nothing more than a “ gut feeling ” [ 49 ] .
Moreover , positive results should be treated with the same scrutiny and rigour applied to negative ones , but with all likelihood they are not .
This latter form of neglect is probably one of the main sources of bias in science .
Adding an interaction term of discipline by productivity did not increase the accuracy of the model significantly .
Although we are currently unable to measure the statistical power of interaction terms in complex logistic regression models , the lack of significance suggests that large disciplinary differences in the effect of publication pressures are unlikely .
Interestingly , however , some interdisciplinary variability was observed : Pharmacology and Toxicology , and Neuroscience and Behaviour had a significantly stronger association between productivity and positive results compared to Space Science .
Of course , since we had 20 disciplines in the model , the significance of these two terms could be due to chance alone .
However , we cannot exclude that a study with higher statistical power could confirm this result and reveal other small , but nonetheless interesting differences between fields .
This study focused on the United States primarily because they are one of the most scientifically productive countries , and are academically diversified but linguistically and culturally rather homogeneous , which eliminated the confounding effect of editorial biases against particular countries , cultures or languages .
Moreover , the research output and expenditure of all US states are recorded and reported by NSF periodically and with great accuracy , yielding a reliable dataset .
Academic competition might be particularly high in US universities [ 1 ] , but is surely not unique to them .
Therefore , the detrimental effects of the publish - or - perish culture could be manifest in other countries around the world .
Materials and Methods
The sample of papers used in this study was part of a larger sample used to compare bias between disciplines [ 36 ] .
Papers within this latter were obtained with the following method .
The sentence “ test * the hypothes * ” was used to search all 10837 journals in the Essential Science Indicators database , which classifies journals univocally in 22 disciplines .
Only papers published between 2000 and 2007 were sampled .
When the number of papers retrieved from one discipline exceeded 150 , papers were selected using a random number generator .
In one discipline , Plant and Animal Sciences , an additional 50 papers were analysed , in order to increase the statistical power of comparisons involving behavioural studies on non-humans ( see below for details on methodological categories ) .
By examining the abstract and / or full - text , it was determined whether the authors of each paper had concluded to have found a positive ( full or partial ) or negative ( null or negative ) support .
If more than one hypothesis was being tested , only the first one to appear in the text was considered .
We excluded meeting abstracts and papers that either did not test a hypothesis or for which sufficient information to determine the outcome was lacking .
All data was extracted by the author .
An untrained assistant who was given basic written instructions ( similar to the paragraph above , plus a few explanatory examples ) scored papers the same way as the author in 18 out of 20 cases , and picked up exactly the same sentences for hypothesis and conclusions in all but three cases .
The discrepancies were easily explained , showing that the procedure is objective and replicable .
To identify methodological categories , the outcome of each paper was classified according to a set of binary variables : 1 - outcome measured on biological material ; 2 - outcome measured on human material ; 3 - outcome exclusively behavioural ( measures of behaviours and interactions between individuals , which in studies on people included surveys , interviews and social and economic data ) ; 4 - outcome exclusively non-behavioural ( physical , chemical and other measurable parameters including weight , height , death , presence / absence , number of individuals , etc… ) .
Biological studies in vitro for which the human / non - human classification was uncertain were classified as non-human .
Different combinations of these variables identified mutually exclusive methodological categories : Physical / Chemical ( 1 - N , 2 - N , 3 - N , 4 - Y ) ; Biological , Non-Behavioural ( 1-Y , 2 - Y/N , 3 - N , 4 - Y ) ; Behavioural / Social ( 1- Y , 2 - Y/N , 3 - Y , 4 - N ) , Behavioural / Social + Biological , Non-Behavioural ( 1-Y , 2 - Y/N , 3 - Y , 4 - Y ) , Other methodology ( 1 - Y/N , 2 - Y/N , 3 - N , 4 - N ) .
Disciplines were attributed based on how the ESI database had classified the journal in which the paper appeared , and the pure - applied status of discipline followed classifications identified in previous studies ( for further details see [ 36 ] ) .
From this larger sample , all papers with a corresponding address in the US were selected , and the US state of each was recorded .
Data on state academic R&D expenditure , number of doctorate holders in academia and number of papers published were taken directly from the State Indicators section of the Science and Engineering Indicators 2006 report [ 37 ] .
This report compiles data from three different sources : Thomson ISI - Science Citation Index and Social Sciences Citation Index ; National Science Foundation , Division of Science Resources Statistics - Survey of Doctorate Recipients ; National Science Foundation , Division of Science Resources Statistics - Academic Research and Development Expenditures .
When counting the number of papers by state , NSF corrects for multiple authorship by dividing each paper by the number of institutions involved .
The scoring of papers as “ positive ” and “ negative ” was completely blind to the corresponding author 's address .
As explained in the Results section , data from other reports were extracted and used for sensitivity analyses .
Statistical analyses
The ability of independent variables to predict the outcome of a paper was tested by standard logistic regression analysis , fitting a model in the form : in which p i is the probability of the ith paper of reporting a positive result , X 1 is the number of papers published per capita ( per doctorate holder in academia ) in the state of the corresponding author of the ith paper , X 2 is the ith paper 's state R&D expenditure per capita , and X n represents the various characteristics of the ith paper that were controlled for in the models ( e.g. dummy variables for methodology , discipline , etc… ) as specified in the Results section .
Statistical significance of the effect of each variable was calculated through Wald 's test .
Except where specified , all parameter estimates are reported with their standard error .
The relative fit of regression models was estimated with Nagelkerke 's adjusted R2 .
Multicollinearity among independent variables was tested by examining tolerance and Variance Inflation Factors for all variables in the model .
All variables had tolerance ≥0.42 and VIF ≤ 2.383 except one of the methodological dummy variables ( Tolerance = 0.34 and VIF = 2.942 ) .
To avoid this ( modest ) sign of possible collinearity , methodological categories were reduced to the minimum number that previous analyses have shown to differ significantly in the frequency of positive results : purely physical and chemical , biological non-behavioural , and behavioural and mixed studies on humans and on non-humans [ 36 ] .
This removed any presence of collinearity in the model .
All analyses were produced using SPSS statistical package .
Figures Confidence intervals in the graphs were obtained independently from the statistical analyses , using the following logit transformation to calculate the proportion of positive results and standard error :
Where p is the proportion of negative results , and n is the total number of papers .
Values for high and low confidence interval were calculated and the final result was back - transformed in percentages using the following equations for proportion and percentages , respectively :
Where x is either P logit or each of the corresponding 95 % CI values .

… In which I use genetic algorithms to search for optimal LLVM optimizer passes to make Haskell programs faster …
On a sunny day last Spring , I spent some time playing with genetic algorithms ( GAs ) for breeding faster Haskell programs , by improving the inlining hints suggested to GHC .
The results were pretty cool : the GA found new inlining settings for existing Language Benchmark Game programs — that had already been heavily scrutinized — improving both programs I tried , and in one case , by 18 % .
Now , 12 months later , it ’s again a sunny Spring day , and we ’ve got quite a few new tools to play with in the Haskell world , for working on interesting performance puzzles :
Today we ’ll see what more we can extract from the LLVM backend .
GHC Overview
LLVM has a massive suite of low level optimizations , most of which were previously unavailable to the Haskell programmer .
GHC has become , in a way , a Haskell to C– to LLVM compiler .
( C– is translated to LLVM bytecode , which is then optimized using classic optimizations prior to code generation ) .
To a first approximation , the LLVM optimizer implements Muchnik ( recommended reading ) , and GHC has just imported 25 years of imperative language optimizations .
This is exciting for me .
First GHC does masses of source to source transformations on the Haskell Core language ( including , e.g. fusion and constructor specialization ) , before translating Core to C– , an imperative language interface between high - level compilers and optimizing code generators .
Some transformations take place here , before spitting out LLVM bytecode using David Terei ’s LLVM backend to GHC ( PDF ) .
By default GHC just passes - O3 to the LLVM optimizer , which enables a number of passes , including :
interprocedural sparse conditional constant propagation .
combine instructions to form fewer , simple instructions
dead code elimination and basic block merging
bottom - up inlining of functions
promoting “ by reference ” arguments to be “ by value ” argument
transformeing tail recursive calls to local jumps
reassociating commutative expressions in an order that is designed to promote better constant propagation ,
loop identification and simplification
a number of SSA analsyis passes
loop invariant code motion
Now , it is entirely unclear to me whether the default set of optimization passes enabled by llvm - O3 are suitable for the kind of code GHC generates , and I ’m not alone in suspecting they ’re not ideal .
With the GCC backend , we were mostly out of luck in having control over the low level optimizations .
The GCC optimization pipeline was n’t terribly programmable , but LLVM lets us run any analysis or transformation pass in any order we want .
Which LLVM passes to use , and which order to run them , with what analysis in between , is a huge search problem , though .
There are roughly 200 optimization and analysis flags , and these , mostly , can be run in any order , any number of times .
If we want to run say , twenty of the passes ( about what - O3 does ) , that ’s what , about 10 ^ 46 arrangements !
So the challenge is to find a set of optimizations that catch some of the idioms in GHC ’s generated code , and to hopefully find ways to make Haskell programs even faster .
Making it into a search problem
So I ’ll use the approach I took in 2009 for the inlining problem , and use the genetic algorithm library , acovea , to breed the best set of flags for a few programs , where fitness for breeding is determined by total runtime .
In this post I ’m using GHC head , with the LLVM patch ( more info in this post ) , and a custom patch to remove the default - O3 passed to LLVM .
I first have to give a specification of the flags to GHC + LLVM .
Here ’s the specification for GHC / LLVM flags that I am going to use — and you can use it too .
Note that LLVM allows us to specify the entire optimization pipeline order on the commandline , including duplicate phases .
I do n’t think Acovea will apply flags multiple times ( no duplicate flags ) .
We ’ll see if that matters .
The acovea set of libraries are fairly widely available now , e.g. in Arch Linux .
For more background on acovea , see the previous post on inlining — it ’s easy to build if not packaged for your distro .
Computing fitness
The programs we want to improve have to report their fitness .
To do this I ’ll use criterion ’s timing function , wrapping up the code we actually want to optimize in some measurement functions .
This will just report total wall clock running time for the code under analysis .
We could make our fitness function more robust to noise by using criterion ’s sampling and iteration framework , which will run the core code sufficiently often to remove noise .
I have notes at the end on what my ideal tool for this looks like .
A warm up : sum of a sequence
To warm up , and see if this stuff works , I ’ll begin with the toy program from last week ’s fusion post .
There , GHC fuses two loops into one , but it fails to collapse that final loop into a constant ( something that GCC - O3 can do to manually fused C code ) .
It ’s a good test program to see how loops are handled in a new backend .
GHC + GCC is n’t able to spot that the loop is a constant either , however , but maybe GHC + LLVM can .
I do n’t know what flag I ’ll need to have this happen , so let ’s run the GA to explore the search space …
First , the code , wrapped in the measurement function :
import qualified Data .
Vector as U import Criterion .
Measurement import Text .
Printf -- code under analysis : sum [ 1..n ] on vectors .
-- v = U.sum $ U.enumFromTo 1 ( 100000000 :: Int ) main = do d <- time_ $ v `seq` return ()
putStrLn ( secs ' d)
secs ' :: Double ->
String secs ' k | k < 0 = ' -' : secs ' ( - k ) | otherwise = printf " %.3 f " k
We can compile and run this by hand :
$ ghc - Odph -- make ex1.hs - fforce - recomp [ 1 of 1 ] Compiling Main ( ex1.hs , ex1.o ) Linking ex1 ... $ time ./ex1 0.111 ./ex1 0.12s user 0.01s system 101 % cpu 0.122 total
While it computes the sum , it prints its fitness .
Note that it removes any startup or IO cost incurred in measurement .
When compiled with standard Haskell optimizations , and the existing native code generator , the program runs in 122 ms .
The LLVM backend does better , with its default optimizations added to the mix :
$ ghc - Odph -- make ex1.hs - fforce - recomp - fllvm - optlo - O3 [ 1 of 1 ] Compiling Main ( ex1.hs , ex1.o ) Linking ex1 ... $ time ./ex1 0.051 ./ex1 0.06s user 0.00s system 98 % cpu 0.061 total
However , despite the value being a constant , llvm - O3 has n’t removed the loop .
Here ’s the assembly of the inner loop :
. LBB1_2 : leaq 1 ( %rsi ) , %rax addq %rsi , %r14 cmpq $ 100000001 , %rax jge .
LBB1_5 addq $ 2 , %rsi addq %rax , %r14 .
LBB1_1 : # %tailrecurse cmpq $ 100000001 , %rsi jl .LBB1_2
So I take the code , and wrap it up in the GA tool , then go off and do other things for a few hours :
$ time runacovea - input ex1.hs - config /home / dons / share/libacovea/config/ghc-6_12.acovea
I chopped out the data and graphed it for you .
Look at how the mean running times reduced in each generation .
It quickly drops down to the llvm - O3 plateau , then marches past that to turn the loop into a constant .
Optimistic options : - optlo- globalopt ( 1.723 ) - optlo- loop - unswitch ( 1.866 ) - optlo- mem2reg ( 2.536 ) - optlo - prune-eh ( 1.627 ) Pessimistic options : - optlo-adce ( - 1.862 ) - optlo-licm ( - 1.623 ) - optlc -O1 ( - 1.528 ) - optlc -O3 ( - 2.149 ) Common : - Odph - O2 - funbox - strict - fields - fllvm - optlo - O2 - optlo- globalopt - optlo - mem2reg - optlo - prune-eh
Once it was done , 4 hours later , I was pretty excited .
Look what happened by generation 12 !
Instead of averaging say , 50ms a run , it was averaging 3 ms a run .
By generation 16 , there was no run time at all .
LLVM did it !
It must have found a way to eliminate the loop entirely .
The flags it recommended were :
-optlo-globalopt - optlo-loop - unswitch - optlo - mem2reg - optlo - prune-eh
So let ’s try these out :
$ ghc ex1.hs - Odph -- make - fforce - recomp - fllvm - optlo - O2 - optlo - globalopt - optlo - loop - unswitch - optlo - mem2reg - optlo - prune -eh $ time ./ex1 5000000050000000 ./ex1 0.01s user 0.00s system 114 % cpu 0.006 total
Bam !
Digging around in the assembly , which is munged in all sorts of ways , there it is :
movabsq $ 5000000050000000 , %r14 # imm = 0x11C3793ADB7080
The sum from 1 to n was computed at compile time by GHC and LLVM .
Now , it is unclear to me why these optimizations where what was needed — and I seem to get the constant produced with other flags after - optlo - O2 as well ( loop - unswitching , mem2reg ) .
So my theory is that many of these passes share a common clean up phase , which is actually doing the work .
Anyway , there it is : better code than we ’ve ever convinced either - fasm or - fvia - C to generate .
I think this is the limit case for what the GA can do .
We know enough information was available statically to compute the entire computation , and standard optimization techniques would get us there .
It was just a matter of getting the flags right .
It will be interesting to see what improvements the GA can find in code that is less obviously amenable to tweaking .
More realistic ?
Let ’s trying summing a stream of random numbers — so there ’s no clever closed form solution for LLVM to find .
Can it just , in general , improve loops in Haskell ?
First , the source :
import qualified Data .
Vector as U import qualified Data .
Vector .Random .
Mersenne as R import System.Random.Mersenne.Pure64 -- compute the sum of a large vector of randoms generated -- with the mersenne twister .
-- sums g = U.sum ( R.randoms g 10000000 :: U.Vector Int ) main = do g <- newPureMT print ( sums g )
A vector is generated using the Mersenne Twister , containing 10^7 random 64 bit integers .
We then sum those values .
GHC fuses this into a single loop where accumulation and random generation are interleaved .
That means it is very simple code .
Just a loop , a call to the mersenne twister , and an accumulator .
There should n’t be that much to improve on .
I launch Acovea on it , as before , and 4 hours later we have :
Optimistic options : - optlo- mem2reg ( 1.914 ) - optlo- scalarrepl ( 2.413 ) Pessimistic options : - optlo -O1 ( - 2.577 ) - optlo -O2 ( - 2.64 ) - optlo -O3 ( - 2.515 )
Very interesting .
the default optimization flags reduce running times , according to Acovea .
Let ’s check that :
$ ghc -- make - Odph - fllvm - optlo - O3 ex2.hs $ time ./ex2 4460916339009010646 ./ex2 0.31s user 0.00s system 90 % cpu 0.347 total
And with the “ common options ” that were suggested :
$ ghc -- make - Odph - O2 - funbox - strict - fields - fllvm - optlo - memdep - optlo - abcd - optlo - loop - unroll - optlo - mem2reg - optlo - scalarrepl $ time ./ex2 4322192527286846546 ./ex2 0.28s user 0.01s system 97 % cpu 0.302 total
So it found a 13 % improvement over the default llvm flags .
Sum of Squares
Now , something relatively serious , the sum of squares of a random vector .
First , in Haskell .
-- compute the sum of squares of a vector .
-- sumsq g = U.sum ( U.map ( \x -> x * x ) vector ) where vector = R.randoms g 10000000 :: U.Vector Int
GHC then fuses the three loops here ( generation , mapping and summing ) , into a single loop with no allocations , which is then ready for low level optimizations .
After crunching away for 4 hours , Acovea recommends :
Optimistic options : - optlo - loop - reduce ( 1.59 ) - optlo- scalarrepl ( 2.079 ) Pessimistic options : - optlo -O1 ( - 2.591 ) - optlo -O2 ( - 2.537 ) - optlo -O3 ( - 2.591 ) - optlc - O0 ( - 2.591 ) - optlc - O1 ( - 1.722 )
With regular flags , we get :
$ ghc - v0 -- make - fforce - recomp - O2 - funbox - strict - fields - fllvm - optlo - O3 - optlc - O3 ex3.hs $ time ./ex3 8241655411004882824 ex3 0.30s user 0.01s system 96 % cpu 0.315 total
And indeed , it ’s “ best of the best ” , we get faster code :
$ ghc - v0 -- make - fforce - recomp - Odph - O2 - funbox - strict - fields - fllvm - optlo- disable - inlining - optlo - basicaa - optlo - basiccg - optlo- count - aa - optlo - domfrontier - optlo - domtree - optlo-globalsmodref - aa - optlo- memdep - optlo - no - aa - optlo- postdomtree - optlo-codegenprepare - optlo- abcd - optlo - functionattrs - optlo - block - placement - optlo - constmerge - optlo-constprop - optlo - die - optlo- dse - optlo - globaldce - optlo- globalopt - optlo- indvars - optlo - inline - optlo-ipconstprop - optlo- ipsccp - optlo- lcssa - optlo- loop - deletion - optlo - loop - index - split - optlo- loop - unroll - optlo- loop - unswitch - optlo- loopsimplify - optlo - mem2reg - optlo- memcpyopt - optlo - scalarrepl - optlo-tailcallelim ex3.hs $ time ex3 4829650279590649126 ex3 0.29s user 0.01s system 100 % cpu 0.296 total
Finding , again , 10 % or so .
And though this is a little more complex ( 3 arguments in the loop , instead of two ) , GHC turns this :
sumsq g = U.sum ( U.map ( \x -> x * x ) vector ) where vector = U.enumFromN 1 10000000 :: U.Vector Int
with the same set of flags as the first version , into something that goes from running 228 ms with default LLVM flags to 14 ms with the flags found by Acovea in the first example ( which seem to work really well for enumerations ! ) .
Summary
The LLVM optimization layer for GHC adds a huge amount of mostly untapped potential .
The optimization space is huge , and using a GA or similar approach to custom - optimize particular programs can be useful for finding common flags , or special purpose flags for niche applications ( like scientific simulations ) .
One downside is that it can take quite a while to find a solution .
We could speed things up in at least two ways :
Additionally , we do n’t yet have a way to generate multiple passes ( maybe we should run - optlo - $ foo 10 times ! ) .
GHC just keeps running its optimizer until the code stops changing , maybe we need a similar approach with LLVM ?
I also speculate that the large loop bodies generated through significant fusion should give LLVM some good straight line code to work on .
My next step is to wrap up this approach into a simple Haskell library , modelled on Criterion , such than Haskeller can easily try this :
import Evolution main = evolve main '
which will take ‘ main ’ , and start evolving the flags used to compile it , against the current GHC / LLVM spec .
It will use criterion to compute the fitness in a robust way ( so you do n’t need to worry about short or long running times ) , and at the end will generate a graph of the evolution , and a recommended set of flags to use in future .
That ’ll be useful to a few people .
We could then apply this tool to all of nofib to compute a general set of useful LLVM flags to use for everyone .
Finally , there ’s still much scope to improve the bytecode going into LLVM , so that more of the analysis phases will fire .
Any Summer of Code students interested ?
LLVM also supports plugins loaded on the command line .
I ’d love to be able to write new passes in Haskell , and load them into LLVM on the fly .
This might really make it easy to try out some new FP - specific passes on the SSA - alike representation .
Another good Summer of Code project …
The LLVM optimizing backend is fun !

Update : Brian Alexik Arrested in Los Angeles
Via : Los Angeles Times :
LAPD officers surrounded a downtown L.A. hotel and took into custody an elusive suspect that police have likened to Jason Bourne , the fictional secret agent known for his daring getaways and high - tech gadgetry in a series of films played by Matt Damon .
Police have been looking for Brian Alexik for nearly two months , ever since they allegedly found weapons and counterfeit cash inside his loft , which is located right outside the Federal Reserve building in downtown L.A .
LAPD sources told The Times that police surrounded a hotel off Hewitt Street near Little Tokyo and eventually detained Alexik as well as a girlfriend .
He is now being questioned .
Streets in the area had been blocked off by police .
LAPD Capt .
Steve Sambar said police officers earlier Thursday noticed a woman who matched the description of Alexik ’s girlfriend near the hotel .

Update : Tile Mosaic Replica of CIA Emblem On Floor , Hugo Chavez Portrait Hanging Above It
WTF ?
Via : Los Angeles Downtown
News :
When a resident of the Reserve Lofts smelled gasoline emanating from unit 701 in the early evening of April 19 , the Fire Department got a nervous call .
The concerned resident could n’t have known that the act would be the first domino to tumble , ultimately setting off an ongoing manhunt for a figure police warn should be considered armed and dangerous .
When fire and police officials arrived at unit 701 shortly after 6 p.m. , the man inside , 33 - year - old Brian Alexik , refused to open the door .
After unlocking the door with a key , the door remained blocked by a homemade contraption that functioned as a second lock .
By the time police broke down the door with a battering ram , Alexik had fled his unit , apparently escaping via a fire escape .
The source of the fumes was immediately apparent : Alexik , who police say sometimes went by the name Ken Shurin and is of Russian descent , had been using a gasoline - powered electric generator .
But the generator was perhaps the least surprising thing authorities found .
Also in the apartment was approximately $ 15,000 in counterfeit money and the equipment used to make it .
Police officials said the fake bills were of “ high quality . ”
Additionally , there was an AK - 47 , a sawed - off shotgun and other evidence that suggests Alexik was manufacturing weapon parts .
He also had an array of fake identification documents .
Other details in the apartment paint a curious if difficult to interpret portrait of Alexik .
Inlaid on the floor was a handmade tile mosaic replica of the Central Intelligence Agency seal ; it was about five feet in diameter .
Hovering over the CIA emblem was a large , framed portrait of Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez .
As of Los Angeles Downtown News ’ press time on April 30 , the LAPD and Secret Service were still trying to track down Alexik .
Capt .
Steven Sambar , who heads the LAPD ’s Major Crimes Division , said Alexik should be considered “ very dangerous . ”
Three felony charges have been filed , two for possessing the AK - 47 and the shotgun , and one for possessing firearms as a convicted felon .
One Arrest
Police seemed to get their first break in the investigation on Thursday , April 29 , when they arrested 32 - year - old Gregory Koller , who officials suspect has ties to Alexik .
Officials served a search warrant of Koller ’s residence — a converted warehouse at 38th Street and Grand Avenue — at about 6 a.m. and discovered “ items consistent with manufacturing weapons , ” said Sambar .
The raid also yielded drugs including methamphetamine , and counterfeit currency , “ the same items that directly link back to Alexik , ” Sambar said .
Koller was expected to be booked on narcotics charges , and likely faces additional charges tied to the recovered contraband , Sambar said .
Almost two weeks after law enforcement first responded to the Reserve Lofts , many residents of the building were still wondering why dozens of police , firemen and Secret Service agents had responded en masse on April 19 .
“ People are completely on edge , ” said a resident who asked not to be identified because tenants had been asked by the landlord not to speak and feared retaliation .
In the days after Alexik ’s door was knocked in , an unsigned letter went up in the building elevator , asking , “ What really happened on the nights of April 19 and 20 at 409 W Olympic Unit 701 ? ”
It went on to make a slate of allegations — including illegal weapons possession and counterfeiting — that police echoed in a press release more than a week later .
Residents also noted the ironic parallels between Alexik ’s alleged counterfeit operation and the 81 - year - old building ’s history .
Converted into 78 live - work units in 2006 , the building was the former Los Angeles branch of the Federal Reserve Bank .
It ’s not yet clear what authorities are making of Alexik ’s choice to live at the Reserve Lofts .
But Commander Jose Perez , who oversees Central Bureau , pointed out that Alexik ’s unit overlooks the current Los Angeles branch of the Federal Reserve Bank , next door at 950 S. Grand Ave .
Perez , who is not actively involved in the investigation , termed the proximity to the active Federal Reserve location as “ suspicious . ”
Alexik is believed to be about 5 - foot - 10 and weigh about 180 pounds , with brown hair and hazel eyes .
Anyone with information on his whereabouts is urged to call 911 immediately and make no attempt to confront him .
Anyone with other information about the suspect is asked to contact LAPD Major Crimes Division Det. Daniel Logan at ( 213 ) 486-7386 .

Via : Los Angeles Times :
It started 11 days ago when a resident at an upscale downtown L.A. high - rise tower smelled fumes coming from a neighboring apartment .
Firefighters knocked on the neighbor ’s door but he refused to let them in .
They called police , who broke down the door of the penthouse just as the man inside was escaping through a back window and down a fire escape carrying duffel bags .
“ He escaped like Jason Bourne , ” said LAPD Deputy Chief Mike Downing of the Counter - Terrorism Bureau , referring to the movie spy character .
What they found next began a weeklong mystery .
The apartment contained sophisticated counterfeiting equipment as well as a cache of weapons including an AK - 47 .
They also found stacks of counterfeit $ 100 bills totaling $ 15,000 and a camera tripod .
But detectives ’ interest was really heightened when they looked outside the window and saw that the penthouse balcony had a spot - on view of the U.S. Federal Reserve building on Grand Avenue .
Detectives now are searching for the suspect , who leased the $ 3,400 - a- month penthouse , paying one year in advance using stacks of cash .
Detectives are not sure what Brian Alexik , a 33 - year - old New Jersey man , was up to and what role , if any , the Federal Reserve might have played in his schemes .
They are not exactly sure whom they are dealing with because detectives found multiple identifications , including passports , listing different aliases for the man .
“ The curiosity in this case is the strategic location in which he chose to operate , ” Downing said .
Photos found at the apartment show Alexik with significantly different looks .
In one photo , he ’s clean - shaven , holding up a glass of wine and smiling .
Another shows him somewhat heavier , with a beard and bandanna covering his forehead .
Police are now working with the U.S. Secret Service .
Experts who have reviewed the counterfeit money say it ’s of extremely high quality .
It appears Alexik kept to himself .
The apartment manager declined to comment on the case .
The LAPD served search warrants at several downtown locations and Thursday announced the arrest of a man whom officials describe as an “ associate ” of Alexik .
Gregory Koller , 32 , was booked on suspicion of narcotics possession .
Police said a search of his home and a downtown warehouse found evidence of “ items consistent with manufacturing weapons . ”
LAPD Capt .
Steven Sambar , head of the department ’s major crimes division , said there evidence was also found linking Koller to Alexik .
Detectives said they were puzzled about many aspects of the case .
Sambar said it appeared that the pair were involved in weapons and drugs as well as counterfeiting — but it was unclear how large the operation was or whether it was connected to a larger criminal enterprise .
Sambar said the location of Alexik ’s apartment overlooking the Federal Reserve “ causes me great concern . ”
The Federal Reserve bank in downtown L.A. is one of several branches of the 12th District of the Fed , which is based in San Francisco .
According to the Fed ’s website , the L.A. branch has 316 employees and serves financial institutions in Southern California , Arizona and southern Nevada .
The 12th District as a whole processed 17.2 billion currency notes in 2008 , or about 68.4 million notes per business day .
No breakdown was available for currency handled specifically by the L.A. office .
It all leaves many intriguing possibilities .
“ There were many levels of criminality , ” Downing said .
“ He ’s funding a criminal enterprise .
He ’s dabbling in narcotics , he ’s manufacturing weapons parts .
But what is it ?
Was there a bigger plan ?
What was his intent ?
We have a lot of questions for him when he is arrested . ”
“ The men found me a pair of rubber boots and a roll of plastic bags which I turned into a poncho to keep the morning dew from soaking my clothes .
“ My job , which began at 7 a.m. , was topping , suckering and weeding .
“ The flower had to be broken off the top and the suckers had to be gleaned from the leaf .
The suckers look like little shoots of romaine lettuce .
“ One of my co-workers , El Nino , was divorced last year but remains a loyal father by supporting four children ages 17 , 16 , 12 and 4 .
He wants the kids to get an education to escape a life of dead - end jobs in Mexico .
Being in the U.S. for so long a time destroyed El Nino ’s marriage , but lack of work in Mexico left him little choice but to sign up for the H2A guest worker program . ”
Thus Baldemar Velasquez , founder and president of the Farm Labor Organizing Committee ( FLOC ) , described the first of seven days he spent last month as an anonymous field laborer .
His aim was to see firsthand the conditions faced by tobacco workers in North Carolina where they are paid $ 7 a day .
He continued : “ All day I was nervous about the nicotine and tar .
The ‘ Green Monster , ’ as they know it here , is nicotine poisoning ingested through the skin .
I was lucky to find some light gloves with grips on them .
They lasted a day .
I had to throw them away as they were sticky and black with what would have been on my hands . ”
Velasquez said that on his third day “ the heat was as bad as anything I can remember .
By 8 a.m. I was soaking wet in part because of having to wear the plastic bag again .
“ The sun felt like a flame thrower on my back .
The men looked beat , breathing with their mouths open with teeth showing and their shirts drenched in sweat .
The top half of my pants was soaked in sweat by 8:30 a.m .
It is easy to see why men can die of heat stroke . ”
Two days after his stint ended Velasquez ’s hands were still swollen and covered with blisters .
He worried about how long it would take for him to make a fist without “ serious pain . ”
Tobacco workers , led by FLOC and joined by supporters from organized labor and community organizations , marched through the streets of Winston - Salem , North Carolina yesterday to demand fair treatment and justice .
They marched , they say , because for 3 years Susan Ivey , CEO of Reynolds , the nation ’s second largest tobacco company , has refused to meet with the FLOC to discuss ending the abuse in the tobacco fields .
Tobacco workers live in poverty , they say , and suffer from both nicotine poisoning and exposure to deadly pesticides and chemicals .
There are nine documented cases of heat stroke deaths in the North Carolina fields over the last two years .
“ The conditions these workers face are not only a tragedy but a moral disgrace hidden from the majority of Americans , ” said Velasquez , vowing , “ FLOC will campaign until Reynolds Tobacco commits to joining us in addressing this national shame . ”
James Andrews , president of the North Carolina AFL - CIO , said the labor movement in his state is in full support of FLOC .
“ Each year , ” Andrews said , “ thousands of tobacco workers are effected by green tobacco sickness and by over exposure to harmful chemicals in tobacco leaves .
Many of these workers never receive medical attention and the vast majority of North Carolina farm workers are not covered under workers ’ compensation insurance . ”
FLOC ’s cooperation with the “ traditional ” labor movement extends well beyond the borders of North Carolina .
The organization was represented at the AFL - CIO ’s 2009 convention in Pittsburgh last September .
FLOC represents thousands of immigrant farm workers in their push for living wages and improved working conditions .
Members harvest a variety of products , including tobacco and tomatoes .
In 2006 FLOC won union recognition for 7,000 migrant workers in North Carolina .
It is currently seeking to organize at least 15,000 more in the state .

Remedy Entertainment 's Alan Wake has been a long time coming .
Originally announced in 2005 , the psychological thriller from the developers of Max Payne has seen numerous delays and dropped the PC version along the way .
But if our time spent with the game during a preview event in Toronto is any indication , the game is finally on the right track .
The game looks and feels like what might happen if Stephen King ever decided to make a game .
It 's set in a small town in the Pacific Northwest and stars a best - selling author struggling with his next novel .
He discovers a manuscript from a book he does n't remember writing , and before long , the town is overrun with dark creatures ripped straight from those pages .
Oskari Häkkinen , Remedy 's Head of franchise development , described Alan Wake as having " the body of a cinematic action game and the mind of a psychological thriller . "
It plays out like a third - person action game with a heavy emphasis on the power of light .
Since the enemies in the game gain power in the shadows and are harmed by light , it 's an integral part of the gameplay .
" Light is a combat tool and a safe haven , " Häkkinen explained .
" You fight with light . "
This plays out in several ways .
Alan can take refuge under lamp posts , which will both heal him and protect him from enemies — provided they do n't take an axe to the lamp and destroy it all together — and there are hints scattered throughout the game written in light - sensitive paint .
It also has a major impact on the weapons in the game .
Your go - to weapon is a flashlight , which harms enemies slightly and slows them down enough so that you can get in a couple of shots with your revolver .
But much more satisfying is the flare gun .
Hitting an enemy with a flare causes it to be engulfed in a glorious explosion of light , though it does have the drawback of needing to be reloaded after every shot .
And at one point Alan even takes hold of a spotlight , wielding it like a turret to take out swaths of foes .
The game is n't shy about its influences , going so far as to quote Stephen King at the opening of the game .
Häkkinen also noted both Twin Peaks and Lost as major influences , but he was quick to point out that Lost had more of an impact in terms of its structure as opposed to its narrative , so do n't expect much in the way of time - travel or alternate timelines .
Instead , the game is structured a lot like a serial drama .
It 's divided into episodes — complete with " previously on Alan Wake " at the outset and " to be continued " at the end — features a large cast of supporting characters , and Häkkinen even frequently referred to the game as " season one . "
Of course , this led us to ask whether or not a sequel is being planned .
While Häkkinen could n't confirm this , he did say that it did n't make sense to develop a game for five years and not create a sequel .
But whether or not it will actually get released depends entirely on how successful Alan Wake ends up being .
He did confirm , however , that Remedy will be releasing some downloadable episodes , which will serve as a " bridge " between seasons one and two .
Häkkinen also said that if Remedy does end up releasing a sequel , it wo n't take another five years .
Another point that Häkkinen emphasized is that Alan Wake is a thriller and not a horror game .
" Horror is about blood and gore , " he explained .
" Thriller is n't about what 's happening but what 's going to happen . "
One of the ways that the developer is going to create that sort of thriller - style tension is by messing with the player 's expectations .
The tension will often build because you 'll expect something to happen , but many times nothing will .

From what we saw , it looks like Alan Wake will live or die based on its atmosphere and storytelling .
From the demo it's clear that Remedy has the former down , but , given the nature of the story , Häkkinen was understandably quiet when it came to specifics of the narrative , so it 's tough to gauge that aspect .
But the developers have definitely done an excellent job of cherry - picking elements from various pieces of pop culture and making it their own .
Let 's just hope the final product will be able to stand on its own .
Alan Wake will be released exclusively for the Xbox 360 on May 18 .

Many people want to make a difference today but aren`t sure how to go about it .
The good news is : little changes can add up to big improvements and here are eight easy ways to make a big difference with just a little effort .
In fact , if everyone were doing them , it would change the whole equation .
Leading GMO researcher , Jeffery Smith tells us if only five percent of the population abandoned GMO foods it might be enough to encourage many food manufacturers to drop them as ingredients .
Widespread avoidance is one way to put those who are genetically manipulating our food right out of business , while saving our health and natural foods for generations to come .
( Confused about hidden GMOs ?
Check out the guide at the end ... )
Aside from the fact that humans aren`t designed to digest animalsthat most animals are improperly fed and drugged , farm animals are an enormous source of pollution .
Raising farm animals produces more global emissions than all of the transportation worldwide .
Rainforests are also regularly cleared for these animals headed for dinner plates .
Processed foods create problems in the body , while nature`s unprocessed foods are healthy and healing .
If taste is stopping you from dropping processed foods , it`s a sign that you need learn some more food preparation techniques .
Healthy eating can be delicious .
When you are truly internally cleansed , disease is not common .
When you are filthy inside , disease is the natural result .
Unfortunately , you can see where most of the population stands on this .
As a bonus , as more of the population begins taking responsibility for their own internal cleanliness , it will end the funneling of billions of dollars to drug , chemotherapy , and radiation companies .
It will also keep millions of profit dollars from being directed to government officials who , these days , are creating many pro-drug , anti-food , and anti-health laws .
Composting returns nutrients to the earth and is an easy backyard project .
On a larger scale , compost needs to be utilized by farmers and added to their soils .
Healthy soils have far fewer pest problems , so composting easily decreases the " need " for pesticides and helps keep chemicals off our foods .
Since a large portion of " trash " is compostable , composting also dramatically decreases what`s sent to landfills .
Having a few fruit trees , vegetable plants , and herbs growing in your yard brings you closer to your food supply .
And with the entire neighborhood doing it , it`s a great way to create community by sharing the results .
It`s also a much better use of water than growing grass .
Chemicals from plastic easily get lodged inside our bodies and they create many health problems .
Since a great deal of plastic isn`t recycled , it ends up in our oceans creating the Great Atlantic and Pacific Garbage Patches .
Many animals will thank you too ; these died because their stomachs contained so much plastic that there wasn`t any room for food .
http://www.chrisjordan.com/current_set2.php?...
Buy organic whenever possible to limit your chemical exposure .
Start reading the ingredients and buy what`s natural - based on the ingredients - not what the seller says on the front of the package .
Use plants to clean your air , not chemical - based air fresheners .
Use baking soda and white vinegar to clean your home , instead of store bought chemicals .
There are hundreds of small changes you can easily make that add up to a lot less chemical contamination in your body and in the environment .

Kim Evans is a natural health writer and author of Cleaning Up !
The Ultimate Body Cleanse offers deep cleansing and using methods in this book , people have gotten rid of dozens of different types of health problems , as well as just losing excess weight , thinking more clearly , and feeling better .
Kim 's next book chronicles events in her life that happen to match patterns in the Bible .
She 's also found three places in the Bible that tell us its about these patterns and even asking you to match them .
Here 's a little from the upcoming book ...
In Isaiah 22:20 , it says , " And it must occur in that day that I will call my servant , namely Elia . "
But , because these prophecies are cryptic and they are n't meant to be understood until they are understood , it 's only the last three letters .
A few lines later , it says , " From the land of Kittim it has been revealed to them .
" Here , you just take out any three middle letters , and again , it 's the name of the person bringing you this message , or the sacred secret of the prophecy .
Actually , if you take those two passages , Kim is about the only name you can get from both of them .
In Numbers 1:1  1:18 , it 's talking about " the family " and mentions Pagiel .
It also twice mentions February 1st , ( Kim 's birthday ) and then says that the youngest is 20 years old .
Kim 's little sister Paige is currently 20 years old .
In Chronicles 1 11:20 it mentions the brother of Joab and then in the same sentence uses the word brandishing .
Kim 's middle name is Jo and her older sister 's name is Brandi .
There are other patterns to her sisters too but these sort of mention them by name .
Of course , it helps if you know that there is a magical spiritual reality available that comes deep cleansing and often major dietary upgrades .
It 's also why Jesus was teaching the same thing , if you find his teachings in the Essene Gospel of Peace .
In this text , he even says things like , " You 'll never see the father unless you clean your colon . "
But , this is paraphrased ...
In the Bible Jesus says things more like , happy are those who wash their robes , as they can enter the tree of life .
The tree of life is elsewhere explained as God 's paradise .
He also said , first clean the inside of the cup and then the outside will also be clean .

OPINION : Incinerator threatens jobs and limits consumer choice – but taxpayers will lose most if it proceeds as planned , writes BRENDAN KEANE
UNDER THE terms of its contract with Dublin City Council , Covanta will benefit very significantly from the development of the Poolbeg project .
It is therefore not surprising that Scott Whitney , president of Covanta Europe , paints a very benign picture of the development while criticising those who have raised genuine concerns about the project ( “ Poolbeg waste plant can only be good for Ireland ” , Opinion and Analysis , April 6th ) .
The reality , however , is different .
The incinerator threatens jobs , recycling and consumer choice .
However , it is the taxpayer who will be the major loser if the incinerator goes ahead as planned .
The supporters of Poolbeg ignore vital facts and Whitney ’s recent article is no exception .
The assertion that we have or need to incinerate 700,000 tonnes ( 2008 landfill data ) of waste in Poolbeg is untrue .
By 2013 , of this amount only approximately 200,000 tonnes will be available from the Dublin local authorities for incineration .
The balance will be treated by diverse operators in facilities that they have developed or are developing , including composting , energy from waste and mechanical biological treatment .
By 2013 , all Dubliners will have three bins for collection , which will ensure that waste segregation occurs .
It ’s nonsense , therefore , to claim that Irish Waste Management Association members are wedded to landfill .
Association members have invested € 500 million in the last 10 years in a range of waste management processes .
This diversity of solutions and competition in the waste sector has led to lower costs for the consumer , has been good for the environment and employment , and was confirmed in a High Court judgement in December 2009 .
Covanta ’s assertion that Poolbeg will create 50 jobs is true but at the expense of many more .
Poolbeg threatens a range of alternative facilities , including mechanical biological treatment , where waste is sorted and recyclable and compostable elements are removed .
Some 1,000 jobs in these facilities are under threat due to Poolbeg .
In addition , proposed levies will ensure that incineration and landfill are more expensive than more sustainable recycling , re-use and prevention .
Whitney rubbishes concerns regarding the contract between Covanta and Dublin City Council .
This “ put or pay ” contract means that the local authority must supply 320,000 tonnes of waste to Poolbeg , each year for 25 years , or pay a penalty .
However , with developments in recycling as outlined above , the local authority will simply not have this much waste to send to Poolbeg .
Independent estimates show the authority will have approximately 200,000 tonnes of incinerable material by 2013 .
The 120,000 tonne shortfall between this amount and the higher level agreed under the contract will have to be paid for by taxpayers or Dublin ratepayers , a point that the Minister for the Environment has also confirmed .
In glossing over these concerns , Covanta asked the public to trust their “ experience and expertise ” .
However , many of the concerns that the association raised have come to pass in locations where Covanta operates .
In Lake County , Florida , the local authority must deliver waste to their Covanta - operated incinerator under a “ put or pay ” contract or face significant penalties .
The authority has to obtain waste from outside their area to meet the demand of the plant , as local waste generation levels fall .
Recycling has also dropped to a low level of 20 per cent .
We should pay attention to this case , as in Dublin we have targeted a 60 per cent recycling rate and yet the Poolbeg project is similar in scale to the Lake County facility .
Of even more concern is the incinerator in Harrisburg , Pennsylvania , where a local authority may apply for bankruptcy protection to deal with the huge repayments arising from the Covanta - operated incinerator .
If Poolbeg is constructed as planned , jobs will be lost , recycling will decline and the local authority will end up subsidising the operation of the plant with taxpayers ’ money .
In addition , there will be less choice and less competition in the waste market , which is bad news for consumers and taxpayers .
The alternative is to yield to common sense and resize the project .
The incinerator was conceived in the 1990s .
Times have changed .
Waste is valuable .
We can generate employment and valuable revenue from what we throw away , we can have healthy competition in the waste sector , and we can become a European leader in recycling .
Or we can let these benefits go up in smoke .
Brendan Keane is spokesman for the Irish Waste Management Association

MLB Commissioner Bud Selig issued the following statement regarding McGregor 's death :
“ On behalf of Major League Baseball , I am very saddened by the sudden and unexpected passing of Keli McGregor .
As President of the Colorado Rockies , Keli was one of our game ’s rising young stars .
He was a great athlete and equally great as a baseball administrator .
Also , he was a great human being .
All of baseball will miss him .
I offer my condolences and deepest sympathies to his family , friends and the Rockies ball club . ”
[ Updated at 2:02 p.m . ]
The Colorado Rockies released a statement saying the team 's president , Keli McGregor , was in Utah on a business trip with team chairman & CEO Charlie Monfort and executive vice president Greg Feasel when he died .
The team said it had no more details on the circumstances surrounding his death .
“ Words cannot describe the level of shock and disbelief that we all are feeling this morning at the loss of Keli , ” Monfort said .
“ Our thoughts , our prayers are with Lori and the entire family as we all try to cope and understand how such a tragic loss could occur with such a wonderful man . ”
[ Posted at 1:21 p.m. ]
Keli McGregor , president of the Colorado Rockies baseball team , was found dead in his hotel Tuesday morning .
Police received a call before 9 a.m. that a man had been found unconscious at the Grand America hotel in downtown Salt Lake City , Utah , police spokesman Detective Rick Wall told CNN .
Wall said paramedics and and fire officials responded to the hotel but were unable to revive McGregor .
He said the cause of death was not known .
Officials told CNN affiliate KMGH that the cause of his death is under investigation but McGregor 's appeared to be from natural causes , possibly a heart attack .
McGregor was found alone and there were no obvious signs of foul play , KMGH reported .
McGregor , 48 , has been the team 's president since October 2001 and had been with the organization for 15 years , according to the team 's website .
The Rockies website says McGregor was raised in Colorado and joined the Rockies organization after he worked for four years as an athletic director at the University of Arkansas .

Photo essay and story by Jagath Dheerasekara
March 28 , 2010 -- Newcastle , Australia --
A mass community protest at the biggest coal port in the world , Newcastle , succeeded in preventing coal ship movements all day .
Hundreds of peaceful protesters occupied the harbour from 10 am .
Naomi Hodgson , spokesperson for organisers Rising Tide Newcastle , said : “ Today was scheduled to be a busy day in the world 's busiest coal port .
Ordinarily , there would have been at least four or five coal ships moving in or out of Newcastle harbour today , but instead there were none .
This an amazing demonstration of the power of peaceful mass action by the community .
Hundreds of people united to protest the rapid expansion of the Australian export coal industry – this country 's number one cause of climate change . ”
“ We succeeded in not only shutting down the harbour , but in showing the political leaders in this country exactly what true leadership on climate change looks like .
If Australia is serious about climate change , we will put an urgent stop to the expansion of coal , and begin replacing this devastating industry with safe and renewable alternatives . ”
Australia 's coal exports account for more greenhouse pollution than all onshore sources combined according to environment activists and scientists .

MIAMI -- The Miami Dolphins released two linebackers Friday and successfully courted a third , Karlos Dansby .
One of big prizes on this year 's market , Dansby reached an agreement with Miami on a five - year deal after visiting the Dolphins in the opening hours of NFL free agency .
Dansby 's contract is worth $ 43 million , and a league source told ESPN NFL Insider Adam Schefter that includes $ 22 million in guaranteed money , which makes him one of the highest paid inside linebackers in the game .
A second - round draft pick by Arizona in 2004 , Dansby has started since his rookie season .
He made one of the most memorable plays in this year 's playoffs , returning Aaron Rodgers ' fumble 17 yards for a touchdown to give the Cardinals a 51 - 45 overtime victory over the Green Bay Packers .
The Dolphins terminated the contracts of disgruntled outside linebacker Joey Porter , inside linebacker Akin Ayodele and free safety Gibril Wilson .
Dansby became an unrestricted free agent after six seasons with Arizona .
He played inside linebacker last season for the NFC West champions and can also play outside linebacker .
Porter , a four - time Pro Bowler chosen in January to the NFL's All - Decade team , was released last month but reverted to the Miami roster because of a salary cap technicality .
He had campaigned to be released while complaining about his reduced role last season and his relationship with coach Tony Sparano .
Wilson was a flop in his only season with the Dolphins .
He received $ 8 million guaranteed when he signed a year ago .
Ayodele was a two - year starter at inside linebacker , but Dansby offers more big - play ability .
The former Cardinals star has 25 ½ career sacks , 10 interceptions , 12 fumbles forced and nine fumbles recovered .
As Friday 's moves made clear , the Bill Parcells regime is eager to improve a defense that last year gave up a franchise - record 140 points in the fourth quarter , most in the NFL .
In the final three games , desperate to stay in the playoff race , the Dolphins fell behind 24 - 6 , 27- 0 and 27 - 10 .
Miami fired defensive coordinator Paul Pasqualoni in January and replaced him with Mike Nolan .
The Associated Press contributed to this story .
Everyone says they have a REST ( or RESTful or REST - like ) API .
Twitter does , Facebook does , as does Twilio and Gowalla and even Google .
However , by the actual , original definition , none of them are truly RESTful .
But that ’s OK , because your API should n’t be either .
The Common Definition
The misconception lies in the fact that , as tends to happen , the popular definition of a technical term has come to mean something entirely different from its original meaning .
To most people , being RESTful means a few things :
Well - defined URIs that “ represent ” some kind of resource , such as “ / posts ” on a blog representing the blog posts .
HTTP methods being used as verbs to perform actions on that resource ( i.e. GET for read operations and POST for write operations ) .
The ability to access multiple format representations of the same data ( i.e. both a JSON and an XML representation of a blog post ) .
There are some other parts of the common vocabulary of REST ( for example , for some developers being RESTful would also imply a URI hierarchy such that / posts / {uniqueid} would be seen to be a member of the / posts collection ) , but these are what most people think of when they hear “ RESTful web service . ”
So how is this different from the “ actual ” definition of REST ?
Diverging From Canon
By the common definition of REST , a service defines a set of resources and actions that can be accessed via URI endpoints .
However , the “ true ” definition of REST demands that resources be self - describing , providing all of the control context in - band of the provided representation .
No out - of - band knowledge should , therefore , be required beyond understanding a media type that the resource can provide .
From there , it should be possible to follow relations provided in “ hypertext ” context of the representation to “ transfer state ” , follow relations , or perform any necessary actions .
Another common divergence comes through the practice of using HTTP POST ( or PUT ) bodies with key - value pairs to create and update documents .
In a canonically RESTful service clients should be posting an actual representation of the document in an accepted media type that is then parsed and translated by the service provider to create or update the resource .
Still more divergence comes in the common practice of denoting collections and elements .
A truly RESTful web service has no concept of a “ collection ” of resources .
There are only resources .
As such , the proper way to implement a collection would be to define a separate resource that represents a collection of other resources .
Is anything truly RESTful ?
Pretty much everyone who claims to have a REST API , in fact , does not .
The closest I ’ve found is the Sun Cloud API which actually defines a number of custom media types for resources and is discoverable based on a single known end - point .
Everyone else , thanks for playing .
There is , however , one public and extremely widely used system that is entirely RESTful .
It ’s called the world wide web .
Yes , as you ’re browsing the internet you ’re engaging in a REST service by the true definition of the name .
Does your browser ( the client ) know whether it ’s displaying a banking website or a casual game ?
Nope , it just utilizes standard media types ( HTML , CSS , Javascript ) to compose and represent the data .
You do n’t have to know the specific URL you ’re looking for on a website so long as you know the “ starting place ” ( usually the domain name ) and can navigate there .
So REST by its original definition is far from useless .
In fact , it ’s an ingenious and flexible way to allow for the consumption and traversal of network - available information .
What it ’s not , however , is a very good roadmap toward building APIs for web applications .
Real REST is too hard .
Truly RESTful services simply require too much work to be practical for most applications .
Too much work from the provider in defining and supporting custom media types with complex modeled relationships transmitted in - band .
Too much work for clients and library authors to perform complex aggregation and re-formulation of data to make it conform to the real REST style .
Real REST is great for generic , broad - encompassing multi-provider architectures that need the flexibility and discoverability it provides .
For most application developers it ’s simply overkill and a real implementation headache .
There ’s nothing wrong with the common definition of REST .
It ’s leaps and bounds better than some of the methods that came before it and pretty much everyone is already on board and familiar with how it works .
It ’s a pragmatic solution that really works pretty well for everyone .
As they say , if it ai n’t broke , do n’t fix it .
What ’s in a name ?
The only problem is that now we have lots of things that we ’re calling REST that are n’t .
Roy T. Fielding , primary architect of HTTP 1.1 and the author of the dissertation that originally defines REST , has n’t always been happy with people calling things REST that are n’t .
And maybe he has a point : these services certainly are n’t REST by his definition and because of the wide propagation of this incorrect definition of REST most people now do n’t really understand the true definition .
In fact , I do n’t claim to have a great understanding of REST as Dr. Fielding defines it .
The problem is that the ship has sailed , and whether it ’s true or not , REST now also means any simple , URL - accessible resource - based service .
Perception is reality , and perception has changed about the definition of REST and RESTful .
While the true definition is interesting for academic purposes and certainly lies behind the technologies upon which we build every day , it simply does n’t have a whole lot of use to web application developers .
The fact that ( nearly ) zero services exist that implement true REST for their API serves as testament to that .
What can we learn from REST ?
Just because we do n’t use true REST does n’t mean there are n’t a few things we can learn from it .
There are a few aspects that I ’d love to see come into favor in the common definition .
The idea of clients needing to know a few media types instead of specific protocols for each service is one that breaks down in practice for APIs due to the overwhelming number of web services with different needs in terms of domain - specific resource definition .
However , would n’t it be great if there were an accepted application / x- person + json format that provided a standardized batch of user information ( such as name , e-mail address , location , profile image URL ) that you could request from Facebook , Twitter , Google or any OpenID provider and expect conforming data ?
Just because there are lots of domain - specific resources does n’t mean that it is n’t worthwhile to try to come up with some standards for common information .
REST - like discoverability could also be a boon for some services .
What if Twitter provided something like this along with a tweet ’s JSON ?
{ " actions " : { " Retweet " : { " method " : " POST " , url : "/1/statuses/retweet/12345.json " } , " Delete " : { " method " : " DELETE " , url : "/1/statuses/destroy/12345.json " } , " Report Spam " : { " method " : " POST " , url : "/1/statuses/retweet/12345.json " , params : {" id " : 12345 } } } } 1 { " actions " : { " Retweet " : { " method " : " POST " , url : " /1/statuses/retweet/12345.json " } , " Delete " : { " method " : " DELETE " , url : " /1/statuses/destroy/12345.json " } , " Report Spam " : { " method " : " POST " , url : " /1/statuses/retweet/12345.json " , params : { " id " : 12345 } } } }
So while REST as originally intended may not be a great fit for web applications , there are still patterns and practices to be gleaned from a better understanding of how such a service could work .
For web applications , the case may be that REST is dead , long live REST !
Extreme Homeschooling : No Tests , No Books , No Classes , No Curriculums
There 's a growing movement of no tests , no curriculums , no books , no classes .
April 19 , 2010  --
The Biegler children live as though school does n't exist .
They 're at home all day , but they 're not being homeschooled .
They 're being " unschooled . "
There are no textbooks , no tests and no formal education at all in their world .
What 's more , that hands - off approach extends to other areas of the children 's lives :
They make their own decisions , and do n't have chores or rules .
Christine Yablonski and Phil Biegler of Westford , Mass. , are self - described " radical unschoolers . "
They allow their teen daughter and son to decide what they want to learn , and when they want to learn it .
" They key there is that you 've got to trust your kids to … find their own interests , " Yablonski told " Good Morning America . "
Yablonski described unschooling as " living your life as if the school system did n't exist . "
When asked how their children learn things like math , she said , " If they need formal algebra understanding , then they will , they 'll find that information . "
Asked by " Good Morning America " about how they could parent without any rules , Phil Biegler said , " We find that we do n't need a whole lot of rules . "
" They might watch television , " Yablonski said .
" They might play games on the computers . "
" They might read , " her husband added .
Most children will always choose television over reading every time , but Yablonski said that " the key there is that you 've got to trust your kids to ... find their own interests . "
She is n't worried that her daughter stays up all night , because " she 's getting everything done that she wants to get done . "
Children as the ' Center of the Universe '
Ann Pleshette Murphy , parenting expert and " Good Morning America " contributor , questioned the unusual approach .
" This to me is putting way too much power in the hands of the kids , something that we know kids can often find anxiety - producing , and it's also sending a message that they 're the center of the universe , which I do not think is healthy for children , " she said .
Dr. Reef Karim , a psychiatrist , agrees .
" The whole concept of cooperating with your kid , it 's kind of cool in theory , " he said , " and if a child was a little adult I think it would be great , but he 's a child . "
Out of an estimated 56 million schoolage children , about 1.5 million are homeschooled .
Of that number , at least 100,000 are believed to be " unschooled " -- the term coined to describe an unorthodox approach to homeschooling that does not focus on formal classes , set curriculums or tests .
This parenting style might raise some eyebrows , but in Massachusetts , it 's perfectly legal .
Unschooling parents in that state are required to report to local school authorities once a year .
The Massachusetts Department of Education did not respond to calls and e-mails from ABC News seeking comment .
Homeschooling rules vary from state to state .

The Discovery Health cable TV channel chronicled the life of one young unschooling family , detailing a home in which the children faced no punishment , no judgment and no discipline .
" It 's amazing when you broaden the scope of what you see as learning as opposed to worksheets , " the mother said .
" There is no hierarchy in our house , so there is no punishment , no judgment , no discipline .
They get what they want for breakfast and eat whatever they want .
It 's all a matter of what feels right to them . "
But what happens when the kids get older ?
Shaun Biegler , 13 , last went to school when he was in the first grade .
He does n't regret not attending anymore , but said , " I wonder what my life would be if I continued going to school .
I was never really into some of the stuff that I had to learn in school . "
He added that sports " have n't really been an interest of mine , " but he also has n't been exposed to many sports because he does n't participate in a PE class .
Shaun 's sister , 15 - year - old Kimi , does n't even know what grade she'd have been in if she had remained in school , and does n't feel prepared for college .
" I have n't done the traditional look at a textbook and learn about such - and - such , " she said .
" If I wanted to go to college , then I would pick up a textbook and learn . "
Neither child has any plans for college , according to their father .
When asked if he felt it was his responsibility to teach his children to do things that they do n't want to do , he said , " they will do what they need to do , whether or not they enjoy it , because they see the purpose in it . "
Though the children 's father acknowledged they were growing up in a unique way , he said that " in all other aspects , they 're … living in the mainstream . "
" They have experiences and knowledge that other people don't , " Yablonski said .

Islamist fundamentalist organisations rooted in religious obscurantism have long been prone to sudden bursts of irrational violence at the slightest provocation .
The stone - throwing and arson in Karnataka by fanatics against the publication in a Kannada daily of an article , purportedly by Taslima Nasreen , on wearing of the burka were a nasty challenge to the freedom of expression guaranteed in the Indian Constitution .
Two people died , one of them in police firing , after thousands of protesters came out on the streets in Shimoga and Hassan districts and indulged in indiscriminate destruction of private and public property .
Muslim organisations have on several previous occasions voiced their opposition to the well - known views of Ms Nasreen against oppression of women and patriarchal prejudices in Muslim society .
By violently protesting every instance of publication of her articles , the religious fundamentalists obviously want to enforce a ban , otherwise legally unsustainable , on her critical and creative works .
The larger purpose was to criminally intimidate free - thinking writers who dare to question the authority of religion and religious scriptures .
Freedom of expression is an inviolable , fundamental right in India ; it can not be held to ransom by intolerant , communal , fringe elements who invoke religious sentiments to get away with blatantly unconstitutional acts .
In secular India , the right to freedom of religion is on a par with other fundamental rights .
One fundamental right cannot infringe on another fundamental right .
It is a great pity that after being hounded out of Bangladesh for her views on society and religion , Ms. Nasreen has had to face the wrath of religious extremists in secular India .
She is now forced to live in hiding , avoiding all public appearances for fear of provoking radical Islamist outfits .
In this particular case , Ms Nasreen sees a conspiracy to “ misuse ” her writings to create public disturbances and denies writing any article for the Kannada newspaper .
The translation of the article too seems to be flawed .
However , the issue is not the authenticity of the article or its authorship , but the right to freedom of expression it embodies .
For Islamist fundamentalists , the target is much bigger than Ms Nasreen : it is the democratic Constitution of secular India .
Fatwas and threats of violence in the name of religion are meant to coerce people , especially writers and artists and public figures , into an unquestioning submission to religious diktats .
These undermine the secular structure of the Indian Constitution .
Creativity and artistic expression , when stifled , will have the effect of killing off critical reasoning and undermining the very democratic fabric of the country .
This Saturday is a great opportunity to give a try to a new concept : A day dedicated to fixing bump request bugs and therefore improving on the update - to - dateness and the bleeding - edgity of Gentoo while decreasing the pile of open bugs a bit more aggressively than on a usual Gentoo day .
I plan to announce winners after .
A bumpday winner is someone who
fixes at least one bump request on the given day
has been fixing the most bugs among all participants
is technically detectable as a winner , i.e. all related bugs must : have the word bump in the summary have changed status to resolved / fixed between the bumpday 's date and the day after still be resolved / fixed be assigned to you ( not someone else , not a herd )
It 's perfectly okay if you join in just for winning as long as you apply the necessary love and care to the bumps you do .
Another thing that should be noted : bump your packages only , otherwise check for permission first .
No answer means no .
As I do n't have any bump request assigned currently ( no , do n't even think about it ! )
I plan to spend the time writing a script to get performance result .
Now bump the **** out of your packages ;-)
Pop out tokens and Zendikons , Polymorph into Progenitus .
Duress and Mire's
Toll gets rid of instants that will ruin your Polymorph ( like Lightning Bolt , Doom Blade , Dispel ) .
Dispel protects your Polymorph from being countered as well .
If you are unlucky enough to draw Progenitus , you can always Mire 's Toll or even Blightning yourself .
Tricks : Put a Zendikon on a Grixis Panorama .
Block with it , then pop it open before it dies to get your panorama back and use it again .

In Russia they sometimes publish some things in blogs that might be considered unethical to publish in some places .
For examples this is a guide for removal a magnetic security tag you can meet in dress stores .
Person who published this says it ’s just for fun , or for using in actual store or just to use if you got the item and they forgot to remove the tag in the store so you can do it by yourself .
It ’s kind of his disclaimer .
So if to get back to the guide all one would need is
… is a very strong magnet .
“ In everyday life the most strong magnet you can get is the magnet from the computer ’s Hard Drive .
You can usually get one non-working disk from some computer store who sells used hardware .
It would cost you dollar or two ” , says the author .
“ The magnet itself is glued to the surface – you need to insert the blade between the magnet and the disk and then you have a magnet ! ”
“ One magnet might be not enough , you gotta get a few of such for best results .
But beware – anything magnetically - sensitive like credit card or small electronic devices should be taken away from it – or it can be easily harmed ”
“ So when you have the magnets put them one to another ( you can see on the picture ) ”
“ Now take the item . ”
“ That ’s NOT right way to put it ”
“ And that ’s right way to do it ”
“ Now just remove the tag together with the magnet ”
“ That ’s it , you got the job done . ”
“ Also if one side of the magnet did n’t do the trick , use another one , the tags have different polarity . ”

Imagine writing a novel like this : every two weeks , you gather thirty people into a room and ask them to read your draft .
When they ’re done , they fill out a series of questions .
“ Did you understand what was going on at all times ?
Did you understand the protagonist ’s motivations ?
Did you feel compelled to read more ?
On a scale of one to five , would you recommend this novel to your friends ? ”
Imagine it does n’t stop there .
While the readers are reading , you watch them the entire time .
How long does the average page take to finish ?
When does their pace slow ?
When do they skim ?
Imagine a camera on these readers ’ faces constantly , tracking their eye movements across each page , data that is then aggregated and mined for trends .
Imagine their brains wired , too , looking for activity related to rational reasoning , emotional response , excitement , imagination .
The data you gather feeds back into the revisions , and , two weeks later , you are testing your novel again .
In 2007 Wired Magazine did a cover story on then - upcoming Halo 3 .
Though the magazine could have picked from any number of interesting angles for the story – how it was the Xbox 360 ’s biggest punch yet in the war with the PlayStation 3 , or how its features like Saved Films and the Forge editor mode would bring Web 2.0 - style user - generated content into the console space– its editors chose instead to focus on the playtesting lab at Microsoft and its unprecedented data - mining capabilities .
The deck to the article did n’t mention Bungie at all .
It read , simply , “ How Microsoft Labs Invented a New Science of Play . ”
When the article came out , I pointed a friend towards it , feeling proud of myself for being part of something deemed a big deal by the cover of a Condé Nast publication .
But my friend came away from the article upset , even disturbed .
Though the writer had almost flippantly tossed off the notion that video game development also “ involves artistry , obviously , ” he clearly saved his real swooning for the lab– for the thousands of hours of recorded play , the gigabytes of log files , the propellerhead science– not so much the game as an experience .
“ Where has the creativity gone ? ” my friend asked .
Nobody really disputes that playtesting in some form or another is indispensable in order to make good games , of course .
Understanding how an audience may react is tricky even in a linear medium such as the novel .
At least there , we can assume readers will start at page one and continue to the end .
In games , though , our agency enables our habits , and out habits become our blinders .
You do n’t consciously know that you always strafe to the right to avoid grenades– you just do , and your design ends up reflecting that .
The choice then is to ship it that way , or to show the game to a lot of people , some of whom will instinctively dodge to the left or backpeadal or who might try to bunny - hop over the damage radius ( something you ’ve never thought to do ) .
It ’s no surprise , then , that the playtest ’s leading proponents , including developers like Valve and Bungie , are often known for the high quality of their titles .
The feedback is valuable because games are systems with many moving parts , players included , and predicting how it will all interact is impossible for a single person or even a group of people .
Psychologists tell us that once something is learned it is very difficult to imagine having not known it .
The playtest allows us to see what it is like to not know our game .
If design by playtest creates the most perfect games , however , then how do we reconcile this with games as a medium in connection with the arts ?
For while it is easy to accept the notion that in mass - market entertainment there may very well be the optimal action film trailer , or the optimal casino layout , to speak of art in its artiest sense as a thing that can be optimized in one way or another is heading down a tricky path .
If game design is actually a series of tests , and we employ scientists to perform empirical research to determine the best path , then where ( like my friend said ) has the creativity gone ?
Given a certain set of goals , is there a “ correct ” game design , an optimal design from which any further innovation is unnecessary ?
When put this way , it is tempting to try to refute the design by playtest as a practice that can get in the way of an auteur ’s personal expression : if people find a part of my highly idiosyncratic art game frustrating , well , that ’s just part of the point .
( I am a frustrated artist , after all , and my art is to make you just as frustrated as I am . )
If we want games to travel into this realm of meaningfulness , the argument continues , we will just have to learn to accept unorthodox control , impossible puzzles , and general obtuseness as part of their repertoire .
Whether or not this is true , I think the uneasiness we get from a reliance on playtesting most often stems from the way it can feel like the tests are telling us what to do– that as creators we have relinquished our control to the mob of the focus group , or to some impersonally codified rules of human behavior .
Over - dependence on playtesting , we fear , may lead us to a middle - of - the - road game that is the average of all games , unremarkable in every way .
These are legitimate concerns .
But it is also important to remember that as personal as they can be , art , entertainment and video games are all transactions : things that occur , somehow , in the space between the creator and the audience .
The playtest is a tool , one that has evolved to help us grapple with that single most important quality of games , the reason they are so beguiling and why they are so problematic : their interactivity .
Used properly , playtesting does not tell you what to do , so much as it tells you what you have in front of you .
It shines a light into the possibility space of the game– a light of a different color or from a different angle than you are used to , one that makes possible a better understanding of its true shape .
In this sense , a game designer ’s artistry is not thwarted by the playtest .
The artistry is present in how he or she reacts to the results .
Data is just data , and it is up to us to decide what we will do about it .
Reaction to the stunning 2007 footage from Baghdad has only begun .
For some of the Atlantic 's interpretations , see for instance here and here .
But one of Andrew Sullivan 's commenters raises a point I meant to make previously -- and which , because it was the middle of the night , I did n't spell out .
What I said was : as with Abu Ghraib , there will be a strong temptation just to blame ( or exonerate ) the lower - level people who pulled the triggers , but that deflects us from real questions of responsibility .
There will be lot of those " real questions " to consider , from rules of engagement to the apparent cover up of the footage .
But the threshold point I meant to start with is this :
The very high likelihood of such " tragedies " occurring is a very strong reason not to get into wars of this sort .
By " of this sort " I mean : twilight - zone urban warfare , not to mention " discretionary " or " preventive " wars , and situations in which a heavily armed - and - amored occupying force of foreigners tries uneasily to mix with a population overwhelmingly of a different race and religion and language .
For their own survival , the occupiers need to be hyper - suspicious and ever alert -- even though today 's prevalent Counter Insurgency doctrine ( " COIN " ) warns of the self - defeating consequences of behaving this way .
( Indeed , a mounting debate about the COIN approach in Afghanistan is whether the effort not to seem distant from the local population is exposing US soldiers to too much risk . )
It is a situation with enormous potential for miscalculation , misunderstanding , and tragedy .
And therefore one to avoid if you have any choice at all .
It is right to be shocked at the violence in this footage , as we are shocked when an especially hard hit in a football game leaves a player motionless on the field .
But the violence behind that hard hit is one millimeter away from what the football players are praised and rewarded for doing .
The decision to gun down Iraqi civilians in real - time pressure and ambiguous circumstances ( " Is that a gun ? "
" Are they hauling a wounded terrorist away ?
Can we get clearance to ' engage ' right now ???? " ) is one millimeter away from the alert and aggressive warrior spirit for which troops are honored and trained .
Ideally , every warrior would always know the exact line that separates just enough violence from too much .
They can't know that in real time , which is why no war , even the most necessary and justified , has ever been " clean . "
We could not know that this episode would occur .
But we could be sure that something like it would .
It 's not even a matter of " To will the end is to will the means . "
Rather the point is :
You enter these circumstances , sooner or later you get these results .
A failure of tragic imagination is what I most criticized in war supporters in the months leading up to the invasion of Iraq , and it was much of the reason I opposed the war .
We can't do anything about that decision now .
But this new footage is worth bearing in mind as we face the next decision -- about bombing Iran , let 's say ; or extending the anti-Taliban fight into Pakistan ; or how long to remain in Afghanistan .
As part of an event designed to commemorate the 15th anniversary of the Murrah Building bombing in Oklahoma City , former President Bill Clinton made some remarks yesterday [ PDF file ] that got right - wingers all upset again :
Before the bombing occurred , there was a sort of fever in America in the early 1990s .
First , it was a time , like now , of dramatic upheaval .
A lot of old arrangements had changed .
The things that anchored peoples ’ lives and gave a certainty to them had been unraveling .
Some of them , by then , for 20 years .
...
And there were more and more people who had a hard time figuring out where they fit in .
More and more people who had a very difficult time living with confidence and optimism in the face of change .
It is true that we see some of that today .
...
But what we learned from Oklahoma City is not that we should gag each other or reduce our passion from the positions we hold -- but that the words we use really do matter , because there 's this vast echo chamber and they go across space and they fall on the serious and the delirious alike .
They fall on the connected and the unhinged alike .
And I am not trying to muzzle anybody .
But one of the things that the conservatives have always brought to the table in America is a reminder that no law can replace personal responsibility .
And the more power you have and the more influence you have , the more responsibility you have .
Look , I 'm glad they 're fighting over health care and everything else .
Let them have at it .
But I think all you have to do is read the paper everyday to see how many people there are who are deeply , deeply troubled .
We know , now , that there are people involved in groups – these “ hatriot ” groups , the Oath Keepers , the Three Percenters , the others – 99 percent of them will never do anything they should n’t do .
But there are people who advocate violence and anticipate violence .
One of these guys the other day said that all politics is just a prelude to the ultimate and inevitable civil war .
You know , I ’m a southerner .
I know what happened .
We were still paying for that 100 years later when I was a kid growing up , in ways large and small .
It does n’t take many people to take something like that seriously .
So I do n’t want the whole story of this retrospective just to be about this , and trying to turn everything into politics .
And I guess that ’s naïve , me being in Washington and all .
I still have some memory of it .
( Laughter . )
But I think that the point I ’m trying to make is , I like the debate .
This “ tea party ” movement can be a healthy thing if they ’re making us justify every penny of taxes we raised and every dollar of public money we spend .
And they say they ’re for limited government and a balanced budget ; when I left office , we had the smallest workforce since Eisenhower and we had four surpluses for the first time in 70 years .
...
Yes , the Boston tea party involved the seizure of tea in the ship because it was taxation without representation .
This fight is about taxation by duly elected representatives that you do n't happen to agree with and can vote out at the next election -- and two years after that , and two years after that , and two years after that .
That 's very different .
...
By all means , keep fighting .
By all means , keep arguing .
But remember words have consequences as much as actions do .
And what we advocate commensurate with our position and responsibility , we have to take responsibility for .
We owe that to Oklahoma City .
We owe it to keep on fighting , keep on arguing .
They did n’t vote for me in Oklahoma in 1996 .
It was still a Republican state .
But I loved them anyway , and I will till the day I die , because when this country was flat on its back mourning their loss , they rallied around the employees of the national government and they rallied around the human beings who had lost everything , and they rallied around the elemental principle that what we have in common is more important than our differences .
And that ’s why our Constitution makes our freedoms last – because of that bright line .
Naturally , such eminent reasonableness upset the talking heads at Fox News very much indeed :
Charles Krauthammer : " I think it 's disgusting .
...
This is really disgraceful . "
Stephen Hayes : " But to link it to Tea Parties , to suggest that there 's some bridge , that there 's some connection , I think is grossly irresponsible . "
Chris Wallace : " Why is he bringing up the Tea Party and Oklahoma City in the same sentence or the same paragraph in the first place ?
And again , it seems to me to be an effort to marginalize these people . "
Byron York : " I think this is more of an effort to sort of pre-tar the Tea Party movement with the label of being violent when , uh , nothing in fact has actually happened . "
Gee , we wonder where Clinton could have gotten the idea that the Tea Parties were connected to the militia movement of the 1990s .
You do n't suppose it could have had anything to do with the saturation of Tea Party events with Patriot movement ideas and agendas , as well as its many conspiracy theories , embodied in all those Patriot movement and militia leaders appearing at Tea Party events , do you ?
I wonder if the reports from traditional conservatives at the Nashville National Tea Party Convention could have influenced that view :
Within a few hours in Nashville , I could tell that what I was hearing was n't just random rhetorical mortar fire being launched at Obama and his political allies : the salvos followed the established script of New World Order conspiracy theories , which have suffused the dubious right - wing fringes of American politics since the days of the John Birch Society .
And the massive revival of the militia movement almost certainly had nothing whatsoever to do with the Tea Party movement -- even though all you have to do is spend a little time at Tea Party websites like Tea Party Patriots and ResistNet to get your daily dose of Patriot / militia conspiracy theories , as well as your daily news about upcoming Tea Party events ( which of course were similarly promoted heavily at Patriot / militia websites ) .
As the SPLC noted in its report :
The anger seething across the American political landscape — over racial changes in the population , soaring public debt and the terrible economy , the bailouts of bankers and other elites , and an array of initiatives by the relatively liberal Obama Administration that are seen as " socialist " or even " fascist " — goes beyond the radical right .
The " tea parties " and similar groups that have sprung up in recent months cannot fairly be considered extremist groups , but they are shot through with rich veins of radical ideas , conspiracy theories and racism .
Similarly , the Anti-Defamation League observed :
What characterizes this anti-government hostility is a shared belief that Obama and his administration actually pose a threat to the future of the United States .
Some accuse Obama of plotting to bring socialism to the United States , while others claim he will bring about Nazism or fascism .
All believe that Obama and his administration will trample on individual freedoms and civil liberties , due to some sinister agenda , and they see his economic and social policies as manifestations of this agenda .
In particular anti-government activists used the issue of health care reform as a rallying point , accusing Obama and his administration of dark designs ranging from “ socialized medicine ” to “ death panels , ” even when the Obama administration had not come out with a specific health care reform plan .
Some even compared the Obama administration ’s intentions to Nazi eugenics programs .
Some of these assertions are motivated by prejudice , but more common is an intense strain of anti-government distrust and anger , colored by a streak of paranoia and belief in conspiracies .
These sentiments are present both in mainstream and “ grass - roots ” movements as well as in extreme anti-government movements such as a resurgent militia movement .
Ultimately , this anti-government anger , if it continues to grow in intensity and scope , may result in an increase in anti-government extremists and the potential for a rise of violent anti-government acts .
Of course , the folks at Fox have steadfastly denied that either they or the Tea Parties they fomented have had anything to do with the extremist rhetoric , and resulting violence , that has erupted in tandem .
But then , conservatives have been trying to whitewash out the existence of right - wing extremist violence for a long time now .
Thus you had Chris Wallace telling Bill O'Reilly last night , describing the National Tea Party Convention in Nashville : " This is America , Bill . ...
They 're not extremists .
It 's like a meeting of the Rotary Club . "
That 's true only if your local Rotary Club indulges in an endless array of far - right conspiracy theories , such as the one about the president 's birth certificate .
Here 's one of the speeches from the National Tea Party Convention , by Joseph Farah of WorldNetDaily :
Of course , Bill O'Reilly has been among the most adamant in insisting that associating the far - right kooks with the Tea Parties is unfair .
As were observed then :
The cold hard fact is that the Tea Parties are a giant magnet for kooks because so many leaders in the movement , from Glenn Beck on down , regularly tell their audiences that provably untrue things are true .
They foist nuttiness upon their mass audiences , and the nuttiness then manifests itself in violent extremist groups rising and coalescing with mainstream - right groups .
More to the point , supposedly mainstream talkers like Glenn Beck and Neil Cavuto help promote Patriot conspiracy theories on Fox News , including the classic New World Order theory .
All of the Fox talkers refer to the apparent normality of the Tea Partiers -- but that is , in fact , not appreciably different than what the militia folks were doing in the 1990s .
That 's because these movements are all about mainstreaming extremist beliefs in the first place :
The hyper -normality is a kind of intentional camouflage .
The Patriot movement , and militias in particular , were a very specific and intentional strategy adopted in the 1990s by the white supremacists and radical tax protesters of the American far right -- and the whole purpose of the strategy was to mainstream their belief systems and their agendas .
The tactic was to adopt the appearance of normal , " red- blooded " Americanism as a way of pushing out the idea that their radical beliefs are " normal " too .
In the process , they often adopted time - worn " patriotic " sayings and symbols , such as the " Do n't Tread On Me " flag Beck wears , as their own -- though with a much more menacing meaning .
Bill Clinton is n't fooled by the camouflage .
But because the Tea Parties are so much a creature of Fox News ' invention , they 're invested now in protecting them from efforts like Clinton 's to strip it away .
The worst thing that could happen to the ideological programmers at Fox is for the public to wake up and realize the nature of the beast they 've created .
So they did their duties Friday .

Konzeptskizze Adele ( Bild : http://www.rwe.com/web/cms/de/183732/rwe/innovationen/stromerzeugung/energiespeicherung/druckluftspeicher)
In den letzten Monaten kursierten vor allem Vorschläge Salzstöcke als Mülldeponien zu nutzen , als unterirdische Zwischenlager - für CO2 oder für strahlenden Müll .
Die Kavernen können aber sehr wohl auch für saubere Energien eingesetzt werden - als Druckspeicher .
Ein Geschäftsfeld , das auch für die Stromkonzerne attraktiv ist , denn an der Strombörse ist der Strom am teuersten der bei Bedarfsspitzen ins Netz eingespeist wird .
Deshalb reaktiviert RWE eine alte Idee und baut unter dem Projektnamen " Adele " einen neuen effizienteren Typ von Druckluftspeicher .
1978 ging in Deutschland der erste Druckluftspeicher in Betrieb .
Damals ging es darum Überschußstrom des Atomkraftwerks Unterweser zu puffern in der Hoffnung Atomkraftwerke könnten so auch Nachfragespitzen bedienen .
Dazu wurde ein Druckluftspeicher bei Huntorf gebaut .
Sein Nachteil : der Wirkungsgrad liegt bei nur 42 Prozent .
Fast zwei Drittel der gespeicherten Energie gehen verloren .
Deshalb sind weltweit bis heute nur zwei Druckluftspeicher in Betrieb gegangen .
Ihr Hauptproblem : Bei der Kompression wird die Luft heiß und bisher wird diese Wärme an die Umwelt abgegeben und ist damit für den Prozeß verloren .
Sobald aber die eingespeicherte Druckluft wieder die Turbine antreiben soll , muß die Luft wieder vorgewärmt werden , sonst würde die Turbine vereisen .
Bisher wird die freigesetzte Luft daher erst energieaufwendig vorgeheizt .
Mit den neuen " adiabatischen " Druckluftspeichern soll sich das ändern .
Bei Ihnen durchläuft die Druckluft , bevor sie in die Kaverne geleitet wird , einen , mit Röhren durchzogenen , Keramikspeicher und heizt diesen auf .
Bevor die Druckluft später in die Turbine geleitet wird durchströmt die Luft erneut diesen keramischen " Kachelofen " und wird dabei mit der eigenen , vorher abgegebenen , Wärme vorgeheizt .
Hitzestabilität der Keramikspeicher und besonders der Kompressoren ist Voraussetzung , denn sie müssen Betriebstemperaturen von 620 - 650 °C langfristig standhalten .
Die Kaverne , die für Adele im Salzstock ausgespült wird , soll eine Höhe von ~ 300 m haben .
Bis 2013 soll das Druckluftspeicherkraftwerk mit einer Leistung von 1.000 MW in Betrieb gehen .
Voll aufgeladen soll der Druckluftspeicher fünf Stunden lang 200 MW Strom produzieren und dabei einen Wirkungsgrad von 70 Prozent erreichen .
RWE geht von einem Bedarf von 20 - 30 Anlagen in Deutschland aus , um die Netzspannung bei regenerativer Strom - Vollversorgung stabil zu halten .
Ideal ist , dass die Salzstockfelder in Nord und Mitteldeutschland geographisch nah an den zukünftigen größten Windparks liegen .
I fly helicopters and write iPhone applications so if there was ever something straight down my alley , it has got to be this :
When you fly an RC helicopter , one of the hardest things to learn is how to control a helicopter that is facing towards you .
As it happens , you have to swap all the controls around in your head .
When the helicopter is facing away from you , all the controls act pretty much like they do when you are flying a real helicopter .
If you want to go forward , you push the control forward , or away from you .
But if an RC helicopter is facing towards you , pushing the control forward makes the helicopter come at you .
Now your standard .60 sized gas powered helicopter can do roughly 70 miles per hour and probably cut your arm off if it hits you .
Given that your natural reaction to this killing machine flying in your direction might be to push the control away from you , you would probably be surprised when the helicopter flies towards you even faster !
It is counterintuitive to think that you would pull the control towards you to stop the helicopter from hitting you .
The solution to this problem has always been to put a little camera and a radio transmitter on the helicopter and fly it by looking from the point of view of the helicopter .
No matter how turned around the helicopter is in real life , you are always looking from the point of view of the pilot and therefore you never have to turn things around in your head .
To date , these solutions have been very expensive .
However , with the Parrot AR Drone , you leverage the radio and video display already existing in your iPhone .
All that is needed is a helicopter camera that works over WiFi .
There is no reason why this idea would n't work on any RC helicopter ( or car / boat / train / what have you , for that matter ) but the helicopter is probably the most visually compelling idea .
Actually , I could also see an underwater camera for the RC Submarine market being compelling as well , but I do n't have one of those !
LONDON —
What could be more embarrassing for a party trying to change its elitist image than the existence of someone like Sir Nicholas Winterton ?
A Conservative member of Parliament for the last 39 years , Sir Nicholas wandered disastrously off message recently when he decided to share his thoughts on why legislators should be allowed to travel first class to avoid exposure to the common man .
“ They are a totally different type of people , ” Sir Nicholas declared in a radio interview , speaking about the relative ghastliness of people in standard - class train cars .
“ There ’s lots of children , there ’s noise , there ’s activity .
I like to have peace and quiet when I ’m traveling . ”
As Labour supporters gleefully disseminated “ LOL ” - annotated links , David Cameron , the Conservative leader , moved swiftly to register his lack of appreciation for Sir Nicholas ’s philosophy .
Still , with an election looming , it was a reminder yet again of how difficult it has been for the Tories to shake off a past that a fair number of them still seem to embrace .
Mr. Cameron , whose party is leading Labour in the most recent polls , has made it his mission to drag the Conservatives — kicking and screaming , if necessary — away from their old chilly image as a stuffy bastion of the elite , the mean - spirited , the entitled and the clueless .
Dr. Sonette Ehlers , inventor of the Rape - aXe condom ( formally known as Rape - X ) , wants to distribute 30,000 of the barbed devices to women in South Africa in advance of the World Cup .
Not everyone is in support .

Severe Dick Damage !
A South African doctor has developed a device worn inside the vagina that gives quite the surprise …

When the Rape - aXe condom first appeared in 2007 , it was met with both excitement and anger .
The dangerous - sounding invention is a direct response to a very real problem in South Africa ; in a country where a woman is raped every 26 seconds , and gang rape is often considered a " legitimate " form of male bonding , something like the Rape - aXe has the potential to save more than a few women from vicious attacks .
However , it also runs the risk of infuriating the rapist , and bringing more violence upon the victim ( especially if there are multiple attackers ) .
Furthermore , the condom only serves to remind women that they 're in danger of being raped every minute of every day .
And , as Lisa Vetten of the Centre of Violence and Reconciliation said in 2007 , " This is like going back to the days where women were forced to wear chastity belts .
It is a terrifying thought that women are being made to adapt to rape . "

Back when the product was first announced , we had some issues with its practicality .
Although it has yet to be tested on the dick of an actual rapist , Ehlers says she has smoothed out some of the kinks in the design .
The real - life version of the vagina dentata ( Ehlers actually says her inspiration came from a victim who said , " If only I had teeth down there ! " ) looks like a tampon and comes complete with an applicator .
She says it is " very comfortable , very soft - she wo n't feel it . "
The plastic sheath is decorated with hooks , which are hard enough to latch on to the skin but not large enough to draw blood , an important consideration in a country with an HIV infection rate of almost 18 % .
Ehlers described the aftermath of a Rape - aXe :
[ The rapist ] can not run after you ... [ the Rape - aXe ] attached to the penis during erection , and the penis wants to go back to normal and it can 't ...
And he can't even get his manhood back into his trousers .
He can't urinate because if he pulls the tip to cut it off ... he pulls the hooks deeper into his body .

If you can't quite imagine it , Ehlers offers an animated video of the Rape - aXe in action on her website , along with multiple images of the product .
Ehlers has appealed for donations to produce and distribute her product — she hopes to get enough support to distribute the first 30,000 condoms free of charge .

OAKLAND , Calif . – Fighting back tears , anger in his voice , Al Marshall recounted how his “ kids were crying when the judgment came down ” to abandon the home in which they were growing up .
“ I ’m sick and tired of ( these banks ) holding the city of Oakland hostage , ” Marshall , a city worker and member of Service Employees International Union ( SEIU ) Local 1021 , told a crowd in front of city hall steps March 9 .
Marshall said city workers are taking pay cuts , furloughs and layoffs while critical public services are being slashed .
It ’s high time , he added , for Wall Street banks “ to step up and help fix the mess they created . ”
SEIU organizer Ariana Casanova told the World the protest is the first of several actions demanding from the big banks financial relief for homeowners and for Bay Area cities .
The action was part of a national campaign by SEIU and community allies .
Demonstrators called on big banks to renegotiate or cancel “ interest rate swap ” agreements they now hold with Oakland and other Bay Area cities .
This action followed “ a historic vote ” by the Los Angeles City Council last week to no longer do business with banks that refuse to renegotiate or cancel swap deals to help the city recover , SEIU said in a press advisory .
In Pennsylvania and Tennessee , lawmakers are also pursuing action on the swap deals .
“ We are not going to patronize banks anymore that loot and steal our money , ” said Andy Stern , SEIU International president , “ We rescued these banks and now we expect a fair treatment . ”
Stern was one of several speakers , including city council members , representatives of unions and community organizations , and Oakland residents recently victimized by the banks .
Wall Street banks sell swap deals to cities and states at a fixed interest rate during periods of economic upswing .
In return these government entities pay banks back what they owe at the fixed rate and the banks take the liability if rates go up .
That seems like sound business practices for the banks and protection for cities and states against unexpected interest hikes .
However , during the periods of capitalist economic slump when interest rates tend to bottom out as in the current devastating crisis , big banks get off like bandits and cities and states are left holding the bag .
This year Oakland will pay $ 5.2 million on its swap deal with Goldman Sachs , exceeding the city ’s $ 4 million budget gap .
Goldman insists that Oakland pay the interest on the swap deal through 2021 even though the city five years ago paid off the underlying bonds that were part of the swap , SEIU ’s press advisory said .
If Oakland were to exit the deal , it would have to fork up $ 19 million in termination penalties .
Bay Area cities will dole out more than $ 150 million to big banks on these swap agreements while , in many cases , what they are paying back in interest on these deals is equal to or larger than their current budget gap .
Casanova said the labor - community coalition will come back to the Oakland City Council to request a base ordinance similar to that of Los Angeles and “ more . ”
The group will also hold the banks accountable to homeowners threatened by foreclosure and to communities blighted by empty and often damaged structures when residents are forced to abandon their homes .
Moments after the rally , the crowd marched to a nearby branch of Citibank and entered the premises chanting “ Banks got bailed out , we got sold out ! ”
While the dazed security guard strained his voice over the din , threatening to call police , the demonstrators handed over a poster - size letter making the case for their demands to bank management , promising “ We will be back ! ”

Mr. Stoltenberg said the line approved on Tuesday splits that disputed area nearly in half , which means the line will still run considerably closer to the Norwegian islands than the Russian ones .
A number of oil or gas fields identified by Russian seismic surveys in the 1980s are thought to straddle the line .
“ Both parties believe the disputed area contains rich deposits of mineral resources , in particular oil and gas , ” said Mr. Ostreng .
“ But they do n’t know for sure .
And when you do n’t know for sure , you act as if the area is extremely rich .
It is not easy to give up strategic resources . ”
A spokesman for Greenpeace , the international environmental organization , said he was startled by how the two leaders talked about oil and gas exploration immediately after announcing the new boundary .
“ It just shows the greediness of Russia and Norway that the first thing they talked about is not global warming , which is what ’s making this area suddenly accessible , but resource extraction , ” said Truls Gulowsen , head of the group ’s Norway branch .
“ This part of the planet is extremely sensitive .
It is often covered with ice and there is no technology to clean spilled oil and chemicals out of ice . ”
Geologists say the eastern Barents , under Russian economic stewardship , probably contains far more oil and gas than the Norwegian sector , though the Norwegians have beaten their neighbors to the punch by starting production in a western Barents field called Snow White .
Based on expertise gained there , a Norwegian company , Statoil , has signed up to help Russia ’s state gas giant , Gazprom , develop a large offshore field called Shtokman far out at sea on the Russian side of the Barents .
That technologically demanding project has been delayed , however , by low gas prices .
At a meeting in Canada of the Arctic nations last month , Foreign Minister Jonas Gahr Store of Norway seemed to express frustration over Russia ’s longstanding opposition to placing the maritime boundary at an equal distance between islands of the two nations .
He was widely quoted as saying Russia was “ not yet a stable , predictable state . ”
Smoked Gouda Grilled Cheese with Apples and Bacon
This post may contain affiliate links .
Please read my disclosure policy .
For some random reason , I realized a few weeks back that I ’ve literally never made a grilled cheese sandwich before .
It ’s true !
I grew up eating them , and I actually order them fairly often at the happy hour of a favorite restaurant in town .
But somehow I could n’t recall ever buttering up the bread , layering on the cheese , and cooking one up in the skillet myself !
So of course , needed to remedy that .
Especially when I had a serious grilled cheese craving after making this yummy tomato soup …
While I was initially bound and determined to make a sandwich with just the classic slices of American cheese , I was sidetracked ( as often happens ) in the produce department while en route to the bread section at the store .
And could n’t help but pick up a few slices of my favorite cheese at the deli .
And then …a delicious , crisp Fuji apple .
And then …some turkey bacon ( which I ’m convinced makes everything better ) .
And thus…my simple grilled cheese turned into this little sandwich experiment . :)
But oh my heavens — this sandwich is fantastic !!!
I could hardly wait to snap a photo before digging in .
The apples were a wonderfully crisp and sweet , and contrasted nicely with the delicious , salty bacon .
And while I ’ll always enjoy a classic grilled cheese with American , the warm , melted , smoked gouda definitely took this ‘ wich to a whole new level .
Delish !!
I promise I will make my very first “ classic ” grilled cheese soon .
But for now , this one is definitely my new “ fav ” …

I spent the weekend celebrating my friend Andy not being dead .
In February 2006 he went sledding , landed in a concrete culvert and broke his back in five places .
It was an incredibly traumatic time for everyone involved .
My partner and I traveled the two hours between our home and the hospital almost every day for over three weeks .
Andy spent a considerable amount of time in ICU , underwent extensive reconstructive surgery , and then spent most of the next year healing .
It was touch and go for awhile but , in the end , he made a full recovery .
Since then , February includes a new ritual for our circle of friends .
We all travel to Bristol to celebrate ANDY ( Andy ’s Not Dead Yet ) .
We play games ( including Operation which is very funny to everyone who is n’t Andy ) , drink adult beverages and , perhaps most importantly , tell stories * about our experience nursing Andy back to health .
Hill 1 ; Andy 0
Celebrating success is natural .
The stories about the times we were at our best are easy to share ( and make great copy for marketing materials ) .
But while they are valuable , they do n’t paint the whole picture .
We also need the stories about the dark times .
the ones about dicey situations , stupid mistakes and general embarrassment .
The soul of your organization is carried in these stories .
They create bonds between the people who experienced the stories first hand and the people who came after .
When shared with the right people at the right time , they can turn casual supporters into loyal fans .
The key is making sure these stories get passed on .
The good news is your people already do that informally –in the bar after work , at the opening night party - after - the - party , in the office as an example to the new person on “ what not to do . ”
This level of sharing is good–but to take full advantage of the power of story a full - on celebration is in order .
Celebrate something specific
It does n’t have to be as traumatic as a week in ICU , three weeks in the hospital and a year of physical therapy , but it should be significant .
Chances are the right moment has popped into your mind already .
If you are stuck , think about the stories you are most likely to tell after a drink or two .
Pick the event with the most stories attached .
Invite the right people
This should not be a public event .
You need to feel completely safe to share the hard stuff .
The right people to invite are the people that know the stories ( staff , board ) and the people you want to be more intimately involved in your work ( very active volunteers , potential board members , possibly engaged donors )
In the beginning it ’s better to err on the side of being too exclusive .
If after an event or two you find no one is learning anything new , it ’s time to expand the invite list .
Finally , intimate is better .
It ’s hard to air dirty laundry in a group of 500 + .
Provide a structure
You need free - form mingling time at the beginning and end of the event–but if you do n’t provide some structure for sharing , it will be hard to get people started .
If your people are n’t shy , an open - mike style event is the easiest way to go .
Get a sound system , some kind of stage and plenty of comfortable chairs .
Start with a welcome message , any ground rules , and hand over the mike to people as they are inspired .
If you ca n’t imagine working like that , try sitting everyone in a large ( or several small ) circle(s ) and share that way .
The key is for everyone to be comfortable , have the chance to share if they ’d like , and to be able to hear the storytellers .
Finally , the actual story - sharing portion of the event should n’t last more than 60 - 90 minutes–after that people will start to get antsy .
Food is a requirement
Wine is probably a good idea as well , but you know your people better than I .
Also , do n’t skimp on the food .
There is something about eating together that helps people feel comfortable .
That comfort will be key to the success of the experience .
Do n’t make it a fundraiser
You will be tempted to use this opportunity to raise money .
Please resist .
If you need a sponsor or tickets to cover expenses , that is one thing , but as soon as you use the event as a way to improve your bottom line you will start to make subtle changes to raise more money .
Before you know it , the spirit of the original event will be lost .
Are you ready to share ?
You do n’t have to go into the gory details –just let us know the general idea of which defeat you ’d be most likely to honor with your own ANDY - style party .
* Most every night Andy would get disoriented and have drug induced hallucinations about people chasing him .
Sometimes it was the mafia , sometimes he was a WWII fighter pilot ; you get the idea .
The only consistent part of the story was he needed to get away fast .
This was a problem because his back was broken–so it was really , really important he stay in bed .
Most nights were spent with one or more people sitting next to him assuring him he was n’t being chased .
He ’d had an accident , he was in the hospital , he needed to stay still , remember ?
Yes. 10 minutes later–lather , rinse , repeat .
He also had a tendency to use his hospital gown as a prop–but I promised not to get into that on the internet .
XINRAN XUE , a Chinese writer , describes visiting a peasant family in the Yimeng area of Shandong province .
The wife was giving birth .
“ We had scarcely sat down in the kitchen ” , she writes ( see article ) , “ when we heard a moan of pain from the bedroom next door …
The cries from the inner room grew louder — and abruptly stopped .
There was a low sob , and then a man 's gruff voice said accusingly : ‘ Useless thing ! '
“ Suddenly , I thought I heard a slight movement in the slops pail behind me , ” Miss Xinran remembers .
“ To my absolute horror , I saw a tiny foot poking out of the pail .
The midwife must have dropped that tiny baby alive into the slops pail !
I nearly threw myself at it , but the two policemen [ who had accompanied me ] held my shoulders in a firm grip .
‘ Do n't move , you can't save it , it 's too late . '
“ ‘ But that 's ... murder ... and you 're the police ! '
The little foot was still now .
The policemen held on to me for a few more minutes .
‘ Doing a baby girl is not a big thing around here , ' [ an ] older woman said comfortingly .
‘ That 's a living child , ' I said in a shaking voice , pointing at the slops pail .
‘ It 's not a child , ' she corrected me .
‘ It 's a girl baby , and we can't keep it .
Around these parts , you can't get by without a son .
Girl babies do n't count . ' ”
In January 2010 the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences ( CASS ) showed what can happen to a country when girl babies do n't count .
Within ten years , the academy said , one in five young men would be unable to find a bride because of the dearth of young women — a figure unprecedented in a country at peace .
The number is based on the sexual discrepancy among people aged 19 and below .
According to CASS , China in 2020 will have 30 m - 40 m more men of this age than young women .
For comparison , there are 23 m boys below the age of 20 in Germany , France and Britain combined and around 40 m American boys and young men .
So within ten years , China faces the prospect of having the equivalent of the whole young male population of America , or almost twice that of Europe 's three largest countries , with little prospect of marriage , untethered to a home of their own and without the stake in society that marriage and children provide .
Gendercide — to borrow the title of a 1985 book by Mary Anne Warren — is often seen as an unintended consequence of China 's one - child policy , or as a product of poverty or ignorance .
But that can not be the whole story .
The surplus of bachelors — called in China guanggun , or “ bare branches ” — seems to have accelerated between 1990 and 2005 , in ways not obviously linked to the one - child policy , which was introduced in 1979 .
And , as is becoming clear , the war against baby girls is not confined to China .
Parts of India have sex ratios as skewed as anything in its northern neighbour .
Other East Asian countries — South Korea , Singapore and Taiwan — have peculiarly high numbers of male births .
So , since the collapse of the Soviet Union , have former communist countries in the Caucasus and the western Balkans .
Even subsets of America 's population are following suit , though not the population as a whole .
The real cause , argues Nick Eberstadt , a demographer at the American Enterprise Institute , a think - tank in Washington , DC , is not any country 's particular policy but “ the fateful collision between overweening son preference , the use of rapidly spreading prenatal sex- determination technology and declining fertility . ”
These are global trends .
And the selective destruction of baby girls is global , too .
Boys are slightly more likely to die in infancy than girls .
To compensate , more boys are born than girls so there will be equal numbers of young men and women at puberty .
In all societies that record births , between 103 and 106 boys are normally born for every 100 girls .
The ratio has been so stable over time that it appears to be the natural order of things .
That order has changed fundamentally in the past 25 years .
In China the sex ratio for the generation born between 1985 and 1989 was 108 , already just outside the natural range .
For the generation born in 2000 - 04 , it was 124 ( ie , 124 boys were born in those years for every 100 girls ) .
According to CASS the ratio today is 123 boys per 100 girls .
These rates are biologically impossible without human intervention .
The national averages hide astonishing figures at the provincial level .
According to an analysis of Chinese household data carried out in late 2005 and reported in the British Medical Journal* , only one region , Tibet , has a sex ratio within the bounds of nature .
Fourteen provinces — mostly in the east and south — have sex ratios at birth of 120 and above , and three have unprecedented levels of more than 130 .
As CASS says , “ the gender imbalance has been growing wider year after year . ”
The BMJ study also casts light on one of the puzzles about China 's sexual imbalance .
How far has it been exaggerated by the presumed practice of not reporting the birth of baby daughters in the hope of getting another shot at bearing a son ?
Not much , the authors think .
If this explanation were correct , you would expect to find sex ratios falling precipitously as girls who had been hidden at birth start entering the official registers on attending school or the doctor .
In fact , there is no such fall .
The sex ratio of 15 - year - olds in 2005 was not far from the sex ratio at birth in 1990 .
The implication is that sex - selective abortion , not under- registration of girls , accounts for the excess of boys .
Other countries have wildly skewed sex ratios without China 's draconian population controls ( see chart 1 ) .
Taiwan 's sex ratio also rose from just above normal in 1980 to 110 in the early 1990s ; it remains just below that level today .
During the same period , South Korea 's sex ratio rose from just above normal to 117 in 1990 — then the highest in the world — before falling back to more natural levels .
Both these countries were already rich , growing quickly and becoming more highly educated even while the balance between the sexes was swinging sharply towards males .
South Korea is experiencing some surprising consequences .
The surplus of bachelors in a rich country has sucked in brides from abroad .
In 2008 , 11 % of marriages were “ mixed ” , mostly between a Korean man and a foreign woman .
This is causing tensions in a hitherto homogenous society , which is often hostile to the children of mixed marriages .
The trend is especially marked in rural areas , where the government thinks half the children of farm households will be mixed by 2020 .
The children are common enough to have produced a new word : “ Kosians ” , or Korean - Asians .
China is nominally a communist country , but elsewhere it was communism 's collapse that was associated with the growth of sexual disparities .
After the Soviet Union imploded in 1991 , there was an upsurge in the ratio of boys to girls in Armenia , Azerbaijan and Georgia .
Their sex ratios rose from normal levels in 1991 to 115 - 120 by 2000 .
A rise also occurred in several Balkan states after the wars of Yugoslav succession .
The ratio in Serbia and Macedonia is around 108 .
There are even signs of distorted sex ratios in America , among various groups of Asian - Americans .
In 1975 , calculates Mr Eberstadt , the sex ratio for Chinese- , Japanese - and Filipino - Americans was between 100 and 106 .
In 2002 , it was 107 to 109 .
But the country with the most remarkable record is that other supergiant , India .
India does not produce figures for sex ratios at birth , so its numbers are not strictly comparable with the others .
But there is no doubt that the number of boys has been rising relative to girls and that , as in China , there are large regional disparities .
The north - western states of Punjab and Haryana have sex ratios as high as the provinces of China 's east and south .
Nationally , the ratio for children up to six years of age rose from a biologically unexceptionable 104 in 1981 to a biologically impossible 108 in 2001 .
In 1991 , there was a single district with a sex ratio over 125 ; by 2001 , there were 46 .
Conventional wisdom about such disparities is that they are the result of “ backward thinking ” in old - fashioned societies or — in China — of the one - child policy .
By implication , reforming the policy or modernising the society ( by , for example , enhancing the status of women ) should bring the sex ratio back to normal .
But this is not always true and , where it is , the road to normal sex ratios is winding and bumpy .
Not all traditional societies show a marked preference for sons over daughters .
But in those that do — especially those in which the family line passes through the son and in which he is supposed to look after his parents in old age — a son is worth more than a daughter .
A girl is deemed to have joined her husband 's family on marriage , and is lost to her parents .
As a Hindu saying puts it , “ Raising a daughter is like watering your neighbours ' garden . ”
“ Son preference ” is discernible — overwhelming , even — in polling evidence .
In 1999 the government of India asked women what sex they wanted their next child to be .
One third of those without children said a son , two - thirds had no preference and only a residual said a daughter .
Polls carried out in Pakistan and Yemen show similar results .
Mothers in some developing countries say they want sons , not daughters , by margins of ten to one .
In China midwives charge more for delivering a son than a daughter .
Chasing puppy - dogs ' tails
The unusual thing about son preference is that it rises sharply at second and later births ( see chart 2 ) .
Among Indian women with two children ( of either sex ) , 60 % said they wanted a son next time , almost twice the preference for first - borns .
This reflected the desire of those with two daughters for a son .
The share rose to 75 % for those with three children .
The difference in parental attitudes between first - borns and subsequent children is large and significant .
Until the 1980s people in poor countries could do little about this preference : before birth , nature took its course .
But in that decade , ultrasound scanning and other methods of detecting the sex of a child before birth began to make their appearance .
These technologies changed everything .
Doctors in India started advertising ultrasound scans with the slogan “ Pay 5,000 rupees ( $ 110 ) today and save 50,000 rupees tomorrow ” ( the saving was on the cost of a daughter 's dowry ) .
Parents who wanted a son , but balked at killing baby daughters , chose abortion in their millions .
The use of sex - selective abortion was banned in India in 1994 and in China in 1995 .
It is illegal in most countries ( though Sweden legalised the practice in 2009 ) .
But since it is almost impossible to prove that an abortion has been carried out for reasons of sex selection , the practice remains widespread .
An ultrasound scan costs about $ 12 , which is within the scope of many — perhaps most — Chinese and Indian families .
In one hospital in Punjab , in northern India , the only girls born after a round of ultrasound scans had been mistakenly identified as boys , or else had a male twin .
The spread of fetal - imaging technology has not only skewed the sex ratio but also explains what would otherwise be something of a puzzle : sexual disparities tend to rise with income and education , which you would not expect if “ backward thinking ” was all that mattered .
In India , some of the most prosperous states — Maharashtra , Punjab , Gujarat — have the worst sex ratios .
In China , the higher a province 's literacy rate , the more skewed its sex ratio .
The ratio also rises with income per head .
In Punjab Monica Das Gupta of the World Bank discovered that second and third daughters of well - educated mothers were more than twice as likely to die before their fifth birthday as their brothers , regardless of their birth order .
The discrepancy was far lower in poorer households .
Ms Das Gupta argues that women do not necessarily use improvements in education and income to help daughters .
Richer , well - educated families share their poorer neighbours ' preference for sons and , because they tend to have smaller families , come under greater pressure to produce a son and heir if their first child is an unlooked - for daughter **.
So modernisation and rising incomes make it easier and more desirable to select the sex of your children .
And on top of that smaller families combine with greater wealth to reinforce the imperative to produce a son .
When families are large , at least one male child will doubtless come along to maintain the family line .
But if you have only one or two children , the birth of a daughter may be at a son 's expense .
So , with rising incomes and falling fertility , more and more people live in the smaller , richer families that are under the most pressure to produce a son .
In China the one - child policy increases that pressure further .
Unexpectedly , though , it is the relaxation of the policy , rather than the policy pure and simple , which explains the unnatural upsurge in the number of boys .
In most Chinese cities couples are usually allowed to have only one child — the policy in its pure form .
But in the countryside , where 55 % of China 's population lives , there are three variants of the one - child policy .
In the coastal provinces some 40 % of couples are permitted a second child if their first is a girl .
In central and southern provinces everyone is permitted a second child either if the first is a girl or if the parents suffer “ hardship ” , a criterion determined by local officials .
In the far west and Inner Mongolia , the provinces do not really operate a one - child policy at all .
Minorities are permitted second — sometimes even third — children , whatever the sex of the first - born ( see map ) .
The provinces in this last group are the only ones with close to normal sex ratios .
They are sparsely populated and inhabited by ethnic groups that do not much like abortion and whose family systems do not disparage the value of daughters so much .
The provinces with by far the highest ratios of boys to girls are in the second group , the ones with the most exceptions to the one - child policy .
As the BMJ study shows , these exceptions matter because of the preference for sons in second or third births .
For an example , take Guangdong , China 's most populous province .
Its overall sex ratio is 120 , which is very high .
But if you take first births alone , the ratio is “ only ” 108 .
That is outside the bounds of normality but not by much .
If you take just second children , however , which are permitted in the province , the ratio leaps to 146 boys for every 100 girls .
And for the relatively few births where parents are permitted a third child , the sex ratio is 167 .
Even this startling ratio is not the outer limit .
In Anhui province , among third children , there are 227 boys for every 100 girls , while in Beijing municipality ( which also permits exceptions in rural areas ) , the sex ratio reaches a hard - to - credit 275 .
There are almost three baby boys for each baby girl .
Ms Das Gupta found something similar in India .
First - born daughters were treated the same as their brothers ; younger sisters were more likely to die in infancy .
The rule seems to be that parents will joyfully embrace a daughter as their first child .
But they will go to extraordinary lengths to ensure subsequent children are sons .
The hazards of bare branches
Throughout human history , young men have been responsible for the vast preponderance of crime and violence — especially single men in countries where status and social acceptance depend on being married and having children , as it does in China and India .
A rising population of frustrated single men spells trouble .
The crime rate has almost doubled in China during the past 20 years of rising sex ratios , with stories abounding of bride abduction , the trafficking of women , rape and prostitution .
A study into whether these things were connected † concluded that they were , and that higher sex ratios accounted for about one - seventh of the rise in crime .
In India , too , there is a correlation between provincial crime rates and sex ratios .
In “ Bare Branches ” †† , Valerie Hudson and Andrea den Boer gave warning that the social problems of biased sex ratios would lead to more authoritarian policing .
Governments , they say , “ must decrease the threat to society posed by these young men .
Increased authoritarianism in an effort to crack down on crime , gangs , smuggling and so forth can be one result . ”
Violence is not the only consequence .
In parts of India , the cost of dowries is said to have fallen ( see article ) .
Where people pay a bride price ( ie , the groom 's family gives money to the bride 's ) , that price has risen .
During the 1990s , China saw the appearance of tens of thousands of “ extra - birth guerrilla troops ” — couples from one - child areas who live in a legal limbo , shifting restlessly from city to city in order to shield their two or three children from the authorities ' baleful eye .
And , according to the World Health Organisation , female suicide rates in China are among the highest in the world ( as are South Korea's ) .
Suicide is the commonest form of death among Chinese rural women aged 15 - 34 ; young mothers kill themselves by drinking agricultural fertilisers , which are easy to come by .
The journalist Xinran Xue thinks they cannot live with the knowledge that they have aborted or killed their baby daughters .
Some of the consequences of the skewed sex ratio have been unexpected .
It has probably increased China 's savings rate .
This is because parents with a single son save to increase his chances of attracting a wife in China 's ultra -competitive marriage market .
Shang - Jin Wei of Columbia University and Xiaobo Zhang of the International Food Policy Research Institute in Washington , DC , compared savings rates for households with sons versus those with daughters .
“ We find not only that households with sons save more than households with daughters in all regions , ” says Mr Wei , “ but that households with sons tend to raise their savings rate if they also happen to live in a region with a more skewed sex ratio . ”
They calculate that about half the increase in China 's savings in the past 25 years can be attributed to the rise in the sex ratio .
If true , this would suggest that economic - policy changes to boost consumption will be less effective than the government hopes .
Over the next generation , many of the problems associated with sex selection will get worse .
The social consequences will become more evident because the boys born in large numbers over the past decade will reach maturity then .
Meanwhile , the practice of sex selection itself may spread because fertility rates are continuing to fall and ultrasound scanners reach throughout the developing world .
Yet the story of the destruction of baby girls does not end in deepest gloom .
At least one country — South Korea — has reversed its cultural preference for sons and cut the distorted sex ratio ( see chart 3 ) .
There are reasons for thinking China and India might follow suit .
South Korea was the first country to report exceptionally high sex ratios and has been the first to cut them .
Between 1985 and 2003 , the share of South Korean women who told national health surveyors that they felt “ they must have a son ” fell by almost two - thirds , from 48 % to 17 % .
After a lag of a decade , the sex ratio began to fall in the mid-1990s and is now 110 to 100 .
Ms Das Gupta argues that though it takes a long time for social norms favouring sons to alter , and though the transition can be delayed by the introduction of ultrasound scans , eventually change will come .
Modernisation not only makes it easier for parents to control the sex of their children , it also changes people 's values and undermines those norms which set a higher store on sons .
At some point , one trend becomes more important than the other .
It is just possible that China and India may be reaching that point now .
The census of 2000 and the CASS study both showed the sex ratio stable at around 120 .
At the very least , it seems to have stopped rising .
Locally , Ms Das Gupta argues††† , the provinces which had the highest sex ratios ( and have two - thirds of China 's population ) have seen a deceleration in their ratios since 2000 , and provinces with a quarter of the population have seen their ratios fall .
In India , one study found that the cultural preference for sons has been falling , too , and that the sex ratio , as in much of China , is rising more slowly .
In villages in Haryana , grandmothers sit veiled and silent while men are present .
But their daughters sit and chat uncovered because , they say , they have seen unveiled women at work or on television so much that at last it seems normal to them .
Ms Das Gupta points out that , though the two giants are much poorer than South Korea , their governments are doing more than it ever did to persuade people to treat girls equally ( through anti-discrimination laws and media campaigns ) .
The unintended consequences of sex selection have been vast .
They may get worse .
But , at long last , she reckons , “ there seems to be an incipient turnaround in the phenomenon of ‘ missing girls ' in Asia . ”

Europe has been hit by a wave of industrial and social unrest in recent days and weeks , as workers across the continent push back against efforts to cut government spending and drive down wages .
The uncoordinated strikes and protests , which have taken place in at least a dozen European countries and have threatened to paralyze much of the continent , may be a harbinger of more unrest to come .
With much of Europe in or just barely out of recession and many millions of Europeans out of work and collecting welfare checks , governments large and small are scrambling to fix gaping budget holes in an effort to stave off financial disaster .
In Spain , for example , the government spent twice as much as it took in during 2009 , with unemployment benefits constituting the largest single component of government expenditures .
Many other European countries are in a similar bind .
Indeed , with millions of long - term unemployed Europeans on track to becoming permanent wards of the state , the European social model is under strain as never before .
In some European countries , there has been tough talk about the need to roll back the much - vaunted welfare state .
In Germany , for example , pro-business Foreign Minister Guido Westerwelle recently called for a complete overhaul of the German social welfare system and warned that German workers were fast becoming “ the nation ’s suckers . ”
Westerwelle also said that increasing benefits to the long - term unemployed would create the kind of decadence that paved the way for the fall of the Roman Empire .
“ Whoever promises the people effortless prosperity encourages late Roman decadence , ” Westerwelle declared .
“ Everyone who is young and healthy and has no relatives to look after must accept reasonable work , whether that is in the form of community work , a career or training , ” he said .
Not surprisingly , Westerwelle ’s comments have stirred considerable controversy .
After all , the European social welfare state , which is supposed to guarantee a generous system of social benefits , relative wage and income equality , and a prominent role for organized labor , forms the basis of Europe ’s post - World War II social order .
Increasingly , however , European governments ( even some on the political left ) are warning about the need to downsize the welfare state in order to save it .
More and more frequently , there is talk of austerity and the need for belt - tightening measures , such as public pay freezes and raising the retirement age , designed to reduce the size of government .
But angry European workers are having none of it .
It ’s a similar story in the private sector , where companies are under pressure to restructure and / or downsize to remain viable .
But European workers are growing increasingly restive , and many are taking to the streets .
Although many of the strikes and protests have been relatively short - lived , they represent growing popular resistance to attempts by European governments and corporations to cut back on spending .
It remains to be seen whether European governments , which derive much of their political legitimacy from doling out social welfare benefits , will buckle under popular pressure and abandon reform .
However , if European governments stand firm and push through the painful austerity measures that many countries need to return to economic health , more labor strife will almost certainly follow .
According to one analyst , the recent wave of protests could be “ just the start of the greatest demonstration of public unrest seen on the continent since the revolutionary fervour of 1968 . ”
In any case , even if European publics are in denial about the future viability of the European social welfare state , a growing number of European governments seem to be acknowledging , albeit reluctantly , that their social and economic model is unsustainable .
Strange , then , that many Americans view the European model as something to emulate rather than avoid .
What follows is a brief summary of some of the strikes and protest movements to hit Europe in recent days :
In Greece , where the government is striving to avert national bankruptcy , much of the country has gone on strike against government austerity measures .
Public - and private - sector unions have called strikes to protest a range of measures aimed at reducing Greece ’s budget deficit .
In Spain , where a 20 percent jobless rate and rising debt have prompted worries about a Greek - style budget crisis , workers in cities across the country have started protesting against the government ’s proposal to raise the retirement age by two years to 67 .
In France , an air traffic controllers strike grounded hundreds of flights in Paris , one of the busiest air travel hubs in Europe .
French unions are protesting the planned consolidation of air traffic control networks in Europe .
The planned merger could see French air traffic controllers , who are currently among the best paid in Europe , lose their generous perks , which include 30 weeks of vacation per year .
( French air traffic controllers are required to work only 100 days a year . )
Also in France , a massive strike has hobbled operations at Total SA , Europe ’s largest oil refiner .
Employees are protesting a potential plan to close an oil refining plant in northern France ; the plant at Flanders has been idle for more than six months due to a drop in demand for refined oil products .
This being France , the government has intervened in the dispute by taking sides with the workers .
The Industry Ministry has warned Total that it is “ out of the question to close the Flanders refinery .
Nor of course , to close any other one in France . ”
( Meanwhile , France Telecom , the main telecommunications company in France , has replaced its CEO following a wave of suicides at the company .
Nearly 40 France Telecom employees have committed suicide since January 2008 .
Labor unions blame the suicides on stress caused by the former CEO ’s attempts to restructure and modernize France Telecom to meet intensifying competition from abroad . )
In Germany , some 4,000 pilots began what was meant to be a four - day strike at Lufthansa , Germany ’s flagship carrier .
The pilots are worried the company might try to cut staff costs by shifting jobs to its foreign subsidiaries , where wage costs are lower .
Unions representing 16,000 Lufthansa cabin crew are threatening to join the pilots if the company fails to reach an agreement with them as well .
Lufthansa pilots agreed to suspend their strike for two weeks after a court ruled against a claim by the union that the airline was obliged to apply German labor law to all of its employees , even those working outside Germany .
In Britain , the union representing 12,000 stewards and stewardesses for British Airways has threatened to strike .
The dispute revolves around a decision by British Airways to reduce the number of staff on long - haul flights and to introduce a two - year pay freeze .
The changes are forcing the cabin service directors ( the most senior crew ) to no longer just oversee the staff , but to start serving meals and drinks as well .
In a statement , the union says British Airways cabin crew feel a “ deep sense of grievance ” about their treatment by their employer .
Also in Britain , more than 250,000 public sector workers are set to strike over what their union says are “ macho ” government cuts to redundancy payments .
The government says the changes , which place caps on pay - offs to those laid off or taking voluntary redundancy , will save £ 500 million in taxpayer money .
The union says the cuts are illegal and are threatening a series of rolling strikes throughout March and April , just weeks before the expected date of the general election , if the government refuses to back down .
In Italy , workers at the troubled car giant Fiat went on strike to protest the planned shutdown at the end of 2011 of an assembly plant in Sicily .
( Even the Pope weighed in on the matter . )
On February 22 , Fiat abruptly halted production at all of its Italian plants for two weeks because of a fall in new car orders .
The measure places 30,000 workers on unemployment benefits .
In Finland , dockworkers staged a strike following the breakdown of contract negotiations .
The dockworkers union has threatened to call an open - ended strike , which would choke off most of the country ’s exports .
In Belgium , workers at the Carrefour supermarket chain are bracing for a nationwide strike over plans to cut 1,672 jobs in Belgium and close 21 stores in the country by the end of June .
Carrefour says its operations in Belgium are “ structurally loss - making . ”
In Poland , nurses are threatening a nationwide strike unless the Health Ministry can reach a deal on raises .
Currently , nurses are on strike at four hospitals in southern Poland .
Some have even begun a hunger strike while others have gathered outside the Health Ministry , playing revolutionary ballads from Poland ’s communist era .
In Portugal , unions representing Portugal ’s public - sector workers are preparing a national strike to challenge a wage freeze that the government says is necessary to cut a burgeoning budget deficit .
In Ireland , public sector workers have been staging a go - slow since February 1 in protest against pay cuts in last December ’s austerity budget .
In the Czech Republic , transport workers are threatening to halt trains and buses to support their demand for a lower tax on benefits .
I frequently go to Starbucks , and over the years have overheard many conversations between women and between women and men .
Based on these overheard conversations , I have reached some conclusions .
1. Women cheat … a lot !
Almost every single conversation between non-senile women involves how they cheated , how they are going to cheat or how someone close to them cheated .
It is amazing how common cheating is , especially among married and attached woman .
It almost seems to be a badge of honor , and even fat cunts who look like Godzilla are happy to recount their misadventures .
Another common theme is the apparent cluelessness of their partners .
Indeed , women like to boast about that just as much as the cheating part .
So guys who believe that game can ‘ always ’ keep women faithful are delusional .
Many of the men married or attached to these cunts are not abusive , unemployed or mentally unstable .
Most of these cheating cunts also have kids , often young and I have always wondered about their true paternity .
2. Women have no respect for men , even the studs .
It is all about them .
You barely figure in their scheme of things other than as an accessory to make other women jealous or as a bank account .
You are very replaceable in their mind , and their actions demonstrate it .
Long term Game , my foot !
You are either the clueless provider or the guy they fuck on the side , but both are readily replaceable upto a certain age .
If you are stupid enough to believe them or show ANY mercy or respect , you deserve to be sodomized .
These cunts barely love their own kids , because it is all about them .
They even see their kids as accessories to make other women jealous .
So who wants to have a LTR with a woman ?
Even women well past their prime see themselves as viable competitors with women barely older than their daughters .
Consequently they keep on being cunts long after they can ill afford to .
3. Women are opportunistic parasites who believe that they are doing you a favor .
Even if you are a stud , women still see sex as a favor bestowed upon you .
They are incapable of perceiving sex as anything other than a favor that you have to pay back , even if they enjoyed it more than you .
They will not rest unless you have paid the ‘ favor ’ back , so do not hang around one woman .
Fuck them and move on ..
They see everything you have as theirs , but their stuff is only for them .
They have no problem getting a big house renovation or car purchase with your money , even when they are fucking someone else and criticising your sexual efforts .
I have overheard about such situations many times .
Next post in this series ( brief case studies ) now up : Things I Learned at Starbucks : 2
Mr Barkat said the development would be a " win-win " situation for the city
The mayor of Jerusalem has announced a plan to demolish an area of Arab East Jerusalem to make way for an upmarket district of hotels and gardens .
But hours before Mayor Nir Barkat was due to announce his scheme - called the King 's Garden - Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said work should be delayed .
The Israelis say the Palestinian houses to be demolished have been built without permits and have become a slum .
Palestinians say it is their land and want it to be part of their capital .
Critics say the plan will inflame an already volatile situation in the area , the BBC's Heather Sharp in Jerusalem says .
Rights groups have warned that pushing ahead with the plan could trigger a fresh wave of violence , our correspondent adds .
' Bold move '
Breaking the ground for the development has been put on hold after Mr Netanyahu called Mr Barkat and told him to carry out more public consultation .
It 's our forefathers ' land , Arab land , Muslim land , I refuse to give up this land
Abu Mohammad , al - Bustan resident
Archaeology and the struggle for Jerusalem
But the public launch went ahead , with reporters invited to look at architects ' models for the new tourist district , thought to be the location of a garden where the biblical King David wrote his psalms .
A spokesman for the US State department said the US " appreciates " Mr Netanyahu 's intervention .
The US called on both sides to " refrain from unilateral actions that whether intended to or not , undermine trust and efforts to resume negotiations , " Philip Crowley said .
Mr Barkat called the plan a " bold move " and said it would be beneficial for both Palestinians and Israelis .
" The plan is a win - win plan for the future of the city , taking into consideration the public and private interests , taking an area that has been neglected and turning it into an area that we can all be proud of , " he said .
' Not outlaws '
The plan for the area near the Temple Mount , known to Palestinians as al - Bustan , will see 22 houses demolished .
Journalists were invited to see architects ' plans for King 's Garden
The residents would be moved to an alternative location , the mayor said .
Another 66 homes would be legally recognised and their residents given legal right to stay in the contested area .
The mayor 's office says that until 1967 , when the Israelis occupied the land , the area was a park .
Palestinians have built their houses illegally , and , without infrastructure , the neighbourhood has turned into a slum .
But Palestinians living there say it is their home .
" It 's our forefathers ' land , Arab land , Muslim land , I refuse to give up this land , " said Abu Mohammad , who has lived in the area for 17 years .
Moussa Owdeh , another local Palestinian resident , said : " We are not outlaws and we are not criminals .
We are not violating construction permits , we have the natural right to be here , at this place , because this neighbourhood is our property . "
Israeli rights organisations said the plan could foment violent reaction from Palestinians .
" Any unilateral step on behalf of the Israeli authorities which aims to expand the Israeli grasp over this very sensitive area is very dangerous both to the political future of this city and the conflict in general , " said Orly Noy , for Israeli human rights organisation Ir Amim .
A statement issued by the prime minster 's office said Mr Netanyahu was concerned that " parties interested in sowing discord " would present a " distorted picture " of the plan , news agency Reuters reported .

Most of us are fairly familiar with the manifesto promises of the main parties .
But politicians are not all the same .
To prove it , here are some eye - catching policies you may have missed .
Howling Laud Hope - wants the Loch Ness monster declared an endangered species Keen to get potholes filled in ?
Want socks to be sold in packs of three ?
Or perhaps you would like to register a protest vote - or even change the parliamentary system altogether ?
Then one of the smaller parties may be for you ...
If you 're concerned about the rights of zombies , there is the Cure ( Citizens for Undead Rights and Equality )
Party , which has among other " undeadly serious " campaign messages : " Zombies , like students , are people too .
Let 's fight for their rights to politically party . "
Its manifesto , published on the party 's website , includes : • Give the undead equal rights to the living •
Make cemeteries more comfortable for their inhabitants •
Implement a robust social integration programme for the undead , curing society of its prejudices •
Increase the minimum statutory retirement age to beyond death • Permit marriages of the living and the undead
It is standing in four constituencies - Hitchin & Harpenden , Twickenham , Doncaster Central and Brighton Pavilion - which it says is " literally a start .
And it means we can comfortably share a table at the Houses of Commons " .
Captain Beany of The New Millennium Bean Party - slogan , " Out with Brown , in with Orange " - has high hopes of capturing plenty of floating and first - time voters in Aberavon with his mixture of serious and frivolous " beanyfesto " pledges .
Along with proposals on the environment , health , the economy and defence , he has a range of unusual eye - catching plans : • Chewing gum to be collected from pavements and used to fill potholes in the road • Children who leave home should not be allowed to return until they are 40 • Convicted drink drivers to have their cars painted bright orange for five years when they finish their ban and return to the wheel • Public officials who are convicted of abuse of office to have their pictures printed on toilet roll packaging .
Captain Beany has been standing in general elections for years and has not yet kept his deposit - but this time around he is " ever so confident " because so many voters are disenchanted with the main parties .
" I 've seen the future and the future 's bright , " he says .
There are several ideas about how to fill in potholes The Church of the Militant Elvis and Bus-Pass Elvis Party also have a pledge on potholes - and on moats .
Campaigner Dave Bishop , aka Lord Biro , has now stood in three general elections and is standing in Kettering because he feels the town " needs brightening up " .
Some of his campaign policies include : • Fancy a moat around your house to keep out randy footballers ?
• Bono for Pope •
Turn public schools into pound shops •
Save public lavatories from extinction •
Fill in the potholes •
All shook - up about dog - muck everywhere ?
Bring back the dog licence .
The Monster Raving Loony Party - currently the Monster Raving William Hill Loony party , after a sponsorship deal with the bookies - is fielding several candidates this year .
Monster Raving Loonies :
Three badgers better than three lions Leader Howlin ' Laud ' Hope was out campaigning in Witney ( where his rivals include David Cameron ) when the BBC News website spoke to him .
Pledges he was campaigning on included " joining Europe in a big way " - by inviting the other European countries to join the pound sterling and then making the entire UK a European offshore tax haven .
He is also pledging a 99 p coin to save on change ( this was also a pledge last time around in 2005 , but " no - one noticed it then , so we 're still shouting about it now " ) .
Other Monster Raving Loony manifesto suggestions - individual candidates can pick from an extensive list or choose their own - include : •
All socks to be sold in packs of 3 as a precaution against losing one •
Make it illegal for superheroes to use their powers for evil •
Ban all terrorists from having beards as they look scary •
Change the English symbol of three lions to 3 badgers •
School dinners must be regularly checked for radioactivity •
Add the Loch Ness Monster to the endangered species list • Dedicated pogo stick lanes on routes to centres of work Howlin ' Laud '
Hope says he has had a " wonderful " reaction in Witney so far and hopes to keep his deposit - but on the other hand , the party says if you get that many votes you are obviously " not loony enough " , so you have to leave .
Anyone baffled by this array of pledges might want to try a party that cheerfully admits it " has n't got any " , because it is a protest vote .
The NOTA ( None of the Above ) Protest Vote movement is standing - officially as independents - in Sherwood and Waveney .
By promising to deliver nothing , I 'm the best man for the job I do n't want
Louis Barfe , NOTA ( None of the Above ) Protest Vote
What would you do if you were PM ?
Waveney candidate Louis Barfe says a vote for him is a last resort ; when people want to vote , but none of the candidates appeals .
" With NOTA standing , they have an option to register their dismay and disaffection , " he says .
In the unlikely event of him getting in , his one policy would be to force a by - election within six months - in which he would not stand .
" The problem with politicians is not what they promise , it 's what they deliver , " he said .
" So by promising to deliver nothing , I 'm the best man for the job I do n't want . "
Similarly the " No Candidate Deserves My Vote " party is standing in Stevenage .
A few candidates want a " none of the above " option on ballot papers
It has one policy : " We seek to put a " None of the above " option on every local and general election ballot paper for all time . "
Thus the disaffected voter can turn out and make a protest vote .
Sole candidate Steve Phillips of Stevenage does not expect to get in , and says if he does he expects his tenure to be fairly short - lived - once he has got the Electoral Commission to make sure the " none of the above " box is on ballot papers , he can stand down .
However , he promises , he would also be a conscientious representative for the people of Stevenage at the same time .
Not quite radical enough ?
Andy Kirkwood of the Movement for Active Democracy ( MAD ) , who is standing in South Dorset , would like to do away with the current system of government altogether .
What about referendums on major issues like smoking bans ?
He would still have MPs discussing things , he explains , but if a large enough group of , say , 500,000 people decided they wanted to stop a certain government proposal , the issue would have go to a referendum and could then be halted whether the government liked it or not .
Equally , if a group of 500,000 wanted a change to a policy such as the smoking ban , they could then trigger a referendum .
And if their change was approved , it would have to be adopted by the government .
" I have no manifesto , " he says .
" I am not telling you what you 're going to get , I 'm asking you what you want . "
There are also plenty of single issue campaigners or parties seeking to make their own serious point at the election .
One that is standing again this time with an easily understandable message is Animals Count .
It is standing in the Islington South and Finsbury constituency .
Although it has policies on mainstream issues such as the minimum wage , banking and the environment , its key policies focus on animal welfare , and include among others : • Eliminate animal experimentation • Redirect subsidies from livestock and fisheries farming to plant - based agriculture •
Phase out farming practices with poor welfare consequences for animals • Establish an " NHS for animals " •
Act on the known link between animal abuse and domestic violence , with increased penalties for those convicted of animal cruelty " Animal and environmental issues are at the heart of society ... " it says .
" Animal issues are part and parcel of the economy , environment , education and other topics and not a fringe or single issue . "
Or there is the Peace Party , which is standing in three constituencies : Horsham , Guildford and Woking .
We envision a far more peaceful country , where people can better demonstrate their care and compassion towards others
Peace Party Veteran campaigner John Morris explains that their overriding point of view is that they do not want " any war of any kind ever again " - and most of their policies stem from this .
Their 10 - point manifesto explains where they stand on issues such as economic recovery , immigration ( " no restrictions to the movement of people around the world " , but also trying to remove the factors " tending to push people away from their homes " ) and taxation .
" We envision a far more peaceful country , where people can better demonstrate their care and compassion towards others , where there is far more social justice and where we care more for our surroundings , both natural and man-made , " the party says .
Have you seen any eye - catching policies that we 've missed ?

How many people have heard about a guy called None Of The Above , who changed his name by deed poll before declaring he was standing for parliament ( in the Chingord & Woodford Green constituency , against the Tories ' Iain Duncan Smith ) ?
The only snag is , on the ballot his name will show up as ' Above , None of the ' .
Which kind of ruins the effect , does n't it ?
Jim , London Does anyone remember ' The Freedom From Acne Party ' ?
Their only manifesto policy was to use the UK GDP to find a cure .
I suppose to get elected , teenage boys would have to be allowed the vote .
The acne probably cleared up of its own accord - hence the party is no -more .

My favourite ever Monster Raving Loony policy was from a campaign in Belfast in the eighties : more street corners for the kids to hang about on .

Tom is running for seats in the City of London and Westminster , his policies include tax free rum , free duct tape for each home to fix broken Britain , and the apple ipad to be renamed the Ipatch .
Daniel , Coventry Martin McAuley , a student candidate in North Belfast had a brilliant poster ' Tough on Crime ... Tougher on women drivers ' .
John , Belfast Looks like the MRL Party have lost the plot ..
Their policies make perfect sense to me .

How about an " I Don't Give A Damn " party - and force all those MPs with a safe seat ( like my own MP ) that will never be lost - to join and give up their party allegiances .
They would then be true Independents and can vote outside of the party Whips .
But they might take the new party name a bit too seriously !

There is the big one that you missed :
Over the past year , political activist and comedian Mark Thomas has been running a " People 's Manifesto " show whereby we the public actually get to choose our manifesto policies .
Mark has actually raised funds to put up a candidate in Bristol West ( Danny Kushlick ) .

The United States is the only country in the world that claims to be superior in every aspect , especially in human rights , and that lie is again exposed , this time by a report from China on the United States , all from US sources .
The US is in fact a backward cesspool , the most backward country in the industrialized world .
From : Chinese report documents human rights disaster in the United States19 March 2010 by Patrick Martinand the full report is at :
On March 13 , China ’s Information Office of the State Council published a report titled , “ The Human Rights Record of the United States in 2009 .
” This document was clearly intended as a rebuttal to the annual US State Department Country Reports on Human Rights Practices for 2009 , released two days earlier .
The Chinese report quite legitimately notes that the US government “ releases Country Reports on Human Rights Practices year after year to accuse other countries , and takes human rights as a political instrument to interfere in other countries ’ internal affairs , defame other nations ’ image and seek its own strategic interests .
This fully exposes its double standards on the human rights issue … ” Delivering the US government a well - deserved dose of its own medicine does not , of course , absolve the Chinese regime of its own gross violations of human rights .
It rules autocratically over 1.3 billion people , most of them desperately poor peasants and super - exploited workers .
That being said , the Chinese report is an eye - opening document — factual , sober , even understated , drawn entirely from public government and media sources in the United States , with each item carefully documented .
It presents a picture of 21st century America as much of the world sees it , one which is in sharp contrast to the official mythology and American media propaganda .
Not surprisingly , the report went unmentioned in the US mass media .
The 14 - page report is divided into six major sections : Life , Property and Personal Security ; Civil and Political Rights ; Economic , Social and Cultural Rights ; Racial Discrimination ; Rights of Women and Children ; US Violations of Human Rights Against Other Nations .
The cumulative picture is one of a society in deep and worsening social crisis .
A few of the facts and figures cited on violence and police repression in the United States : • Each year , 30,000 people die in gun-related incidents . •
There were 14,180 murders last year . •
In the first ten months of 2009 , 45 people were killed by police use of tasers , bringing the total for the decade to 389 . •
Last year , 315 police officers in New York City were subject to internal supervision due to “ unrestrained use of violence . ” • 7.3 million Americans were under the authority of the correctional system , more than in any other country . •
An estimated 60,000 prisoners were raped while in custody last year .
On democratic rights , the report notes the pervasive government spying on citizens , authorized under the 2001 Patriot Act , extensive surveillance of the Internet by the National Security Agency , and police harassment of anti-globalization demonstrators in Pittsburgh during last year ’s G - 20 summit .
Pointing to the hypocrisy of US government “ human rights ” rhetoric , the authors observe , “ the same conduct in other countries would be called human rights violations , whereas in the United States it was called necessary crime control .
” The report only skims the surface on the socioeconomic crisis in the United States , noting record levels of unemployment , poverty , hunger and homelessness , as well as 46.3 million people without health insurance .
It does offer a few facts rarely discussed in the US media : • 712 bodies were cremated at public expense in the city of Los Angeles last year , because the families were too poor to pay for a burial . •
There were 5,657 workplace deaths recorded in 2007 , the last year for which a tally is available , a rate of 17 deaths per day ( not a single employer was criminally charged for any of these deaths ) . •
Some 2,266 veterans died as a consequence of lack of health insurance in 2008 , 14 times the military death toll in Afghanistan that year .
The report presents evidence of pervasive racial discrimination against blacks , Hispanics and Native Americans , the most oppressed sections of the US working class , including a record number of racial discrimination claims over hiring practices , more than 32,000 .
It also notes the rising number of incidents of discrimination or violence against Muslims , and the detention of 300,000 “ illegal ” immigrants each year , with more than 30,000 immigrants in US detention facilities every day of the year .
It notes that the state of California imposed life sentences on 18 times more black defendants than white , and that in 2008 , when New York City police fired their weapons , 75 percent of the targets were black , 22 percent Hispanic and only 3 percent white .
The report refers to the well - known reality of unequal pay for women , with median female income only 77 percent that of male income in 2008 , down from 78 percent in 2007 .
According to the report , 70 percent of working - age women have no health insurance , or inadequate coverage , high medical bills or high health - related debt .
Children bear a disproportionate burden of economic hardship , with 16.7 million children not having enough food at some time during 2008 , and 3.5 million children under five facing hunger or malnutrition , 17 percent of the total .
Child hunger is combined with the malignant phenomenon of rampant child labor in agriculture : some 400,000 child farm workers pick America ’s crops .
The US also leads the world in imprisoning children and juveniles , and is the only country that does not offer parole to juvenile offenders .
US foreign policy comes in for justifiable criticism as well .
A country with so many poor and hungry people accounts for 42 percent of the world ’s total military spending , a colossal $ 607 billion , as well as the world ’s largest foreign arms sales , $ 37.8 billion in 2008 , up nearly 50 percent from the previous year .
The Chinese report notes the documented torture of prisoners in Afghanistan , Iraq and Guantanamo Bay , the worldwide US network of military bases , the US blockade of Cuba ( opposed by the UN General Assembly by a vote of 187 to 3 ) , and the systematic US spying around the world , utilizing the NSA ’s “ ECHELON ” interception system , as well as the US monopoly control over Internet route servers .
The report also points out the deliberate US flouting of international human rights covenants .
Washington has either signed but not ratified or refused to sign four major UN covenants : on economic , social and cultural rights ; on the rights of women ; on the rights of people with disabilities ; and on the rights of indigenous peoples .
The report does not discuss the source of the malignant social conditions in the United States — nor should that be expected , since that would require an explanation of the causal connection between poverty , repression and discrimination and the operations of the capitalist profit system , something that Beijing is hardly likely to undertake .

Environment groups say the International Whaling Commission 's ( IWC ) proposal to allow some whales to be killed is a return to commercial whaling .
The IWC 's proposal would let whalers harpoon 400 minke whales and 10 fin whales each year in Antarctic waters until the 2015 - 2016 season .
Fin whales are an endangered species and green groups say the only reason their numbers are strong again is because of the ban on commercial whaling .
Australia says it will not support the proposal and in a surprise twist New Zealand has also said it will not support it .
The next meeting of the IWC in Morocco in June was always going to be heated , but Friday 's announcement from the IWC guarantees the debate will be loud and long .
Australia is against whaling and is very worried this latest proposal may be supported .
" We 'll look at the IWC statement carefully but on face value it falls very well short of any outcome that Australia could ever accept , and I repeat what we 've said all through this process and that is that Australia remains resolutely opposed to commercial and so - called scientific whaling , " Environment Minister Peter Garret said .
" We will not support a proposal which would sanction commercial whaling and we 've put an alternative set of proposals which we think go towards achieving the conservation goals which we believe the IWC nations should set for themselves . "
Australia wants a proposal that bans whaling for commercial and scientific reasons .
" We need to strongly press for no whaling in IWC endorsed sanctuaries .
We need to agree on the scientific procedures that underpin all IWC decisions , " Mr Garrett said .
' Legitimises whaling '
Environmental groups are outraged by the IWC proposal .
The World Wildlife Fund ( WWF ) says the proposal endorses the killing of whales in one of the most critical feeding grounds , the Southern Ocean .
Mick McIntyre from Whales
Alive says the proposal is flawed .
" This proposal would mean the return to commercial whaling because it clearly is a proposal that would legitimise whaling over a 10 - year period , " Mr McIntyre said .
" To me it 's like if you were a parent and you said to your kid do n't worry about us telling you what to do or receiving any discipline , you do what you like for 10 years and then we 'll come and talk to you about how you went and then we 'll talk to you about discipline at the end of those 10 years .
" I mean it 's a free for all and it's completely legitimising what Japan has been doing in a scientific whaling program .
It completely allows them to get away with murder basically . "
This is the first time the IWC has put a figure on the numbers of whales it would allow to be killed .
The proposal was put forward in an attempt to break the deadlocked debate .
Non-whaling countries which support it , such as the US , believe a compromise will mean the number of whales killed will be closely controlled .
Three weeks ago there was international outrage when New Zealand said it would consider this proposal , but it now says the proposal is offensive and inflammatory .
" The proposal for a consensus decision proposed by the IWC chair and deputy chair today falls seriously short of being a basis for diplomatic settlement to the whaling debate , " New Zealand foreign affairs minister Murray McCully said .
" In terms of the specifics , the proposed catch limits for the Southern Ocean are unrealistic and unacceptable from New Zealand 's point of view .
" The suggestion that there should be a small quota for fin whale is an inflammatory proposal in my view . "
Mr McIntyre hopes other nations will now follow New Zealand .
" New Zealand 's change of heart is very , very welcome .
I think commonsense has prevailed with the New Zealand government , " he said .
" They saw the writing on the wall that this was a complete contradiction of the proposal .
That all this proposal does is give the whaling countries everything they could possibly want . "
ALERTA .

I never thought I 'd write a personal story about being a war correspondent .
It seemed so beside the point , so much less important than the story I was reporting .
Some of my closest friends are photographers and writers who 've worked in war zones , and whenever we'd get questions like " What 's it like to be a woman and work in Afghanistan or Iraq ? " we 'd roll our eyes .
It was an attitude , for sure , but one we were proud of .
When I was asked to write about being pregnant and embedded with soldiers in Afghanistan , I said OK .
But I was still reluctant .
And so the months passed .
Then , not long ago , I got an email from a colonel in the army 's media affairs office , saying they were declining my next embed request in part because " you failed to disclose your pregnancy " .
What troubled me more than the refusal was that the colonel was a woman .
Compare the email I got from another colonel , a man : " Congratulations !
I heard you are due in February – forever you will provide Rock Paratroopers with stories .
5 (+) months pregnant humping up the Abas Ghar ! " ( the 8,400 ft mountain ridge in the Korengal valley ) .
How could a woman , particularly in the military , not understand why I would have kept my pregnancy to myself ?
Is it true that the toughest adversary for women is still other women ?
I may be extracting too much out of a simple anecdote , but it was enough to make me want to tell the story .
One reason was visceral : I wanted to get even with her .
The other is more complicated .
On a muggy August afternoon , I dragged myself and my flu to an infectious - disease doctor .
I asked him if he could give me some antibiotics for Afghanistan that were safe to take when you 're pregnant .
His eyes leapt up from his notes .
" How far along are you ? "
" Three months and a bit . "
I stared at a James Nachtwey photograph on his wall as he regaled me with stories about his war - photographer patients , all of whom were men .
Clearly , I posed a different equation .
" Are you sure you will be able to run ? " he said .
" Because you 're going to need to run , and I have to advise you not to go in your condition . "
Suddenly he was rigging up a heart - monitoring machine on my chest and pointing out my supposedly irregular heartbeat arrowing up and down the page .
" I just came for a prescription , " I said .
" If I wanted someone to tell me not to go to Afghanistan , I could have called my mother . "
Outside , the heat was stultifying , but I felt light , my flu miraculously subdued to a tickle in the throat .
I thought about a journalist I 'd known in Iraq whose wife wanted him home for the birth of their fifth child , but who stayed anyway for the invasion .
And the French photographer with two kids who was shot in three different war zones , the last time nearly paralysing his arm .
I could n't think of one who'd stopped because of a pregnancy or his family .
Especially if there was n't a penny in the bank and a baby was on the way .
I walked out , went home , and booked my ticket .
A few days later I was 7,500ft above sea level , short of breath , tears streaming down my face , tumbling headfirst down a jagged mountain slope in the dark , body armour , backpack , baby and all .
I could hear Lynsey – my partner in crime , an extraordinary photographer – gasp and then burst out laughing .
We 'd ended up in the Korengal valley , a place of everglade beauty , screeching monkeys , and gruff mountain tribes .
" It 's really not fit for women , " the media affairs guy had said .
" There 's nowhere for you to sleep . "
" Then we 'll go , " we 'd said .
That 's where we wanted to be : the place not fit for women .
By which I guess he meant male , smelly , rough .
We were doing a story on air strikes and civilian casualties , and I wanted the point of view of the soldiers dropping the bombs .
And that 's what happened on our first night at Camp Blessing , the battalion headquarters in the Pech River valley in eastern Afghanistan .
We were inside the TOC – the tactical operations centre , which is like a big , classified PlayStation .
The landscape comes to life on a movie screen by way of Google Earth and Predator drone video feeds .
The Americans zeroed in on a few bad guys firing mortars from a roof .
One soldier joked that we were about to get our first glimpse of Kill TV .
The screen flashed , bright static , as a 500 lb bomb hit the roof .
The mortar stopped .
So did the men .
It was a snuff film .
They call it pred porn .
Early the next morning we were in a Chinook , hugging the contours of the rocky peaks and then sprinting across the landing zone to avoid getting shot at .
I found big , brash 27 - year - old Captain Dan Kearney , dubbed the Lord of the Korengal Valley , in the well - equipped medic 's tent .
On the bed sat a boy with blood - stained eyes , his face covered in gashes .
He would n't or could n't talk .
The villagers said he was wounded by the American bomb that also killed two women .
Two more women were wounded and outside the gate , but the villagers would n't let them be treated because the medic was a man .
The women could die , said the medic .
The men still refused .
" Welcome to my life , " said Dan .
Taliban attack his soldiers from the villages .
He retaliates .
Afghan women and children die .
" Pull out his eyes , apologise ; apologise , pull out his eyes " .
The old , taunting rhyme bounced in my head as I looked into the eyes of an Afghan woman lying limp and frightened on a hospital bed down the valley in Kunar 's capital .
Attached to her was a nursing child .
The bomb had landed on her house , killing her husband .
Her eyes moved behind me , seemed to tour the room ; then , seeing no salvation , they lost focus .
There were other wounded women in the beds .
One had lost her husband a year ago in a feud , and now her teenage son had been killed in the bombing .
She was asking the doctor , me , anyone who 'd listen , " Who will take care of me ? "
The doctor translated for them and then pursued me down the hall , urging me to tell the Americans to please stop bombing their villages .
" It 's too much , it 's too much , " he said .
He was young , with a creased , tired face and was craning his head to catch up with me .
" Please tell them , " he said .
" They might listen to you .
They wo n't listen to us . "
I said that I would and I meant it , and I knew it would make no difference .
It was as a 12 - year - old girl had asked me five years earlier in Kandahar , squirming in her hospital bed .
She 'd been playing in the courtyard at her sister 's wedding when gunships burst out of the night , killing her entire family .
" Why do you bomb us and then come saying you 're sorry ? "
Nightmare .
Will we never stop ?
I imagined trying to shelter my own child from air strikes and being unable to .
And suddenly I was overwhelmed at the thought of becoming a mother .
I saw myself pinned to the bed .
Baby at the breast .
Life over .
Helpless .
I was supposed to be overjoyed .
Many women
I know at the edge of fertility are going through IVF and surrogate mothers , sleeping with friends and strangers , inseminating themselves with their gay friends ' sperm , scrolling through sperm banks to find the perfect baby daddy – to be a mother .
In my moments of paralysing ambivalence , I found myself assaulted at newsagents on every corner by our pregnant and baby - laden stars hanging like icons around an altar .
Ambivalence , on the other hand , was not for sale .
Does any pantheon even have a goddess of doubt ?
A few months earlier , all I 'd wanted in the world was a child .
The father would be a special part of our lives , but I 'd be a mum on my own .
That did n't deter me .
But now in the hospital , where I was supposed to be taking meticulous notes , I froze .
I 've been a nomad most of my life , uninterested in and unhindered by the domestic .
" Babies need homes , Ellie " – the warnings of a South African soldier friend echoed in my head .
Lynsey appeared with her cameras .
And a message .
Nisar , my friend from Kunar who was waiting outside ( men can not enter the women 's ward ) , said it was getting dangerous to stay in the hospital any longer .
We ducked into the burqas that would hide us on the streets .
It was a relief to shuffle anonymously inside the musty blue nylon cage , and I decided to defy caution , go back to the soldiers dropping bombs in the mountains , and deliver the doctor 's message .
I settled into life with the soldiers , sharing their bunkers , barns , cots , and spine - breaking 4 am hikes .
I scavenged their care packages for chicken - noodle soup and shampoo .
One night , Lynsey and I were deep inside the back of a Humvee with two young , insecure intelligence officers at the helm as we set off for an all - night mission to capture Taliban .
A truckload of Afghan special forces in our convoy had just driven over a cliff .
" If the shit hits the fan , " said the one driving , " can you load those bullets into the machine gun ? "
I fingered the toothpaste - tube - sized cartridges in their bandoliers piled up next to me .
" Sure , " I said as Lynsey and I gave each other a what - are - we - doing - here look .
Then , shouting louder over the engine , he said , " Do n't you think it 's a little irresponsible to be pregnant in a war zone ? "
I could n't imagine how he knew .
I looked over at Lynsey , who was shrugging and mouthing : " I did n't say anything . "
" Do n't you think as an intelligence officer you should get your intel right ? "
I cringed , even as I said it .
Five hours later , our convoy was trapped in the enemy village .
The roads were donkey paths , not fit for 2.5 - ton Humvees .
The roosters were up .
Charcoal clouds appeared in the pre-dawn light .
The Humvee was stifling and I had consumed seven bottles of water and I was four months pregnant and my bladder was going to explode and I could n't get out or I might get killed .
" Do you guys have a knife ? "
One of them handed me a Leatherman .
I sliced the top of a water bottle off , climbed up on to the seat , then crouched and peed .
No one noticed .
I filled up six bottles , tossed each out the window .
The last time I missed the bottle .
Over the next weeks I found myself peeing on the floors of bombed - out homes , abandoned cottages , and goat pens .
My blood - filled womb attracted every flea in the Korengal Valley .
The medics gave me flea collars and toxic anti-flea lotion , along with ibuprofen ( which I 'd stash away , because you can't take it when you 're pregnant ) and compression bandages for my swollen ankles .
Nothing worked .
When I had boarded the helicopter to come back to the Korengal , I armed myself with the heroic tales of pregnant women I 'd known .
There was my friend Ayub 's mother , who was harvesting tobacco when she delivered the last of her eight children in Halabja .
And the Bosnian woman who was nine months pregnant when the militias attacked her town .
As she fled through the mountains , mortars exploding around her , she went into labour .
A villager scooped her up in a wheelbarrow , and there she gave birth to her son .
Maybe stories are nourishment .
Because as bad as it got – like at the end of an 18 - hour patrol , when I ended up on the medics ' trolley suffering from dehydration , and felt my body sucking hungrily on the juices of two IV drips – I compared my situation with the wheelbarrow or the Afghan women , and I could n't really complain .
Summer gave way to a cold mountain autumn .
The company was gearing up for a six - day mission in enemy terrain .
I was nearing six months .
Was I crazy ?
Maybe .
But I also knew this was it : a 21st - century dilemma stripped of all theory , playing out in life , death , absurdity , and coinciding with the last weeks I could possibly stay out there .
Death in the Korengal had many arrangements .
A girl died of shrapnel wounds , maybe American shrapnel , maybe insurgents ' .
Her father gave her bracelets to a soldier who'd tried to save her .
A sergeant died of a sniper 's bullet because he was giving visitors a tour .
A US Marine training Afghan soldiers died in an ambush defending Afghan soldiers .
Soldiers had to kill their dogs .
( The higher - ups figured they had diseases . )
Death was a daily dialogue .
One night I watched a flea bouncing on my distended belly .
I drifted off and dreamt that the baby was in a rubbery goat - skinned wine sack , suffocating and shrinking .
The night before I 'd dreamt she was a dwarfed donkey .
Some nights , after a day of jets ripping the land apart with 2,000 lb bombs , and insurgents crashing mortars into the base , I 'd put earphones on my stomach , hoping the vibrations of Horowitz playing Mozart 's B - flat sonatas would soothe her .
And every night she soothed me against despair and mortality .
We had a few days until the full moon and the mission .
Sergeant Nestell , an Apache - American who 'd suffered Lynsey and me in his bunker , asked me , " Do you have your gear ? " I looked around sheepishly .
" Monkeys ate my gear ? "
I 'm sure I was grating on his nerves .
And while Lynsey and I provided comic relief on patrols for Dan , the captain , to the rest of the pack , particularly a vigilant survivor like Nestell , we were a loud liability .
Nevertheless , he emerged from behind his curtain with long johns , thermal socks , even his wooby ( the soldiers ' camouflage blanket , and one of their most prized possessions ) .
3 am .
Enemy territory .
I'm on a mountain ridge with Dan and his command cell .
Below , dozens of soldiers are spilling out of choppers around the villages .
The insurgents are on their radios , getting ready to strike .
Dan is not going to let them , and soon the night sky lights up with air strikes , gunships , rockets and bombs .
Around dawn , Dan 's lieutenant radios .
He 's with the village elder .
There are five dead and 11 wounded women and children .
Dan is depressed .
He wants to go down and explain .
He wants the villagers to know there were bad guys there .
At one point he says , " I 'll take any advice you got , Liz . "
Later I say , " Did n't you know this would happen ? "
" Yeah , I did . "
But did he have a choice ?
In his mind the choice was – my soldiers or the Afghans .
3 am .
TWO NIGHTS LATER .
We 're hiking above the tree line in the dark , and I can't figure out how to work my night - vision goggles , and I 'm freezing and everything 's throbbing in pain , and I can see no reason to be searching abandoned Afghan summer cottages .
I have an epiphany .
Up ahead , I can make out a boulder .
As soon as I reach it , I 'll just slip behind , lie down , and go to sleep .
I have another epiphany : if I stop moving I 'll freeze .
Then suddenly the line 's stopped .
There 's a soldier worse off than me .
" Get the fuck up , Spino , " shouts an officer .
" Get the fuck up , fucking Spino . "
I love you , Spino .
I lie down on my pack , and now the throbbing makes me cry , and if I do n't pee , I 'm going to explode .
I start counting the stars .
We slept in our flak jackets in a ditch that night , Lynsey , me , a couple of soldiers , spooning to stay warm .
The next day , as the sun sank again , I remembered Nestell 's advice : heat up rocks , put them in a ditch , and lie over them with a blanket .
True , a fire could give you away .
But we 'd been on the insurgents ' home turf for days .
They already knew everything .
We heard them on the radio talking about us .
How could a little fire harm anyone ?
Many of the soldiers out there took a turn in the oven .
It was bliss .
The next day , Lynsey and I and a few soldiers hiked down to the woods where 2nd Platoon was watching the valley .
It was a beautiful afternoon .
Then we were ambushed .
My heart surged into my throat .
The doctor was right : I can't run .
But I have to or I 'll die .
So I ran .
I ran after Piosa , the young lieutenant , up to the ridge , past two bloodied , wounded soldiers — Rice and Vandenberge .
As soon as I saw Clinard , a towering , blue - eyed soldier , crying " Rougle 's dying and it's my fault , " I wanted to disintegrate .
Rougle was lying behind him , already dead .
The insurgents had climbed up the mountain , shot Rougle , Rice and Vandenberge , and stolen their equipment .
Rougle .
Battle Company 's best .
He and his scouts were badder than the rest , travelling in their own pack , sleeping in the wild .
Next leave , Rougle was heading to ask his girlfriend 's dad for permission to marry her .
Four Afghan soldiers began dragging his body through the dried leaves and branches , and Raeon , a fellow scout , lost it on them , me , the world .
He shoved the Afghans aside and lofted Rougle up over his shoulder , fireman - style , drenching his back in Rougle 's insides .
I turned away .
My tape recorder stopped working , and I was forced to take notes .
The job is the only thing that saves you .
Two days later , I flew back to the base .
Around midnight , guys from 1st Platoon filed in , drenched in river water and blood .
Mohammad Tali , the ugliest Taliban on the bad - guy family tree , had nearly dragged off Brennan , whom I 'd watched playing guitar all day long before the mission .
Brennan would die that night .
So did Hugo Mendoza , 1st Platoon 's smiling medic .
Shelton , their platoon sergeant , was caked in Tali 's brains and blood .
I listened to Dan , hunched over , call the boys ' parents , one by one , and recount what happened and how their sons had died .
I went to the showers , peeled off the clothes I had n't taken off in six days , and disappeared under the patter of warm water .
I cried for the hundredth time .
I thought of the doctor .
I never did deliver his message .
I could see that as long as the soldiers were there , the Korengalis would keep shooting from the villages and the Americans would keep bombing them .
The only thing I could do was write about it .
Border crossings require resolve .
Getting on a plane , getting married , moving , taking a job , writing the first words .
Babies cry themselves to sleep resisting the transition from wakefulness to slumber .
Throughout my life I 've kept a classification of the two kinds of people in the world : those who dwell in the land of ambivalence and those who give it a glance and drive on .
Those who know where they 're going , and the perpetual rubberneckers .
I had no idea what I was getting into when I flew up to the Korengal Outpost , met Kearney , and realised I 'd have to stick it out for two months to tell the story I was after .
But it 's no surprise to me that I ended up in extremis , completely distracted through the middle of pregnancy .
finally I left the soldiers and the mountains , though not before telling Dan what he already knew – that I was six months pregnant .
It was n't until I was back in civilian life in Kabul that I began to worry .
I 'd contracted some Afghan illness .
" Time for you to go home , " wrote my brother .
" You are not built like Afghan women .
We are from shtetl , not mountain people . "
But I was stubborn .
My friend Najib , a doctor and journalist , took my blood pressure with a kit he'd ordered from the internet , and it read 70 over 40 .
" I 'd be dead , Najib . "
" Well , you look horrible , and it 's really low . "
What was worse , I could n't feel the baby 's flutters any more .
He called a friend with a sonogram machine .
It was raining , cold , dark , and electricity was out in much of the city .
We entered an old building cratered by Cold War rockets .
Najib pushed me past the patients waiting in the blacked - out hallway .
I was rushed into a room and greeted by a tall , smiling Afghan doctor who 'd studied in Indiana .
By the time I was on my back , shirt up , a guy began banging on the door and shouting : why the hell did the foreigner cut the line ?
I was sure he was going to crash through the door , exposing me to the crowd .
I wondered how they could be so patient with us – we 'd caused bombings , kidnappings , massive rent inflation , and we threw our weight around in big SUVs , cutting corners , queues , and laws , just like the warlords .
I turned my head to the sonogram screen , and there was what I 'd come for : a small black - and - white static , pulsing .
It was her heart .
Then I saw her hand in her mouth , and that was it .
In retrospect , I can see that the act of keeping a secret allowed me to forestall being pregnant , becoming a mother , changing my life .
But whatever abstraction " having a baby " was up until that moment , it was over .
I was besotted .
Whenever she stopped hiccuping or kicking inside , I missed her .
The next question was simply how I 'd ever get on a plane again and go to Afghanistan without her .
Best Serum I 've Ever Used
This is the one serum that I rely on , hands down .
A few drops goes a long way in giving me what I 've looked for over countless years of trying and trashing .

Give it try , I think you 'll like what you see in your mirror .

Restaurant - owner and folk artist Martin Sanchez has created an urban oasis , a garden of Eden , hidden behind shrubs , trees and a wrought - iron fence inside Martin ’s Tio ’s Tacos restaurant on Mission Inn Avenue in Riverside , California .
Relatively undiscovered , Mr. Sanchez has been working on his creation for almost 10 years .
Patrons of the restaurant can walk underneath cooling streams of water flowing from a fountain garden made of broken pieces of clay and old pipes , discarded bicycles , dolls and other items .

Belarus - based Yuri Shif is rapidly becoming one of the most interesting custom builders outside the US .
Granted , his specialty is show bikes — but he ’s mixing interesting design and paint with a tremendous level of detail .
This S&S - engined machine is the follow - up to the controversial ‘ DUster ’ , the star of the last Custombike and Verona Expo shows .
It ’s mysteriously called Gustav Skippone , for reasons only known to its owner Vladimir Kristovskiy .
As with DUster , the paintwork is unusually pale for a custom , but the retro- inspired cream color strangely works .
The bike is built around a powerhouse 107ci S&S V - twin motor , and transmits its 95 - or - so horsepower through a Baker 6 - speed ‘ box and Continental rubber .
The fuel tank , swingarm and softail frame are all YSC creations — with a classic Harley - Davidson springer handling suspension duties up front .
Expect to hear a lot more about this bike over the next few months at the European shows .
Salt has been around since the beginning of civilization .
Why is it we still can't agree on how to use it ?
Almost every home cook I know has proudly declared , " I hardly use any salt in my cooking . "
But when I ask them what makes restaurant cuisine taste so good , they all agree : it 's the salt .
I feel their pain .
After all these years spent as a home cook , never once having made it through an entire box of salt , it 's unnerving to make your first foray into confidently salting food .
But salt truly is the one factor that will give your food the pop , pizazz and wow every cook craves .
Doing it right just takes a little trial and error .
You do n't need to go out to a specialty market and buy the most expensive , trendy , or rare salt you can find , or a special grinder .
Your fingers , and whatever you have in your kitchen now is probably fine — that is , assuming it 's kosher or sea salt , not table salt .
( This pulverized kitchen sand tends to be , in the words of Deborah Madison , " harsh and not particularly interesting . " )
Kosher salt is beloved among chefs for its texture and flavor .
It has a jagged , rough shape which helps it stick to food and feel substantial between your fingers — you have more control of the amount you grab and release .
Sea salt works for the same reasons , and it's a great finishing salt because of its coarseness , which helps it dissolve at different rates on the tongue .
( Translation :
You 're not hit with a startling , salty mouthful when you bite down . )
That brings me to my next topic : tasting saltiness .
Sometimes this is nice , in the case of caramels sprinkled with sea salt or hot French fries covered in a dusting of the stuff .
But , mostly , a proper salting results in being able to taste the ingredients better , not the salt .
The trick : Season along all stages of the cooking process ( not just the end ) and continue to taste , taste , taste as you go .
Each time you add something to the pot ( unless it 's an ingredient like bacon or capers that has a naturally salty flavor ) , go ahead and season it .
You 'll find you do n't use significantly more salt , but that the foods will develop flavor as they cook in the proper seasoning .
Plus , if you overseason it in one phase , you still have time to compensate .
To avoid overdoing it : Keep in mind that saltiness can change as food sits or shifts in temperature ( as in the case of preparing something in advance and storing it in the fridge ) , or can concentrate as liquids reduce .
It also tends to be absorbed or counteracted by adding dairy — keep this in mind when finishing a soup with heavy cream or a sauce with butter .
If you 've ovedone it :
You can add a splash of cream or a dab of unsalted butter at the end .
Starch , too , can have absorbing powers .
Julia
Child wrote that if you grate raw potatoes into a dish , let them simmer for 7 to 8 minutes , then strain , " they 'll have absorbed quite a bit of the excess salt . "
A final trick , and this will feel posery at first , practice salting food at a height of about 10 or 12 inches above it .
The distance gives a better sense of just how much salt you 're trickling , and the granules will spread more evenly over the food 's surface .
It gives the cook a certain sense of confidence , too .
Chances are you wo n't overdo it when salting in this fashion .
But , I suppose that 's debatable .

As connoisseurs in the United States , Europe and East Asia have discovered civet coffee in recent years , growing demand is fueling a gold rush in the Philippines and Indonesia , the countries with the largest civet populations .
Harvesters are scouring forest floors in the Philippines , where civet coffee has emerged as a new business .
In Indonesia , where the coffee has a long history , enterprising individuals are capturing civets and setting up minifarms , often in their backyards .

Neither the Indonesian government nor the Association of Indonesia Coffee Exporters breaks down civet coffee ’s tiny share of Indonesia ’s overall coffee production .
The Association of Indonesian Coffee Luwak Farmers , created in 2009 to handle the rising demand for civet coffee , or kopi luwak , as it is called in Indonesian , said most civet producers were small - time businessmen who exported directly overseas .
Given the money at stake , fake and low - grade civet coffee beans are also flooding the market .
“ Because of its increasing popularity , there is more civet coffee than ever , but I do n’t trust the quality , ” said Rudy Widjaja , 68 , whose 131 - year - old family - owned coffee store in Jakarta , Warung Tinggi , is considered Indonesia ’s oldest .
Competition is touching off fierce debates .
What is real civet coffee , anyway ?
Does the civet ’s choice of beans make the coffee ?
Or is it the beans ’ journey through the animal ’s digestive tract ?
Can the aroma , fragrance and taste of beans from the droppings of a caged civet ever be as tasty as those from its wild cousin ?
Vie Reyes , whose Manila - based company , Bote Central , entered the civet coffee business five years ago , said she bought only from harvesters of the wild kind .
Ms. Reyes exports to distributors overseas — Japan and South Korea are her biggest markets — and also directly sells 2.2 - pound bags for $ 500 , or about $ 227 a pound .
( CNN ) --
A group of suspected pirates was captured Thursday after attacking a U.S. Navy frigate in the Indian Ocean , according to a statement released by the U.S. Sixth Fleet .
The USS Nicholas reported taking fire from a suspected pirate skiff shortly after midnight local time west of the Seychelles , the statement said .
The Nicholas quickly returned fire and began pursuing the skiff , which was eventually disabled .
A boarding team from the Nicholas subsequently captured and detained three people , the statement said .
The team discovered ammunition and several cans of fuel aboard the skiff , which was later sunk by the Nicholas .
Two more suspected pirates were captured on a confiscated " mother ship , " the statement said .
The detainees will " remain in U.S. custody on board Nicholas until a determination is made regarding their disposition , " it said .
The Pentagon is determining its next steps , and the suspects may be sent to Kenya to be tried in a piracy court there , Pentagon spokesman Bryan Whitman said Thursday
The Nicholas , based in Norfolk , Virginia , is part of the U.S. military 's Africa Command .
The waters off the coast of Somalia -- the Gulf of Aden and the Indian Ocean -- have been plagued by Somali pirates over the last couple of years .
To crack down on piracy , the international community has adopted measures including naval escorts and expanded monitoring .
Last week , one pirate was killed and several others were detained after a private security team thwarted an attack against a Panamanian - flagged cargo ship , the MV Almezaan .
A European Union naval force was called in to assist the vessel .

WHEN I READ THIS TWEET " The only board members who like the exec. comm. are the ones who are on it ! "
I had to admit I agreed with it .
Afterall , what 's the point of serving on a board if all the important and interesting discussions and decisions are had by a few leaving the rest of us to suffer through report meetings ?
Who wants to be just another pretty rubber stamp ?
Executive committees walk a fine line .
Typically consisting of the board 's officers , they are often indispensable in times of crisis .
Big organizations with big boards quite rightly find that smaller " steering " committees serve important oversight functions .
In this instance , the make - up may go well beyond officers to include committee chairs and others ( and the size of a steering committee could be as large as a small full board ) .
But as a routine decision - making body acting on behalf of the full board , an active executive committee can alienate or isolate the rest of its board .
I have worked for and with many organizations where the full board meets every other month or quarter and the executive committee meets on the intervening months .
Or where the executive committee AND the full board both meet every month -- how 's that for duplication ?
Any one of these scenarios begs these questions :
If there 's so much board work to be done that the executive committee needs to meet just as often or MORE often than the full board , why is n't the full board meeting more frequently ?
Or is the executive committee working on a specific crisis or issue that was not assigned - or could not be assigned - to another committee or task force ?
The distinction is very important and must be made clear .
And then there 's the issue of burn - out .
Meeting after meeting , particularly if duplicative , is such a waste of energy and talent .
Since great board members are seemingly hard to come by , why intentionally overburden them ?

The Top 50 Liberal Media Bias Examples . [ # 7 ]
1995 Oklahoma City Bombing :
In an example of jumping to conclusions — as long as such jumping smears the right — the media has for years claimed that convicted Oklahoma City bomber Timothy McVeigh was a " Christian terrorist . "
This is an absurd claim , though , because McVeigh did not perpetrate his crimes in the name of religion nor was he a proselytizing Christian .
He was an anti-government activist and did not use religion to justify any of his actions .
This claim is still extant and even came up recently in a piece by lefty journalist Juan Williams .
McVeigh was also part of the mythic " white militias " fear that the media and President Bill Clinton drummed up in the 1990s with little to no evidence .
1995 Oklahoma City bomber Timothy McVeigh was a Muslim sympathizer .
From the beginning , the media had portrayed McVeigh and co-conspirator Terry Nichols as extremist , " right - wing , " Christian nut - cases . [...]
But The Federalist points out that McVeigh was n't a Christian — he identified himself as an agnostic .
Though raised as a Roman Catholic , McVeigh stated in his 2002 biography American Terrorist that he did not believe in a hell and that science was his religion .
In June 2001 , a day before the execution , McVeigh wrote a letter to the Buffalo News identifying himself as agnostic .
More than that , McVeigh was a Muslim sympathizer .
In her bestseller , The Third Terrorist , investigative journalist Jayna Davis presents the evidence showing that Timothy McVeigh was a front man for Middle Eastern terrorists , and that a third co-conspirator was an Iraqi — the mysterious " John Doe " who was never found .
Davis says the evidence was ignored and dismissed because the Clinton Administration did n't want to go to war with Iraq , the likely culprit , and wanted to blame the attack on domestic right - wingers for political reasons .
Oklahoma City Bombing Investigation : To Demonize Conservatives , Constitutionalists & Christians .
For the Marxists who have infiltrated the American political system and their captive media , the official account of the Oklahoma City bombing was the exclamation point purposely and expeditiously placed at the end of the paragraph that included Waco and Ruby Ridge .
The arrest and conviction of Timothy McVeigh and Terry Nichols was the much - needed mechanism of the Progressive left against the Christian Conservative right during that period of the 1990s .
It continues to serve as the cornerstone for the nefarious agenda that has re-categorized Christians , Conservatives and Constitutionalists as enemies of the state , using the blood of the innocent dead and maimed .
We must not forget that this push for demonization was managed by the Clinton administration which also included Hillary Rodham Clinton , and the Department of Justice under Janet Reno .
Its political and ideological importance cannot be understated , and has become much clearer for those who understand and are paying attention to history .
$ 10 M upgrade to OKC Memorial and Museum helps visitors mark 20th anniversary .
The National Memorial and Museum , built to commemorate the terror attack on a federal building on April 19 , 1995 , is taking strides towards the future , while preserving the memory of one of America 's darkest days .
McVeigh regarded bombing that killed 168 people a failure .
Timothy McVeigh considered the bombing of the Oklahoma City federal building 20 years ago somewhat of a failure , viewed himself as a " Paul Revere - type messenger " and even suggested his defense team should receive $ 800,000 from the government , according to an archive of documents donated by the convicted bomber 's lead attorney .
OKC Bombshell Implicates Feds In Murrah Blast .
Only moments after an enormous blast blew away most of the facade and a full quarter of the eastern end of the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City in 1995 , the FBI and Bureau of Alcohol , Tobacco and Firearms ( BATF ) began to release evidence implicating two men , and two men only , who they claimed were solely responsible .
The evidence later showed that Timothy McVeigh and Terry Nichols had confessed to the impossible .
At first , several independent investigators came forward to complain that there was an obvious cover -up .
Now they call it the " ongoing cover - up of the cover - up . "
And now , even the new OKC museum contradicts the official theory of what happened on April 19 .
Officials in charge at the time still refuse to discuss anything other than the manufactured spin : [...]
The Dipole Might Project : The Dipole Might ( DM ) project , initiated in 1990 , provided for the first comprehensive , scientific analysis of large scale ( 50 - 5,000 pounds ) vehicle bombs .
It is a multi-national endeavor which uses a computer - aided design program to analyze various effects of vehicle bomb blasts .
The Bureau of Alcohol , Tobacco , and Firearms ( BATF ) sponsored a series of controlled vehicular explosions .
Man claims tampering in case over bombing videos .
[ Utah attorney Jesse ]
Trentadue says the agency is refusing to release videos that show a second person was with Timothy McVeigh when he parked a truck outside the Oklahoma City federal building and detonated a bomb that killed 168 people .
Utah lawyer claims FBI withholding evidence in OKC bombing , brother 's death .
A trial has opened in Utah over documents and videotape of the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing , and whether the FBI is refusing to hand it over .
Jesse Trentadue , who claims his brother was killed in an interrogation by federal agents when he was mistaken for a bombing co-conspirator , is suing for the records .
The FBI said Monday it has provided everything he asked for and everything it has . [...]
Trentadue claims his requests under the Freedom of Information Act ( FOIA ) for surveillance tapes from around the bomb site have n't been fulfilled .
FBI Defends Search for Oklahoma City Bombing Video .
The FBI thoroughly searched its archives and found no evidence that more videos of the Oklahoma City bombing exist , agency employees told a judge Monday [ 7/28/2014 ] in a trial that has rekindled questions about whether any others were involved in the 1995 attack .
Trial to begin over video of 1995 Oklahoma City bombing .
The case is at the heart of Jesse Trentadue 's quest to explain his brother 's mysterious jail cell death 19 years ago , which has rekindled long - dormant questions about whether others were involved in the deadly 1995 blast .
They Are Lying to You About the Oklahoma City Bombing .
Jesse 's brother , Kenneth Michael Trentadue , was tortured to death in federal custody in the summer of 1995 .
And it turns out the reason , the probable reason anyway that he was tortured to death in federal custody , was because it was a case of mistaken identity .
They were trying to get him to admit that he was a guy named Richard Lee Guthrie , who was one of the John Does suspected in the Oklahoma City bombing .
And Kenneth Trentadue , unfortunately , was just at the wrong place at the wrong time with the wrong color hair , the wrong truck , the wrong dragon tattoo on his arm , and they were just convinced that he was Richard Guthrie , and he paid for it with his life .
Terrance Yeakey Truth .
Sergeant Terrance
Yeakey was the first to arrive on the scene that terrible day and saved the lives of ( 8 ) eight people from the rubble of the building and the horrific effects of the explosion .
The article says Yeakey committed suicide because he was living emotional pain because he could not do more to help the people injured in the bombing , and that he was suffering from intense survivor guilt which he was unable to manage .
But others in Oklahoma City , including the family of Terrance Yeakey , claim that his death was not a suicide at all , but a brutal murder , and indicate that local law enforcement were complicit in covering up this murder .
A Noble Lie : Oklahoma City Bombing .
The first feature length documentary to examine the Oklahoma City bombing in the light of new and suppressed evidence that proves the official story to be false and that Timothy McVeigh was not the sole perpetrator on that terrible April 19th , 1995 .
Oklahoma City Bombing Families Believe FBI Knew .
There is no doubt that Timothy McVeigh was guilty , says [ Ambrose ] Evans - Pritchard , but he believes that nothing like the full story has ever come out .
Why ?
Because the government , although it interviewed over 20,000 people , failed to call many knowledgeable witnesses during the trial , witnesses who could discuss collaborators with McVeigh and Nichols .
He makes a strong case that the reason the government covered up — and continues to cover up — is that bumbling FBI agents knew in advance that the bombing plot was afoot but failed to stop it .
He discloses what he calls " the smoking gun of the Oklahoma bombing , " a memo written only two days after the bombing .
The memo discusses the FBI 's debriefing of a Bureau of Alcohol , Tobacco and Firearms undercover agent who infiltrated a neo -Nazi paramilitary group where men close to McVeigh talked about using violence against the U.S. government .
Jon Rappoport Interview with OKC Bombing Grand Juror .
As in the JFK assassination , disturbing evidence of a different sort of murder scenario from the official version has emerged ; and typically it has been relegated to the " conspiracy file " by the mainstream press .
Very serious questions about bombs other than the ammonium nitrate truck bomb have surfaced .
McVeigh himself in some eyes begins to appear as the dupe , the patsy left holding the bag .
Key stories about federal law enforcement agencies having advance warning of a bombing in Oklahoma City are gaining credibility .
Researchers on the scene in Oklahoma City are talking about the FBI intimidating witnesses and thereby shaping a false version of events .
Oklahoma City Bombing Questions .
" Norma , " a witness who worked in an office building just down the street from the Federal building , told reporter Sherry Koonce what she saw prior to the explosion : " The day was fine , everything was normal when I arrived for work at about 7:45 a.m .
There was some talk about the bomb squad among the employees at our office .
We wondered what it was doing in our parking lot .
Around nine I heard and felt a huge explosion .
Then someone said it had to be a bomb , and we all knew .
I remembered the bomb squad in our parking lot and knew what had happened . "
" Norma " has since quit her job , gone into hiding and refused to speak again to any reporters or investigators .
So have a number of other people who saw the heavily armed and equipped bomb squad in the area up to three hours before the blast .
Why ?
Deceiving America -- More Witness Deaths .
According to the official government story , which the news media accepted without question , the bombing in Oklahoma City , at the Alfred P. Murrah Building on April 19 , 1995 , was the work of American dissidents bent on a violent overthrow of the government .
Congress responded by immediately enacting legislation to give the government unprecedented latitude with the invasion of individual privacy .
All evidence actually points to a well planned , sophisticated government operation put into motion months earlier , with a massive cover - up controlled by the U. S. Justice Department , and carried through and beyond the " Star Chamber " charade of trials in Denver in 1997 .
The Legacy Of The Oklahoma City Bombing .

General Parton clearly proved that the explosive devices that brought down the building were shaped charges of C - 4 Plastic and not Ammonium Nitrate .
I also interviewed a gentlemen at the nearby Classen High School museum ( 1½ block from the Murrah Bldg . ) who was in the museum the day of the explosions and he was very sure that the first explosion ( Am. Nitrate Bomb ) could be heard like a loud boom but that the second explosion was a sharp crack bang which shook the museum bldg .
and broke several glass windows in the museum .
I worked with a group in Ok .
City to try to replicate the concrete skeleton of the Murrah Building to prove that an Am.
Nitrate bomb could not have destroyed the concrete columns in the building but was not able to muster the funds to do so .
The positive proof that the root cause of the explosion was not the Am.
Nitrate bomb was the fact that the entire Murrah Building debris was hauled away and buried in nearby El Reno at the U.S. Army Reservation and marked " restricted area " .
New OKC Revelations Spotlight FBI Involvement In Bombing .
New claims by Oklahoma City Bombing conspirator Terry Nichols that Timothy McVeigh was being steered by a high - level FBI official are supported by a plethora of evidence that proves McVeigh did not act alone and that authorities had prior warnings and were complicit in the bombing of the Alfred P. Murrah building .
The Oklahoma City Bombing Case Revelations .
The OKC bombing was a failed federal sting operation that was , and still is , being covered up by federal officials and bureaucrats .
Officials had prior warnings from domestic and Islamic terror groups and foreign governments including West Germany and Israel .
But the officials also had their own prior warnings because of intelligence they had gathered from informants and provocateurs that U.S. government agencies had planted within the groups responsible for carrying out the OKC bombing .
The government officials and agents involved are criminally and civilly liable because they did not have adequate fail - safes built in to warn the public or preempt the OKC bombing if things got out of control .
Since they used provocateurs , they had a moral and legal responsibility to set up and use these fail - safes but they did not .
Furthermore , some of these officials and agents criminally obstructed justice and perjured themselves in court and criminally withheld evidence to maintain a cover up and protect themselves from civil and criminal liability for their negligence .
Was Saddam the Man Behind McVeigh ?

Suffice it to say that there is evidence of Iraqi involvement in at least one and perhaps all three of most deadly terrorist attacks in the United States to date .
It may or may not prove dispositive , but it can no longer safely be ignored .
Govt Faces Trial Re : Missing Tapes — Terry Nichols Confessed to FBI of Middle Eastern Operation — Likely Iraqi .
No matter what you think we know about the bombing of the Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City in 1995 , U.S. District Judge Clark Waddoups acknowledged that the government has not complied with Freedom of Information
Act request for specific tapes of the Murrah , surrounding buildings and the dash - cam of the police traffic stop of Timothy McVeigh 90 minutes after the bombing .
If the requested tapes are ever released there are hopes they will show a bombing suspect or suspects who remain (s ) unidentified or perhaps one has been identified as Hussain al - Hussaini .
Newly - Discovered FBI Memo Supports Previous Claims of Iraqi Involvement in OKC Bombing .
The once - classified memo , according to an article published Tuesday by The Center for Public Integrity , was discovered by Jesse Trentadue , a Utah lawyer I interviewed in September 2009 about the mysterious disappearance of surveillance tapes from downtown Oklahoma City .
He has spent years researching the Oklahoma City case trying to prove a connection between the terrorist bombing and the death of his brother in an Oklahoma prison in the summer of 1995 .
New Oklahoma City Bombing Trial Set for Spring 2014 .
A federal judge in Utah ruled today that a trial will be held to resolve a long - running legal battle between Jesse Trentadue and the FBI over videotape footage recorded in downtown Oklahoma City April 19 , 1995 — footage the Salt Lake City attorney believes will help him unravel a mystery almost two decades old .
The mystery in this case surrounds the death of Jesse Trentadue 's brother , Kenneth Trentadue , who died under suspicious circumstances while in custody at the U.S. Bureau of Prisons Federal Transfer Center in Oklahoma City several months after the Oklahoma City Bombing .
Memo suggests FBI had mole inside ABC News in 1990s .
A once - classified FBI memo reveals that the bureau treated a senior ABC News journalist as a potential confidential informant in the 1990s , pumping the reporter to ascertain the source of a sensational but uncorroborated tip that the network had obtained during its early coverage of the Oklahoma City bombing .
The journalist , whose name is not disclosed in the document labeled " secret , " not only cooperated but provided the identity of a confidential source , according to the FBI memo — a possible breach of journalistic ethics if he or she did not have the source 's permission .
Shielding the Enemy .
A mere 20 years ago , responding to pressure from then - President Clinton to de-emphasize Arab international terrorism , FBI head Louis Freeh shifted the agency 's focus from foreign terrorists to domestic terrorists or " rightwing extremists . "
As a direct consequence , 40 boxes of evidence from the first World Trade Center attack in 1993 that would have revealed valuable information about Al Qaeda operations were never reviewed and key evidence , including the presence of Arab nationals at U.S. flight schools , was ignored .
In the same way , serious evidence of Middle Eastern involvement in the Oklahoma City bombing that claimed 168 lives , injured more than 680 people and damaged 324 buildings within a 16 block radius was ignored .

While Kenney was in federal custody , indictments were handed down against Timothy McVeigh and Terry Nichols — as well as " others unknown " — for their role in the Oklahoma City Bombing .
That occurred on August 10 .
Kenney arrived at the Oklahoma City Federal Transfer Facility — just a few miles from the courtroom where McVeigh and Nicholas had been indicted — on August 18 .
Three days later , he was dead , supposedly of suicide .

Not only were prison officials indecently eager to cremate Kenney 's body , they were also frantic to sanitize the " suicide - proof " cell .
This was a criminal act of evidence tampering . [...]

Adventure game veteran Ron Gilbert has left Hothead Games , the studio at work on his upcoming .
Thecreator says that now that the game 's creative and production phase has wrapped , he 's finished with his work at the studio .
" When I started working there two years ago , my goal was to makethe most awesome game ever made and have it win a Nobel Prize and the early word out of Stockholm is that DeathSpank is neck - in - neck with some string theory dweeb ( eleven dimensions my ass ) , " writes Gilbert on his personal blog Just last month , Electronic Arts ' EA Partners signed DeathSpank for publication on Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 , and although a PC version was n't announced , an EA rep implied that one was at least under consideration .
" Asends the creative and production phases and starts down that long and winding road of certification and testing of the XBox and PS3 and [ REDACTED ] versions , it 's looking quite amazing and is damn funny , " writes Gilbert .
" So , to quote my childhood hero George W. Bush : Mission Accomplished .
" Gilbert says he 'll continue to work with both EA and Hothead to promote , which is slated to release later this year .
The game blends adventure gaming and - style dungeon - crawling , and will have a humorous tone that relies on beloved tropes of the adventure genre .
Hothead is also developer of , and whilewas originally intended as an episodic title , it 's now been reformulated into a more traditional release .
Although he says he has " vowed to blog more and try and remember my twitter password , " Gilbert did not indicate what his next professional steps will be .
He 's best known for his work with LucasArts on , and the SCUMM scripting language that became a major defining factor in LucasArts ' PC adventure game success .
After leaving LucasArts , he founded Humongous / Cavedog , and a few years back , set out on his own .
The San Francisco Police Commission voted 4 - 3 late Wednesday against drafting a policy to allow officers to use Tasers , after hearing from several researchers and advocates who warned the panel about the lethal risk of the electric stun guns .
Commissioner Petra DeJesus , a leading Taser opponent on the panel , said she refused to be a " rubber stamp " for the department - namely Chief George Gascón , who has pushed for the stun guns to save lives and spare injuries .
Tasers , she said , " have n't been vetted to a level I think is required . "
She said San Franciscans need to be asked if they want them , given the $ 1 million plus price tag and the possibility that the devices could cause sudden death of unarmed suspects .
" If we do want Tasers at all , the commission should be a partner along the way - but it has not been , " DeJesus said .
It was the second time in two weeks that the commission , consisting of four mayoral appointees and three appointees of the Board of Supervisors , had rejected the proposal to draw up a policy under which officers would be allowed Tasers .
The panel also voted down the idea in 2004 .
The panel 's president , Joe Marshall , said he supported Gascón 's effort to come up with a policy after years of delay .
" I believe this man knows what he is doing , " he said .
But Commissioner Jim Hammer , who voted against Tasers , cited research showing that in -custody deaths increased in the first year of Taser deployment in 50 California cities .
" I will not rush into this tonight , " he said .
DeJesus and Commissioners Vincent Pan and Yvonne Lee joined Hammer in voting against Tasers .
All but Lee are supervisors ' appointees .
Marshall and Commissioners Thomas Mazzucco and David Onek , all appointed by Newsom , voted for the devices .
Gascón said he had intended to impose strict conditions on when officers could use Tasers .
He said he was dismayed by the commission 's vote , but was not as sharply critical as when the panel voted down the devices last month .
Then , he called delays in giving the stun guns to officers " unconscionable . "
Most cities use Tasers
San Francisco is one of only a few major cities in the United States whose officers are not equipped with the weapons , which incapacitate suspects by stunning them with an electrical charge .
After becoming chief in July , Gascón commissioned a study of officer - involved shootings in San Francisco over five years that found that as many as one - third could have been avoided had police been able to use Tasers .
Critics , however , cite studies that indicate a possible connection between the stun guns and the risk of sudden heart attack in people hit with them .
They note that manufacturer Taser International warned police last year not to fire the devices at suspects ' chests , after one of the company 's scientific advisers concluded that at least one fatal heart attack in an otherwise healthy person had been caused by the device .
John Burton , a lawyer who won a $ 5 million judgment against Taser International in the case of a man who died after being hit with a police Taser in Salinas , urged the commission to reject the stun guns as " very dangerous " and largely untested and unregulated .
" Departments are relying on training and representations of the manufacturer , which has a built - in conflict of interest , " he said , adding that Taser had " covered up a real health risk . "
Burton said the company has known since 2005 that the devices could stop the hearts of animals and , later , humans , but failed to warn officers until late last year about not firing at the chest and against multiple uses .
" This is a company that simply refuses to sell its product with advice about how it could be used most safely , " Burton said , adding that the " hidden dangers " outweigh the utility of the device .
Taser International did not send a representative to the meeting .
ACLU weighs in
Kelli Evans , associate director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Northern California , urged the panel to reject the proposal as ill conceived and premature .
" The first step is to back up , " Evans said .
" You 've got the cart before the horse . "
She said the Police Department should first reach out to community groups , particularly mental health experts , before the matter goes to the commission .
" What needs to happen is a community dialogue - does this really make sense in San Francisco right now ? " she said , suggesting that the community distrusts the police and the department 's use - of - force tracking .
Evans pointed to Memphis , Tenn. , where officers do not have Tasers .
She said the police department there has opted instead to create a mental health response team , reasoning that most unruly suspects who would be hit with the stun guns have psychological problems .
She said that if San Francisco does deploy Tasers , it is " important not to do it carte blanche . "
But 38 - year SFPD veteran Vince Repetto , who joined a contingent of officers waiting to speak in favor of Tasers , said before the meeting that the Taser proposal is literally " a life - or - death decision . "
" It 's not if , but when , a Taser is used to stop a knife - wielding suspect and a life is saved , " he said .
" Then you will see the results of your decision .
Let us hope that same suspect is not shot dead because an officer lacked a valuable option to deadly force . "
Police Officers Association Gary Delagnes told the commission that a no vote would be essentially expressing no confidence in the chief .
" He 's not an idiot - he knows what he is doing , " Delagnes said .

Mercedes hopes the longer wheelbase car it plans to introduce at the Spanish Grand Prix will help it get a grip on the weight distribution issues that it has encountered so far this season .
The Brackley - based outfit is set to introduce a major aerodynamic upgrade to its W01 for next month 's race at Barcelona , and will also lengthen the wheelbase of the car .
Team principal Ross Brawn has revealed that the motivation for making the major wheelbase change has been prompted by the fact the team miscalculated the weight distribution needs for the 2010 tyres .
" The problem is not actually the wheelbase per se , it is the weight distribution , " Brawn said about the motivation for the change .
" We got the weight distribution wrong .
" When we got to test these tyres we realised we did n't have the correct weight distribution and we went to the limit with what we could achieve with this car .
It is not the wheelbase as such , it is the weight distribution that is not what we wanted it .
" The tyres changed quite a bit ... and we did n't have the opportunity to test these tyres , and we did n't have as good a guess of what was required as some of the other teams .
So we will have a modification to the car at Barcelona which will give us a better range for the weight distribution that we can achieve . "
As well as helping with the overall handling of the car , the weight distribution changes may well help iron out some of the understeer tendencies that have left Michael Schumacher struggling on his F1 return .
Brawn also said that Mercedes will likely introduce a fully working version of an F - duct in the next few events , having begun experimenting with a blown rear - wing in China last weekend .
" McLaren 's system , which is driver operated , is quite complicated to get to work properly , " said Brawn .
" McLaren conceived that car to accommodate the system , and it is not so easy to put it onto [ other ] cars .
" What we had in China was a simple , passive system .
It is not driver operated , so it is not as effective as the McLaren system .
" We are still working on a proper system that we will have at Barcelona or Istanbul .
It is complicated to get to work properly , but our aerodynamicists are working on it . "

Princes of Perdition : Five Myths about Catholic Sexual Abuse
VATICAN CITY —
As Benedict XVI prepares to mark the fifth anniversary of his election as pope here on Monday , he is beset by devastating reports about the sexual abuse of children by Catholic priests — and about his own role in the crisis .
The reports have prompted sharp condemnations of the pontiff as well as a backlash of media criticism from papal defenders in the Vatican and around the world .
Amid the firestorm , myths have emerged that only complicate the search for truth , healing and accountability .
1. Pope Benedict is the primary culprit in the coverup of the abuse scandal .
Between 1981 and 2005 , Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger , the future pope , headed the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith , the Vatican ’s office for doctrinal orthodoxy .
A few abuse cases ( some from the United States ) came before him , and the evidence shows that he did not move with any urgency to defrock priests .
In 2001 , as the number of cases coming to light worldwide increased , Ratzinger convinced Pope John Paul II to let his office have jurisdiction over all of them .
Though the Vatican says church confidentiality did not preclude bishops from reporting crimes to civil authorities , some see Ratzinger ’s move as an attempt to keep the cases secret .
Nonetheless , there is just one case so far that can be traced directly to Ratzinger ’s tenure as a bishop , when he was head of the archdiocese of Munich in his native Germany .
In that 1980 case , Ratzinger allowed a child abuser into his diocese for psychiatric treatment , and the priest was reassigned to a parish where he went on to abuse more children .
It ’s unclear whether Ratzinger personally signed off on the assignment , but he seems to have acted more or less like most bishops at the time — giving little oversight to the abuser and doing nothing to remove him from the priesthood .
Alas , there is plenty of blame to go around for the church ’s passivity .
As pope , Benedict has blamed the media for exaggerating the scandals , yet he has moved more aggressively against abusers than John Paul II , his predecessor , who tried to stop defrocking priests altogether and who ignored evidence of the terrible abuses by the late Marcial Maciel Degollado , a well - known Mexican priest who founded the Legionaries of Christ , a secretive order that is under Vatican investigation .
During the 2000s , as Ratzinger came to realize the scope of the abuse , he expedited the defrocking of abusive priests and reopened the Maciel case , which had been closed under John Paul .
“ We realize that it ’s necessary to repent , ” Benedict said in a homily on Thursday .
He has still has not punished bishops , however , with the same rigor with which he has targeted abusers .
2. Gay priests are to blame .
Some defenders of the Catholic Church ’s response to the abuse crisis say that homosexual priests are responsible for the majority of abuses , in part because more than 80 percent of the victims are male .
They argue that true pedophiles — adults who are pathologically attracted to pre-pubescent children — constitute a small minority of offenders .
Vatican Secretary of State Tarcisio Bertone repeated this gay - pedophile link on Wednesday , and such reasoning was partially behind a 2005 Vatican policy barring gays from seminaries .
Such assertions have numerous flaws .
For one thing , research shows that gay men are no more likely to molest children than straight men .
( And celibacy does n’t seem to be a determining factor , either . )
Yes , 80 percent of the victims were male , but many offenders assaulted children of both sexes .
Maciel abused boys and fathered children with several women .
Moreover , the abusers had access to boys ; an adult male could n’t go on overnight trips with girls or take them away unchaperoned .
Finally , while critics of gay clerics fret that homosexuals dominate the priesthood and endanger children , in fact the ostensible increase in gay priests in recent years has coincided with a sharp decrease in reports of child abuse by clergy .
3. Sexual abuse is more pervasive in the Catholic Church than in other institutions .
Sexual abuse of minors is not the province of the Catholic Church alone .
About 4 percent of priests committed an act of sexual abuse on a minor between 1950 and 2002 , according to a study being conducted by John Jay College of Criminal Justice in New York .
That is roughly consistent with data on many similar professions .
An extensive 2007 investigation by the Associated Press showed that sexual abuse of children in U.S. schools was “ widespread , ” and most of it was never reported or punished .
And in Portland , Ore. , last week , a jury reached a $ 1.4 million verdict against the Boy Scouts of America in a trial that showed that since the 1920s , Scouts officials kept “ perversion files ” on suspected abusers but kept them secret .
“ We do n’t see the Catholic Church as a hotbed of this or a place that has a bigger problem than anyone else , ” Ernie Allen , president of the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children , told Newsweek .
“ I can tell you without hesitation that we have seen cases in many religious settings , from traveling evangelists to mainstream ministers to rabbis and others . ”
Part of the issue is that the Catholic Church is so tightly organized and keeps such meticulous records — many of which have come to light voluntarily or through court orders — that it can yield a fairly reliable portrait of its personnel and abuse over the decades .
Other institutions , and most other religions , are more decentralized and harder to analyze or prosecute .
Still , it is hardly good news that the church appears to be no different from most other institutions in its incidence of abuse .
Should n’t the Catholic Church and other religious institutions hold to a higher standard ?
4. Media outlets are biased against the Catholic Church .
While the Vatican and the pope ’s champions argue — often in conspiratorial tones — that the media is biased against the church , the truth is quite the opposite .
The church and the pope do receive major media attention , and with reason .
The pope is a world leader as well as the temporal head of one of the world ’s most storied religious traditions .
There are more than 1.1 billion Catholics on the planet , and the Catholic Church is the largest denomination in the United States , with more than 65 million baptized members .
In the media , holidays such as Christmas and Easter tend to be dominated by Catholic images .
The pope also makes news with his pronouncements on a range of topics , and his travels are media events .
Pope John Paul II ’s death and funeral in April 2005 produced wall - to - wall coverage for weeks , generating some of the most favorable press the church has ever had .
The annual survey of religion in the news conducted by the Pew Forum on Religion and Public Life showed that in 2008 — the year Benedict traveled to Washington and New York — coverage of the pope and of the Catholic Church accounted for more than half of all news stories about religion , and the majority were positive or explanatory .
You do n’t hear the church complaining about this kind of attention .
5 . The crisis will compel U.S. Catholics to leave the church .
When the initial revelations of widespread sexual abuse by clergy emerged in 2002 , many believed that Catholics would abandon the church en masse , or at least send the institution toward insolvency by withholding donations .
But then , as now , American Catholics turned out to be an unpredictable lot .
Though critical of the bishops and the Vatican , Catholics tend to love their local parishes and priests .
And even if they do n’t heed all church mandates , they do n’t easily shed all the cultural and sacramental markers of their faith .
A 2007 Pew survey of the religious landscape in America found that among Catholics who had left the church , the abuse crisis ranked low on the list of reasons — well behind church teachings on homosexuality , the role of women , abortion and contraception .
And a 2008 poll by Georgetown University ’s Center for Applied Research in the Apostolate showed that even the bishops had enjoyed a rebound in approval , with satisfaction with the hierarchy growing from 58 percent in 2004 to 72 percent in 2008 .
Still , Catholic leaders ca n’t be complacent .
Some 10 percent of all Americans are former Catholics , and without immigrants , the number of American Catholics would be falling , not growing slightly .
In a competitive marketplace , it ’s not smart to put your customers ’ loyalty to such a test .

New evidence shows immunization against " swine flu " in 1976 might provide individuals with some protection against the 2009 pandemic H1N1 influenza virus , according to new research from St. Jude investigators .
Researchers found that individuals who reported receiving the 1976 vaccine mounted an enhanced immune response against both the 2009 pandemic H1N1 virus and a different H1N1 flu strain that circulated during the 2008 - 09 flu season .
The work appears in the April 23 online issue of the journal Clinical Infectious Diseases .
" Our research shows that while immunity among those vaccinated in 1976 has waned somewhat , they mounted a much stronger immune response against the current pandemic H1N1 strain than others who did not receive the 1976 vaccine , " said Jonathan A. McCullers , M.D. , an associate member of the St. Jude Infectious Diseases Department and the study 's lead author .
McCullers said it is unclear if the response was enough to protect against the 2009 H1N1 virus , but the study points to a lingering benefit .
The findings also raise hope that those vaccinated against the 2009 H1N1 pandemic strain might also enjoy a similar long - term advantage .
The study is the first to focus on whether those vaccinated against the 1976 H1N1 strain made antibodies against the 2009 pandemic flu , including antibodies that could block the virus from infecting cells .
This research follows an earlier study from the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that reported blood taken from volunteers shortly after they were vaccinated in 1976 and stored for decades also showed a strong immune response to the 2009 pandemic virus .
Investigators noted the results might not reflect the immune response those same volunteers would mount today .
The latest effort involved 116 St. Jude employees and spouses age 55 and older .
The group included 46 vaccinated in 1976 against the H1N1 flu virus , known as A / New Jersey / 76 , which sickened more than 200 military recruits in New Jersey .
That outbreak triggered fears of a flu pandemic and led to a massive government effort to quickly produce and distribute a vaccine .

The current study was conducted in August 2009 before a vaccine was available against the pandemic H1N1 flu strain and before the virus was circulating widely in the Memphis , Tenn. , metropolitan area , where study volunteers lived .
Researchers reported that nearly 90 percent of volunteers made antibodies able to recognize a key protein on the surface of both the 2009 pandemic and the 2008 - 09 H1N1 flu strains .
Those antibodies were present in numbers large enough to meet one federal gauge of vaccine effectiveness .
Nineteen percent of volunteers also produced antibodies that neutralized the 2009 pandemic strain and blocked it from infecting cells .
In comparison , more than 67 percent of volunteers had antibodies that neutralized the 2008 - 09 seasonal H1N1 strain .
Those vaccinated in 1976 were more likely to make neutralizing antibodies against the new pandemic strain .
More than 17 percent of the 1976 - vaccine group made such antibodies in large quantities .
Only about 4 percent of those who had not received the 1976 shot had comparable levels of antibody production .
The difference between the two groups was statistically significant , meaning it was unlikely chance alone explained the result .
The work reflects ongoing efforts to understand why the current pandemic flu has taken a greater toll on children and young adults than on those ages 65 and older .
In this study , researchers focused on older individuals to better gauge the impact of the 1976 " swine flu " shot or possible childhood exposure to flu viruses similar to the current pandemic strain .
McCullers said those viruses last circulated in the 1930s and 1940s .
The unexpectedly robust immune response mounted by all the volunteers suggests that routine vaccination against seasonal flu might confer a broader - than - realized protection , McCullers said .
The St. Jude volunteers included many health care workers who are vaccinated annually against flu .
Other St. Jude authors are Lee - Ann Van De Velde , Kim Allison , Kristen Branum , Richard Webby and Patricia Flynn , all of Infectious Diseases .

Advice for Undergraduates Considering Graduate School
Phil Agre
October 1996 .
With some additional notes added May 2001 .
A PDF version is available here : http://dlis.gseis.ucla.edu/people/pagre/grad-school.pdf
This article contains informal advice for undergraduates who are thinking about graduate school .
Graduate school comes in three varieties : professional schools ( law , medicine , education , and so on ) , master 's programs , and doctoral programs .
I know little about either professional schools or master 's programs , so I will concentrate on doctoral programs .
In particular , I will use the term " graduate school " to refer to doctoral programs .
Please note , too , that I originally wrote this document for students in my own field and department .
Things might work differently where you are , particularly if you are not currently in college , or if the faculty in your college do not do much research in the area that most interests you .
As with all advice , only trust these notes to the extent they correspond to your own experience .
You might also consider reading books about job - hunting , since that 's often a good way to look at the process of applying to graduate school .
I recommend Tom Jackson 's " Guerrilla Tactics in the New Job Market " ( second edition , New York : Bantam , 1991 ) .
WHAT IS GRADUATE SCHOOL ?
Graduate school is training in research .
It is for people who love research , scholarship , and teaching for their own sake and for the difference they can sometimes make in the world .
It is not for people who simply want more undergraduate courses .
It is not for people who are in a hurry to get a real job .
The eventual goal of many doctoral students is to get a job as a college professor , or perhaps in industrial or government research .
Some in technical subjects go on to start companies .
But many just do it because they like it .
More specifically , graduate school is typically a five to eight year program ( in the US anyway ; fewer years in most other countries ) of study and research organized by a single department or interdisciplinary program of some university , culminating in a doctoral degree ( usually a PhD ) .
In the United States , as a general rule , the term " university " refers to a college that grants doctoral degrees .
Some individual departments in a university may not have graduate programs .
But a research - oriented university will normally grant doctorates in dozens of different fields .
A common misconception is that you cannot apply to a PhD program until you have completed a master 's degree .
This is rarely the case .
If you want a PhD , apply to a PhD program .
You 'll need an undergraduate degree before you start the PhD program , but you can apply to the PhD program before your undergraduate work is done .
Graduate school , as I mentioned , generally takes five to eight years .
That 's a long time .
The first year is often the worst .
It usually consists of an overwhelming amount of structured reading , designed to give you a generalized background in the basic texts of the particular field .
But the exact format of the first few years of graduate school varies widely .
Typically one must pass a set of " comprehensive exams " ( often called " comps " ) to continue in the program past a certain point .
People do fail these exams .
And the workload and the possibility of failure often cause a great deal of anxiety .
I have elaborate ideas about the causes and cures of this situation , but I 'll reserve them for another occasion .
My point here is simply that this unhappy period passes , to be followed by more interesting periods .
The next few years of graduate school are usually focused on finding a topic and advisor for one 's dissertation , along with additional coursework and teaching assistantships .
The best part of graduate school , the part that makes it worthwhile , comes toward the end , when you begin to present your research in public .
Suddenly you will begin to join the community of scholars who work in your chosen area ; they will take you seriously and you will begin to make numerous professional acquaintances , some of whom you will probably keep for the rest of your life .
( I 've written another article , similar to this one , about this process of professional networking .
It 's online at http://dlis.gseis.ucla.edu/pagre/network.html .)
Graduate school , then , is quite different from undergraduate school .
It takes longer , it requires more focused and sustained work , it involves more intensive relationships with faculty and other students , and it makes considerably greater demands on your personal identity .
You can get through your undergraduate education , if you care to , without ever really thinking about who you are or what you want to accomplish in the world .
In graduate school , though , your personal identity will almost certainly undergo great change .
In particular , you will acquire a particular sort of professional identity : you will become known as the person who wrote such - and - such a paper , who did such - and - such research , who refuted such - and - such theory , or who initiated such - and - such line of inquiry .
This process can be tremendously satisfying .
But it 's not for everyone .
DO I WANT TO GO TO GRADUATE SCHOOL ?
Your undergraduate education will not enable you to decide whether to go to graduate school .
You will need to ask for advice .
You should figure that the decision will take about a year to make , so ask for a lot of advice over a long period .
Start toward the middle of your junior year , if not before .
You should get advice from everyone you consider either knowledgeable or wise , but particularly from professors .
Actively explore the possibility of graduate school even if you think your odds of actually going are relatively low ; many people have discovered that they had misconceptions about graduate school and that it is more interesting than they thought .
Many people have difficulty asking for advice about such things , especially from professors , because they are embarrassed at not already knowing all the answers .
But you should understand that a large part of what professors do all day is to give people advice .
And professors know a great deal about graduate school .
In particular , a professor who does research in a given area will probably know a large proportion of the other people who do research in that area .
Indeed , he or she will probably have visited most of the departments that have good graduate programs in the area .
On the other hand , professors ( like everyone else ) see things from their own personal angle , so you should expect to get different advice from different people .
That 's life .
You can also talk to the graduate students in your department , for example the ones who have served as teaching assistants in your classes .
The first step is the hardest .
Start by making a guess at the field or topic that you might want to study in graduate school .
Then pick a professor who seems approachable and might know something about that topic , perhaps because he or she teaches a course in that area .
Show up in that person 's office during scheduled office hours and say , " Hello .
I 'd like to ask your advice .
I am thinking I might want to go to graduate school , but I 'm still uncertain about where I would go or what exactly I would study .
I do know that I 'm pretty interested in such - and - such .
How would I find out about graduate schools in that area ? "
Some common responses to this are as follows :
(1) " I do n't actually know much about that area , but you should talk to so - and - so who is really the expert on that . "
Go talk to so - and - so .
( 2) " I think you 're going to have to define your interests a little better before I can help you . "
Ask for help in defining your interests better .
(3) The response you 're looking for , namely a list of all the good graduate programs in that area , with as much detailed description of them as you can possibly digest .
What next ?
Well , let 's back up and talk about research .
RESEARCH
Graduate school , as I said , is training in research .
When a graduate school looks at your application , their principal question is , " Is this person going to be good at research ? "
Indeed , that should be one of your own principal questions as well .
How can you tell if you 're going to be good at research ?
Getting good grades in your undergraduate classes is important , but it 's not really the main thing .
The main thing is this : if you want to go to graduate school , you should start getting involved in research as an undergraduate .
This fact is usually kept secret , but it 's true .
And in retrospect it 's obvious why .
Graduate school is a big commitment , both for you and for the department that accepts you into its graduate program .
You should try your hand at research first so that everyone can make a well - informed decision .
( On the other hand , if you do n't manage to get involved in research as an undergraduate , you should go ahead and apply to graduate school anyway , and consider including your best undergraduate term paper with your application . )
How can an undergraduate get involved in research ?
This question has two answers , the official answer and the real answer .
The official answer will take the form of administrative mechanisms ( independent study courses , faculty mentor programs , and so forth ) that provide formal structures around a project that you might be involved in .
Go talk to your department 's undergraduate coordinator , find out what these mechanisms are , and read the necessary paperwork .
Then forget about them for a while , because the real answer to the question lies in your professional relationship to the faculty member who will supervise your research .
But who will this person be ?
That 's the hard part .
As with all professional relationships , you 're looking for a match between your interests and abilities and those of a faculty member .
Finding this match will take a little time , but like all hard projects it starts with asking advice .
One way to start is by finding out which faculty members have supervised undergraduate research in the past .
Teaching assistants are often a good source for this sort of information ( and much other information as well , though you should realize that TA's , like everyone else , see the world from a particular angle and often have differing opinions ) .
You can also start with someone whose course you liked and did well in .
This approach has the advantage that the professor in question already knows you .
Show up in that person 's office hours and say , " I 'd like to ask your advice .
I liked your course on such - and - such and I 'm thinking I might want to go to graduate school in that area .
In particular I 'd like to see if I can get involved in a research project in the area starting maybe next term .
But I have n't got a precise idea of how to go about it , or about how to define a good project .
What do you think I should do ? "
Maybe they 'll just send you to someone else , or maybe they wo n't .
The ensuing conversation will be complicated but probably less painful than you think .
Keep in mind that it is basically a negotiation .
It is your first chance to practice a skill that you will need for the rest of your career as a scholar : formulating and reformulating your research interests in language that particular people can understand .
Listen to their language .
What do they think a research topic is like ?
How do they think a research project should be conducted ?
Do they see research as an individual activity or as a collective one ?
How enthusiastic do they really seem about the idea of supervising undergraduate research ?
Are you comfortable with the answers to these questions ?
No need to make a quick decision , though .
Most likely your conversation will be inconclusive .
That 's normal .
Sleep on it .
Ask for research papers to read and then read them -- and then ask yourself if you want to learn to write papers like that .
Have the same sort of conversation with other professors ( do n't forget other departments and even other universities in the same geographic area ) .
Then compare and contrast the results .
Undergraduate research projects can take a wide variety of forms .
Sometimes a professor will have a large research project that involves dozens of people .
Such projects frequently have niches for undergraduates .
This can be the best kind of undergraduate research experience because it will give you the opportunity to work with a group , observe the whole process of research , and feel like you 're contributing to something .
But maybe nobody has project of that type in your area .
Another possibility is simply to set up a project of your own , with regular meetings with a professor to discuss its progress .
Projects like this work best if you have a good relationship with the professor and a strong feeling for the topic .
Try to get to know other people with interests in that area , both because it 's interesting and to keep from getting isolated or dependent on a particular professor .
Your project will make a good conversation topic .
Yet another possibility is to become a professor 's assistant on some project .
This might involve anything : library work , data collection , putting together complex research papers , etc .
The work might be tedious ( or it might not ) , but it can be a good way to learn about research through apprenticeship .
All such deals are unique and should be weighed on their particular merits ( e.g. , whether you feel that you can work for this person ) , but you should always give them serious consideration because they do n't happen every day .
And the world is full of other possibilities .
Maybe you will become involved with an off - campus project of some sort -- a company , a community group , an alternative media project -- that you can integrate with a university research project .
Maybe you can get a summer job in a research group .
Maybe you will have an outside job that you want to use as a site for field research .
Who knows .
Few research opportunities are advertised ( though many universities have offices that find undergraduates for research projects ) , so you 'll have to ask around .
Most likely you 'll have to make the opportunity yourself by exploring options with various professors .
Once you have defined a project and found a supervisor , go ahead and figure out the paperwork .
Maybe you 'll arrange for independent study credit .
Maybe you 'll sign up for some official program in the university .
Maybe you 'll even get a research grant .
( If you need some money for your research , perhaps to take a trip or operate a photocopier , ask .
It may exist .
Writing a grant proposal may be the single most valuable experience of your project .
And if you 're being paid for your involvement in the project , make sure you get a clear understanding of your responsibilities to avoid misunderstandings later . )
Just keep in mind that professional relationships are the real substance of research .
Administrative details are secondary .
Maybe you wo n't even formalize the arrangement at all .
The important things , after all , are the experience you 'll get , the relationships you 'll develop , and the research paper that you can include in graduate school applications .
In particular , it is not crucial how well your research project turns out .
It will be okay in any event ; and everyone understands that research is hard and that undergraduate projects regularly fail to work out completely for reasons that are not your fault .
( The main pitfall for undergraduates and graduate students alike is attempting a project that 's too big .
Keep asking wise people to help you narrow your project . )
If your project works out well enough to produce a publishable paper , go for it .
But it 's not necessary .
APPLYING TO GRADUATE SCHOOL
If you have been getting advice and doing research then you will have figured out where the good graduate programs for your interests are .
You might even have an idea of which professors you want to study with .
( If you liked someone 's book , maybe you should become that person 's student .
It 's worth a try .
Ask for good books to read with this in mind , and get advice about the potential advisability of writing this person a letter . )
Apply to as many good graduate programs in your area as you can .
When in doubt , apply .
You can always turn down offers you do n't want later on .
Applications for graduate school , at least in the United States , are typically due in December or January .
You should start writing away for the application forms in September -- that is , September of your senior year , unless you are planning to take a year off .
I want to make a special point of this because it is common to forget about next year until the spring , when it is too late .
Getting the application forms is easy .
Write a letter to " Graduate Program / Department of Whatever / University of Whatever / City , State , ZIP " ( you can get the addresses from the Web or from reference books ; ask at the library reference desk ) and say " I am interested in applying to graduate school in your department .
Please send me some detailed information on the department , the necessary application forms , and information about financial aid .
Thank you very much . "
( Some departments may have Web - only application procedures , so look for these on the Web before you write away for the forms . )
You should expect to apply to five or six schools and maybe more , depending on the level of competition in your area .
Filling out the application forms is tedious , but it will get easier once you 've done a couple .
The most important part of the application form will be a blank page headed something like " Statement of Purpose " .
On this page you will be asked to explain why you want to go to graduate school , including some idea about what sort of research you would like to conduct .
You need to take this seriously .
Write about a page and a half on the subject , single - spaced , and take it to the professors you 've been getting advice from .
They will almost certainly tell you to rewrite it , and you should definitely do so .
Do n't be surprised if it takes three or four tries to get it right .
If they just make a few suggestions around the edges , ask them specifically what the best approach would be in rewriting it from scratch .
Your statement should demonstrate that you know what research is , that you have had at least one idea in your life , and that you have an interesting and tractable idea about your research for the future .
The problem , of course , is that you probably have only the sketchiest idea of what your research in graduate school will be about .
That does n't matter .
You are not promising to do the research you describe in your statement ( although I am told that this is changing in some areas of the hard sciences ) ; you are only spelling out a single plausible scenario , one that fairly reflects your interests .
Try to be concrete , but also include a few hedges such as " perhaps " and " these possibilities include " .
Good writing counts .
Project sobriety and maturity .
Avoid frivolity , boasting , and self - deprecation .
Show that you 've read the research literature , but go easy on academic jargon .
Minimize adverbs .
Eschew the words " interesting " and " important " , which say little .
Many people start their statements with a paragraph or two of commonplaces ; cut this material until you reach a statement that says something non-obvious about the world and your research involvements .
Do n't talk about your family , your feelings , or your non-professional interests .
Do n't say anything bad about anyone , including yourself .
And make sure that you are not simply describing the year 's most fashionable cliche of a research project -- ask for advice about this issue specifically .
Put yourself in the shoes of the graduate admissions committee : they 're looking at hundreds of applications and they 're only going to take a second look at the ones that stand out .
If you follow the above advice then your application will make the first cut and receive the serious consideration it deserves .
It is also a good idea , if you have the energy , to tailor your statement to fit the particular departments you 're applying to .
You might write a generic statement and then edit in some passages that fit each department , for example mentioning one of the professors there whose work is relevant to your interests , just to show that you know what you 're doing .
If you have your heart set on a particular department ( say because you want to work with a particular professor whose work you admire ) then write a customized statement for that department .
Find people who are well acquainted with that department and ask their guidance .
In short , show the admissions committee that you 've done your homework .
It makes a difference .
Make sure your graduate application includes the research papers you wrote as an undergraduate , and be sure that your statement explains the connection between these papers and the graduate research you are envisioning .
Meanwhile , apply for fellowships , that is , grants from foundations and other sources that pay your tuition and a small salary so that you can commit yourself full - time to studying .
Do n't wait until you 're accepted somewhere to apply for outside funding !
Deadlines typically fall between November and January in the United States and a few months later in many other countries .
Ask someone in your department which are the major fellowships in your area and apply for them all .
Also , at each university it is usually somebody 's job to keep a list , maybe on the Web , of obscure graduate fellowships .
It might be called the office of research development .
You might also look in the acknowledgements sections of papers written by younger researchers in your field .
Find such lists and write away for applications forms for all of the fellowships that seem relevant .
Get advice about which ones are worth applying for .
When in doubt , apply .
Fellowships are good because they give you much more freedom to choose your own research topics .
Without a fellowship , you will have to work for someone else as a teaching assistant or research assistant .
Assistantships are often perfectly fine , but a fellowship is always better .
About grade point averages .
Many people worry that their GPA will prevent them from getting into graduate school .
Good grades are important , but they can be measured in different ways .
For example , you might recompute your GPA without your freshman classes ( many universities do this routinely ) , or your GPA for upper - division courses only , or only for courses in your major .
If any of these numbers is significantly more impressive than your official GPA , you should mention it somewhere in your application .
About exams .
Certain exams ( eg. GRE , GMAT etc. ) are necessary for many graduate programs , and you often need to apply to take these over a year before you apply , particularly if you do n't want to take a general and a subject GRE on the same day .
You can get details of what exams are needed from the course catalog or brochure from the graduate programs you might be interested in ; this is one more reason to get the brochure well ahead of time , whether you 're serious yet about applying or not .
You are probably appalled at how many applications you are filling out .
Rest assured , though , that filling out applications is a major part of a career in research .
Look on the bright side : applying for things is an opportunity to assess your career and to articulate it in the best and most sincere light for other people .
You will be doing a great deal of this in the future .
LETTERS OF RECOMMENDATION
Your application to graduate school will also involve some letters of recommendation , usually three or four .
Most of these letters will probably ( but not necessarily ) be from professors in the department where you got your undergraduate degree .
It helps , other things being equal , if you get letters from famous professors as opposed to junior ones .
But the important thing is to get letters from people who know you and who can say things about you that make you sound like you belong in graduate school .
But there 's a problem .
Most letters that professors write for undergraduates are not very impressive because most professors do not know the undergraduates in their department very well .
If you want good letters then you need to do something about this .
The best thing is to get involved in research , as I 've described above .
The person who supervises your research will then be able to write you a helpful letter that does n't sound like a computer wrote it .
The other way to get good letters of recommendation is to get to know the professors who teach the classes that you particularly like .
This is a remarkably difficult matter .
Doing really good work in the class definitely helps , but this in itself need n't entail any actual acquaintance with the professor who taught it .
So how do you do this ?
The wrong way to go about it is to show up in the professor 's office to chat randomly , hoping that you 'll make a good impression along the way .
This strategy almost always makes a dreadful impression , for the simple reason that professors are busy people who hate it when you waste their time .
Think about it like this .
Your relationship with a professor will be defined by a set of ideas -- the ideas that the professor is trying to teach in the classes you 're taking .
Either you find those ideas compelling and interesting or you do n't .
If you do n't get a genuine thrill out of the ideas then you 're better off investing your energies elsewhere in the first place .
But if you actually do find the ideas interesting then you are going to have questions about them -- questions that go beyond the course .
Maybe your term papers will address those questions .
Or whatever .
In any event , do n't keep your questions a secret .
Go ask them .
There 's no need for flattery or hints or hidden agendas .
Simply ask the questions because you want to know the answers .
Only a jerk considers it a waste of time to answer genuine questions .
Letters of recommendation will take care of themselves when the time comes .
GETTING ACCEPTED TO GRADUATE SCHOOL
In March or April you will start getting letters of acceptance or rejection from graduate schools .
When you are accepted , the main thing you want to know is how much money they are offering you .
Graduate school is expensive and you want to avoid paying the fees yourself .
The most common arrangement is for you to be offered a teaching assistantship ( TA ) , a nominally half - time teaching job , or a research assistantship ( RA ) , which may involve prescribed work for some professor or may simply be support for your own work .
A better arrangement , though , is to get a fellowship .
Maybe you will win a fellowship through your own efforts .
Another possibility is that the department that accepts you can provide its own fellowship money .
Whatever you do , do n't accept the department 's offer right away .
Reply to the offer with a polite acknowledgement and then stall them for a couple of weeks while you wait for other acceptances to arrive .
Meanwhile , think much more seriously about the offer .
Do you really want to move to that city ?
What is that university really like ?
What is that department really like ?
The important thing here is that you are about to be treated with more respect than you might be accustomed to .
Take advantage of this by getting more advice .
The faculty in your department will celebrate your acceptance to graduate school , and they will probably be happy to help you decide what to do .
Ask them about reputations and rumors .
Ask them if anybody else in town graduated from that same department or a closely related department at the same school .
Find out if the people in that department care about their graduate students ; some do n't .
Make lists of questions and then call the department on the phone and ask them .
Try to get a course catalog ( but be sure to ask whether it corresponds to reality ; many do n't ) .
If you can visit the department , do so .
Sometimes you can even get the department ( or even your own ) to pay for a trip .
The department will be waiting anxiously for your decision ; if you turn them down they will offer your space to someone else who seems promising .
They may even try to pressure you into making a decision .
If this happens , get more advice .
If you can talk to the department 's existing graduate students , go right ahead ; graduate students do n't always have all the facts , but they usually have blunt opinions .
Unless the department has offered you a good fellowship , one of your main goals will be to extract more money from them .
Sound reasonable about this .
Plead poverty .
Explain that you find the offer exciting but that you still need to eat .
If you have kids to feed , tell them that .
If you have a good offer from another school , tell them that too ( but do n't tell them the details of that offer or make it sound like you 're just after the money ; just say that the other offer , taken as a whole , is attractive and more financially feasible ) .
Your basic stance is that you simply need enough money to do your graduate work without having to take outside jobs , at least for the first few years .
Often some additional money will materialize as other people turn down offers from the same place .
After a couple of weeks , though , you will have to decide .
Send a brief message to the winning school accepting its offer , wait for acknowledgement , and inform the losing schools of your decision with a brief message such as , " After long thought , I have decided to attend graduate school at Podunk U. I appreciate your interest in my career , though , and I hope we can keep in touch .
Thanks very much . "
Congratulations and good luck .
MORE NOTES , MAY 2001
Many people have written me about " Advice for Undergraduates " , and their comments and questions have made clear that I ought to throw it out and write it again .
I do n't have time for that , but perhaps these additional notes will be useful .
First , I need to re-emphasize that " Advice for Undergraduates " is written solely for people who are thinking of applying to PhD programs .
I do not know much about master 's and professional programs , and I do not have any advice to offer people who are thinking about applying to them .
Throughout this article , both above and below , the phrase " graduate school " refers strictly to PhD programs , which are training in research .
Now some more substantive comments .
Most people who apply to graduate school understand the process by analogy to applying to undergraduate programs .
On the surface the two processes are similar : they both involve paperwork , written statements , course transcripts , recommendation letters , and so on .
Underneath , however , the processes could not be more different .
Undergraduate admissions is handled entirely by professional admissions officers who evaluate large numbers of applications covering every field .
Graduate admissions , by contrast , is handled by each department separately .
You might send your application to a bureaucratic office , but that office exists only to assemble a file on each applicant .
The applications are evaluated by a committee of faculty .
This means that your application will be read by people who have a deep knowledge of the field that you want to study .
If you have knowledge of the field yourself , then you would be well - advised to tell them about it .
Do n't show off or pretend to knowledge that you do n't really have , but do address your materials to the people who will become your professional peers once you finally get your PhD degree .
Having your application evaluated by the faculty is also advantageous because superficial bureaucratic criteria are less important .
It is in the faculty 's interest to admit students who are likely to do well , and any faculty worth your time will consider whatever evidence of aptitude for research you can give them .
The admissions process on the graduate level is therefore more human , with all of the positive and negative consequences that that implies .
I originally wrote " Advice for Undergraduates " in 1996 , before the Web became an important factor in most academic fields .
If I were to write it over again today , I would put the Web in the middle of the picture .
The most important intuition , already hinted at in the previous paragraph , is that a PhD program , unlike most undergraduate programs , is about relationships with particular individuals .
Therefore , I recommend the following rather aggressive - sounding procedure .
Hit the library and identify a half - dozen professors in your intended field whose work you admire and identify with .
You might be able to get these people 's names from the professors that you talk to at your own school , but there is no substitute for the library .
So take the time to read the books and journals that are relevant to your field .
Once you have several names in hand , hit the Web .
Look up those professors ' home pages , which will hopefully provide you with a more complete map of their research interests and publications .
Inform yourself more deeply about each individual 's work .
If you 're still interested in exploring a relationship with them , proceed to their departments ' home pages .
Look at the other faculty in the department , and see if you can identify three or four other faculty whose research topics are at least in the basic ballpark of your own .
It 's dangerous to rely on one single individual .
Having done all this , you will have narrowed down your list of candidate departments .
You are now in a position to establish contact with each of the professors who you are still strongly interested in .
Send each one a customized e-mail message , no more than a few hundred words in length .
This message should do four things : ( 1 ) demonstrate knowledge of their research , ( 2 ) explain that you are looking for the right PhD program , ( 3 ) explain the general research area you are interested in working in , and ( 4 ) ask them whether they are taking on new students .
Do n't make it sound like you 're asking for a commitment at this point , just a conversation to determine whether you should apply .
If you happen to be in the same geographic region , or if you can travel , ask if you can stop by .
Never ask the professor or the department about financial aid until the department has accepted you to its program .
( You should apply for fellowships on your own initiative at the same time that you apply to the departments , but you should also recognize that most departments at serious research universities have a lot of financial aid for their students , especially in their first couple of years . )
And do n't get hung up on the administrative details of the application process .
Right now , the important thing is to establish an intellectual relationship .
In the sciences and engineering , it is important to have a specific idea of your intended research topic , even though it will surely evolve later on , and you should work out a clear understanding of your topic with the professors at your home institution first .
Other fields allow for more exploration , for the simple reason that less money is at stake .
If you get no response from the professor , then that tells you something right there .
It might mean that the professor gets lots of spam - like messages from prospective students who have n't done any real homework , but it might also mean that the professor 's department deals with students in a relatively impersonal way , so that the time for advising discussions is after you 've been accepted and passed all the classes .
The professor might say " no " , either because their lab is already full or for lack of an intellectual match .
The professor wo n't say " yes " , because that 's the admissions committee 's job .
But if it turns out that the two of you have something to talk about , then definitely apply to the department .
Briefly mention your correspondence with the professor in your application letter .
Many people have asked me how to proceed if they have been out of school for several years .
The basic answer is given in the last few paragraphs .
It is not crucial to have been involved in research as an undergraduate , and you should only try to get letters from your undergraduate professors if there is a good chance that they will remember you .
( Keep in mind , however , that if you did good work in their class , then a copy of your work is likely to refresh their memory .
If you did n't do good work in their class then forget them . )
Treat the process as a rational conversation among adults -- if it 's not then walk away .
You 're basically looking for a job in a different industry , and you should do your homework and build networks accordingly .
If you can attend the major annual conference in your intended field then gathering intelligence and talking to people there would be ideal .
As I say , the faculty simply need evidence that you are likely to succeed in their program , and the ones you want to work with will be open to any kind of evidence that convinces them .
If you do n't have letters from faculty whose reputations they know , and if you have n't been involved in research , then they are going to need other kinds of evidence .
You might think about , or even explore with them , ways that you can move stepwise back into graduate school .
Maybe you can get involved with the research on some other basis first .
Maybe you can write something on your own .
Maybe you can get into a master 's program first , and use the faculty that become available to explore the transition to a PhD program .
( Many PhD programs include a master 's degree as a halfway point , but most programs will not recognize a terminal master 's degree as a substitute for this halfway master 's .
The reason is that the first couple of years of a PhD program , having been designed as socialization into a research discipline , are very different from a terminal master 's program in both content and style .
So if you get a terminal master 's then it will probably not shorten the amount of time it takes to get a PhD. )
Another common question is how heavily the admissions committee for graduate school will weigh your undergraduate school .
Is it better to attend a good school and risk getting a low GPA , or to attend a not - so - good school and get a better GPA ?
The answer , if you 're really talking about getting into a PhD program worth attending , is that you should attend a good school and get a good GPA .
The admissions committee for the PhD program is trying to decide which students will be good at research , and they are making this decision based on the limited information available to them in the applications .
They know that a good GPA from a not - so - good undergraduate program is not a very meaningful predictor of graduate school success .
When you apply for graduate school , you will be competing against people who went to good schools , got good grades , and wrote papers that were in the general ballpark of being publishable .
So if you have a choice , go to a good school and get involved in research .
If you 've already been to undergraduate school and your school was n't so great , go ahead and apply anyway , making sure to enclose your best undergraduate papers .
If you are uncertain whether a particular school is considered " good " , then it 's time to ask the advice of people who are engaged in research in your chosen field .
Foreigners have asked me how they should apply to American PhD programs .
Foreign students often assume that they lack " inside information " that American students enjoy , and they sometimes respond by trying to divine this information from statistics about what kinds of test scores got someone into one school or another .
I 'd like to suggest a different approach .
First of all , you should not assume that American students are insiders who have secret knowledge that you lack .
The great majority of American students just take their classes and follow the rules without becoming part of the research institutions around them .
I hope to change this by encouraging more undergraduates to become more involved in research , but undergraduate involvement in research is not yet the norm .
The central point is that a PhD program allows you to integrate yourself into the research community , and you are more likely to be accepted into a PhD program if you have already begun the process .
The research community is global , so if you are attending a research university then the starting place is with your professors .
If you are not attending a university that is part of the global research community , or if your professors cannot help you , then you need a research library .
A research library is a library that has a large collection of current research literature -- books and journals -- in your field .
In most scientific and technical fields this means a large collection in English ; in the humanities a large collection in a major world language will suffice .
You need to spend a month , full - time , in a research library .
Read extensively in the literature of your field .
Determine which research topics you find most interesting , and then judge which research groups are doing the best work .
Take extensive notes .
Then base your application letter on what you 've read in the journals .
Demonstrate that you are familiar with the literature and that you understand the concepts by using the vocabulary of the literature to explain very clearly what topics you want to conduct research on .
If you do not have a research library near your home you will need to travel .
Talk to the librarians at your university , and figure out which library in your region is best - suited to your needs .
Then find out if you can get permission to use the library .
It is usually easier to get into the library of a public university than a private university , and libraries in English - speaking countries tend to be more liberal , as a broad generalization , than libraries in other countries .
In extreme cases you might even have to fly to a country such as Australia and sleep on the floor somewhere .
It 's difficult and expensive , I understand , but it will dramatically increase your chances of being accepted to a PhD program .
A final comment .
Many people have written me with questions about their own particular situation .
I am happy to help if I can , but please understand that many questions depend on the policies of particular schools or the customs of particular fields , and in these areas I am afraid I can't help .
I know about the intellectual and relationship aspects of getting accepted to graduate school , but I refuse to know anything about the more bureaucratic aspects .
Each school makes its own decisions about what examinations to require , how to establish English - language proficiency for foreign students , how to set fees , where to obtain application forms and where to send them , whether students are allowed to attend school part - time , what kinds of grades and test scores they require , and so on .
For answers to these types of questions , you should consult the individual department 's Web site .
Likewise , I do have not have any kind of directory of graduate programs or fellowship opportunities , even in my own field .
I do not even know if such directories exist .
It does n't matter , in my opinion , since I believe that you should select a graduate program using the kinds of social networking and library homework that I described above .
Nor , unfortunately , do I have any way of evaluating how strong a candidate for graduate school you might be .
So , bottom line , if you have questions about intellectual and relationship aspects of getting into graduate school that I have not addressed above , you are most welcome to write .
Otherwise please talk to the experts in your own field .
