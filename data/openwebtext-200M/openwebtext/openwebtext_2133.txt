President Bush exempted the Navy from an environmental law so it can continue using sonar in its anti-submarine warfare training off the California coast — a practice critics say is harmful to whales and other marine mammals .
The White House announced Wednesday that Bush had signed the exemption Tuesday while traveling in the Middle East .
The Navy training exercises , including the use of sonar , “ are in the paramount interest of the United States ” and its national security , Bush said in a memorandum .
( Original Article )
Immediately after 9/11 , Colin Powell said the terrorists were clearly engaged in a war on civilization itself .
Soon after , as secretary of state , he prophetically warned the president — and the lawyers drafting and justifying “ torture memos ” in the Justice Department — that this country ’s rejecting the Geneva Conventions and our own laws on the treatment of terrorism - related prisoners would “ undermine public support among critical allies , making military cooperation more difficult to sustain . ”
Increasingly , as Powell predicted , while the president strongly insists that the CIA be allowed to continue practicing what Bush calls “ its specialized interrogations ” in its secret prisons , and “ renditions ” ( kidnapping Europeans to be tortured elsewhere ) , we have lost the trust and respect of many our allies ’ citizens .
Significant , moreover , is the refusal of FBI Director Robert Mueller to permit his agents to engage in such “ coercive ” CIA - style interrogations that often involve torture .
Also opposing the tortured use of language by high officials of the administration to disguise this lawless treatment of prisoners , which would make any such “ evidence ” thrown out of our federal courts , are Gen. David Petraeus and Lt. Gen. Michael Maples , director of the Defense Intelligence Agency .
Nonetheless , on March 8 , George W. Bush vetoed a bill that includes a mandate that there be a single standard of interrogation by all our forces — very intentionally including the CIA .
As a result of Bush ’s veto , the United States , by validating torture as a tool of interrogation , has become a less civilized nation .
The bill the president disdained ( thereby staining his legacy ) would have made the Army Field Manual the standard of all interrogations .
Among the practices it prohibits are : placing hoods or sacks over prisoners ’ heads ( as in CIA “ renditions ” ) ; exposing them to extreme heat or cold ( as often reported ) ; and waterboarding ( as disclosed about CIA prisoners at “ black sites ” ) , a procedure that makes the prisoner believe he is about to drown — and he will drown if it ’s not stopped .
The CIA has finally admitted it has used waterboarding , and though it claims it no longer does , the White House says that this “ specialized interrogation ” remains potentially permissible in future interrogations .
John McCain has called waterboarding an “ exquisitely ” painful torture , but he voted against making the Army Field Manual the standard for interrogations , thereby giving cover to some of the members of Congress who joined him to support the president .
Why criticize them when the Republican presidential nominee has been the icon of those , in and out of our military , who oppose torture ?
This human rights status for McCain has now been tarnished badly .
In contrast to McCain ’s current stance , there has been continuing strong support of including the Army Field Manual in the CIA techniques by 31 retired Army , Navy and Marine Corps generals who insist — as Human Rights First reports — that “ the United States not sanction the use of interrogation methods it would find unacceptable if inflicted by the enemy against captured Americans . ”
Documented reports of CIA interrogation methods by human rights organizations , and by both American and overseas reporters , include accounts of barbarous assaults on prisoners that , if practiced on American captives in other countries , would enrage us to demand swift and harsh punishment of the perpetrators .
It has long been evident that the Bush administration , in addition to giving the CIA extra-legal powers , deliberately incarcerated terrorism suspects at Guantanamo Bay in its belief that the American rule of law would not apply there , any more than in the CIA secret prisons or the torture cells in countries where CIA captives are sent in “ renditions . ”
Currently , as an index of how the CIA has shamed us among our allies , CBS News and the Associated Press reported ( March 8 ) that according to Newsweek :
“ The Canadian government is refusing to use testimony from alleged Al Qaeda leader Abu Zubaydah ( now at Guantanamo Bay ) in its prosecution of two terror suspects , because the testimony was acquired during CIA interrogations in which Zubaydah was waterboarded . ”
The CIA destroyed videotapes of that “ specialized ” questioning to hide it from our laws .
Human Rights
Watch ’s senior terrorism counsel Jennifer Daskal predicts that Bush “ will go down in history as the torture president ” for his continuing protection of CIA “ specialized ” procedures .
Congressman William Delahunt , D - Mass. , adds : “ History is going to judge us all ” — including the next president if he or she continues to debase our values as we fight the terrorists .
If the president is so convinced he ’s right , why does n’t he demand that Petraeus order his troops in Iraq to discard the Army Field Manual , which the general insists they not stray from as their standard .
He strongly rejects the use of torture .

EBay owns a small part of Craigslist
The online auction giant eBay is suing the popular internet community ad site Craigslist to " safeguard its four - year financial investment " .
In a statement , eBay claimed that in January , Craigslist executives took actions that " unfairly diluted eBay 's economic interest by more than 10 % " .
No details of those actions were given by eBay .
In its company blog , Craigslist said it was surprised and disappointed by eBay 's " unfounded allegations " .
The company said eBay 's legal action " came to us out of the blue " .
We have always treated eBay fairly as a minority shareholder , and plan to continue doing so
Craigslist
Craigslist 's silent emergence
The case , which is sealed , has been filed in a court in Delaware , where Craigslist is registered .
In a press statement , eBay claims that Craigslist 's founder Craig Newmark and its chief executive Jim Buckmaster adopted unspecified measures in January that have disadvantaged eBay and its investment .
Preserve our investment EBay 's general counsel Mike Jacobson said : " Since negotiating our investment with Craigslist 's board in 2004 , we have acted openly and in good faith as a minority shareholder , so we were surprised by these recent unilateral actions .
He continues : " We are asking the Delaware court to rescind these recent actions in order to protect eBay 's stockholders and preserve our investment . "
Craigslist , the seventh most popular English - language page on the Web , hit back in a blog .
" We have always treated eBay fairly as a minority shareholder , and plan to continue doing so , despite this unfortunate development , " it said .
" EBay has absolutely no reason to feel threatened - unless a hostile takeover of Craigslist , or the sale of eBay 's stake in Craigslist to an unfriendly party , is their ultimate goal . "
Uneasy relationship
The relationship between Craigslist and eBay has not always been an easy one .
Online auction site eBay acquired a 28.4 % stake when it bought shares from a former employee who had been given equity by Mr Newmark .
Mr Newmark and Mr Buckmaster give away for free most of the services that Craigslist provides .
They have always appeared to have little ambition to milk profits from the popular site , which offers everything from houses for rental to nannies for hire .
A year after the deal was completed , eBay , which had said it wanted to learn from Craigslist , started Kijiji.com , a rival international network of classified ad sites that now sells ads in all 50 US states .

Last - minute changes to Windows Vista broke drivers , forcing key hardware vendors to " limp out with issues " when the OS launched last year , according to a presentation by Dell Corp .
that was made public this week .
" Late OS code changes broke drivers and applications , forcing key commodities to miss launch or limp out with issues , " said one slide in a Dell presentation dated March 25 , 2007 , about two months after Vista 's launch at retail and availability on new PCs .
The criticism was just one of many under the heading " What did not go well ? "
Others ranged from knocks against Vista 's Windows Anytime Upgrade scheme , an in - place upgrade option , to several slams on " Windows Vista Capable , " the marketing program that targeted PC buyers shopping for machines in the months leading up to Vista 's debut .
Dell 's postmortem , in fact , was one of several after - launch appraisals included in the 158 pages of e-mails and other documents unsealed Wednesday in a class - action lawsuit over Vista Capable .
" Stronger messaging regarding hardware requirements ( the bar was set too low when Aero was dropped as a requirement for Vista Capable ) , " Dell 's presentation noted in another slide .
That response would n't have come as a surprise to Microsoft .
Dell had voiced its dissatisfaction with Microsoft 's marketing plans a year and a half earlier .
In August 2005 , Gretchen Miller , Dell 's director of mobile marketing responsible for the Texas company 's laptop marketing gave feedback to Microsoft on its Vista programs .
" [ The dual logo ] adds another level of complexity to an already complex story , which in turn will create confusion for our customers , both corporate and consumer , " said Miller in an e-mail .
Although Dell advised Microsoft to scale back the logos , the software developer eventually went ahead with its plans for two stickers , once that announced a PC was " Vista Capable , " the other advertising that the system was " Vista Premium Ready . "
Dell also used the March 2007 presentation to call out other things it thought Microsoft got wrong in the push for Vista .
" Windows Automatic Update was not what was advertised and has lead to a number of poor customer experiences , " Dell charged .
" Upgrade program needs a complete overhaul . "
Microsoft 's response to Dell 's criticisms was not included in the documents revealed by U.S. District Court Judge Marsha Pechman this week .
A Microsoft OEM account manager who passed the Dell presentation to others at her company , however , said that she had told Dell that Microsoft would " have a more detailed postmortem discussion around capable and upgrade in the May [ 2007 ] timeframe . "
Microsoft only just tweaked Windows Anytime Upgrade this month .
As of Feb. 20 , Microsoft started mailing DVDs equipped with a product activation code , rather than e-mailing the key and expecting the user to dig out the original Vista installation DVD .
Company managers and executives also did their own postmortems on Vista , the unsealed e-mails revealed .
One that presumably carried more weight than others was written by Steven Sinofsky , chief of Windows development .
In an e-mail to CEO Steve Ballmer written less than three weeks after he took over the post , Sinofsky spelled out his three reasons why Vista stumbled out the gate .
" No one really believed we would ever ship so they did n't start the work until very late in 2006 , " Sinofsky said .
" This led to the lack of availability [ of device drivers ] . "
Next on his list : Changes to the operating systems ' video and audio infrastructure .
" Massive changes in the underpinnings for video and audio really led to a poor experience at RTM , " he said .
" This change led to incompatibilities .
For example , you do n't get Aero with an XP driver , but your card might not ( ever ) have a Vista driver . "
Finally , said Sinofsky , other changes in Vista blocked Windows XP drivers altogether .
" This is across the board for printers , scanners , WAN , accessories and so on .
Many of the associated applets do n't run within the constraints of the security model or the new video / audio driver models . "
According to the e-mails made public this week , Microsoft will apply the lessons it learned with Vista the next time around .
" There is really nothing we can do in the short term , " noted Joan Kalkman , the general manager of OEM and embedded worldwide marketing , in a message written a week after Sinofsky's .
" In the long term we have worked hard to establish and have committed to an OEM Theme for Win [ dows ] 7 planning .
" This was rejected for Vista .
Having this theme puts accountability and early thinking on programs like Capable / Ready so that we make the right decisions early on . "

I have no idea why they did n't go with a mushroom cloud at the end .
A sequel in the works , perhaps ?
It 's a good thing they did n't shoot for the " based on a true story " intro , because the part about it really being the fault of the Republicans refusing to negotiate on their insistence on covering up Bush 's crimes by protecting the telecoms who enabled him -
That would have really detracted from that whole ' terror / panic / Democrats - fault ' theme .
All the GOP has left is the fear card , and that sucker is wore slam out .
Bush 's trusty Supreme Court has already seen fit to throw up a firewall for the telecoms , so why is it the Republicans are still insisting on holding up the FISA bill ?
It 's because the Republican Party will do anything they can to keep whatever secrets are hidden in those NSA spy rooms from ever incriminating their President , even if it does mean putting our country at more risk to do so .
That 's why .

Editor 's Note :
In our Behind the Scenes series , CNN correspondents share their experiences in covering news and analyze the stories behind the events .
CNN 's Senior Vatican Analyst John L. Allen Jr. is following the pope during his U.S. trip .
Pope Benedict XVI asked pilgrims in St. Peter 's Square on Sunday to pray for the success of his U.S. trip .
NEW YORK ( CNN ) --
The official motto of Pope Benedict XVI 's April 15 - 20 visit to the United States , the first of his papacy , is " Christ our Hope . "
Based on the frequency with which papal spokespersons have struck a different note , however , its unofficial motto might well be , " This is not a political event . "
Here 's a typical example from early April : " The pope is not coming to get mixed up in the local political process , " said Italian Archbishop Pietro Sambi , the pope 's ambassador to America , in an interview with the National Catholic Reporter .
" His presence is about something more universal and , at the same time , more personal . "
Fear that Benedict 's visit might be read through the lens of party politics reflects a key fact of electoral life in America :
The " Catholic vote " matters .
To take the most obvious example , if a few heavily Catholic counties in Ohio had gone the other way in 2004 , pundits would today be handicapping the re-election of President John Kerry .
America 's almost 70 million Catholics , representing a quarter of the country 's population , are diverse and divided .
They do n't all agree with official church positions , and although Catholics were once reliable Democrats , today they 're not clearly aligned with either party .
That 's a key reason why states with large Catholic populations , such as Ohio , Pennsylvania , Wisconsin and Florida , are considered crucial battlegrounds .
Already in the 2008 race , Catholics have made themselves felt .
On the Democratic side , they 're the biggest single reason Sen. Hillary Clinton is still afloat .
So far , the more Catholic a state , the better Clinton has done .
With her back to the wall not long ago in Ohio and Texas , Clinton decisively outpolled Sen. Barack Obama among Catholic Democrats .
In Ohio , Clinton won the Catholic vote by a margin of 63 percent to 36 , while in Texas it was 62 percent to 38 .
Clinton is now hoping that Catholics will come through for her again in Pennsylvania 's April 22 primary .
The state 's 3.87 million Catholics represent more than 30 percent of the population , and Clinton is clinging to a lead despite Pennsylvania Sen.
Robert Casey 's endorsement of Obama .
Casey is a hero to pro-life Catholic Democrats , and his backing is apparently helping Obama narrow the gap .
Clinton does better than Obama among Latinos , who are disproportionately Catholic .
She 's also winning Catholic " Reagan Democrats , " meaning socially conservative blue - collar voters .
Obama 's recent gaffe , telling a crowd in San Francisco , California , that small - town Americans were " clinging to guns or religion " out of economic frustration , may help cement that advantage .
Once the Democrats settle on a candidate , the Catholic vote seems wide open in November .
Sen .
John McCain , the presumptive Republican nominee , appeals to many Catholics because he 's pro-life and has a moderate stance on immigration .
Yet his willingness to remain in Iraq for " 100 years " is at odds with the church 's opposition to the war .
Either Clinton or Obama could make a strong appeal to Catholics on peace - and - justice issues , yet both are out of sync with Catholic teaching on issues such as abortion , stem - cell research and gay rights .
Both sides are expected to court Catholics aggressively .
The McCain campaign recently formed a " National Catholics for McCain Committee " led by former Kansas Sen. Sam Brownback and former Oklahoma Gov. Frank Keating , along with a " who 's who " of prominent Catholic conservatives .
Obama has his own " National Catholic Advisory Council , " led by Casey and former Indiana Rep .
Tim Roemer , both pro-life Democrats .
Clinton likewise has top - drawer Catholic advisers .
Pope Benedict 's trip is unlikely to offer a decisive boost to either side .
He 'll probably strike pro-life notes that Republicans can exploit , but he 'll also likely accent peace , concern for the poor and the environment , issues that generally skew to the Democrats .
Watch as CNN's Rosemary Church speaks with Vatican analyst John Allen about the pope 's visit »
Any political fallout may thus depend on what happens to the pope 's message once it 's swept up into the sausage grinder of American spin .
Benedict XVI usually speaks not in sound bites but in carefully crafted paragraphs , which sometimes leaves the door ajar for competing explanations of what he really means .
One can expect a " war for the microphone " among Republican and Democratic operatives , each looking to exploit pieces of the pope 's message .
In a tight race , movement of even a few percentage points among Catholics could be decisive .
One sign the Democrats understand what 's at stake is that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has arranged an April 16 conference call with reporters to comment on Benedict 's trip -- in effect , not wanting President Bush , and by extension the Republicans , to claim a monopoly on the pope .
All this makes the political implications of the pope 's presence difficult to anticipate .
The best advice boils down to that classic broadcast cliché : " Stay tuned ! " E-mail to a friend

McCain full of convictions and contradictions
John McCain has been called a " maverick " Republican for so long that most Americans started taking his independence for granted a long time ago .
His public persona as a straight - talking , pork - busting , politically centrist war hero - firmly established during his upstart 2000 presidential run against GOP front - runner George W. Bush - is one of the greatest assets for this year 's presumptive Republican nominee .
But a look back at McCain 's 25 - year political career in Arizona and on the national stage reveals a unique figure far more complicated than either his campaign 's marketing machine or hostile Democratic Party operatives will admit .
He has demonstrated a repeated willingness to buck fellow Republicans and stray from GOP orthodoxy since he first ran for Congress in 1982 .
He also has a record of heartily supporting Bush on some of his most controversial priorities , including the Iraq war and comprehensive immigration reform .
In 2007 , as he ramped up for his second White House run , McCain voted with Bush 95 percent of the time , according to Congressional Quarterly , which tallied votes McCain was present for on issues in which the administration took a position .
There is political value in maverickism .
Presidential candidates rarely present themselves as strict party people as they court middle - of - the - road voters during the general - election season .
And the notion of rugged individualism is still ingrained in the American psyche .
Still , a maverick is sometimes hard to define and , in politics , the free spirits are often the most inconsistent .
Over the years , McCain has given the opposition ammunition : The Democratic National Committee issues regular " McCain Myth Buster " news releases accusing McCain of " walking in lockstep with President Bush , pandering to the right wing of the Republican Party , and embracing the ideology he once denounced . "
McCain campaign insiders do n't seem worried .
" It 's a natural thing for the Democrats to go right at the McCain brand , his independence and reputation for doing what he thinks is right , regardless of his political interest or self - interest , " said Charlie Black , a senior McCain campaign adviser .
" That is a big part about what people know and like about him .
We 'll just keep reinforcing his record and who he is , and I doubt seriously they can put a dent in the brand . "
Is McCain a ' maverick ' ?
McCain has bucked the party line often enough to be able to lay claim to the " maverick " moniker , even if his overall record is more complex :
 In 2001 , he was one of only two Republicans to vote against Bush 's signature tax - relief program .
The other was then - Sen. Lincoln Chafee , R - R.I. , one of the Senate 's most unabashedly liberal GOP members .
But today , McCain supports making the tax cuts permanent because letting them lapse is tantamount to a tax increase .
 He is eager to work with Capitol Hill Democrats on topics such as immigration and climate change but has a history of clashing heatedly with Senate colleagues in both parties .
 He delivered in February 2000 a blistering critique of religious conservative leadership , which included blasting Jerry Falwell and Pat Robertson as " agents of intolerance . "
Yet in 2006 , he delivered the commencement address at Falwell 's Liberty University .
So is McCain truly a " maverick " ?
" It 's part of who he is , but that 's not him in his entirety , " said Dan Schnur , who was communications director for McCain 's 2000 presidential campaign but is not affiliated with his current bid .
" There are some parts of him that are very conventional , conservative Republican .
And there are other parts of him that are much more independent and iconoclastic . "
McCain recently quipped that he prefers the term " Great American " to the overworn " maverick " label .
But he also signaled that he does not intend to run as a typical partisan in the Nov. 4 general election .
" When you look at my great hero , ( progressive GOP President ) Theodore Roosevelt , I think many viewed him in those days as not a stereotype Republican , " McCain said .
" So I do n't know if you would call it a ' maverick , ' but I certainly have issues that I think can attract independents .
I think we can find the old Reagan Democrats and a lot of new Reagan Democrats so that we can unite the party and reach out and win an election in November . "
Asked to elaborate on that strategy , McCain said : " I think my positions on the issues are very well - known , and some of them , obviously , are not always in keeping with some members of my party , such as earmarking and pork - barrel spending . "
McCain has long fought the congressional practice of funneling money toward parochial projects in the home states or districts of influential lawmakers , saying it leads to waste and corruption .
The stand often has found him at odds with GOP colleagues .
Matt Welch is the editor in chief of the libertarian magazine Reason and the author of a critical look at the senator from Arizona titled McCain : The Myth of a Maverick .
The 2007 book 's title notwithstanding , Welch acknowledged that McCain , who spent more than five years as a prisoner of war in Vietnam , has demonstrated " maverick - y " behavior ever since he was " the class pop-off " and " a funny kind of punk kid who was getting in fights . "
McCain 's military background has a lot to do with his political independence .
Unlike many Republican leaders and activists , McCain did not rise from the conservative movement .
In fact , many of the patriotic values that McCain commonly espouses from the campaign stump are nonpartisan , such as duty , honor , courage and service .
" In one sense there 's a sense of structural ' maverick - ness ' in general with any politician who comes after a career in the military , " Welch said , citing Sen.
Jim Webb , D - Va. , as another example .
" They tend to have a country - first , political - party - second type of approach .
They 're going to sound a little different from your average politician and maybe say things that sort of outrage their own party more because they 're less grounded in philosophy . "
McCain and Udall
Not long after his first election to Congress in 1982 , McCain 's independent streak quickly emerged in his choice of mentors .
McCain has said it was the late Rep. Morris Udall , D - Ariz. , who taught him about the necessity of forging bipartisan coalitions to pass significant legislation .
McCain took Udall 's advice to heart , and it later crystallized with his successful push with Sen.
Russell Feingold , D - Wis. , for a new campaign - finance - reform law .
" He had no trouble trying to work on a bipartisan basis , " said former Sen. Dennis DeConcini , D - Ariz. , who served in the Senate with McCain from 1987 to 1995 and is now a lobbyist .
DeConcini recalls McCain going out of his way to befriend Udall and , early on , accompanying him at times when senior Arizona delegation members would huddle to discuss issues important to the state .
" Often , I remember having those meetings and McCain would show up and kind of just be a ' yes person ' for Udall , " he said .
" Which is fine .
He learned something , and I had no objection to it . "
Scott Celley , a press aide to McCain from 1987 until 1994 , said McCain 's maverick side was apparent from his earliest days in Congress .
Many recall McCain 's 1983
House vote against extending President Reagan 's Marine deployment in Lebanon .
McCain cited a lack of " obtainable objectives " in the mission .
Soon after , 241 Marines died in a terrorist attack on their barracks .
Celley pointed to other examples , such as McCain 's early criticism of wasteful Pentagon spending , which was not a top concern for many Republicans during the days of Reagan 's defense buildup .
McCain 's opposition to the 1988 catastrophic health - insurance law and subsequent attempt to reform it was widely reported at the time but little remembered now .
McCain sensed that Arizona seniors thought the new federal program was a disaster .
But when McCain brought up the problems , Senate leaders " mocked " him , Celley recalled .
" I remember overhearing him say on the floor , ' We 're going to keep coming back here and revisiting this issue over and over until I have persuaded all of you guys that this is the wrong thing , ' " Celley said .
Eventually , senior outrage over a surtax in the plan mounted nationwide .
The Senate voted 99 - 0 in October 1989 to adopt a McCain reform plan before ultimately repealing the entire program a month later .
Redefining McCain
The preponderance of incidences of McCain either bucking Bush or defying Senate GOP leaders will make it hard for Democrats to recast him as a White House stooge at this late date , said James Pfiffner , a presidential scholar at George Mason University in Virginia and the author of the 2004 book The Character Factor : How We Judge America 's Presidents .
The continuing distrust and hostility toward McCain from high - profile conservative commentators such as Ann Coulter only reinforces McCain 's reputation as a party outsider , he said .
" A lot more people are going to listen to ( national radio host ) Rush Limbaugh than are going to read the DNC ' myth buster ' stuff , " Pfiffner said .
Besides , McCain continues to do things his own way .
Two recent examples of McCain 's trademark style do n't reflect shrewd political calculation .
He continued to call for victory in Iraq , even at a time when it appeared to imperil his chances to secure the GOP nomination .
McCain repeatedly said he'd rather lose a political campaign than a war and still might as public skepticism about U.S. involvement in Iraq remains high .
" It helps on the character part , but it hurts on the policy part , " Pfiffner said .
Likewise , there 's little upside to McCain 's comments downplaying his own economic expertise other than to suggest he is someone who can comfortably discuss his flaws in public - at least away from the heat of a presidential campaign .
Those remarks came back to haunt him as the economy rose to prominence in this year 's race .
" He actually admits error more than most , " said Sen. Jon Kyl , R - Ariz . , a McCain backer .
" He almost prides himself in it .
He can't wait to tell you about a mistake he made or when he was wrong , and that 's fairly refreshing in a politician . "
McCain 's sincerity even wins some grudging praise from an unlikely source : Ralph Nader , the longtime consumer advocate who is running for president as an independent .
Nader likes what McCain has accomplished on campaign - finance reform and appreciates his positions on global warming , torture and Pentagon procurement practices .
" But on foreign and military policy , he 's horrendous , " Nader said .
" I 've called him the candidate of permanent war and intervention around the world . "
Still , Nader believes McCain is genuine and motivated by what he thinks is right .
Conservatives ought to take note of that , he said , particularly if they expect to sway McCain on other issues after he is sworn in as president .
" If they think they can change him , they 're whistling Dixie . "
I ’m considering writing a proposal for CSS Qualified Selectors to be submitted to the CSS Working Group .
But before I do I wanted to open the idea up for discussion .
I ’m looking for comments on the proposed feature ’s utility and hopefully , offers to help write the implementation details , specifically changes to CSS Grammar and Lexical Scanner — I ’m pretty sure I can handle the rest .
What exactly are Qualified Selectors ?
Descendant selectors are a pretty common sight so let ’s start there .
a img { ... }
This style is applied to any image inside of any anchor element .
But what if we already have an anchor style defined
a { text - decoration : none ; color : # A10 ; border - bottom : 1 px dashed # A10 ; }
but do n’t want this style applied to our image links ?
Currently we must add a new class to each of our image links so we have a hook to disable the unwanted style ( in this exampe , the border - bottom ) .
What if we could just write :
a < img { border : none ; }
That is a qualified selector .
A qualified selector can only contain one < .
The element immediately to the left of the < is the target of the selector , everything after is the qualifier .
In this case , the style would only apply to anchors that contain an image .
Here ’s another example : since most modern browsers allow you to click on a label to check the corresponding checkbox we can hint at this behavior by changing the cursor style :
label { cursor : pointer ; }
But what if the contained checkbox is disabled ?
The pointer cursor is misleading ( since the label ’s checkbox ca n’t be un / checked ) .
Currently we need to manually class the label ( or disable an additional arbitrary parent element ) to correct this .
With Qualified Selectors ( combined with attribute selectors ) we could just write :
label < input [ disabled ] { cursor : default ; }
One last example : let ’s say our site has news , blog and event archives .
The archive is a list of items containing an excerpt and a link to the full article or event details .
The mark - up looks something like this :
< ul class = " archive " > < li > < h3 >< a href= " #archive - link " >
Headline / Event Title</a></h3 > < div class= " excerpt " >
<!-- excerpt which may contains block level elements and other links --> </div> </li > <!-- and many more --> </ul >
Suppose we want to differentiate entire previously visited items ( rather than just previously visited links ) ?
There is no way to do this currently ( without being overly clever with server - or client - side scripting ) .
With qualified selectors it would be as easy as :
ul.archive li < h3 a:visited { opacity : 0.5 ; }
As you can see above , both sides of the < can contain complex or compound selectors .
Again , everything before the < selects the target , and everything after selects the qualifying element ( in the case above , a visited link in an h3 in our target list items in archive unordered lists ) .
If the link in the h3 has not been visited , the li appears at the default , full opacity .
Likewise even if a link contained by the excerpt is visited , the li will still appear at full opacity .
How would this be implemented ?
Based on my admittedly limited DOM - based CSS selector parser experience , the changes required for this type of selector would appear to be minimal .
Most CSS parsers work from the top down with each successive step deeper into a descendant selector replacing the previously selected ancestor elements until they have selected the target elements .
With qualified selectors rather than subsequent descendants replacing the ancestor elements , the descendants would be used to eliminate unwanted ancestors .
Let ’s say we have a recursive parser ( ) function that takes two arguments , a selector string and the parent node (s ) ( if no parent is provided it defaults to the root html element ) .
Let ’s call parser ( ' ul.archive li h3 a ' ) to see how it works .
Since a second argument is n’t provided the parser assumes that the root html element is the parent .
It then “ snaps off ” the first individual element selector ( in this case ul.archive ) and saves the remainder of the selector ( li h3 a ) in a remainder variable for later use .
It proceeds to select all ul in the parent and eliminates any without an archive class .
A reference to each matching ul is stored in a selected variable .
Once all ul have been considered the parser ( ) function calls itself .
This recursive call is provided the non-empty remainder of our original selector and the currently selected elements as arguments ( the selector and parent respectively ) .
The result of the recursive call replaces the currently selected elements .
This repeats until no remainder remains and the current value of selected ( containing just a elements ) is returned .
Qualified selectors would require modified logic around the recursive call .
Let ’s call parser ( ' ul.archive li < h3 a:visited ' ) to observe the changes .
The function proceeds as before until the remainder equals < h3 a:visited .
When the remainder begins with < that signifies that the currently selected elements are our actual targets and that any of those elements that do n’t contain the elements selected by the remainder should be eliminated .
So at this point the parser removes the < from the beginning of the remainder and calls itself , like so parser ( remainder , selected ) ( selected contains all matching li ) .
Rather than replacing selected with the result of that recursive call as before , the result is stored in a qualifiers variable .
Then for each selected it loops through qualifiers , eliminating any selected that do not contain one of the qualifiers ( by checking each qualifiers ancestors tree for each selected ) .
selected is returned containing just li elements contained by an archive ul that contain a visited link in an h3 .
Sound good ?
Sound Off
Designers and developers , does this sound useful ?
When creating mark - up and style I prefer to write selectors based on context ( rather than classing every .
single .
element ) .
Usually that context is created with one or two classes on a parent element .
Qualified selectors would help eliminate the need for some of those additional classes and provide previously unavailable distinctions related to states already maintained by the browser or elsewhere in our mark - up .
Browser developers , is this even feasible ?
Would the syntax of this new selector degrade gracefully ( read : be completely ignored ) in current and legacy browsers ?
If so , would you be interested in helping translate the proposed syntax into the required changes to CSS Grammar and Lexical Scanner ?
Cliff Thompson , a San Antonio resident sued by the RIAA for copyright infringement , has asked the Supreme Court to decide whether the record labels should be forced to pay attorneys ' fees in cases where they voluntarily dismiss copyright infringement cases .
Thompson was sued by the RIAA in 2006 for allegedly using KaZaA to distribute music , but the labels dismissed their case against him once it became apparent that his adult daughter was the KaZaA user in question .
Thompson and the case of the unawarded attorneys ' fees
Thompson sought an award of attorneys ' fees , arguing that since he was the prevailing party in the copyright infringement lawsuit , he was entitled to have his legal bills paid for by the RIAA .
The problem is that different courts do not handle attorneys ' fees in copyright infringement cases uniformly .
The judge in Virgin v. Thompson denied his request , citing a " purported lack of responsiveness , " and Thompson was thwarted once again at the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals .
Citing a 1997 Supreme Court ruling , the appeals court decided that attorneys ' fees awards are " not automatic . "
Instead , courts must take a number of factors into consideration , including " frivolousness , motivation , objective unreasonableness ... and the need in particular circumstances to advance considerations of compensation and deterrence , " noted the opinion .
In contrast , the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals has held that a simple " material alteration of the legal relationship of the parties " is sufficient for an attorneys ' fees award .
That decision , which involved a copyright infringement lawsuit between video poker game manufacturers , was based on a 2001 Supreme Court ruling .
Midwest Electronic Specialties was entitled to legal fees once the case against it was dismissed , said the appeals court .
" Midwest obtained a favorable judgment , " wrote the judges .
" That this came about when Riviera threw in the towel does not make Midwest less the victor than it would have been had the judge granted summary judgment or a jury returned a verdict in its favor .
Riviera sued ; Midwest won ; no more is required . "
Attorney : the Supreme Court should end the recording industry 's gambling
In the petition for certiorari filed with the Supreme Court , Thompson 's attorney Ted Lee lays out the RIAA 's legal strategy and notes what he describes as the " inherent unfairness " of the lawsuits .
" Clearly , the industry has gambled that defendants will make the financially - rational decision of settling the lawsuits — regardless of culpability — rather than risk financial ruin in a knock - down , drag - out legal fight , " reads Lee 's petition .
" More often than not this strategy works , as the vast majority of these defendants never see the inside of a courtroom in these lawsuits , simply because even if the innocent defendant were to win his case on the merits , he more than likely would lose in his pocket book . "
Lee focuses on a 1994 Supreme Court decision in Fogerty v. Fantasy Inc. , which appeals courts throughout the US have interpreted differently .
He argues that federal courts have " latched on to one footnote " from the case and only look at " frivolousness , motivation , objective unreasonableness , and the need to advance considerations of compensation and deterrence " when making a decision on attorneys ' fees .
The Fogerty factors are inherently unfair to prevailing defendants , says Lee .
" Simply put , it is impossible for a court to apply
the factors mentioned in Fogerty to prevailing plaintiffs and prevailing defendants in an evenhanded manner , " reads the petition .
" For example , the trial court 's opinion gave no consideration to the merits of Thompson ’s defense , but essentially concluded , contrary to the tenor of Fogerty , that because the plaintiffs ' cause was not " frivolous , " no attorney 's fees should be awarded to Thompson . "
That logic flies in the face of the Supreme Court 's finding that innocent defendants should be encouraged to fight back in court , says Lee .
" There is a clear and present need for this Court 's intervention and guidance on this important issue of copyright law , " Lee concludes .
" Moreover , an absence of uniformity between the circuits , concurrent with an onslaught of litigation by the music companies against internet account holders , only serves to provide innocent defendants with even little , if any , incentive to fully litigate any meritorious defenses they may have , contrary to the policies this Court has recognized . "
Obviously , no one outside of the nine justices can say whether or not the Supreme Court will hear this case .
But there are some significant reasons why the Court may be interested in taking up this case .
First , there is a conflict at the Appeals Court level , as at least two circuits are interpreting the same ruling and law very differently .
Second , and more significantly , there 's a lot at stake here .
The fight between the RIAA and alleged copyright infringers is inherently unbalanced due to the vast financial resources available to the record labels .
The risk - reward ratio for defendants is seriously out of kilter , and mandating that a successful defense — even if it comes from the RIAA 's decision to voluntarily dismiss a case — results in the record labels picking up the tab would even things out .

The third annual Feminist Porn Awards show is sold out , proof this is an idea whose time has come .
Organized by the female - focused sex store Good For Her , the awards tonight at the Gladstone Hotel are to be followed for the first time by a screening of clips from nominated porn flicks at the Revue Cinema tomorrow night .
Tickets to both events sold out in record time .
Feminist porn might not yet be a dictionary entry , but Good For Her staff are very familiar with the kind of adult movies that appeal to women of all sexualities – and to broad - minded men as well .
To meet the criteria for feminist porn , says the store 's manager Alison Lee , video must portray genuine pleasure , not involve exploitation of women or a restrictive male point of view , and include females largely left out of the picture , such as the disabled or the transgendered .
Such pornography shows women exploring their sexual desires in a safe place .
On the set of a feminist porn film , Lee says , " people usually indulge in their own fantasies , without some director barking orders all the time . "
Typically , feminist porn is better - scripted than mainstream adult movies and engages in issues concerning every woman 's right to express herself sexually .
There might even be laughs .
Feminist pornographers embrace irony .
An example might be one that could be described as Pleasantville meets The Stepford Wives carrying silk cords and chains .
That is not to say audience members at the fem - porn screenings will not enjoy – within the bounds of the obscenity laws – some very raunchy scenes at tomorrow 's screenings .
The films in the screening were all nominated – mostly by the store staff – for this year 's Feminist Porn Award .
The award is a statue , called the Emma after the pro-sex , anarchist feminist Emma Goldman .
Toronto filmmaker Loree Erickson , self - described " queer femme gimp , " opens her video of a woman in a wheelchair enjoying the intimate attentions of another woman with a line about giving up invisibility .
" Time to talk sex , be sex , show sex ... "
This is the sort of porn you 'd never find on late - night cable programming – it's risqué rather than raunchy – and certainly shows no evidence of awareness of the camera .
One thing about these women pornographers , says Lee , is that their work is very deliberate .
Niche audiences are now being catered to .
Porn nominee Morty Diamond is a transgendered New Yorker whose video Trans Entities is among the first to detail sex between gay trans men .
Firefighter - turned - filmmaker and web producer Bren Ryder will join the directors at the Revue Cinema to talk about her work .
Some straight men do enjoy lesbian porn , says Lee .
And some straight women enjoy gay male porn , if only because the men are physically appealing .
One of the tales in Erika Lust 's Five Hot Stories for Her features two hunky , seemingly straight men tumbling into bed together .
Straight girls might pick up a few pointers here .
Another of the stories is about Nadia , a woman desired and seduced by other women .
This one , says Lee , " absolutely anyone – gay , lesbian , straight or bisexual – would enjoy the tension and eroticism of it . "
Lust 's film gets down to business with female fantasies : taking on the pizza delivery man or pole dancing in the middle of a subway car .
Her film and City of Flesh 6 : Lisa 's Little Secret from New York feminist porn pioneer Estelle Joseph actually have plot , theme and multiple characters .
The narrative element here makes one wonder why filmmakers are not adapting stories from a wealth of female literary erotica , from Anaïs Nin to Susan Musgrave and Nicholson Baker .

[ digg - reddit - me ] Barack Obama was in New York City last night and unfortunately I was n’t able to make it as I did his Washington Square Park event in September .
By most accounts , the event was a huge success as Obama continued to use the new stump speech he premiered at the Jefferson - Jackson Dinner in Iowa earlier this month to great acclaim .
Over 1,500 were packed into the Apollo Theater including Dr. Cornell West , Chris Rock , and the Reverend Al Sharpton , who is still on the fence about the Clinton - Obama match - up .
Barack has consistently had strong showings in the New York City area and as happened at the two other campaign events I attended in New York , Obama attracted overflow crowds .
Chris Rock introduced Barack to the audience just a few blocks away from Bill Clinton ’s Harlem office , slipping in a reference to “ that white lady ” who happens to be Bill ’s wife , and explaining how George Bush has actually met our expectations as a nation :
From Newsday :
“ I want to stand up for those who still hunger for opportunity , who still thirst for justice .
I do n’t want to wake up four years from now to find that we missed the opportunity .
We cannot wait . ”
At this point , it is hard to deny the momentum is building for Obama as many take a second look at Clinton and a first serious look at the race .
A note on Chris Rock ‘s performance : Evidently not at his best last night .
The line he delivered fell flat , but I think this phrasing , stolen from FoxNews is an improvement .

Sometimes an artist can execute his labors too well .
For a limited time , please enjoy my extensive revision of the musical I opened to the most passionate audience response of my career in 2015 .
Alas , my success did not go unnoticed by another group of artists : the white - collar confidence artists of the Great White Way .
If you were in the audience for the baffling “ adapted ” version of Head Over Heels that was mounted on Broadway in 2018 , I am sincerely sorry .
I had nothing to do with that production .
I left it two years prior , heartbroken and battered from the egregious abuses of my now - former representation .
The original artist ’s vision only comes to life in these pages .
I set every syllable in meticulous iambic pentameter .
Over the thousands of hours I spent constructing the language , I learned priceless lessons about Shakespeare ’s favored poetic form : how the hypnotically flowing language crackles from the mouths of actors into the delighted ears of the Audience .

I have over a decade of professional C++ experience , but I do n’t call myself a “ C++ Programmer . ”
Am I competent with programming in C ++?
Yes , very much so .
But I refuse to let my skills be pigeon - holed by the language I ’ve historically used .
Nor should you .
Use the right tool for the job , the saying goes , and software development is no exception .
Programming languages , frameworks , and other tools are the subject of religious - caliber debate but they are just means to a greater end .
This article is a call to both programmers and their managers : a good programmer cannot be summed up by the list of tools they use .
The Toolbox
John K. Ousterhout , in this highly - recommended article , splits programming languages into two very rough categories : systems languages ( C , Java , etc. ) and scripting languages ( Perl , Ruby , etc. ) .
Even from the simplistic metric of “ machine instructions per line of code ” it should be obvious that some tasks are best suited for a systems language and others for a scripting language .
Device drivers need to be very fast and very efficient .
It ’s worth writing them in C , and doing so in any other language would be painful anyway .
C is simply the tool for the job .
( Or C ++ if you know what you ’re doing . )
How about a web interface for a database ?
The job is largely one of connections and business logic : take data in , apply rules and transformations to it , spit data back out .
Scripting languages are great at that .
They have all kinds of features for data manipulation and they ’re easy to interface with external resources .
There are other axes besides “ instructions per line of code . ”
Objective CAML is nearly as fast as C , for example , yet it ’s a completely different beast .
Factors such as approaching problems in the functional vs. imperative style can be significant to both developer and machine efficiency .
Another huge factor is libraries , e.g. part of Perl ’s popularity is rooted in its huge archive of modules .
Use the Right Tool for the Job
Any programmer that ’s earned their stripes has seen it : the massive C++ ( or whatever ) application that could have been written in 1 ⁄ 100 the lines of code in Ruby ( or whatever ) .
It would have been much easier to create , work just as well in production , and be easier to maintain .
But early in the game a C++ programmer was faced with starting the application , so he started writing it in , needless to say , C ++.
Foolish consistency is the hobgoblin of small minds .
– Ralph Waldo Emerson
The talented programmer has more than one tool in the toolbox .
Just as a carpenter does n’t build a house using only a hammer , a programmer does n’t need to bludgeon every problem into submission with C++.
Use the right tool for the job .
Before starting a project , step back and consider : what ’s the most efficient way to solve this problem ?
And what ’s the right tool ?
A programmer is more hindered than the carpenter in choosing their tools , however , because their coworkers must be able to maintain the code .
They may need to find one systems language and one scripting language the team can agree on .
That said , it sometimes takes a maverick to force the issue – rather than just causing trouble by developing a project in Python instead of the management - approved language , the maverick may be doing everyone a favor in the long run .
The Programmer ’s Responsibility
In school there ’s a good chance you were educated in the popular systems programming language of the day : assembly , Pascal , C , C++ , now Java .
If you ’ve been out of school more than ten years , chances are that language is starting to look a little … antiquated .
Whose responsibility is it to keep your toolbox current ?
It ’s up to you , of course .
Your current job might be writing C with Win32 APIs , and you ’re worried that you ’ll need to know .NET for your next job .
So learn it .
Convince your company to learn it on their time , or learn it on your own , but get it done .
Your professional growth is a longer - term issue than the current project you ’re working on – and much more important ( to you ) .
But more important than specific tools are the principles behind writing great software .
Seminal tomes on software like Design Patterns are n’t about a language or framework , but about principles of writing great software .
Do n’t just learn Java , learn object - oriented design .
Or screw learning something just for your résumé , learn functional programming and gain insight into whole new ways of approaching problems .
Employers Are Not Helping
“ Okay , this is all fine and dandy in principle , ” you say , “ but all the job listings are for [ insert language here ] programmers . ”
I admit it ’s a rare job listing which seeks a great programmer .
Most managers advertise jobs for assembly - line tool operators .
Many still do n’t appreciate that creating software is a creative endeavor , not a manufacturing process .
The average manager appears to choose their job requirements based solely on what tools have been used before .
Even for new products , if the past product was written in C++ , the new product will be written in C ++.
Therefore , hire more C++ programmers .
Even for completely new companies , I ’ve seen managers with little or no software background choose their technologies before hiring a programmer .
The smarter manager realizes a few things : first , a great programmer is a craftsman who creates software using the best practices and tools for the problem ; he does n’t just turn the C++ crank until enough code units have popped out .
Second , one great programmer is way more productive than several mediocre ones .
And more than just raw productivity :
The real trouble with using a lot of mediocre programmers instead of a couple of good ones is that no matter how long they work , they never produce something as good as what the great programmers can produce .
– Joel Spolsky
Some managers have gotten clever and turned the “ tool operator ” problem on its head : it can be argued that advertising for esoteric languages can bring in smarter programmers .
It ’s not so much important that a programmer know esoteric languages , it ’s important that they care enough to learn stuff out of the mainstream .
The great programmer is compelled to master their craft with self - education beyond the obvious résumé fodder .
And This Brings Us Back To…
Do you , the programmer , want to be a craftsman or a tool operator ?
If you ’re skilled with Java and your Java programming job pays well , that ’s great , but do you want that to be limit of your skills ?
I encourage programmers to master their craft .
Learn more sophisticated ( or simple ! ) concepts you can apply to the tools you use .
Learn new tools .
Learn tools that open up whole new ways of creating software .
Even if you continue using the same tools at your day job , expanding your perspective on programming will help you create software more skillfully .
And do you , the manager , really want to hire a bunch of tool operators ?
Perhaps your job is to create boring software that nobody really cares about anyway , so sure , hire some cheap guys and let them turn the crank .
But if you ca n’t afford to create mediocre products , you ca n’t afford to staff up with mediocre programmers .
Put out a bold job post : “ I want freaking great programmers . ”
Enough already with the “ 7 - 8 years of C++/STL/MFC/blah / blah experience . ”
Or be clever and post jobs for Python or Ruby programmers .
The software industry is doing everyone a disservice by defining programmers with a laundry list of tools instead of deeper skills .
Programmers need to be diligent about developing a breadth of skills , and marketing themselves appropriately .
Managers , in turn , need to appreciate programming as a creative endeavor and seek talented programmers , then let them pick the best tools .
Even if you ’re hiring for an in - progress project , a great programmer can learn a new tool faster than a mediocre programmer can become great .
GAZA CITY  " I am bleeding uncontrollably , I need an ambulance . "
That was not a call to emergency services , it was an appeal broadcast live on radio in Gaza City .
Who knows whether there will ever be an ambulance or not .
But this way the ambulance services still hear the appeal broadcast on Al - Iman FM Radio Station , one of few independent radio stations in Gaza .
And if the emergency services cannot help , someone else who hears the appeal might .
The ambulance dispatcher announces he cannot get the ambulance to the man .
An Israeli bulldozer is blocking the road , and an Israeli tank on a hilltop has been firing at the ambulance , he says .
Nobody can say if anyone else got to help the man .
But at least his SOS could have been heard .
Appeals again went on air after the Friday attacks on Bureij refugee camp , where the death toll climbed to 16 by the weekend .
The deaths included six children among nine people killed Friday .
Again , ambulance crews confirmed they could not reach many of the injured .
But the appeals were made on radio for all to hear .
A man called from east of Jabaliya refugee camp asking for an ambulance for his wife about to deliver .
The radio host asked his location , and that of Israeli tanks .
" I ca n’t look from the window to see , " he said .
" They will shoot me if I do . "
A lady called to ask an ambulance to clear the remains of a body lying on the door .
IPS confirmed later that it was the body of Abdelrazek Nofal , who was 19 .
He was blown to bits by an Israeli tank shell .
Someone else called from Bureij asking for ambulance , and for food and water .
" My mother needs to be in hospital urgently , " he called the radio station to say .
Another difficult mission , with the Israeli troops patrolling the area .
The appeals are heard on radio day after day .
No one can say what follows the appeals in each case .
But the live broadcasts on the radio can be a lifeline  or at the least , a line of hope .
Where emergency services and aid agencies are not listening in , the radio then calls them .
" It brings tears to my eyes , " says radio host Khaled al - Sharqawi .
" I can sometimes hear shooting , and women and children screaming , asking for ambulances , and the ambulances cannot reach them . "
Emergency services keep the radio on , if only to go in when it ’s safe to bring out bodies .
On one recent mission , said Ahmed Abu Sall , who works as a volunteer medical worker , " we were shot at by an Israeli tank .
Two bullets hit the wheels . "
This mission succeeded , as several do .
But it can be a long haul to call and wait .
Often , cell phone batteries run out as people call again and again with the appeals for help .
The Palestinian Telecommunications
Company has given the radio station a toll - free number .
That makes calling easier , but the radio station has to be on guard also against mischief .
Hosts do what they can to check sources and credibility before putting an appeal live on air .
Not every call is a medical crisis .
" In such cases we call human rights organizations , " Sharqawi told IPS .
" But they usually tell us they can not help people on the ground . "
Most people working at the radio station are young volunteers .
And Al - Iman is n’t the only one ; several other local radio stations have begun now to hear and to broadcast live appeals for help .

Astronomers say Universe is small and finite .
Mmm ... Universe .
Calculations show it really might be shaped like the snack favourite .
The doughnut is making a comeback – at least as a possible shape for our Universe .
The idea that the universe is finite and relatively small , rather than infinitely large , first became popular in 2003 , when cosmologists noticed unexpected patterns in the cosmic microwave background ( CMB ) – the relic radiation left behind by the Big Bang .
The CMB is made up of hot and cold spots that represent ripples in the density of the infant Universe , like waves in the sea .
An infinite Universe should contain waves of all sizes , but cosmologists were surprised to find that longer wavelengths were missing from measurements of the CMB made by NASA ’s Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe .
One explanation for the missing waves was that the universe is finite ( see ' Universe could be football - shaped ' ) .
A mirror ball
“ You can think of the Universe as a musical instrument - it cannot sustain vibrations that have a wavelength that is bigger than the length of the instrument itself , ” explains Frank Steiner , a physicist at Ulm University in Germany .
Cosmologists have suggested various ' wrap - around ' shapes for the Universe : it might be shaped like a football or even a weird ' doughnut ' .
In each case , the Universe would appear to be infinite , because you would never physically reach its edge - if you travelled far enough in any direction you would end up back where you started , just as if you were circumnavigating the globe .
But the notion soon suffered a setback .
Cosmologists predicted that a wrap - around Universe would act like a hall of mirrors , with images from distant objects being repeated multiple times across the sky .
Glenn Starkman at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland , Ohio , and his colleagues searched for the predicted patterns , but found nothing .
Undeterred , Steiner and his colleagues have re-analysed the 2003 data from NASA 's Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe , looking for different shapes , including the so - called ' 3 - torus ' , also dubbed the ' doughnut universe ' .
Despite its catchy nickname , this shape is tough to visualize , says Steiner .
The 3 - torus is an extension of the familiar doughnut shape and can be formed from a rectangular piece of paper .
You can imagine gluing together first one set of opposite edges to make a cylinder , and then the second set of opposing edges to make a doughnut shape , explains Steiner .
The 3 - torus is formed in a similar way , but you begin with a cube and glue together each of the opposite faces .
So if you were to attempt to exit one of the cube 's faces , you would immediately find yourself entering again through the opposite one .
Other shapes are possible
Steiner ’s team used three separate techniques to compare predictions of how the temperature fluctuations in different areas of the sky should match up in both an infinite Universe and a doughnut one .
In each case , the doughnut gave the best match to the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe data .
The team has even been able to pin point the probable size of the Universe , which would take around 56 billion light years to cross .
Jean - Pierre Luminet at the Paris Observatory in France , who proposed the football - shaped universe in 2003 , likes Steiner 's work .
He agrees that the analysis shows that the doughnut is still a likely candidate , but adds that other shapes are also possible .
“ One must remember that the ( football universe ) is still alive and well , ” says Luminet .
ADVERTISEMENT
Starkman , however , is not convinced that Steiner ’s team has done enough to win people over .
“ It could be true that the Universe is small , ” he says , “ but this does n’t provide an answer one way or the other . ”
Steiner believes that new and more precise measurements of the cosmic microwave background to be made by Europe 's Planck satellite , which is due to be launched later this year , will help answer the question .
“ Philosophically , I like the idea that the Universe is finite and one day we could fully explore it and find out everything about it , ” Steiner says .
“ But since physics can not be decided by philosophy , I hope it will be answered by Planck . ”

The final quote of this article was mistakenly attributed to Glenn Starkman .
It is now correctly attributed to Frank Steiner .
Welcome to a virtual world .
Even complex processes can be modelled with relatively simple cellular automata .
In the first part of Simulating the World we saw how simple mathematical models can be built to study everything from the flocking of birds to the collision of entire galaxies .
In these examples , a matrix , or a grid of numbers , was used as a convenient way of storing information on all the objects included in the simulation , so that it can be updated each time step as the simulation progresses .
In this second article , we 'll take a look at another class of mathematical models ; ones where the matrix or array is n't just a way of storing information during the simulation , but actually is the simulation itself .
Many real - world situations can be simplified as a sequence of objects in a line or an arrangement across a flat space — in other words , they can be faithfully represented by either a list of numbers ( a one - dimensional matrix ) or a regular grid of cells ( a two - dimensional matrix ) .
During the course of the simulation , the objects interact with those near - by according to a set of predefined rules , with the identity of each discrete position on the line or plane changing over time .
Such a system is called a cellular automaton model .
Cellular automata
The essence of any cellular automaton is a regular grid of cells , each of which can be in any one of a number of different states .
The earliest cellular automata models used only two states and are said to be binary — each cell could be either ON or OFF .
More complex models use a greater number of possible states , as we 'll see a bit later on .
Time is discrete , which means that at every time step the state of each cell is updated as if the cells were co-ordinated by the tick - tock of a great clock .
The state of each cell is updated in accordance to a set of rules depending on the cell 's current state and that of its neighbours .
In a one - dimensional model , the neighbours are simply the cells to the immediate left and right of the one in question .
In two dimensions there are different ways of defining the neighbourhood , but using the 8 bordering cells is one very common method .
Ideally , the simulation world would be infinite , with the grid of cells extending for ever in all directions , so that there is no concern about what to do with cells along the edge , which do n't have the full number of neighbours .
Handling this on a computer is obviously impossible in practice , and so the opposing world boundaries are joined into a circle ( one - dimensional ) or doughnut - shaped torus ( two - dimensional ) , as we saw in the first article .
This kind of model is said to have periodic boundary conditions .
One very famous example of a two - dimensional cellular automaton is the so - called Game of Life , where cells on the grid either die , survive , or are born , depending on the number of their neighbours already alive ( ON ) .
The rules for the universe are very simple , but even so , incredibly complex behaviour emerges out of the evolving patterns of cells .
We wo n't go into the fun to be had with the Game of Life here though , as this is well covered elsewhere , and Plus has also interviewed its creator John Conway .
In this article , we 'll take a look at examples of both one - dimensional and two - dimensional cellular automata , from traffic on a road to forest fires and cities .
Road traffic
In the very simplest road traffic set - up , we define the system so that each cell can exist in only two states .
Here , 0 denotes that the cell is empty — clear road — and 1 denotes that the patch of road is occupied by a car .
The neighbours of each cell are those immediately in front or behind .
The scenario for this single - lane model is such that a car can only advance forward if the road cell to the right is clear , otherwise it stays put .
We are only considering a single - lane road here — cars cannot overtake each other .
This model can be formally described as a set of rules for all eight ( 23 ) possible states of a cell and its two neighbours as follows ( the change to the third cell obviously depends on the next one to the right , not shown ) :
1. 000 ⇒ 000
2. 001 ⇒ 000
3. 011 ⇒ 010
4. 010 ⇒ 001
5. 100 ⇒ 010
6. 101 ⇒ 010
7. 110 ⇒ 101
8. 111 ⇒ 110
Situation 1 is the simplest case ; the cell in question , and both of its neighbours , are empty of cars and so nothing changes in the next time step .
In numbers 2 , 4 , 5 , and 7 one of the cars has clear road ahead , and so can advance one cell to the right , vacating the road space behind it .
In situations 3 and 8 , the central car finds another vehicle immediately in front of it , and so cannot move — there is a temporary deadlock in the road .
The display shows our strip of road as it changes over time .
A vacant cell is represented by a black pixel and a cell with a car by a white pixel .
There are no rules that cause the cells ' states to change , so the traffic is stationary .
The evolution of this one - dimensional cellular automaton over time can be represented by displaying the sequence of changing strips of road one after the other down the page .
So let 's take the very simplest case , where the initial value in each cell is randomly assigned to either 1 or 0 ( occupied by a car or empty ) , but where there are no rules defined for the evolution of the array from one time - step to the next .
Let 's take the probability of any cell containing a car at the beginning to be 1 % .
The image to the right shows the development of the cellular automaton as a simple series of vertical stripes — the value of each cell does not change over time ( looking down the page ) because all cars are stationary .
Here black denotes an empty cell and white denotes an occupied cell .
Now that we understand what the lay - out of the display means , we can add in the rules ( as above ) so that a car can move forwards to the right if the road in front of it is clear .
Now , the display becomes a little more complicated .
The road is nice and empty of traffic , and so each car always finds the space immediately in front of it clear and so advances one cell to the right every time - step .
One important aspect to remember about this cellular automaton is the periodic boundary condition : the road loops round into a complete circle , like the M25 .
So whenever a car drives off the right - hand side of the diagram , it reappears on the left - hand edge .
This is shown well in the animation below .
If you set the probability of a cell containing a car to 0.1 and click " start " , you will see diagonal white stripes appearing .
These represent cars driving steadily along the road , disappearing from the right - hand side and wrapping around to the left .
This text is usually replaced by the Flash movie .
The cellular automaton gets a whole lot more surprising if we increase the number of cars on the road .
Setting the probability of each cell containing a car during the initial set - up to be 50 % — 0.5 in the animation — produces a different pattern .
Many of the cars find the space in front of them empty and so advance one square to the right every time - step .
Occasionally , the random assignation of a value to each square at the beginning places several empty cells next to each other , and these appear as thin black 45 degree diagonal stripes .
These empty stripes are preserved over time because all the cars in this simple model are moving at the same speed , so they never catch up with those in front to close up the gaps in the traffic .
The white stripes are where cars have bunched up bumper - to - bumper on the road .
Only the front car of this stationary clump can move away into empty road , while the stationary obstacle means that other cars have to stop at the back end , and so these traffic jams move steadily back up the road — appearing as a - 45 degree white stripe .
Traffic nightmares ?
Modelling can not only imitate traffic flow , but also come up with traffic control mechanisms that can help alleviate congestion .
The most interesting behaviour shown by this extremely simple cellular automaton is when a right - moving black stripe intersects a left - moving white stripe .
This is the situation when a gap in the flow of cars meets a temporary traffic jam .
If the stripes are the same thickness ( i.e. involve the same number of cars and car holes ) they perfectly annihilate each other to result in a steadily - flowing stream of closely - spaced cars .
Over time the number of black and white stripes inexorably decreases as they meet and cancel each other out , until only those which were slightly more frequent in the initial set - up survive .
Although this very simple cellular automaton already shows some interesting behaviour , it 's easy to increase the complexity of the model to better represent traffic on a road .
In reality , a stream of traffic on a road does not exist in one of only two states — stationary or moving forward at the same speed .
There is in fact a smooth spectrum of different speeds that cars can take , as they accelerate over stretches of open road before getting caught behind slower - moving traffic ahead .
We can improve our cellular automaton model by allowing the cars to take different speed values .
This is achieved by keeping a cell value of 0 to denote an empty road square , and assigning the values of 1 to 10 to denote a cell occupied by a car with that particular speed .
If a car finds itself with a clear stretch of road in front it accelerates up to the speed limit ( 10 units per time step ) , otherwise it slows down to match the speed of the car just in front .
In this case , the state of each cell in the one - dimensional array can be colour - coded : black still signifies a patch of empty road , with a cell containing a car moving at a speed of 1 - 10 denoted with a colour spectrum blue - red .
The display produced when speed is allowed to vary .
Besides producing a pretty multi-coloured striped pattern , this simple traffic flow model generates some startlingly realistic behaviour .
As cars are constantly accelerating into empty road or braking behind slower - moving vehicles , the traffic spontaneously forms into packs of fast - moving cars and caravans of slow - moving cars .
You can see this in the diagram as a series of orangey - red and greeny - blue stripes , respectively .
The really interesting behaviour is when a train of fast traffic pulls up behind slower cars — the traffic is forced to slow and bunch up and then spaces out again as the cars accelerate away .
This exactly reproduces the compression waves often seen in real traffic on road - layouts much more complicated than this simple scenario , with variable speed limits , multiple lanes and over - taking , and side streets feeding into main roads .
Two - dimensional cellular automata
When another dimension is added to the simulation , so that the cells are spread out across a plane , even more realistic simulations of natural phenomena can be created .
A common two - dimensional cellular automaton model is that of fires spreading in a forest .
Cells in the grid can contain only bare earth ( grey cell ) , be occupied by trees ( green cell ) , or by burning trees ( orange cell ) .
A grey cell becomes a green cell with a certain probability , simulating tree growth .
A green cell that has no burning neighbour becomes red with a certain low probability .
This simulates lightning strikes , or any other natural fire starter .
Once ignited , a cell with a forest fire burns out in a single time - step , returning the cell to bare earth , but the inferno spreads to all adjoining cells filled with trees .
The animation below allows you to set the probability of a tree cell igniting and the probability of an earth cell growing trees .
Click " start " to see the scenario evolving .
You can also see a full screen version .
This text is usually replaced by the Flash movie .
The dynamics of our model forest mirror that of real woodland : trees grow slowly and spread into clear space , but are lost suddenly in catastrophes of small , medium and large fires .
It turns out that the frequency distribution of fires follows a power - law : small fires strike regularly , medium - sized conflagrations occasionally , and great forest - spanning infernos happen only very rarely .
This same pattern is seen in many natural events , from avalanches and earthquakes to meteorite impacts .
Large fires become much more likely , though , if the sparking probability is low because the forest has time to grow up and thickly cover the land before being hit by the next wildfire .
Once again , a ludicrously simple model produces some very interesting behaviour .
At any one time , depending on the assigned probability of fire - starting , several areas of forest will be burning simultaneously , in a range of small patches to large regions .
If the forest has become particularly dense , large clusters of trees exist and isolated regions of forest fire can spread rapidly and merge together to cover larger and larger areas of the forest , before finally burning themselves out .
The thicker the forest , the more devastating fires become , and the more land cover they consume and destroy .
So even this simplistic model produces a somewhat counter - intuitive result : it may well be safer to allow regular small fires to burn naturally through a forested region than to always attempt to extinguish them as quickly as possible .
Fire prevention officials are now actually deliberately starting small fires to prevent bigger , uncontrolled , infernos .
City development
Two - dimensional cellular automata models have not only been applied to understanding the natural environment , but also that of the human world .
Sophisticated cellular automata models have been applied , for example , to studying the development of cities over time .
The land area of a city is divided into cells , all of which have a certain neighbourhood of other adjoining cells , as before .
But in this case you can allow the cells to take several different states simultaneously to reflect the great variety of combinations possible in a real city .
For example , a small region of urban space can contain any of a number of different land uses ( such as residential , retail , offices , industrial ) , at a range of densities ( eg. from sub- urban bungalows to high - rise blocks on a housing estate ) , property values , and so on .
Depending on the surrounding area , the identity of cells evolve over time , and the rules defining these transitions can themselves be very complex .
And of course , the geography of the land itself can exert a strong influence on the development of a city , such as nearby hills , the course of a river , or the unconfining flat plains of a sprawling Los Angeles .
One research group at Arizona State University is attempting to include all these sorts of factors into great simulations of future urban development .
Imagine an automatic game of SimCity , but on a vast scale !

" By the time the government finds out , you 'll be inthe hole thirty days " 9/11 Truther is Told By OfficerWho Admits to False Accusation of Having a BombAaron Dykes / JonesReport | April 27 , 2007 Two persons identifying themselves as New York policeofficers interrupted a 9/11 Truth demonstration - - on apublic sidewalk in front of the new WTC 7 Building -- to intimidate free speech , stating " Larry [ Silverstein ] does n't want to hear it , " beforeaccusing We Are Change founder Luke Rudkowski ofhaving a bomb and that his cell phone was " a gun .
"
The officer was apparently responding to refusals tostop filming their faces as police attempted to impedefree speech on behalf of Larry Silverstein- - makingslanderous and knowingly false accusations : " I think he 's got a bomb in his bag .
Saw wires comingout .
Think he 's got a bomb in there .
" The police officer carried on during the encounter , saying " A terrorist act -- I guess they go away forabout 30 days .
" Rudkowski tell him he is not a terrorist and that heis an American citizen .
The officer responds , " You 'reright .
But by the time the government figures it out , you 'll be in the hole for 30 days .
"
The officer made the statements on camera with anotable smirk , and made no attempt to distance himselfor other witnesses from any physical danger ( as hewould have done he actually believed the activist hada bomb ) .
The officer went on to give away his criminalbehavior -- still on tape , despite ongoing demands heand the other officer made that the cameras be shutoff .
Alex Jones commented , " We have New York police ON TAPEthreatening to frame someone for terrorism in anonchalant fashion .
How bad would it have gotten ifthere were no cameras around ?

Democrat wins Mississippi special election
Democrats picked up a northern Mississippi House seat in one of the most conservative - minded districts in the country Tuesday night -- an upset that will reverberate darkly through a House Republican caucus already reeling from losses in special elections in Illinois and Louisiana .
With all precincts reporting , the Democratic nominee , Prentiss County Chancery Clerk Travis Childers , defeated Republican Greg Davis , 54 to 46 percent .
Childers was able to expand his three - point margin of victory from the race 's first round of balloting last month -- even as he faced an onslaught of Republican attacks .
The victory marks the Democrats ’ third straight special election pickup in three months .
It will be a serious blow to the Republican Party ’s already - flagging morale and will surely prompt a new round of finger - pointing among the already fractured GOP caucus .
" This loss is going to prompt serious introspection by our conference to figure out what went wrong and how to fix it , " said a GOP leadership aide .
" We have time to do that , and we will if we learn our lessons leading into November .
But the next couple of days are not going to be pretty . "
The special election was held to fill the seat of former Rep. Roger Wicker ( R - Miss . ) , who was appointed to serve out the remainder of Sen.
Trent Lott ’s term last December .
Wicker had never faced a competitive race since first elected in 1994 , and the district gave President Bush 62 percent of the vote in 2004 .
The results amount to a rebuke of the Republican strategy of trying nationalize the race by tying Childers to Sen. Barack Obama and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi .
Obama held low approval ratings in the district , but the nearly $ 2 million that GOP groups poured into northern Mississippi failed to make the race a referendum on the national political landscape .
Republicans dispatched a lineup of heavy hitters in the campaign ’s final week , including a pre-election stop Monday by Vice President Dick Cheney .
President Bush , Sen. John McCain ( R - Ariz . ) and First Lady Laura Bush recorded automated calls urging voters to support Davis .
A GOP House leadership aide told Politico last week that “ if we do n’t win in Mississippi , I think you are going to see a lot of people running around here looking for windows to jump out of . ”
The $ 1.27 million that the NRCC spent in the heavily Republican district amounted to nearly 20 percent of the committee 's entire cash - on - hand .
The committee has now spent more than $ 3 million to defend three conservative House seats , losing all three of them , and it is ill - equipped financially to compete fully in an ever - widening playing field for November .
For his part , Childers effectively downplayed the national implications of the contest , instead framing the race as a geographic battle between his home base in the 20 largely rural counties in the northeast corner of Mississippi and Davis ’ base in the newer and fast - growing Memphis suburbs .
Childers improved upon last month 's performance in most of the district ’s smaller rural counties and his home county of Prentiss , and he managed to cut slightly into Davis ’ margin of victory in his home base around the South Memphis suburbs , where Cheney campaigned for him on Monday .
" His victory has sent a political thunderbolt across America tonight , " DCCC chairman Chris Van Hollen said in a statement .
" It is yet another rejection of the House Republican agenda , the Bush Administration ’s misguided policies , and John McCain ’s campaign for a third Bush term . "
Man , that tiny Eee PC can be used for just about anything : surfing the web , blogging , surreptitiously hiding inside an ATM machine and stealing your identity .
You know , the usual stuff .
Yeah , so three creative Brazilian thieves were recently caught stuffing a black Eee into an ATM , where it replaced the ordinary magical - money - making workings and instead stole unwitting customers ' card numbers and PINs .
The thieves did n't stop there , however -- they purposefully damaged all the other nearby ATMs so that theirs would be the only one in service .
Clever !
Of course , that does n't explain why it was so easy to crack open the target ATM in the first place -- we 'd pretty much consider our cash flow problems solved if we could pull that trick .

OpenMoko develops completely open Linux - based mobile phones that can be modified and improved in the spirit of open source .
OpenMoko's developer - oriented Neo1973 was released last year and the consumer model , called the FreeRunner , is expected to move into the mass production stage next month .
Now , the company has radically reinvented its mobile software platform and is offering developers an early sneak peek of an alpha release that features Trolltech 's Qtopia mobile technology and uses the Enlightenment e17 window manager .
Although the OpenMoko application stack was originally built largely with GTK + and GNOME mobile and embedded technologies , the developers have recently pursued a radical deviation from the original plan and are reshaping many aspects of the platform to make it more functional and responsive .
We got our first hints of this transition back in February when we met with Enlightenment developer Carsten Haitzler at the Southern California Annual Linux Expo ( SCALE ) .
He told us that pervasive use of GTK + throughout core components of the user interface was consuming too much memory and diminishing the phone 's responsiveness .
He planned to leverage Enlightenment technology to cut back on the bloat while also making the user interface visually richer .
In addition to dropping OpenedHand 's Matchbox window manager in favor of Enlightenment e17 , the OpenMoko developers are also adopting components from Trolltech 's Qtopia mobile environment .
Qtopia , which is built with the Qt toolkit , provides a relatively mature and functional mobile Linux solution .
The GTK - based software used for basic phone capabilities like dialing and the address book have been replaced with Qtopia equivalents .
Although OpenMoko has largely abandoned GTK + for many of it built - in capabilities , the developers will still make it possible for GTK + to be used for third - party applications .
OpenMoko's developers ported Qtopia to X11 so that it can coexist with other frameworks .
OpenMoko developer Holger Freyther explains that the decision to adopt Qtopia was primarily motivated by the need for software that works today and he comments that the community members are still welcome to contribute to moving the GTK - based stack forward as well .
" We wanted to have a working phone on a short time frame and some of us believed that the current stack , specially the gsmd , is not close to be working properly .
The most promising alternative was the Qtopia stack .
So we started marching into this direction by porting it to Qt/X11 .
When I say Qtopia we mean the prediction of the keyboard , the dialer , the sms program , the various other phone apps , " Freyther writes in a blog entry .
" There are quite some things left but it is looking promising .
So guys , be happy that you will getting working hardware and working telephony software .
If you are bored with stuff just working the Gtk+ based stack is awaiting your patches . "
Support for Qtopia expands the ecosystem of community - built software that is available for the platform because it will now likely be easier to port existing Qt and KDE applications to the phones .
It 's also worth noting that Trolltech 's recently released Qt 4.4 has support for Windows Mobile .
Developers will be able to build an application with a single code base that can be used across both Windows Mobile and OpenMoko devices .
OpenMoko's decision to adopt
Qt seems to have come at roughly the same time that Nokia decided to make Qt available in its Maemo Internet Tablet operating system .
Nokia is also in the process of acquiring Qt creator Trolltech .
Two of the most prominent adopters of GTK + in the mobile space are now emphatically embracing the competing Qt toolkit — a shift that will likely impact the decisions of other mobile Linux adopters .
GTK + still has some big supporters in the phone handset industry , however , because it has been selected as the default application user interface toolkit for the LiMo Foundation 's mobile platform .
LiMo has a lineup of some heavy hitters including Motorola , NEC , NTT DoCoMo , Panasonic , Samsung , LG , and Verizon .
OpenMoko's new strategy will ensure that its phones are more functional at launch and it will also provide developers with more options and flexibility , but it could fragment the platform .
Supporting multiple toolkits will make it harder to make the platform truly integrated on the level that many expect of their phones .
It is likely that the Qtopia components are being used extensively now simply because they are more mature and that they will be incrementally replaced with richer Enlightenment - based software as the platform evolves .
Further Reading :
But the Republican strategy of trying to link Mr. Childers to more liberal national Democratic figures fell short , as it did in Louisiana .
Indeed , voters here were bombarded by advertisements equating Mr. Childers with Senator Barack Obama , a tactic intended to turn conservative whites away from Mr. Childers and which some politicians said played on white racial resentments .
Mr. Childers , for his part , fiercely resisted the connection , calling himself over and over a “ Mississippi Democrat . ”
The defeat is certain to put a damper on plans by Congressional Republican plans to roll out their new policy agenda this week in an effort to turn around their fortunes .
Several House Republicans , who were already scheduled to meet on Wednesday , have said privately they do not see a wholesale leadership shake - up or an overhaul of their campaign operation as a strong option , given that the election is just six months away .
But they are likely to consider some changes in response to the Mississippi defeat .
Former Speaker Newt Gingrich warned last week that Republicans need a major shift to forestall heavy losses in November .
When Mr. Childers is sworn in , the House will have 236 Democrats to 199 Republicans .
The seat was vacated when Representative Roger Wicker , a Republican , was appointed to succeed former Senator Trent Lott .
In the end , tying the white Democrat to the black presidential candidate may have helped Mr. Childers more than it hurt him , as campaign aides reported heavy black turnout , heavier than in a vote three weeks ago when he came within 400 votes of winning .
“ I like what Childers was saying : he was more truthful and down to earth , ” said Mary Shelton , an African - American who had just voted for him at the Yalobusha County courthouse here .
And Mr. Childers ’s association with the party that might nominate Mr. Obama did n’t hurt either .
“ We need a change , we really do , ” Ms. Shelton said .
Something I ’ve been noodling on since PyCon is how to improve code coverage testing in Python , in particular , finding a way to measure bytecode execution instead of just line execution .
After a fruitful investigation , I know a lot more about how CPython executes code , and I ’ve found a way to trace each bytecode .
As I mentioned in the Hidden Conditionals section of Flaws in coverage measurement , measuring line execution misses details within the lines .
My example was :
def implied_conditional ( a ) :
if ( a % 2 == 0 ) or ( a % 0 == 0 ) :
print " Special case "
return a + 2
# 100 % coverage :
implied_conditional ( 0 ) == 2
implied_conditional ( 2 ) == 4
A line coverage tool says that line 2 was executed , but never points out that a divide by zero error is lurking there .
Line tracing and beyond
The problem is that Python ’s tracing facility ( sys.settrace ) is based on source lines .
Your callback function is invoked for each line executed .
At PyCon , Matt Harrison floated the possibility of a source transformation tool which would take your Python code and rewrite it so that the operations were spread out over more lines so that the trace function would be invoked more often .
This would allow for tracing of the operations within lines .
It ’s an intriguing idea , but seems difficult and risky : the rewriting process could introduce errors , and there could be constructs which ca n’t be pulled apart successfully .
I thought a better approach would be to modify the Python interpreter itself .
If we could have the interpreter call a tracing function for each bytecode , we ’d have an authoritative trace without intricate code munging .
This approach has a few problems of its own :
Hacking the C code of the Python interpreter is not a simple task .
The change might not even be technically feasible .
Even if we did write a patch , getting those changes accepted by the core team is not easy if their perception of the costs and benefits is different than yours .
Even if the changes were accepted , it would be some future version of the Python interpreter which supported the cool new feature .
But I was interested enough to explore the possibility , so I went digging into the Python interpreter sources to see how sys. settrace did its work .
I found the answer to how it works , and also a cool trick to accomplish bytecode tracing without modifying the interpreter .
Python line numbers
The bytecode interpreter invokes the trace function every time an opcode to be executed is the first opcode on a new source line .
But how does it know which opcodes those are ?
The key is the co_lnotab member in the code object .
This is a string , interpreted as pairs of one - byte unsigned integers .
To re-use the example from The Structure of .pyc Files , here ’s some bytecode :
1 0 LOAD_CONST 4 ( ( 1 , 0 ) )
3 UNPACK_SEQUENCE 2
6 STORE_NAME 0 ( a )
9 STORE_NAME 1 ( b )
2 12 LOAD_NAME 0 ( a )
15 JUMP_IF_TRUE 7 ( to 25 )
18 POP_TOP
19 LOAD_NAME 1 ( b )
22 JUMP_IF_FALSE 13 ( to 38 )
>> 25 POP_TOP
3 26 LOAD_CONST 2 ( ' Hello ' )
29 PRINT_ITEM
30 LOAD_NAME 0 ( a )
33 PRINT_ITEM
34 PRINT_NEWLINE
35 JUMP_FORWARD 1 ( to 39 )
>> 38 POP_TOP
>> 39 LOAD_CONST 3 ( None )
42 RETURN_VALUE
and here ’s its line number information :
firstlineno 1
lnotab 0c010e01
The lnotab bytes are pairs of small integers , so this entry represents :
0c 01 : ( 12 , 1 )
0e 01 : ( 14 , 1 )
The two numbers in each pair are a bytecode offset delta and a source line number delta .
The firstlineno value of 1 means that the bytecode at offset zero is line number 1 .
Each entry in the lnotab is then a delta to the bytecode offset and a delta to the line number to get to the next line .
So bytecode offset 12 is line number 2 , and bytecode offset 26 ( 12+14 ) is line number 3 .
The line numbers at the left of the disassembled bytecode are computed this way from firstlineno and lnotab .
( There are more details to deal with deltas larger than 255 .
Complete info is in the CPython source : compile.c , search for “ All about a_lnotab ” . )
As the Python interpreter executes bytecodes , it examines the offsets against this map , and when the source line number that results is different than for the previous bytecode , it calls the trace function .
Here ’s where the hack comes in : what if we lie about line numbers ?
What would happen if we change the .pyc file to have a different mapping of bytecode offsets to line numbers ?
A simple program to trace
To set up the test , here ’s a sample .
py :
sample .py a , b = 1 , 0
if a or b :

Hello 1
As each line is executed , my trace function is invoked , and it digs into the frame object to get the filename and line number .
From the output , we can see that we executed lines 1 , 2 , and 3 in turn .
Lying about line numbers
To lie about line numbers , I wrote a small tool to rewrite .pyc files .
It copies everything verbatim , except it changes the firstlineno and lnotab entries .
As a simple proof of concept , we ’ll make the lnotab map claim that every byte offset is a new line number : it will consist entirely of ( 1,1 ) entries .
And because byte offsets start at zero , I ’ll change the firstlineno entry to zero .
Here ’s hackpyc.py :
hackpyc.py " " " Wicked hack to get .pyc files to do bytecode tracing
instead of line tracing .

This is fairly straightforward , the only hiccup was that code objects ’ members are read - only , so I could n’t just update the parts I wanted , I had to create a new code object with new .code .

Here the “ line number ” in the trace function is really a bytecode offset , and the interpreter invokes the trace function for every bytecode executed !
We can see that execution jumped from 15 to 25 , skipping the bytecodes that examine the b variable .
This is just the sort of detail about execution that line - oriented coverage measurement could never tell us .
Where does this leave us ?
As I see it , these are the good things about this technique :
It works .
It does n’t require complex manipulation of source code .
It does n’t require changes to the Python interpreter , with all of the difficulties that could bring .
Problems with this so far :
I ’m sure some people will find it distasteful .
It needs to compute more useful fake line numbers .
These bytecode offsets are always from the beginning of each code object .
In real .pyc files , which have many distinct code objects , each code object will start from zero .
We need some way of disambiguating the offsets .
Also , the line number is the byte offset , not the number of the bytecode , so there are gaps in the numbers that can only be understood by examining the bytecode .
If the Python interpreter changes their line numbering mechanism , this technique could be completely broken .
There ’s no way to correlate the bytecodes back to source constructs other than the original source lines they came from .
In our small example , we only know it was b that was never examined by looking at the disassembled bytecodes .
The original line number information is lost .
It would have to be stored off to the side to make this useful .
This is only a quick demonstration of a technique , it is n’t useful yet .
I think it could be made useful though .
PS : As a result of this investigation , I also think it would be simple to patch the interpreter to call a trace function on every bytecode .

He is reported to be living apart from the mother - to - be .
As he is unemployed he does not support his children financially , but Mr Macdonald says he has no plans to father any more children
' Not happy '
The north east has a high rate of teenage pregnancies , with 52 girls per 1,000 under 18 becoming pregnant , as opposed to an England average of 42 .

( NaturalNews ) Researchers at Penn State have discovered a process for generating hydrogen from the decomposition of a common acid , according to a study published in the Researchers placed naturally occurring bacteria into acetic acid , which is produced when glucose or cellulose ferment .
Acetic acid is the primary component in vinegar .
The researchers added a granulated graphite anode and a cathode of carbon with a platinum catalyst , converting the entire system into a fuel cell .
As a consequence of the bacteria 's digestion of the acetic acid , electrons flowed from the anode to the cathode , generating up to 0.3 volts of electricity .
With a total of 0.5 volts of energy - meaning that 0.2 volts must be added from an external source - the liquid starts to break into its component parts and hydrogen gas is released .
According to researcher Bruce E. Logan , the new process highlights that hydrogen production for energy purposes is more achievable and nearer to realization than biofuels such as ethanol .
"
The energy focus is currently on ethanol as a fuel , but economical ethanol from cellulose is 10 years down the road , " Logan said .
" First you need to break cellulose down to sugars and then bacteria can convert them to ethanol .
"
In contrast , the fuel cell developed by Logan 's research team uses minimal processing to produce an energy surplus .
" This process produces 288 percent more energy in hydrogen than the electrical energy that is added to the process , " Logan said .
If the cell is set up to siphon off some of the hydrogen that it produces in order to power its own process , the cell produces 144 percent more energy than it uses .
Fuel cells last until the fuel that powers them ( in this case , acetic acid ) is consumed .
In contrast to batteries , in which the anode and cathode are consumed and must be replaced , the fuel cell can be recharged with fuel and continue operating .

Sniper taken from Iraq after shooting Quran
BAGHDAD — A U.S. sniper was removed from Iraq after he used a copy of the Quran for target practice , the military said Sunday .
The removal announcement came a day after a U.S. commander apologized to Sunni tribal leaders .
Iraqi police found the Quran on a firing range near a police station in Radwaniyah , a former insurgent stronghold west of Baghdad , said a U.S. military spokesman , Col. Bill Buckner .
U.S. commanders launched an inquiry that led to disciplinary action against the unidentified soldier , Buckner said .
Sheik Ahmed Khudayer al - Janabi , a local tribal leader , said a protest march was planned Thursday but was called off under pressure from U.S. forces and to prevent any insurgent violence as retaliation .
" I come before you here seeking your forgiveness , " Maj. Gen. Jeffery Hammond said Saturday at a ceremony in Radwaniyah .
" In the most humble manner , I look in your eyes today and I say , please forgive me and my soldiers . "
" The actions of one soldier were nothing more than criminal behavior , " he said .
" I 've come to this land to protect you , to support you — not to harm you — and the behavior of this soldier was nothing short of wrong and unacceptable . "
The commander also read a letter of apology by the shooter .
Tribal leaders , dignitaries and local security officials attended the ceremony .

A bill to protect Americans from discrimination based on their genetic makeup has passed the Senate by a vote of 95 - 0 , sending it to the president 's desk via a final vote in the house that is considered a formality .
President Bush is widely expected to sign the legislation into law .
The Genetic Information Non-Discrimination
Act , aka GINA and S. 358 , had been bouncing around Congress for a decade , but this is the first time it has passed through both the House and Senate .
" After a very long wait , Americans can now be confident that their genetic information cannot be used by health insurers or employers in harmful or hurtful ways , " Kathy Hudson , director of the Genetics and
Public Policy Center , said in a statement .
The legislation 's passage could make consumers and patients more willing to have their DNA tested for disease - indicators , which could swing the door wide - open for so - called personalized medicine in which genetic and genomic data is used to tailor treatments .
It could be a major win for genomic testing companies like 23AndMe and Navigenics , who are collecting and analyzing unprecedentedly large amounts of genetic information from their clients .
Genetic testing advocates worried that the adoption of testing would be slowed by the lack of government protection .
Surveys appeared to back that sentiment with an overwhelming number of Americans saying they wanted their genetic data safeguarded from employers and insurers .
GINA , specifically , would bar employers and insurance companies from using genetic information in human resources decisions or determining insurance eligibility .
The bill appeared on the verge of passing into law last year before it got held up by Tom Coburn , a
Republican Senator from Oklahoma as detailed in a Wired.com story last year , " Genetic Non-Discrimination Bill Stalled in Senate . "
Coburn 's press secretary , Don Tatro , said that a clause was added to the legislation that removed Coburn 's concerns .
" Dr. Coburn supported the Genetic Information Non-Discrimination
Act the whole time , " Tatro said .
" We just wanted to make sure that we did n't create unintended consequences . "

Panhandling can be an effective way to earn some cash , but you ’ll need to choose a busy area and ask people appropriately to make it work .
Choose a place where there ’s a lot of foot traffic , like a subway stop or urban campus , since you ’ll find it easier to talk to more people .
It ’s a good idea to move to a new spot every once in a while so you do n’t wear out your welcome .
When you ask for money , be polite and always say thank you whether or not they give you any .
Being courteous will encourage more people to give to you , whereas being aggressive or rude will only lead to confrontation .
You should also ask for something specific , since people are more likely to give you a few cents if your story sounds believable .
For example , it would be better to say you need 40 cents for a bus ticket than tell someone you need money for a bus ticket .
Avoid getting into disputes with other panhandlers , since this could put your safety at risk .
Remember to stash your money somewhere safe from time to time so you 're not carrying large amounts of cash around with you .
For tips on how to find the best cities for panhandlers , read on !

New survey finds only 20.8 % of India is poor
BS Reporter in New Delhi | February 07 , 2008 08:55 IST
According to the survey , ' How India earns , spends and saves ' , about 214 million people , or 20.8 per cent of India 's population , are poor .
In contrast , according to the two sets of poverty estimates provided by the NSS using consumption expenditure data , the country 's poverty level is 27.5 per cent according to the 30 - day data and 21.8 per cent on the basis of the 365 - day data .
The latest survey has been carried out by Max New York Life and the NCAER using state - wise expenditure poverty lines ( EPL ) for 2004 - 05 as defined by the Planning Commission to calculate the poverty ratio based on the income data .
The incidence of income poverty in rural and urban areas , according to the study , is estimated to be 21.7 per cent and 18.7 per cent , respectively .
The survey has found that around 22.3 per cent households control 51 per cent of India 's total income .
This group 's per capita income is Rs 33,170 annually , about nine times the lowest income - level segment of 17.9 per households , whose annual per capita income is Rs 3,534 .
The urban annual income level of Rs 95,827 is around 85 per cent higher than the rural annual income level of Rs 51,922 , according to the survey .
Given that the expenses of urban households are substantially higher than rural households , an average urban household is estimated to be saving Rs 26,762 or nearly double that of a rural household , which saved Rs 11,613 on an average .
In Delhi , the richest state in the country , the annual average per capita income is Rs 29,137 , compared with Rs 6,277 in the poorest state of the country , Bihar .
Labourers constitute over 62 per cent of poor households .
In contrast , this group accounts for 26 per cent of non-poor households .
While 21.7 per cent of non-poor households earn salaries , just about 4.4 per cent of poor households earn their living through salary or wages .
The survey , which was conducted with a sample size of of 63,016 households in 24 states , included 31,446 rural households and 31,570 urban households .
For years I 'd been visiting Newegg 's facilities and I 'd always commented , especially in the early days , on how I 'd really wanted to take pictures of the facilities and do an article on them .
Back when Newegg was much younger , a good portion of its success was due to the efficiencies of its warehouse in filling orders .
As many companies in our industry tend to be , Newegg was quite shy and would n't let me so much as take a picture the first couple of times I visited them .
Finally in 2006 , they opened up to the idea of documenting one of their warehouses .
Armed with camera and notepad I toured Newegg 's facilitiy in Los Angeles just around the time that it opened its first warehouse servicing the east coast in Tennessee .
Fast forward to 2008 and Newegg had just recently unveiled its second east coast facility , this time in New Jersey .
With revenues well over $ 1B a year , Newegg is no longer the seemingly small operation it once was and the company is much less shy .
While the brains behind the original warehouse design has since left the company , the New Jersey facility is an improved , more up - to - date version of what I saw back in LA in 2006 .
There are far fewer actual people at the warehouse now thanks to even further automation and , yes , the goal is still to get your order to you within two days of leaving the facility regardless of shipping method .
That 's actually the whole purpose of building the NJ facility , so that customers on the east coast can actually get their orders within that two day target - even with ground shipping .
For those of you who remember the first article , not much has changed - everything i just a lot newer ( and the warehouse is a lot quieter too ) .
I told Newegg that if we were going to do another tour we had to do it exactly like last time , which meant that they needed to give away something special to AnandTech readers .
The first time Newegg let me tour their facilities and setup a giveaway it was a very kind gesture , now it has become tradition .
I 'll get to exactly what you get to win and how in a little bit .
While some people pay attention to the alleged contest between Sens. Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama ( and she won big ) , almost unnoticed is the Republican primary .
Many people think Arizona Republican Sen. John McCain has won the GOP nomination .
Actually , he has .
A long time ago .
But Texas Rep. Ron Paul 's revolutionaries continue to plug away .
With 45 % of Pennsylvania 's 9,268 precincts reporting , Paul has captured 15 % of the vote .
He 's easily beating former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee , who has only 12 % .
Two things will moderate joy in the Paul camp .
One , Huckabee suspended his campaign and stopped campaigning weeks ago .
Yet , he 's still getting 12 % .
And second , McCain is capturing 73 % of the GOP vote -- which was apparently reduced by some thousands of Republicans who changed their registration to vote Democratic for Clinton , as ordered by their leader , Rush Limbaugh , to promote further prolonged feuding among Democrats .
On the other hand , Paul will point out , McCain has already won the party 's top ticket spot and yet is drawing only 3 out of 4 Republican ballots .
( UPDATE : With 98 % of Pennsylvania 's 9,268 precincts reporting Rep. Paul has narrowed the lead of Sen. McCain by 1 % , to just 57 points .
Paul captured 125,204 votes or 16 % to McCain 's 570,188 or 73 % .
Mike Huckabee trails both with 89,344 or 11 % . )

CBS anchor Katie Couric told members of We Are Change that she would support a new 9/11 investigation " if there ’s enough public support , " after first commenting that she ’d " have to think about it . "
Gary Talis , of We Are Change , also cited the Jersey Girls , who first pressed for the inquiries that became the 9/11 Commission .
Couric said she knew them , seeming concerned at the idea their questions had been largely ignored .
" The commission definitely had some issues , " Couric admitted .
Couric added that she herself had done a 60 Minutes piece about the respiratory illness that 9/11 rescue workers from the pile now face and was certainly concerned about that aspect of 9/11 truth issues .
Talis also spoke briefly with Jeff Greenfield , also a CBS correspondent , who was dismissive of a new 9/11 investigation and quickly walked away after commenting :
" A lot of people have views like that who are very strange , " Greenfield said .

Led by PayPal founder Peter Thiel and a Google engineer and Sun programmer , the Seasteading project aims to allow people who are looking to live independent of any government a chance to do just that .
People will get a dinky 300 square feet of living space in a windowless tube floating in the ocean , but hey , there 'll be satellite internet access !
Google 's Patri Friedman has this to say about the plan :
" Government is an industry with a really high barrier to entry , " he said .
" You basically need to win an election or a revolution to try a new one .
That 's a ridiculous barrier to entry .
And it 's got enormous customer lock - in .
People complain about their cellphone plans that are like two years , but think of the effort that it takes to change your citizenship . "
Friedman estimates that it would cost a few hundred million dollars to build a seastead for a few thousand people .
With costs that low , Friedman can see constellations of cities springing up , giving people a variety of governmental choices .
If misguided policies arose , citizens could simply motor to a new nation .
" You can change your government without having to leave your house , " he said .
It 's a pretty insane idea , albeit an interesting one that 's got a lot of money and smart people behind it .

A Beijing court has rejected the claim of a Chinese man and his grandson for reputation damage in consuming a KFC " teadog set meal " , the local media reported on Thursday .
Tongzhou District court ruled on Tuesday that the two plaintiffs surnamed Jin would not get compensation from the KFC fast - food chain as they could n't provide substantive evidence to prove the set meal had led to a " lower social evaluation " and reputation damage to them , as they claimed .
According to The Beijing News , the Jins bought a " teadog set meal " in a KFC store in the capital 's east Tongzhou District on Dec. 15 .
The two had found an advert in the shop promoting the set meal , which the elder Jin thought meant man and dog sharing the meal .
He then sued KFC for insulting consumers , because " according to the advertisement , my grandson has eaten dog food and we two have become ' dog friends ' " , -- a term that means " a dissolute company " in Chinese .
Representatives for KFC , however , said the set meal was so named because consumers could get a calendar featuring teadogs , a Japanese cartoon image , if they paid extra money through a promotion .
KFC argued the advertisement was meant to convey the message that teadogs were men's good friends , and the advert itself did n't break the law .
The problems , at least in the early stages of this crisis , were most pronounced among banks whose regulatory oversight has been elaborate for years .
To be sure , the systems of setting bank capital requirements ... will be overhauled substantially ...
Also being questioned , tangentially , are the mathematically elegant economic forecasting models that once again have been unable to anticipate a financial crisis or the onset of recession .
Home prices have been receding rapidly under the weight of ... inventory overhang .
...
The level of home prices will probably stabilise as soon as the rate of inventory liquidation reaches its maximum ...
That point , however , is still an indeterminate number of months in the future .
We will never have a perfect model of risk , by Alan Greenspan , Commentary , Financial Times :
The current financial crisis in the US is likely to be judged ... as the most wrenching since the end of the second world war .
It will end eventually when home prices stabilise ...
Although inventories of vacant single - family homes ... have recently peaked , until liquidation of these inventories proceeds in earnest , the level at which home prices will stabilise remains problematic .
...
The short version of this argument by Alan Greenspan is : models of risk are not perfect , they can miss inflating bubbles , so do n't expect the Fed to know when a bubbling is inflating or to predict when a bubble might burst .
And even if the Fed could identify bubbles , it could n't stop them since a bubble " will not collapse until the speculative fever breaks on its own . "
The subtext is : do n't blame me for missing the bubble that created the current mess , even if I did recognize it I could n't have stopped it , and do n't use the current crisis as an excuse to limit " market flexibility and open competition " through regulatory responses :
Credit market systems and their degree of leverage and liquidity are rooted in trust in the solvency of counterparties .
That trust was badly shaken on August 9 2007 when BNP Paribas revealed large unanticipated losses on US subprime securities .
Risk management systems – and the models at their core – were supposed to guard against outsized losses .
How did we go so wrong ?
The essential problem is that our models – both risk models and econometric models – as complex as they have become , are still too simple to capture the full array of governing variables that drive global economic reality .
... I do not say that the current systems of risk management or econometric forecasting are not in large measure soundly rooted in the real world .
The exploration of the benefits of diversification in risk - management models is unquestionably sound and the use of an elaborate macroeconometric model does enforce forecasting discipline .
It requires , for example , that saving equal investment , that the marginal propensity to consume be positive , and that inventories be non-negative .
These restraints , among others , eliminated most of the distressing inconsistencies of the unsophisticated forecasting world of a half century ago .
But these models do not fully capture ... the innate human responses that result in swings between euphoria and fear that repeat themselves generation after generation with little evidence of a learning curve .
Asset - price bubbles build and burst today as they have since the early 18th century , when modern competitive markets evolved .
To be sure , we tend to label such behavioural responses as non-rational .
But forecasters ’ concerns should be not whether human response is rational or irrational , only that it is observable and systematic .
This , to me , is the large missing “ explanatory variable ” in both risk - management and macroeconometric models .
Current practice is to introduce notions of “ animal spirits ” , as John Maynard Keynes put it , through “ add factors ” .
That is , we arbitrarily change the outcome of our model ’s equations .
Add - factoring , however , is an implicit recognition that models ... are structurally deficient ...
We will never be able to anticipate all discontinuities in financial markets .
Discontinuities are , of necessity , a surprise .
Anticipated events are arbitraged away .
But if , as I strongly suspect , periods of euphoria are very difficult to suppress as they build , they will not collapse until the speculative fever breaks on its own .
...
In the current crisis , as in past crises , we can learn much , and policy in the future will be informed by these lessons .
But we cannot hope to anticipate the specifics of future crises with any degree of confidence .
Thus it is important , indeed crucial , that any reforms in , and adjustments to , the structure of markets and regulation not inhibit our most reliable and effective safeguards against cumulative economic failure : market flexibility and open competition .
You have just been appointed as a member of the Federal Reserve Board and you are now in charge of the Bubble Management Division .
Will you be able to identify the next bubble ?
How will you do it ?
Remember , when some prices shoot up rapidly it is an equilibrium response to changes in supply or demand that signal resources to flow into the industry .
High profits for a period of time - profits that look excessive when compared to other industries - are required to signal people and resources to enter the industry .
If we shut down all large changes in prices , and prevent large profits , then we will shut down this signal and resources will fail to move efficiently in response to variations in market conditions .
But we do n't want resources to respond to false signals and that is the problem with bubbles , resources flow to the wrong places because the price signal is distorted .
So the problem for a policymaker is to separate the price changes that are properly directing the flow of resources from those that are n't , and the size or rapidity of price changes is not enough to make this determination , the two types of price changes are difficult to sort out .
So , since it 's your job to do this , can you ?
Or is there a chance you might shut down an industry that appears to be an inflating bubble when in fact it is an equilibrium response to changing conditions ?
It 's generally possible to tell both sets of stories , to explain how it could be an equilibrium response , and to explain that it could be a bubble , so what degree of certainty do you require before intervening and shutting down price movements , thereby taking profits away from participants in the market ?
It 's easy to see bubbles looking back , it 's not so easy to see them as they are developing .
I 'm not saying we can't do it , that we 'll never recognize a bubble as it is inflating , just that it 's not as easy as it might seem .
Stepping away from bubbles for a moment and talking more generally about prices sending false signals , the point behind monetary policy in New Keynesian models of sluggish wage and price adjustment is to shut down misleading price signals .
The flow of resources in the economy is dictated by what we call relative prices , the price of good A divided by the price of good B ( e.g. , the number of apples you can get for an orange ) , and in the presence of inflation and prices that do not adjust quickly these relative prices can be pushed away from their long - run , equilibrium levels .
Inflation requires all prices to move , and local conditions require prices to move differentially , but the presence of price rigidities prevents these adjustments causing relative prices to move away from their desired values .
This sends false signals to both input and output markets , resources go to the wrong places , the wrong goods are produced , and this makes us worse off .
The policy solution is to make sure relative prices do not deviate from their optimal values .
How do you do that ?
There are two types of prices , flexible prices ( e.g. the price of gasoline and asparagus change rapidly in response to current conditions ) , and not - so - flexible prices which stay fixed or move slowly over time even when current conditions are changing ( e.g. prices printed in catalogues mailed to households ) .
If you are going to have any chance of keeping these ratios in line , it is the flexible prices that will have to do most of the adjusting .
For example , suppose that good A has inflexible prices , but good B has perfectly flexible prices .
Then so long as participants in the market for good B are fully aware of and can predict the price of good A , the price of B can be adjusted so that relative prices are correct .
That is the basis of monetary policy in the New Keynesian model , make the prices that are inflexible as stable and predictable as possible so that the flexible prices can adjust optimally and prevent false signals from misdirecting resource flows .
How do you make these prices stable and predictable ?
You first create a price index - call it core CPI or core inflation if it is a percentage change - that contains only the inflexible prices and leaves out the flexible prices .
You then target those core prices using monetary policy so they are as stable and as predictable as you can make them , and allow the flexible prices which are not part of the index to adjust in response to changing conditions and maintain the optimal relative prices .
Notice something important .
If you use overall CPI instead of core CPI , i.e. if you use the price index that includes both flexible and inflexible prices , then you would be targeting and limiting movement in the very prices - the flexible ones - you need to adjust to keep relative prices in line and prevent false signals from sending resources to the wrong places .
That 's why you do n't want the flexible prices to be part of the price index the Fed is monitoring .
I 've wandered from the topic of bubbles a bit , so back to the main topic .
As the newly appointed Head of Bubble Management , where do you think the next bubble will appear , how will you detect and verify that it is a bubble , and how will you deflate it without harming other sectors of the economy in the process ?
Update : Paul Krugman comments on Greenspan 's remarks .
In yet another example of robots getting the short end of stick , a Japanese weather forecasting company is set to deploy a swarm of some 200 pollen - sniffing robots throughout the country , which will warn us humans of any impeding pollen - related dangers ( and no doubt scare a few unsuspecting animals in the process ) .
As you can see , the robots are of the spherical variety , and measure a scant one foot across and weigh in at about 2.2 pounds .
Sticking true to creepy robot conventions , they also boast glowing eyes , which light up in one of five different colors to indicate the level of pollen in the air .
Somewhat curiously , that information takes a rather roundabout way back to the company 's headquarters , with 200 allergy suffers volunteering to keep watch on the robots and rely their status back to the company .

Before my fiancée and I headed to Syria to study Arabic , we often heard there was one advantage to living in a police state : almost no crime .
So it came as a surprise when Sara and I returned to our Damascus apartment one night after a dinner party to find splintered wood in the hallway — wood that had once been part of our front door .
I made a beeline for the living room to check on our most valuable possessions : my MacBook and Sara 's MacBook Pro. Both gone .
There 's no 911 in Damascus , so we called our landlord , who contacted the cops .
Within an hour , a dozen police were on the scene .
About half of them sat around fingering unlit cigarettes .
( Pushy Americans , we had asked them not to smoke inside . )
The others engaged in what could generously be called an investigation .
They took fingerprints from the door .
They dusted the fridge .
" Maybe the robber was thirsty , " one said .
They did not dust the coffee table where the laptops had been sitting .
The size of the police contingent was itself disconcerting .
Damascus ' finest had probably come out in force simply because it's not often a foreigner 's home gets burglarized .
But it 's easy to get paranoid in Syria .
We wondered whether some of the cops — like the ones wearing dark leather jackets — were " special " police , more interested in us than the crime .
( Being a foreign journalist in Syria on a tourist visa can invite extra attention .
Also , how to put this delicately , we were returning home from a Shabbat dinner . )
The next morning , our landlord accompanied us to the local police station to press our case .
The commander was a friendly , well - fed man with an impressive mustache and the terminal stage of a comb -over .
He asked a few questions about the theft and many more about the progress of our studies .
Eager to please , I told him a few Arabic jokes I had learned .
( " There 's this guy with a monkey , see .
Along comes a hash addict ... " )
When I finished , he sat stone - faced — then burst into thunderous laughter .
" I like this man ! " he bellowed , pinching my cheeks .
Sara would have taken a snapshot had our camera not also been stolen .
A few hours later , our computers were back , but it was n't the police who found them .
A friend had put us in touch with Bassel Al Hassan , apparently the one guy in Damascus who services Macs .
A few days later we shared a meal with Hassan , a soft - spoken man in his mid-thirties .
" Yours were the seventh and eighth stolen Macs I 've recovered , " he said .
" Nobody knows about Macs here .
A few other stores buy Macs , but eventually they all come to me , asking , Is it good ?
How much is it worth ? '
Then I check the serial numbers . "
When Hassan learned our laptops had been pilfered , he called about 20 computer shops .
" I did n't tell the owners I was looking for stolen computers , because then maybe they would n't buy them , " he said .
Soon Hassan got a call about two newly arrived Macs and hustled over to the shop .
He confirmed the computers were ours and told the store owner the machines were hot .
The proprietor , who had paid $ 200 for the pair , gave them back to us without taking a penny in exchange , sheepishly delivering them to us at a street corner in our neighborhood .
The only thing Hassan asked was permission to " friend " me on Facebook .
A few months later , after Sara and I returned to the US , I spoke with Hassan by phone .
He said that he had corralled another stolen Mac just weeks after rescuing ours .
From back here in the States , Hassan 's role as the Mac Avenger of Damascus seems improbable .
Except that I 'm writing this article on my recovered laptop .

Pseudo - Random vs. True Random
A Simple Visual Example
Once upon a time I stumbled across Random.org , an awesome true random number generation service .
The difference between true random number generators ( TRNGs ) and pseudo - random number generators ( PRNGs ) is that TRNGs use an unpredictable physical means to generate numbers ( like atmospheric noise ) , and PRNGs use mathematical algorithms ( completely computer - generated ) .
You can read more about this at Random.org and Wikipedia .
I was messing around with the Bitmap Generator , when I decided to create a pseudo - random generated bitmap of my own to compare .
And would n't you know it , the very first thing I tried showed a pattern !
Random.org Bitmap
PHP rand ( ) on Windows Bitmap
Yikes !
Not so " random " eh ?
Not many PRNGs will produce an obvious visual pattern like this , it just so happens to be a really bad combination of language ( PHP ) , operating system ( Windows ) , and function ( rand ( ) ) .
I ran the same code in a Linux environment , and it did not have an obvious visual pattern .
I also ran the same code again in Windows , but using PHP 's mt_rand ( ) function instead , which utilizes the Mersenne Twister to generate a better random number , and it did not have an obvious visual pattern .
If you want to know more about why this happens , read this .
Here 's the code I used to generate the bitmap :
<? php // Requires the GD Library header ( " Content - type : image / png " ) ; $ im = imagecreatetruecolor ( 512 , 512 ) or die ( " Cannot Initialize new GD image stream " ) ; $ white = imagecolorallocate ( $im , 255 , 255 , 255 ) ; for ( $y = 0 ; $y < 512 ; $ y++ ) { for ( $x = 0 ; $x < 512 ; $ x++ ) { if ( rand ( 0 , 1 ) ) { imagesetpixel ( $ im , $ x , $y , $ white ) ; } } } imagepng ( $ im ) ; imagedestroy ( $im ) ;
Basically , it 's the sort of thing you would n't need worry about with a true random number generator , unless somehow it 's security was breached ( a whole other topic really ) .
Pseudo - random number generators vary greatly in quality .
Some are horrible , some are extraordinary , but none are true .

Plouffe :
It 's still over
In a statement emailed to reporters , and reiterated on a conference call just now , Obama 's campaign Manager , David Plouffe , says :
It is clear that narrow popular vote wins in Texas and Ohio will do very little to improve their nearly impossible path to the nomination .
If they do not win Texas and Ohio by healthy double digit margins – and they led by healthy double digit margins as recently as two weeks ago - they will be facing almost impossible odds to reverse the delegate math .
" They were sitting on enormous leads as recently as two weeks ago , " he said on the call , dismissing the notion of a Clinton " comeback . "
" They keep moving the goal posts , but at some point you run out of field , " he said .

RE : The Real Meaning of March 4th
Clinton Chief Strategist Mark Penn : “ After March 4th , over 3000 delegates will be committed , and we project that Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama will be virtually tied with 611 delegates still to be chosen in Pennsylvania and other remaining states .
Again and again , this race has shown that it is voters and delegates who matter , not the pundits or perceived ‘ momentum . ’ ”
[ Mark Penn memo , 2/13/08 ]
Clinton aide Guy Cecil : " We think that at the end of the day on March 4 we will be within 25 delegates . ”
[ Politico , 2/13/08 ]
Howard Wolfson : “ I Think We Will Be Ahead In The Delegate Race After Texas And Ohio . ” [ Clinton campaign conference call , 2/11/08 ]
New York Times : “ Clinton advisers have said Mrs. Clinton must win the Texas and Ohio primaries by at least 10 percentage points if she has any hope of catching up with Mr. Obama in the delegate count , particularly because he has shown momentum recently at picking up support from elected officials who count as superdelegates . ”
[ NYT , 2/22/08 ]
-------------------------------------------
By their own clear definition of where they expected and believed they needed to be after Ohio and Texas , the Clinton campaign will fall terribly short on March 4th .
The Obama pledged delegate lead stands at 162 .
The question for the Clinton campaign if they do not significantly erode that lead on Tuesday is what plausible path they have to even up the pledged delegates in the remaining contests .
There are 611 pledged delegates left after March 4th ’s contests .
They would need to win at least 62 % of all remaining pledged delegates to get back to even .
And while they have often talked about Pennsylvania – where public polls show their lead deteriorating rapidly – the Wyoming caucuses on March 8th and Mississippi primary or March 11th could potentially result in more pledged delegates netted to the winner than on March 4th .
So it is clear that narrow popular vote wins in Texas and Ohio will do very little to improve their nearly impossible path to the nomination .
If they do not win Texas and Ohio by healthy double digit margins – and they led by healthy double digit margins as recently as two weeks ago - they will be facing almost impossible odds to reverse the delegate math .
While the Clintons gamely continue to try to move the goal posts , at some point there has to be a reckoning .
It is a very simple question – what is their path to secure the nomination ?
No amount of spin can change the math .
We look forward to their tortured answers on Wednesday morning .
The Clinton campaign has insisted that this is a race about delegates .
And we agree .
The tale of March 4th is not who wins what states but where the delegate battle stands after all the delegate yield for all four of these contests have been allocated .
The publisher of the best - selling Grand Theft Auto video games is suing the Chicago Transit Authority , accusing it of pulling the ads for the game 's latest installment and interfering with the company 's First Amendment right to freedom of speech .
Take - Two Interactive , which in addition to GTA IV also produced Manhunt , wants the CTA to put the ads back up and pay $ 300,000 in compensatory damages .
The lawsuit , filed in U.S. District Court in Manhattan , says the transit authority pulled the ads from buses and transit stops after a report by a Fox News affiliate that questioned why the ads were permitted after a wave of violent crimes in Chicago .
The GTA series of M-rated ( mature ) games have prompted a debate over the impact videogames have on children .
Grand Theft Auto : Vice City drew a lot of heat in 2003 amid questions whether it led Alabama minor , Devin Moore , to shoot two police officers and another person as he was being booked for suspicion of car theft .
His attorneys blamed
GTA : Vice City for the shooting , saying vehicle thefts and homicide are major themes of the game .
The judge did n't buy it and barred jurors from hearing any evidence linking the game to the case .
Gamers have snapped up about 6 million copies of GTA IV in the week since it came out , forking over more than $ 500 million .
The game sold 3.6 million copies on its first day , breaking the previous sales record held by Halo 3 .

Analysis
The Supreme Court ’s historic argument Tuesday on the meaning of the Constitution ’s Second Amendment sent out one quite clear signal : individuals may well wind up with a genuine right to have a gun for self - defense in their home .
But what was not similarly clear in the hearing on District of Columbia v. Heller ( 07-290 ) was what kind of gun that would entail , and thus what kind of limitations government could put on access or use of a weapon .
In an argument that ran 23 minutes beyond the allotted time , Justice Anthony M. Kennedy emerged as a fervent defender of the right of domestic self - defense .
At one key point , he suggested that the one Supreme Court precedent that at least hints that gun rights are tied to military not private needs — the 1939 decision in U.S. v. Miller — “ may be deficient ” in that respect .
“ Why does any of that have any real relevance to the situation that faces the homeowner today ? ” Kennedy asked rhetorically .
With Chief Justice John G. Roberts , Jr. , and Justices Samuel A. Alito , Jr. , and Antonin Scalia leaving little doubt that they favor an individual rights interpretation of the Amendment ( and with Justice Clarence Thomas , though silent on Tuesday , having intimated earlier that he may well be sympathetic to that view ) , Kennedy ’s inclinations might make him — once more — the holder of the deciding vote .
There also remained a chance , it appeared , that Justice Stephen G. Breyer , one of the Court ’s moderates , would be willing to support an individual right to have a gun — provided that a ruling left considerable room for government regulation of weapons , particularly in urban areas with high crime rates .
One of the most important aspects of the 98 - minute hearing was the steadfast commitment that the federal government ’s lawyer , Solicitor General Paul D. Clement , held to the position he had expressed in a brief that has come under heavy fire from inside the White House and from a wide swath of the gun-owning community .
Clement had written that , while there should be an individual , private right to have a gun in one ’s home , it should be subject to regulation by government that would not have to meet the strictest constitutional test .
At the podium , he several times repeated his criticism of the D.C. Circuit Court for raising a higher constitutional bar to gun regulation — even though his critics ( including Vice President Cheney ) passionately support exactly what the Circuit Court did in striking down the District of Columbia ’s 1976 ban on any private ownership or use of handguns .
If the Court were ultimately to rule that the Second Amendment ’s promise of a “ right to keep and bear arms ” embraces a personal , individual right of self - defense at least in one ’s home , it might also have to address what , if any , limits government might put on that right , and what constitutional standard to use in judging whether a particular law ’s limitations would be valid .
Thus , it was no surprise that many of the exchanges on Tuesday dwelled on both of those issues , with no sign of anything close to a consensus on the answers .
The Chief Justice , signaling that he would like to pare down the task the Court faces in deciding the case , told the Solicitor General : “ I wonder why in this case we have to articulate an all - encompassing standard .
Is n’t it enough to determine the scope of the existing right that the amendment refers to , look at the various regulations that were available at the time , including you ca n’t take the gun to the marketplace and all that , and determine how … this restriction and the scope of this right looks in relation to those ?
I ’m not sure why we have to articulate some very intricate standard . ”
Clement said it “ would be an improvement over the court of appeals ” if the Court were to decide the case “ very narrowly . ”
Again , as in his written brief , Clement voiced concern that the Circuit Court ruling might be understood to give individuals a right to have even a machinegun .
The Chief Justice , focusing on what he called the “ absolute ban ” in the District ’s law , countered that the city was not restricting machineguns so “ why would you think the opinion striking down an absolute ban would also apply to a narrow one … directly solely to machine guns ? ”
The Solicitor General countered that the government needed to worry about the implication of a strict Second Amendment limit on the gun right because of the possible changes in gun technology in the future , bringing new weapons under the Amendment ’s protection .
Because the current members of the Court had never taken part in a case testing the scope of the right laid out in the Second Amendment , it was not clear , going into the argument , where any of them ( with the possible exception of Justices Scalia and Thomas ) would stand on the question .
But the Chief Justice , Justice Kennedy and Justice Scalia moved in , in the very earliest stages of the argument , to lay out clear positions — at least on the collective vs. individual rights dispute .
Within seconds after the defender of the District law , Washington lawyer Walter Dellinger , laid out his general theory that the Amendment only guaranteed a “ militia - related ” right , the Chief Justice focused on the text of the Amendment and said “ If it is limited to state militias , why would they say ‘ the right of the people .
In other words , why would n’t they say ‘ state militias have the right to keep arms . ' ”
Kennedy soon joined in , saying the reference in the Amendment to the arms needs of the militia was simply a reaffirmation of the importance of having an organized militia ( as guaranteed by other provisions in the Constitution ) , but then the Framers went further an added an entirely separate right , “ a right to bear arms . ”
Scalia shortly got involved , saying “ why is n’t it perfectly plausible , indeed reasonable , to assume that since the Framers knew that the way militias were destroyed by tyrants in the past …by taking away the people ’s weapons … the two clauses go together beautifully :
Since we need a militia , the right to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed . ”
As the hearing moved on , it became more apparent that the kind of right Kennedy was supporting was one keyed entirely to the home , and its defense against intruders — beginning with people in the Founding era who lived in the wilderness , and had to fend off , say , Indians .
He referred to “ the remote settler ” seeking to “ defend himself and his family against hostile Indian tribes and outlaws , wolves and bears and grizzlies and things like that ? ”
And it also became clear that , in modern times , with high crime rates , individuals in their homes needed a dependable means of defense against urban intruders .
It took a little more time for Justice Alito to take part in the exchanges .
When he did , he definitely seemed on the individual rights side of the debate .
In fact , when Clement was at the podium , Alito commented : “ How could the District code provision survive any standard of review whee they totally ban the possession of the type of weapon that ’s most commonly used for self - defense… ? ”
The ideological dividing line among the Justices that is often apparent in major constitutional cases reemerged in this one .
Dellinger , in defending the city ’s version of the Amendment ’s meaning , had to fend off tough and sometimes hostile questions from the conservatives , while the lawyer speaking for the challengers — Alexandria VA attorney Alan Gura — was met with sometimes aggressive questioning from the liberals and moderates .
Justice John Paul Stevens , the leader of the moderate / liberal bloc , repeatedly returned to the notion that , at the time the Second Amendment was written in the Founding era , only two states ’ constitutions embraced an individual right to have a gun for self - defense .
The other members of that bloc , including Justice Breyer , spent much of their time pressing for clarity on whether a ban on handguns would actually interfere with a right of self - defense , since they suggested — as does the city government — that the city has no objection to maintaining a useable rifle or shotgun within the home .
But Gura regularly countered that argument with his interpretation that , aside from the handgun ban , the District law ’s requirements of disassembly or locked triggers on rifles and shotguns in the home would deprive the residents of having any functional firearm .
Gura , as he went along , made some concessions that seemed less than supportive of his basic argument .
He got into a difficult exchange with Justice Stevens , for example , over his agreement that the militia language in the Second Amendment did have some role to play in defining the right .
As soon as he offered that agreement , the Chief Justice pounced , suggesting that it would limit gun rights of people who had nothing to do with the military but who may have a need for a gun .
Justice Kennedy came to Gura ’s rescue , suggesting that the militia language was put there simply to reaffirm the Constitution ’s allocation elsewhere of power over the militia .
And Kennedy moved in to nail down his basic view of the Amendment , saying to Gura : “ I want to know whether or not , in your view , the operative clause of he amendment protects , was designed to protect in an earlier time , the settler in the wilderness and his right to have a gun against some conceivable Federal enactment which would prohibit him from having any guns ? ”
Gura readily replied : “ Oh , yes . ”
Breyer also made use of Gura ’s time at the podium to shore up the Justice ’s apparent embrace of the concept that , if there is a personal right , it should be subjected to “ reasonable regulation . ”
A ban on handguns , Breyer indicated , might meet that test , if an individual had a right to use other weapons .
Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg and David H. Souter , while less active than their colleagues , were quite clearly on the District of Columbia ’s side .
The argument , taken as a whole , revealed a Court ready — perhaps somewhat eager — to confront and decide the core question of the Second Amendment ’s meaning .
No one on the Court seemed interested in the District of Columbia ’s backuip argument — that the Second Amendment simply does not apply to the District as the federal capital city .
There also was no interest expressed in an issue that is only implicitly involved : whether , if there is an individual right , it would be applied to state and local governments through incorporation into the Fourteenth Amendment ’s protection of due process against state action .
The popular BitTorrent site Mininova is currently Beta testing BitTorrent powered video streaming .
The new streaming feature allows users to watch videos instantly , streamed from . torrent files .
The new feature will be integrated into the featured torrents section , which lists all the distributors taking part in Mininova ’s content distribution platform .
The Open Source “ swarmplayer ” which is used for the video streaming service is developed in collaboration with the Tribler team from the Technical University Delft and Free University Amsterdam .
Tribler is also working together with the BBC and several other European broadcasters , and they recently received a $ 22 million grant for P2P research from the European Union .
The swarmplayer has also been demonstrated for a 100 + audience of media industry insiders in Geneva at the European Broadcaster Union event on Open Internet TV this week .
The streaming magic comes from replacing the tit - for - tat algorithm with Give - to - Get .
Tribler project leader Johan Pouwelse stated after his keynote speech at the conference : “ the attitude of several key media stakeholders in Europe are shifting and they are now exploring P2P on a serious scale . ”
Mininova is still looking for people to test the streaming service , as Erik writes : “ We are looking for people who would like to be in the first testing group who test the software , report suggestions and bugs you find .
Please reply in this topic if you want to participate in this closed beta . ”
Mininova already has a music streaming feature for their content distribution platform , based on the Java applet developed by Bitlet .
The site currently has over 300 premium publishers , and Mininova ’s CEO Niek told Torrent Freak last month that they will focus on extending and improving their content distribution service .
“ Publishers will see more distribution options in the near future , and users will be able to find featured content easier .
Our plan is to offer the most sophisticated and scalable distribution service of the future .
Functionality of “ regular ” torrent files will of course be kept as it is now . ”
Over the past months we have seen more and more P2P streaming alternatives .
One of the main problems seems to be that it is practically impossible to make a high quality video streaming service profitable because of the immense bandwidth costs but P2P streaming solves this problem .
BEIJING ( Reuters ) - China on Tuesday condemned the disruption of the Olympic torch relay in London and Paris , vowing it would not impede the Olympic spirit .
Officials in Paris on Monday were forced to extinguish the Olympic flame and carry it by bus when anti-China protesters tried to seize it .
During the British leg the day before , activists waving Tibetan flags and shouting “ Shame on China ” turned the event into an obstacle course .
“ We express our strong condemnation of the deliberate disruption of the Olympic torch relay by ‘ Tibetan independence ’ separatist forces , who gave no thought to the Olympic spirit or the laws of Britain and France , ” Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Jiang
Yu said in a statement posted at www.fmprc.gov.cn.
“ Their despicable activities tarnish the lofty Olympic spirit . ”
China had hoped the Olympic torch relay would by a symbol of unity in the run-up to the Games , which open in Beijing on August 8 and which are a source of immense national pride .

Instead , the torch has become a lightning rod for protesters advocating Tibetan independence from Chinese Communist rule , as well as other causes , following a wave of unrest throughout China ’s Tibetan regions .
Jiang also took issue with reports that said officials in Paris were forced to extinguish the flame , saying the relay was temporarily changed there to safeguard the security of the torch .
“ The reports by foreign media are false in claiming that the Olympic torch was forced to be extinguished during its relay in Pais , ” she said .
The torch heads to San Francisco on Wednesday , where it is expected to face continued obstacles .

The Washington Post this weekend reported an off - the - record meeting that President Bush had at the White House with various pundits , where he predicted that Hillary Clinton will be the next President .
Bush is shaping his legacy , said the Post , and is planning to make it feasible for his successor to keep us in Iraq .
It ’s a sharp contrast with Hillary ’s support among Democratic voters , who think she ’s more likely to get us out of Iraq and are more likely to view her as “ liberal ” than John Edwards or Barack Obama .
But if you parse Hillary ’s statements , she has left enough wiggle room for a Clinton Administration to stay in Iraq for a while .
It is easy to dismiss Bush ’s talk as delusional , but in recent years Hillary ’s husband has developed a close personal friendship with the elder President George Bush as if 1992 never happened – suggesting a stronger tie between the two political families than one might imagine .
Last week , Bush invited top Beltway pundits – including ABC ’s George Stephanopoulos – to the White House for a casual discussion .
The media were told not to directly quote the President , but they could repeat what transpired in the talks .
“ Bush made no explicit election predictions , ” reported the Post , “ but clearly thought Clinton would win the Democratic nomination and talked in a way that seemed to suggest he expects her to succeed him – and will continue his Iraq policy if she does . ”
That certainly flies in the face of how Democrats generally perceive Hillary Clinton – who has held a steady lead for the presidential nomination .
Despite her initial support for the War , her refusal to apologize , and her late support for withdrawal , Democrats by a 2 - 1 margin think that she is more likely to get us out of Iraq .
Clinton also pledged on yesterday ’s “ Meet the Press ” that she will oppose further funding of the War as the Senate votes in the coming weeks .
But take a closer look at what Hillary says , and it is not certain what her plans would be about getting us out .
Like the other candidates , she is crystal clear about saying she would begin withdrawal – but is vague about when all of our troops would come home .
She promised on yesterday ’s “ Meet the Press ” to “ end our involvement ” in Iraq , but qualified it “ at the level that we ’ve seen . ”
Clinton would have fewer troops than what we have right now , but her words imply keeping a residual force for an undetermined period of time .
Which is really not that different from what Bush – who has taken initial steps towards reducing the surge – told the Beltway reporters .
“ He indicated that he wants to use his final 16 months to stabilize Iraq enough , ” said the Post , “ and redefine the U.S. mission there so that the next president would feel politically able to keep a smaller but long - term presence in the country . ”
According to Stephanopoulos , Bush analogized himself with Harry Truman and Hillary to Dwight Eisenhower .
“ He believes that whoever replaces him , ” said Stephanopoulos , “ like General Eisenhower when he replaced Truman , may criticize the president ’s policy during the campaign but will likely continue much of it in office . ”
Hillary may talk tough on the campaign trail when attacking Bush ’s Iraq policy , but when she becomes President will hesitate to withdraw our forces .
All of this sounds like farcical ramblings of a lame duck President , but Stephanopoulos recounted the analogy yesterday when he had Hillary Clinton on his TV show .
Rather than deny it , Hillary replied that she would “ likely continue a presence in Iraq ” to fight Al - Qaeda , protect civilian employees and the U.S. embassy , train the Iraqi army , and protect the Kurds .
When Stephanopoulos asked her to pledge that all U.S. troops would be out of Iraq by the end of her first term , Clinton refused .
While Bush believes that Hillary will succeed him and continue the occupation of Iraq , Bill Clinton – who would be the most powerful and influential presidential spouse in history – has cultivated a close relationship with the elder George Bush , a man he defeated in 1992 .
“ They have come to consider each other to be family , ” reported the New York Times , “ spending time golfing , boating and kibitzing about foreign policy . ”
This is not just an instance of two elder statesmen who bury the hatchet after retiring from public life .
As the Times reported , the Bush - Clinton alliance has only one historical precedent – John Adams and Thomas Jefferson , who became friends after running against each other in the 1800 election .
You did not see Franklin Roosevelt and Herbert Hoover becoming close friends after their rivalry , or Jimmy Carter and Ronald Reagan .
Other pundits have observed the growing alliance between Bush and Clinton – as if the 1992 election , which repudiated the trickle - down economics of the Reagan - Bush era , is now a distant memory in the minds of these two Presidents .
Bush Senior is concerned about his son ’s legacy , and Clinton wants to lay the groundwork for his wife ’s political future .
With Bill Clinton ’s influence as President Hillary ’s husband , progressives have reason to be worried .
While John Edwards and Barack Obama stake out more progressive positions on Iraq than Hillary , a Rasmussen poll shows that a higher number of Democrats view Clinton as “ liberal . ”
With Bush predicting that Hillary will keep us in Iraq , and Bill keeping close ties with the Bush family , what reason do these voters have to view Hillary as “ liberal ” – besides mere perception ?
But in politics , where most voters rely on low levels of information , “ perception ” can soon become “ reality . ”
It does n’t matter what the truth really says , as long as a certain line gets repeated so that it becomes accepted lore .
Despite warning signs of what she would do with Iraq , Hillary could still win the Democratic nomination as the “ liberal ” candidate .

The US Supreme Court has just dealt a serious blow to voters ' rights that could help put John McCain in the White House by eliminating tens of thousands of voters who generally vote Democratic .
By 6 - 3 the Court has upheld an Indiana law that requires citizens to present a photo identification card in order to vote .
Florida , Michigan , Louisiana , Georgia , Hawaii and South Dakota have similar laws .
Though it 's unlikely , as many as two dozen other states could add them by election day .
Other states , like Ohio , have less stringent ID requirements than Indiana 's , but still have certain restrictions that are strongly opposed by voter rights advocates .
The decision turns back two centuries of jurisprudence that has accepted a registered voter 's signature as sufficient identification for casting a ballot .
By matching that signature against one given at registration , and with harsh penalties for ballot stuffing , the Justices confirmed in their lead opinion that there is " no evidence " for the kind of widespread voter fraud Republican partisans have used to justify the demand for photo ID .
Voting rights activists have long argued that since photo ID can cost money , or may demand expensive trips to government agencies , the requirement constitutes a " poll tax . "
Taxes on the right to vote were used for a century to prevent blacks and others from voting in the south and elsewhere .
They were specifically banned by the 24th Amendment to the Constitution , ratified in 1964 .
But the Court 's lead opinion , written by Justice Stevens , normally a liberal , said that though rare , the " risk of voter fraud " was nonetheless " real " and that there was " no question about the legitimacy or importance of the state 's interest in counting only the votes of eligible voters . "
The burden of obtaining a voter ID , said the court , was not so difficult as to be deemed unConstitutional .
Ohio election protection Attorney Cliff Arnebeck believes Stevens joined the decision to divide the Court 's conservative majority , and to leave the door open for further litigation .
But there is no indication the corporate media or Democratic Party will be pursuing significant action on this issue any time soon .
Though the Kerry Campaign solicited millions of dollars to " protect the vote " in 2004 , it has not supported independent research into that election 's irregularities .
In the King - Lincoln Civil Rights lawsuit , in which we are attorney and plaintiff , 56 of Ohio's 88 counties destroyed ballot materials , in direct violation of federal law .
There has been no official legal follow - up on this case , no major media investigation , and no support from the Democratic Party either to investigate what happened in Ohio 2004 , or to make sure it does n't happen again in 2008 .
The issue has yet to be seriously raised by the major Democratic candidates despite the fact that it could render their campaigns moot .
This latest Supreme Court decision is yet another serious blow to voting rights advocates --- and probably to the Democratic nominees for President and other offices .
It will clearly make it far more difficult for poor , minority , elderly and young citizens to vote .
Tens of thousands of normally Democratic voters in key states --- especially Florida , Michigan , Georgia and Louisiana --- will simply be prevented from getting a ballot .
The Brennan Center for Justice at New York University 's School of Law in its " Friend of the Court " brief noted that between 10 % and 13 % of eligible voters lack the identification now required in Indiana .
People without an official photo ID tend to be disproportionately minorities and poor , ushering a new Jim Crow era based on race and class apartheid .
One Indiana study , according to Inter Press Service reporter Jim Lobe , found that 13.3 % of registered Indiana voters lacked the now - required ID , but the numbers were significantly higher for black voters at 18 % and young voters age 18 - 34 at more than 20 % .
Kathryn Kolbert , President of People for the American Way , put the number at " millions of eligible voters who do n't have the ID these laws require .
" Photo ID has long been a lynchpin of a concerted GOP strategy to eliminate Democratic voters .
In the wake of the theft of the 2004 election in Ohio , Republican activists produced heavily publicized allegations of massive voter fraud , virtually all of which proved to be false .
Nonetheless , the drumbeat for restrictive ID requirements has been steadily rising from GOP strongholds .
Other such laws are now virtually certain to follow in states with Republican - controlled legislatures , though it 's unclear how many more can be put into law by November .
Nor has the GOP let up in its other campaigns to restrict access to the polls .
Extremely harsh limitations on voter registration campaigns in Florida have severely restricted attempts by the League of Women Voters and others to sign up new voters .
GOP election officials also have made it clear they will severely restrict the franchise of those who have minor irregularities in the registration forms , such as an errant middle initial or changed address .
It is also unclear how many electronic voting machines will still be in place come November .
Despite a wide range of high - level studies showing them easily hackable , the elimination of touch screen voting machines has proceeded at a glacial pace .
No significant federal legislation has been passed to eliminate electronic voting machines or even to make them more secure .
With a few exceptions , most notably Florida , progress at the state level has been minimal .
Thus the GOP hope that millions of Americans will be voting on hackable computers this November , and that millions more may be eliminated from the rolls altogether , seems very close to fruition .
Whether this will swing the election to John McCain remains to be seen .
But this Supreme Court decision allowing the demand for photo ID makes it much more likely .

Instead Mrs. Clinton darkened that cloud by claiming that she was fooled by the prewar intelligence that did n’t dupe nearly half her Democratic Senate colleagues , including Bob Graham , Teddy Kennedy and Carl Levin .
Even worse , she repeatedly pretends that she did n’t know President Bush would regard a bill titled “ Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Iraq Resolution of 2002 ” as an authorization to go to war .
No one believes this spin for the simple reason that no one believes Mrs. Clinton is an idiot .
Her patently bogus explanations for her vote have in the end done far more damage to her credibility than the vote itself .
That she has never given a forthright speech on Iraq is what can happen when your chief campaign strategist is a pollster .
Focus groups no doubt say it would be hara - kiri for her to admit such a failing .
But surely many Americans would have applauded her for confessing to mistakes and saying what she learned from them .
As her husband could have told her , that ’s best done sooner rather than later .
It ’s too late now , and so the Democratic stars are rapidly aligning for disaster .
Mrs. Clinton is no longer trying to overcome Mr. Obama ’s lead in the popular vote and among pledged delegates by making bold statements about Iraq or any other issue .
Instead of enhancing her own case for the presidency , she ’s going to tear him down .
As Adam Nagourney of The New York Times delicately put it last week , she is “ looking for some development to shake confidence in Mr. Obama ” so that she can win over superdelegates in covert 3 a.m. phone calls .
If Mr. Wright does n’t do it , she ’ll seek another weapon .
Mr. Obama , who is , after all , a politician and not a deity , could well respond in kind .
For Republicans , the prospect of marathon Democratic trench warfare is an Easter miracle .
Saddled with the legacy of both Iraq and a cratering economy , the G.O.P. can only rejoice at its opponents ’ talent for self - destruction .
The Republicans can also count on the help of a political press that , whatever its supposed tilt toward Mr. Obama , remains most benevolent toward John McCain .

This was strikingly apparent last week , when Mr. McCain ’s calamitous behavior was relegated to sideshow status by many , if not most , news media .
At a time of serious peril for America , the G.O.P. ’s presumptive presidential nominee revealed himself to be alarmingly out of touch on both of the most pressing issues roiling the country .
Never mind that Bear Stearns was disposed of in a fire sale , the dollar was collapsing , job losses hit a five - year high , and the price of oil hit an all - time high .
Mr. McCain , arriving in Iraq , went AWOL on capitalism ’s meltdown , delegating his economic adviser to release an anodyne two - sentence statement of confidence in Ben Bernanke .

According to BBC television , AFP is reporting that Mahdi Army militiamen killed 2 US troops in northern Baghdad on Wednesday morning .
US Secretary of Defense Robert M. Gates admitted on Tuesday that the reduction in US troop casualties in recent months had ended in the past few weeks , because of the fighting in Sadr City in the capital .
Over 40 US troops have been killed in April .
Gates also brandished a second aircraft carrier in the Persian Gulf at Iran , which the US accuses of supplying the Mahdi Army with arms that are used against US troops .
Recent US press reporting in the New York Times and elsewhere has raised questions about the allegation .
Sadr spokesman Salah al - Obeidi ( al - Ubaydi ) in Najaf bitterly attacked Iran , accusing it of seeking to share with the US in influence over Iraq .
He pointed to the Iranian ’s regime ’s failure to condemn the long - term mutual security agreement being crafted by the Bush administration and the al - Maliki government .
Al - Obeidi ’s angry denunciation suggests that Iran is backing PM Nuri al - Maliki and his current chief ally , the Islamic Supreme Council of Iraq led by Abdul Aziz al - Hakim against the Sadr Movement of Muqtada al - Sadr .
The sandstorm continued in Baghdad on Tuesday , and so did the fierce fighting between the US military and the Shiite Mahdi Army ( paramilitary of the Sadr Movement ) , leaving 37 dead and 6 US soldiers wounded .
The dead were said to include 9 civilians , including 3 women and a child .
The sandstorm was an essential context for the fighting , since it prevented the US from deploying helicopter gunships and so left a ground patrol vulnerable to militia attack .
The Mahdi Army was apparently attempting to prevent further US wall - building in the Shiite slum .
Snipers also shot at US troops from rooftops .
It is hard to believe that such complex assaults ( involving a combination of ambush , small arms , and roadside bombs ) are still going on after 5 years of US military occupation of the capital .
AFP reports :
‘ Several rockets or mortar rounds . . . struck the Iraqi capital ’s heavily fortified government compound , as militants took advantage of the absence of US air cover during the storm , witnesses said .
In one of the most intense firefights in weeks , the American soldiers killed 28 militants in Sadr City , stronghold of anti-American cleric Moqtada al - Sadr , the military said .
Four US soldiers were also wounded in the fighting that began at around 9:30 am ( 0630 GMT ) .
The fighting erupted when a US patrol was targeted with small - arms fire that wounded one soldier , Lieutenant Colonel Steven Stover told AFP .
As the soldier was being evacuated , a US vehicle was struck by two roadside bombs , small - arms fire and rocket - propelled grenades .
The “ complex ” attack damaged the vehicle and wounded three other soldiers , Stover said , adding that another US vehicle was later damaged by a third roadside bomb .
The US military said its soldiers defended themselves and “ killed 28 militants in a four - hour ” battle .
Residents said US forces also launched two air strikes in the area which heavily damaged four houses .
Pictures taken by an AFP photographer showed a number of bodies buried under the debris of the four houses .
But Stover denied that aircraft had been used .
The sandstorm had largely grounded US helicopters .
Instead he said US troops used heavy rockets against the militants . ’
It is now being revealed that on Monday , “ Shi’ite militants hit a U.S. military station in southern Sadr City with explosive canisters , badly damaging a tactical operations center and injuring 15 troops . ”
Up in the oil city of Kirkuk , the focus of competition between Kurdish Peshmerga on the one hand and Arab and Turkmen guerrillas on the other , “ around the oil city of Kirkuk four people were killed and 15 wounded in two bomb attacks . ”

The nation 's food supply may soon be under significant threat as the result of a Bush administration decision to move its research on one of the most contagious animal diseases from an isolated island laboratory to the U.S. mainland , placing it near herds of livestock .
According to an April 11th Associated Press article by Larry Margasak , concerns about a catastrophic outbreak of hoof and mouth disease have prompted Congressional Democrats to demand internal documents they believe highlight the risks and consequences of this decision .
An epidemic of this dreaded disease could devastate the livestock industry .
Lawmakers have already received one such report from the Homeland Security Department , which combines commercial satellite images and federal farm data to reveal the proximity to livestock herds of the five locations under consideration for the new lab .
The numbers of livestock in the counties and surrounding areas of the locations under consideration range from 132,900 at the site near Atlanta , Georgia , to 542,507 at the site near Manhattan , Kansas .
Research on diseases that can be transferred from animals to humans will be included at this new laboratory , the National Bio- and - Agro- Defense Facility .
The rationale for the new laboratory is that the current facility , in Plum Island , does not have the security in place for this higher - level usage .
The Department of Agriculture ran the Plum Island lab until 2003 , when it was turned over to the Homeland Security Department because preventing an outbreak has become part of the nation 's biological defense program .
Other locations being considered are Butner , N.C. ; San Antonio , Tx ; and Flora , Miss .
Although rarely a threat to humans , hoof - and - mouth virus is deadly to animals .
It can be transported on workers breath , clothes , or vehicles when they leave the lab .
It is so contagious that it has been confined to Plum , Island , New York for over 50 years where it is far from commercial livestock .
The current location , 100 miles northeast of New York City in the Long Island Sound , is accessible only by ferry or helicopter .
Plum Island researchers work on detection of disease , epidemic control strategies , vaccines and drugs , tests of imported animals , and training of professionals .
Researchers who work with the live virus are not permitted to own susceptible animals at their homes , and they are required to wait at least a week before attending outside events where such animals might be encountered , such as circuses or rodeos .
According to the article , a simulated outbreak of the disease was part of a 2002 government exercise called .
" It ended with fictional riots in the streets after the simulation 's National Guardsmen were ordered to kill tens of millions of farm animals , so many that troops ran out of bullets . "
The government said it would have been forced to dig a ditch 25 miles long in Kansas to bury the carcasses .
Senator Pat Roberts , R - Kan. portrayed the president in the simulation , and recalls what a mess it was .
Nevertheless , he now supports moving the government 's new lab to his state , because " It will mean jobs " and spur research and development , he says .
An epidemic of the disease in 2001 produced devastation to Britain 's livestock industry , and resulted in the government slaughter of 6 million sheep , cows and pigs .
A less serious outbreak last year was thought to have been caused by viral contamination from a site shared by a government research center and a vaccine maker .
Other recent outbreaks occurred in Taiwan and China .
Diseased animals weaken and lose weight .
Milk cows stop producing and remain highly infectious , even if they survive the virus .
If evidence in a single cow suggests an outbreak in the U.S. , emergency plans call for the government to immediately shut down all exports and movement of livestock .
Herds would be quarantined , and controlled slaughter would begin to help halt the spread of the disease .
Although the British outbreak indicated that the virus can escape from a modern day facility and wreak economic havoc , the Bush administration supports belief that modern laboratory safety rules are adequate to prevent an outbreak .
The Homeland Security Department is also convinced that it can operate a lab on the mainland safely , citing improved containment procedures at high - security labs .
The former director of the aging Plum Island Animal Disease Center , Dr. Roger Breeze , says that research ought to be kept away from cattle populations and , ideally , placed where the public has already accepted this type of research .
If the government is unwilling to expand and update the Plum Island site , he suggests the location of the facility at the Atlanta campus of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , or at Fort Detrick in Frederick , Md. , the location of the U.S. Army Medical Research Institute for infectious diseases .
Another possibility he suggests is on Long Island , where there is no commercial livestock industry , and where most of the current Plum Island employees could be retained .
When asked about the administration 's choice of sites near livestock , Breeze says , " It seems a little odd .
It goes against the ... safety program of the last 50 years .
" The last outbreak of hoof - and - mouth disease on the U.S. mainland was in 1929 .
" The horrific prospect of exterminating potentially millions of animals is not something this country 's ready for , " says Dr. Floyd Horn , former head of the U.S. Agriculture Department 's Agricultural Research Service .
Leaders of the House Energy and Commerce Committee also express worry about a move to the mainland .
Rep. John Dingle , D - Mich , chairman of the committee , and Rep. Bart Stupak , D - Mich , have threatened to subpoena records they claim Homeland Security is withholding from Congressional inspection .
Of particular interest are the reports about , an internal review of a 1978 release of hoof - and - mouth disease on Plum Island , and reports about releases of the virus on the island during the past century .
If these reports are not turned over as requested , the committee leaders warned in a letter to Homeland Security Secretary , Chertoff , they will vote to issue a congressional subpoena .
Cattle farmers and residents are divided over the proposal .
Community activist , Grady
Thrasher is worried about an outbreak from a research lab , and has started a petition drive against moving the lab to Georgia , citing the great risks involved .
" There 's no way you can balance that equation by putting this in the middle of a community where it will do the most harm , " Thrasher said .
" The community is now aroused , so I think we have a majority against this .

Unexpectedly Intriguing !
Today , we 're going to redefine the way you look at health care spending among the nations of the world .
We 're going to start by looking at the total Health Expenditures per Capita across the member nations of the Organisation of Economic Co-operation and Development ( OECD ) against their Gross Domestic Product per Capita , adjusted for Purchasing Power Parity , for 2005 :
The chart above presents the data with a linear regression to show the traditional correlation between national economic output and health care spending .
In it , we see that the United States appears to spend a disproportionate amount of money upon health care , especially as compared to the other member nations of the OECD .
Since many of the other OECD nations have national health care programs , it is often argued that the lack of such a comprehensive program in the United States accounts for the reason why its health care expenditures are so disproportionate with respect to its economic output per capita compared to those other nations .
Advocates for such a program frequently cite this disparity as a reason why a universal health care program should be enacted in the U.S. , where presently , such spending is comparatively unconstrained with respect to other nations of the world .
What 's Wrong with That ?
The problem with this view is that the analysis upon which it is based is flawed .
For any comparative analysis to be valid , care must be taken to ensure that the fundamental units behind the analysis are directly comparable .
Where a comparison between the United States and the other member nations of the OECD is involved , that means we must consider the size of the economic output of each nation , the total health expenditures for each , and the size of their populations .
Our following chart shows the total GDP ( adjusted for PPP ) for the member nations of the OECD for 2005 , ranking the nations from low to high according to their 2005 GDP ( PPP ) :
The next chart shows the total public and private Health Expenditures ( adjusted for PPP ) for the OECD nations .
We obtained these figures by multiplying the 2005 Health Expenditures per Capita ( from above ) by the Population for each nation for that year .
Again , the nations are ranked from low to high according to their 2005 GDP ( PPP ) :
The third chart shows the total Population for the member nations of the OECD .
As with the other two charts , the nations are ranked according to their 2005 GDP ( PPP ) :
What all three of these charts demonstrate is that the United States ' economic output , health expenditures and population all completely dwarf those of the other nations , often by several orders of magnitude .
These factors alone make nation - to - nation comparisons dicey at best , and outright misleading at worst .
It would be more valid to compare individual states within the United States against many , if not all , of the other OECD member nations .
A Better Comparison
So , why do n't we do that ?
After all , it has been observed that the economic output of each of the U.S. states is comparable to that of other nations .
Comparisons between the populations of individual U.S. states and OECD nations would certainly be more consistent .
It also makes sense in how the government health care programs that the United States does have are administered .
Here , while the U.S. does not have a universal health care program covering its entire population , it does have several large - scale national health care programs , such as Medicare for the elderly , Medicaid for the poor , and the State Children 's Health Insurance Program ( SCHIP ) ( originally intended for poor children but being expanded to include children whose families can easily afford health care ) , among others .
Many of these programs are administered at the state government level , which helps make a U.S. state to OECD nation comparison of more valid .
Our next chart takes our first chart showing the 2005 OECD Nations ' Health Care Expenditures per Capita vs GDP ( PPP ) per Capita , and simply adds some fifty data points for the individual U.S. states ( see Note 1 for a discussion of how we found these figures for 2005 ) :
We can see from this chart that the linear regression no longer does such a good job in describing the relationship between total health expenditures per capita and GDP ( PPP ) per capita for the set of data .
We next sorted all our individual U.S. state and OECD member nation data from low to high on the basis of their GDP ( PPP ) per capita and used ZunZun 's 2 - D function finder to find a better regression model .
We selected a sigmoid with offset function as being the best fit for the data , which we 've shown in the chart below ( we 've also identified a number of the individual U.S. states in the chart , as well ) :
Our tool below takes the formulation we found for our sigmoid regression model and provides the corresponding expected level of health expenditures for a given level of GDP ( PPP ) :
GDP per Capita Data Input Data Values Gross Domestic Product per Capita ( $ USD )
Health Care Spending Data Calculated Results Values Total Health Care Expenditures per Capita ( $ USD )
We believe the sigmoid regression model provides a significantly better representation of the relationship between health care expenditures and economic output .
While built from empirical data , it has an advantage over the linear regression model in that it better agrees with established economic theory .
The main weakness of the linear regression model is that it assumes that with increasing economic output ( or income ) , increasing health care expenditures will result .
The problem with this model however is that it also assumes that there are no diminishing returns to additional health expenditures .
The economic " law " of diminishing marginal utility suggests that there is a limit to how much additional benefit an individual or a population may receive from additional spending for health care .
After a certain point , it 's not worth spending more for additional health care because you 're not getting the same bang for the buck .
These diminishing returns are reflected in the sigmoid regression model we 've illustrated above .
Instead of health expenditures forever escalating with increasing economic output ( or national income ) , we instead find that amount of expected health expenditures for a given level of GDP ( PPP ) follows an S - shaped curve , one that rises with growing GDP ( PPP ) at the low range and transitions to a relatively fixed level at higher ranges of GDP ( PPP ) , corresponding with the diminishing returns one should expect from additional health care spending .
Coming Soon
We 'll discuss what this relationship really means for the U.S. and the nations of the world .
A quick preview : the United States is , collectively , spending about as much as we should expect on health care with respect to its economic output .
Nations with long established universal health care programs are , in effect , achieving their lower expenditures by suppressing the amount of health care their populations may receive below the more natural , unconstrained levels that we see in nations without such established national health care programs .
Notes
[ 1 ] Total health expenditures may be found by adding Personal Health Care Expenditures with the expenditures associated with government program administration , public health programs and investments .
We were only able to find a projected value of Personal Health Care Expenditures of 1.6778 trillion US dollars for 2005 from Table 125 of the U.S. Census Bureau 's 2007 Statistical Abstract of the United States , so we had to estimate this component for each of the states for 2005 .
We did this by extracting the Personal Health Care Expenditures by State for 2004 , which provided this component of the Total Health Care Expenditures for all 50 states and the U.S. as a whole .
We found the percentage of each state 's personal health expenditures with respect to that of the entire U.S.
We then assumed that these percentages from 2004 would be relatively unchanged in 2005 , and multiplied these percentages by the $ 1.6778 trillion projected national personal health expenditures we found earlier to approximate the state personal health expenditures .
We then divided all these figures by the populations of each state to find the Personal Health Expenditures per Capita for each of the states .
We next took the OECD 's projected value of U.S. total health expenditures per capita for 2005 of $ 6,401 and divided it by the U.S. personal health expenditures per capita of $ 5,660.40 ( this figure is obtained by dividing the $ ,6778 trillion personal health expenditures by the 2005 U.S. population estimate of 296,410,404 ) .
This gives us a multiplication factor of 1.131 , which represents the portion of total health expenditures associated with government program administration , public health programs and investments .
These costs were distributed among all the states by multiplying this factor by each state 's estimated Personal Health Expenditures per Capita for 2005 , thereby providing our estimate of the Total Health Expenditures per Capita for each individual state in the U.S .

Google co-founder Larry Page claims that science has a serious marketing problem , and yet his own company 's news service heavily emphasizes consumer products and video games rather than educational material .
As I write this , the sci / tech section of Google News is loaded with the stories about iMac upgrades and Grand Theft Auto , but not a single science article is in sight .
Unfortunately , the search and ads company may be simply giving the public what it wants : product reviews to drool over .
From my point of view , this is absolutely terrifying :
Our society has an unhealthy preoccupation with gadgets and other shallow distractions .
By depriving the public of science news , and showing mostly meaningless product stories in its place , Google is contributing to the epic case of materialism and scientific illiteracy that plagues the developed world .
Do you agree that there is a problem and Google News is a part of it ?
Despite Party Designation on Provisional Ballot Envelopes , an Estimated 10 to 15,000 Democratic Votes Cast by Validated , Non-Partisan Registered Voters from ' Super Tuesday ' Primary May be Uncountable by Registrar 's New ' Supplemental Counting ' Scheme ...
Brad Friedman Byon 2/29/2008 , 4:57 pm PT
I spent most of yesterday and today on the phone with attorneys and officials trying to sort out the continuing , disastrous mess concerning the " Double Bubble " ballot fiasco from Los Angeles County 's February 5th Democratic Primary .
That , despite what we see as this week 's premature declaration of " Victory ! " on Tuesday from our friends at the Courage Campaign , followed by their " We won ! " email on Wednesday , as they celebrated after the county 's acting Registrar announced his plan to count some ( though by no means all ) of the 50,000 or so still - uncounted ballots cast by Non-Partisan ( NP ) voters who had attempted to vote in the open Democratic Primary on " Super Tuesday . "
During a late - night phone call from a local Election Integrity advocate last night , however , I was told that situation is even worse than previously reported or even known --- even by the county 's elections officials --- to date , as another set of thousands of legal ballots may go uncounted , even under a new tabulating scheme being implemented by county officials ...
Judy Alter , President of ProtectCaliforniaBallots.org , has been spending her days at the county 's central tabulating office in Norwalk over the last several weeks since the election , observing tabulation , and working closely with the managers and technicians overseeing the ballot counting .
She told me last night that there are thousands of validated provisional ballots cast by NP voters , which include a selection for a candidate in the open Democratic or American Independent Party Primaries , but which will remain uncounted according to the new counting scheme [ PDF ] announced this week by acting Registrar Dean Logan .
On Wednesday , I reported on the problems with the partial , unfair - to - candidates , " supplemental " counting scheme proposed by Logan , along with my solution to the problem which would count nearly all of the so - far uncounted ballots , 100 % accurately , and in accordance with provisions of both the California election code and its Constitution .
Though my suggestions have been ignored by officials to date , Logan is set to begin the " supplemental count , " according to his currently proposed scheme , on Saturday morning .
Alter , however , reports that a set of ballots , from among an estimated 10 to 15,000 currently uncounted NP provisional ballots , will also not be counted by the county 's new tabulating scheme .
That despite the fact , Alter says , that the original provisional ballot envelopes specify on them whether the NP voters were attempting to vote in either the Democratic or American Independent Party primary .
Logan is set to begin his " supplemental count " of all of the NP ballots which went uncounted previously , tomorrow .
Those ballots --- an estimated 50,000 of them --- had valid selections in the Presidential race , but no selection in a second bubble on the ballot used to specify which party , Democratic or American Independent , the voter was intending to vote in .
Due to the absurd ballot design implemented by the former Registrar Conny McCormack , who quit her post as the chief Election Official for the nation 's most populous county just one month prior to election day , it was impossible for the county 's optical - scan computers to read the Presidential selections on those NP ballots correctly , given that a number of the bubbles for Presidential candidate overlapped for each party 's candidates .
If neither the # 5 or # 6 bubble was filled in on the ballot , specifying either the Dem or AI party , there was no way --- short of a manual cross-check with the precinct poll rosters --- to determine which party 's candidate the voters were intending to select if they voted for a candidate in the # 8 to # 10 bubbles where both parties had candidates listed on the ballot .
According to Logan 's flawed plan for his " supplemental count , " many of the currently uncounted non-provisional ballots , with votes for Democratic candidates lucky enough to be on the ballot in the # 11 to # 15 bubbles , will be tallied .
But his plan will not tally votes cast --- even in the same precinct --- for any candidate in the # 8 to # 10 slots , if any NP - AI voters were noted in the poll rosters as having voted at the same precinct .
The candidate ballot positions were rotated randomly in each different Congressional district .
The plan , as bad as it is , according to Alter , is even worse than previously known , since thousands of provisional ballots without the # 5 or # 6 party bubble filled in will go uncounted due to yet another bad decision by the Registrar 's office .
Alter explains that many of the provisional ballots cast were " remade " after the voter was validated as a registered voter .
The remaking of the ballots is said to have been done when voters cast their provisional ballots at precincts different than their own .
If they did , their ballots were " remade " by hand , by county officials , on the appropriate ballots for the voters ' correct precincts .
That notion is bad enough , but worse , when the ballots were " remade , " if no selection was made by the voter in the # 5 or # 6 party bubble , the voters ' selections for President were not included on the remade ballots !
Therefore , when those ballots are processed again , via Logan 's " supplemental " method , they will not be seen by the tabulator machines as containing votes for President , and thus will remain uncounted .
More disenfranchised voters in Los Angeles County .
We have several calls in to the Registrar 's office to confirm these details and to get more information .
However , given that Logan's " supplemental " count is now set to begin at 7:30 am tomorrow morning , according to this notice [ PDF ] posted by the county , and with the local certification deadline set for next Tuesday , we thought it best to get this information out immediately , based only on Alter 's description of the problem for the moment .
How Many Voters May be Affected ?
According to an informal guesstimate , based on previously known percentages of NP ballots containing selections for a Presidential candidate , but without a choice selected in one of the two party bubbles , Alter estimates that some 10,000 to 15,000 such ballots may be affected and mixed in with the 136,000 existing , already - validated provisional ballots cast during the Election .
Of that estimated 10 to 15 thousand , a smaller set of those would have been " remade " without transferring the voters ' selections for Presidential candidate to the new ballot , though Alter did not want to hazard a guess as to how many that might be .
Our call has so far not been returned by the official she recommended we contact to get harder numbers on this issue .
Late this afternoon we spoke again with Alter , who is again at the Norwalk counting facility today .
She reports that she has now shared her discovery , and accompanying concern , with nearly half a dozen of the officials and technical managers there .
She is hopeful that they understand the problem , and are currently taking action to find a way to include those ballots for accurate tabulation in the " supplemental count . "
Alter suggests that the quickest and most accurate way to do that count , at this point , would be to examine and count , by hand , all of the original ( un - " remade " ) provisional Non-Partisan ballots .
Though I caution again that I 've been unable to confirm any of these details , up to this point , with officials , Alter 's description of the problem , as well as her understanding of the ballots and counting processes currently underway in Norwalk , is quite detailed .
Alter says she originally discussed the matter yesterday with the head of quality control for provisional ballots and the supervisor of the " remake " room , whose nickname is " Tray " ( she does n't know his last name ) .
She confirmed the issue with him again today , and also reported the problem to Alex Olvera , Tray 's supervisor , and at least two other officials at the facility .
The time issues in play lead me to run this story earlier than I normally might , without getting confirmation from an official , but it certainly sounds like the always - vigilant Alter has likely got it right .
All of which underscores again the importance of tangible , voter - marked paper ballots that can be transparently counted , examined , and recounted again , as needed , as well as the importance of oversight , and the ability of the public to do so in all aspects of our public elections .
The voters of L.A. County , and L.A. County officials themselves , owe Alter a great thank you .

his mustache is fucking raw .
Justice , that 's a commodity I do n't waste my money on
Richard Roundtree

final track
Do n't watch the movie on a shitty screen .
You will not enjoy it .
The moviethrusts the viewer into an alternate universe with very intense colors .
There is a particularly imaginative daydream scene that looks hand - drawn .
Holy shit , it 's live action but it 's still a cartoon .
I can probably say that a hundred times but it wo n't have any meaning to you until you actually see it for yourself .
At times the movie feels like a total abortion .
It 's shit like this that made the Flintstones live action movie fail -- it 's just hard to combine live action with animation in a way that does n't make the viewer want to vomit .
Some scenes are sort of disgusting to watch -- this could be because the combination of animation and live action is somehow " wrong , " but it could also just be John Goodman .
Early on , the movie is almost entirely visual .
There is a plot , but it is hard to care .
Some of the more subtly computerized scenes are very interesting to look at .
It 's like being in the best theme park ever .
Wait , back to John Goodman :
This guy is alive ?
And still acting ?
Ugh .
There are large chunks of the movie that are hard to follow because there 's no clear chronological order .
This would n't be a problem in itself ( other movies can pull this off ) , but there are parts where the movie is orderly and parts where it is not , and there is no clear distinction between these parts .
They are literally connected by a scene where Speed Racer is racing along on a race track .
What the hell is going on ?
Chim - Chim 's introductory scene is fucking Again , might not have been the wisest choice to cast John Goodman after The Flintstones , but , on the other hand , Some scenes are incredibly ugly and it's like the color palettes were deliberately made to be bland .
At this point I 'm about ready to walk out .
I can't care about the movie .
To make matters worse , one of the main characters says , " " in very poor English .
The movie cost $ 120 million , could n't they have done a couple extra takes on this shot ?
Halfway through , the movie is n't bad at all .
This is around the time where Spritle and Chim - Chim are driving around amped up on sugars and listening to " Free Bird . " appears in this movie .
The Wachowski siblings ' vision becomes clearer as the movie progresses .
The movie finds its pace starting at the firstscene and stays decent up until the final scene which is as ridiculous as anyin a Mario Kart game .
If you like ' kart ' racing games or are a fan of the Speed Racer cartoon ( and there is probably some overlap between the two groups ) , you would probably like the movie overall .
Anyone who worked on the visuals for this movie should be extremely proud , even though it looks like the movie will financially fail .
I think the movie will be nominated for some special effects awards .
Op-ed : USA Today ' overlooks ' 25,000 deaths in Myanmar for Jenna ' I dos ' Walter Brasch
Published : Monday May 12 , 2008

Print This Email This
The editors of USA Today , as they do every day , had to decide what to make its  Cover Story . 
The death toll from the cyclone in Myanmar was approaching 25,000 , with about almost a million homeless , and the ruling military junta was still refusing to accept foreign assistance .
A Pentagon report revealed that about 43,000 medically unfit troops were sent into combat .
In Philadelphia , six police officers were under investigation for beating suspects .
And , in Russia a new president was inaugurated .
What the editors chose to dominate the front page was a three - column head photo of presidential daughter Jenna Bush and a story about her forthcoming non-public private wedding .
The only reason USA Today didnt run the story on its front pages Saturday and Sunday is because it doesnt publish on weekends .
But , just about every other news medium gave the wedding heavy play .
When USA Today debuted in 1982 , it was a glitzy full color alternative to the average gray newspaper .
Focused upon an audience of travelers , and primarily available at airports and hotels , the five day a week newspaper , then as now , had short , quick looks at the news .
 Across the USA  is a series of one paragraph stories from every state , plus the territories , something to let the lonely traveler know his home state still exists .
A color weather map informs travelers what to expect when they arrive at an airport a dozen states away .
Extensive business stories target middle - and upper - management workers who dont have the time to read that days Wall Street Journal .
With an emphasis on polls , USA Today tells us what we think .
And what we think is divided into four equal parts News , Lifestyle , Sports , and Money .
Thus , news is one - fourth of the newspaper .
Ridiculed as McPaper , but read by about two million people a day , most of whom get their daily dose from vendor boxes that look like a TV on a stand , USA Today has set the agenda for almost every newspaper in the country .
Following the USA Today model , local newspapers have splashed color and graphics on its pages .
The stories are shorter , but not necessarily tighter .
And , in an era of downsizing , in which publishers who dont pull in 20 percent a year profits are often reassigned , there are fewer reporters , fewer in - depth stories , fewer and narrower pages , and a greater reliance upon wire service stories .
But , celebrity - based stories and increased fluff what editors wrongly believe the readers want have taken over the front pages .
USA Today was never designed to replace the local newspaper , nor should it be a model for local newspapers .
It has a niche , and serves that niche well .
But , local newspapers have become USA Today clones .
That s why if USA Today places a celebrity wedding as its most important issue of the day , then its reasonable to believe that the clones also believe that 25,000 deaths can be relegated to the inside pages .
[ Walter Brasch , professor of journalism at Bloomsburg University and president of the Pennsylvania Press Club , readily admits he reads USA Today and several other newspapers .
His latest book is Sinking the Ship of State : The Presidency of George W. Bush , available through amazon.com .

JOHANNESBURG  Violence against immigrants , like some windswept fire , spread across one neighborhood after another here in one of South Africa ’s main cities this weekend , and the police said the mayhem left at least 12 people dead  beaten by mobs , shot , stabbed or burned alive .
Thousands of panicked foreigners  many of them Zimbabweans who have fled their own country ’s economic collapse  have now deserted their ramshackle dwellings and tin-walled squatter hovels to take refuge in churches and police stations .
This latest outbreak of xenophobia began a week ago in the historic township of Alexandra and has since spread to other areas in and around Johannesburg , including Cleveland , Diepsloot , Hilbrow , Tembisa , Primrose , Ivory Park and Thokoza .
Amid so much violence , the police were spread thin , sending in squads of officers in armored vehicles .
“ We are using all available resources and will call in reinforcements if the need arises , ” a police spokesman , Govindswamy Mariemuthoo , told reporters .
George W. Bush is undoubtedly one of the most popular figures of current times .
He ’s infamous for many things he misspoke and his views on how to handle national security .
His ideology affected not only the United States , but the whole world in a major way .
No wonder he ’s been on top of mind for many creatives and became the hero of numerous advertisements in the last few years .
Here is a collection of some of the most interesting ads that dissect his character in order to sell an idea or a product .
You be the judge whether they are successful in achieving this objective .
Let me start the showcase with this ad made for Milenio , a Mexican newspaper who claims they solved the inner workings of Bush ’s personality .
Simpson +
Texas cowboy = GWB .
The tagline reads : “ Such a complex world needs a good explanation . ”
In this highly diplomatic ad ( what else would you expect from Britain ) Marmite Squeezy claims Bush ’s just like the funny tasting sirup : “ You either love it or hate it . ”
Non-profit groups use Bush as the topic of their campaign regularly .
Here Greenpeace China brings up controvercial issues and claims : “ Everyone ’s entitled to an opinion .
Voice yours at forum.greenpeace.org ”
Tesa an adhesive tape brand thinks Bush should be silenced .
The headline of the Brazilian ad says : “ The world needs a tape like this . ” and later quotes Bush : “ Are you going to ask that question with shades on ?
For the viewers there ’s no sun ” .
— George W. Bush , addressing a blind reporter during a press conference .
Bush has even unknowingly been recruited to sell cars .
On a more political tone this poorly art directed smart ad from Malaysia reads : “ Still looking for weapons of mass destruction .
Not smart . ”
I guess the viewer is supposed to complete the sentence saying , but getting a smart car for myself that uses up little of our precious non-renewable resources is smart .
Amnesty International
Spain thinks they are like a fly you ca n’t get rid of .
I guess in some cases being associated with an annoying insect is a good thing in some twisted way .
Another AI campaign this time from Malaysia urges you to : “ Write to him and help stop torture at Guantanamo Bay . ”
Then makes a snotty remark : “ Remember , use simple words ” .
Ouch .
Sport Factory
Outlet sells bicycle helmets in Switzerland and promises to prevent and injury to your head , so you can avoid saying silly things .
The ad claims : “ George W. Buch has fallen off the bicycle more than once .
If you voted for GWB an ad from Hong Kong washes the guilt away when they declare : “ Everyone makes mistakes ” , but with Stabilo Ereasable pen you could ’ve corrected the ballot .
Amnesty International again .
This time they suggest that their site powerofyourvoice.org can put words like this into Bush ’s mouth : “ Guantanamo is illegal .
We must close it as soon as possible . ”
In San Francisco the billboards of the movie Lord of War were defaced with Bush ’s collage picture made from portraits of dead soldiers .
More NGO ads this time from Denmark that directly address the president and state : “ It ’s torture no matter what George Bush calls it . ”
Lipton from Australia argues their ice tea would allow for surprising mental achievements for the president .
He would be able to successfully name all 50 US states without outside help .
According to the ad : Bush credits his monumental improvement to a “ magic water ” from “ Chinaland ” .
TVNZ New Zealand is pretty straightforward about their views on Bush .
They advertise the famous movie American Psycho with the head of state on this outdoor board .
For those who have not seen it , Bush is n’t part of the movie .
But of course you would have to go to Brazil for the strongest critique .
On this ad for Rolling Stones magazine they profess : “ We do n’t show naked women to sell more .
At the most , we show some asses . ”
There are of course more mellow ads out there .
The Times magazine from the UK advertises their new full color edition ( they have to compete with the Internet in some way ) with Bush envisioned in a color vision testing chart and asks : “ Are your eyes ready for more colourful news ? ”
Another newspaper called Egoista from Portugal suggests a dove ( representing peace ) will poo on Bush ’s shoulder and makes him responsible for recent wars with their tagline : “ since 1945 there have been only 26 days of peace in the world . ”
Oh , come on !
Bush has only been at war for the last 7 - 8 years since he became a president .
Another public interest campaign portrays Bush as silly kid who does n’t want to hear a word they say .
This ad from Budapest , Hungary was publicizing the Make some noise for human rights concert held on the Danube river in front of the building of the Parliament .
Accroding to magazine Novynar Bush sees the world map in a different way everybody else does .
US is in the dead centre of everything .
I fail to see what ’s wrong with this view !
Ad school students are using Bush in their ads frequently .
Like in this award winning ad , that I must admit I do n’t understand .
Enlighten me if you do .
The South African History Channel ad reads : “ Unfortunately , we do show repeats . ” playing on the popular saying — history repeats itself .
On a lighter note a paint ball park in Portugal suggests you could be Bush if you feel like playing war games .
This ad from Cape Town for the local newspaper argues if Bush is public enemy No1 by eroding freedom ?
If you ’re all worked up , you should relax with the Spanish Susaron anti-stress tea .
Strange art direction that manages to give me a headache without even reading the headline : “ Iraq has weapons of mass destruction . ”
This Mexican ad for a dog kennel is ready to accept Bush to their premises : “ We do n’t discriminate any kind of breed . ”
( In Mexico “ Dog ” means lowlife )
The Arno blender can do funny things .
Like mixing up old Bush with the lead character of Mad Magazine to create GWB .
Do n’t you need to involve a female somewhere in the process ?
Dreamland bedding also promises to cure angry souls disturbed by the oil wars : “ Who says there ’s no rest for the Wicked ?
Dreamland —
The sleep through the night mattress . ”
Even the BBC World news channel took up the subject of having two sides of each story to popularize themselves in the USA .
On one side we see a scared muslim family and on the other a confident US president on TV .
In case of Diario a Brazilian newspaper the ad suggested that there are more to reality than meets the eye .
A pleasant meeting between Blair and Bush is just the tip of the ice - berg .
Beneath we find war , oil , suffering , money and torture .
A Romanian sticker company IPPU claims they can create realistic looking compositions that could never have occurred , like a meeting between GWB and Fidel Castro .
And in Chile in Scrabble terms Fidel Castro equals George Bush .
Each worth 17 points in the game .
On this Vodka campaign from New York Bush ’s life is distilled into a few cliparts .
This ad belongs to the WTF chategory .
The project never actually materialized .
In Germany a compact size newspaper created the toddler version of Bush .
He was a cute kid .
Finally two TV spots .
The first one shows GWB in an unfavorable way acting like an animal .
In the second one South China Morning Post showcases how the paper helps Bush with his speech at an important moment .
I hope Bush does n’t watch TV or reads the paper , because seeing all this must be depressing .

Shenon 9/11 Commission Expose - Not the Last Word
Not the Last Word : New Expose Shreds Credibility of 9/11 Commission Report
By Kyle F. Hence
© Copyright 2008 - Kyle F. Hence
3/18/08
========================
" Senior investigators on the 9/11 Commission believed their work was being manipulated by the executive director to minimize criticism of the Bush Administration . "
" Investigative staffers at the Commission believe [ executive director ]
Philip Zelikow repeatedly sought to minimize the administration ’s intelligence failures in the months leading up to 9/11 , which had the effect of helping to ensure President Bush ’s re-election in 2004 . "
-- Excerpts from The Commission : The Uncensored History of the 9/11 Investigation by Philip Shenon
" There ’s a lot of things they missed , and unfortunately there is going to be a lot of talk for rest of our lifetimes about whether or not these connections at the White House had some impact on the final report . "
-- Philip Shenon on " The Daily Show , with Jon Stewart , February 10 , 2008
========================
I first met Philip Zelikow , the Executive Director of the 9/11 Commission , during the " independent " investigative body ’s first hearing in New York City in 2003 .
As Executive Director , Zelikow was to set the course of the investigation and I was curious to hear what Zelikow had to say .
After the hearing , gathered in a tight little circle of journalists , Zelikow mused on two monumental and historic investigations , the Warren Commission – created to investigate the assassination of President John F. Kennedy , and his Commission – created to investigate the mass murder of over three thousand people from over 80 countries .
Before cutting himself off and expressing concern about going " on - the - record " , Zelikow insisted he would avoid the fate of the Warren Commission , which many critics have questioned over the years , and announced that Lee Oswald acted alone .
In this one exchange , Zelikow showed just how wrong a choice he was to lead the investigation .
His conclusion about Oswald had in fact been undermined by later Congressional findings — revealing an astounding ignorance of the historic record regarding the JFK assassination .
** # # # # **
In the shadow of the Warren Commission
In point of fact , an overwhelming majority of Americans today just do n’t buy the Warren Commission findings , and for good reason .
Our own Congress by way of the House Select Committee on Assassinations concluded that , " on the basis of the evidence available to it , that President John F. Kennedy was probably assassinated as a result of a conspiracy . " [ on page 3 - http://www.archives.gov/research/jfk/select-committee-report/summary.html]
Though the 9/11 Report has sold over 1.5 million copies , many more millions are just not buying the 9/11 Commissions findings , and like the critics of the Warren Commission – for good reason .
Do n’t take my word for it ; polls from Zogby , Scripps - Howard , CBS and others tell the story .
On this count we know Zelikow failed .
It ’s where he succeeded that is of concern to commission critic and New York Times reporter Philip Shenon , especially relative to the Commission ’s mandate to produce " a full accounting of the facts and circumstances " surrounding the 9/11 attacks .
When dogged recently , and no doubt to Zelikow ’s chagrin , Tom Kean , the co-chairman of the 9/11 Commission and other commissioners conceded that their 9/11 Report is " not the last word . "
Now a new book by Shenon , The Commission : The Uncensored History of the 9/11 Investigation , paints a definitive portrait of why their final report cannot possibly be , and must not be , deemed the final word on the September 11th attacks .
While several damning high profile disclosures have raised doubts these past years about the Commission ’s ‘ definitive account ’ ( see Able Danger and Woodward ’s disclosure of two commission - censored high level meetings for examples ) , Shenon ’s expose ’ strikes a mortal blow at the standing and credibility of the increasingly scrutinized 9/11 Commission and its now justifiably suspect report , especially inside - the - beltway where Shenon has been reporting for years .
Judging by early response , this is one fire that the former Commissioners or Zelikow will not be able to put out , no matter how many finely - worded press releases or rebuttals they circulate .
The slow burn will likely continue until a full accounting compels a new investigation willing to point fingers , as Shenon does here .
Among the most seasoned investigative reporters at the Times , Shenon covered the 9/11 Commission wall to wall for over two years .
Few reporters were as close to the work of the panel and the " 9/11 families " ; and no one since the report ’s release gained more access to former staff ( two - thirds ) and commissioners ( 8 of 10 ) , lending the book and its claims added weight and consequence .
All those who previously dismissed or attacked the " Jersey Girls " and others turn the page and take note .
Coulter , Limbaugh , Hannity … that means you .

Pointing fingers at a would - be star witness
At the center of this riveting expose is the controversial figure of Director Zelikow whose impact on the Commission is depicted throughout the book , more often than not in a negative light .
He lords threateningly over his underlings , restricts their contact with Commissioners , and most disturbingly fails to disclose the full scope and nature of his work for the Bush White House .
More than any single commission member , the ambitious and willful Zelikow is responsible for the Commission ’s nuanced , non-partisan , zero accountability " point - no - fingers " conclusions , and especially for minimizing the Bush administration record leading up to 9/11 .
As months pass Zelikow increasingly becomes a lightning rod , for some of his own staff , but most especially for the 9/11 families who call for his resignation when glaring conflicts of interest emerge .
Though Shenon focuses heavily on Zelikow ’s highly compromising conflicts of interest he is himself reluctant to draw obvious conclusions .
Zelikow ’s role in the Bush White House should have precluded any role in the 9/11 investigation , much less that of Executive Director .
In fact he should have been a star witness .
Prior to his hiring , the Commission Chair interviewed Zelikow and reviewed the resume he ’d submitted .
The only problem was the resume , like his final report , glossed over critical details that would have precluded his securing the job of Director .
While the resume did detail his close ties to Rice , with whom he had written a book , and his service on the Bush transition team , Zelikow did not reveal his role as ‘ architect ’ of the Counter - terrorism Security Group ( within Rice ’s National Security Council ) and in demoting counter - terrorism ‘ czar ’ Richard Clarke .
Beginning in January Clarke warned Rice repeatedly about the al - Qaeda threat , including , shockingly , from known cells in the U.S. ( more on that later ) .
Zelikow also failed to disclose the fact he had anonymously authored the Administration ’s pre-emptive war doctrine .
When finally exposed the deception was the last straw for the 9/11 families who felt compelled to call for Zelikow ’s resignation .
Though the Commissioners did force Zelikow to recuse himself from key inquires involving Rice and Richard Clarke , they defended him and insisted he would remain .
Then , in an unsettling twist Zelikow is put under oath to be the subject of the investigation , one that he is to lead , adding commission insult to 9/11 injury .
** # # # # **
A preempting Karl Rove plays quarterback
Early on , Zelikow had agreed to avoid contact with senior Bush officials , but here too Zelikow reveals a deceptive and controlling streak .
Shenon tells of how the agreement is violated when Executive Secretary Karen Heitkotter logged two calls in June of 2003 from Karl Rove , Bush ’s senior political advisor and legendary maestro of dirty tricks .
Commissioner John Lehman will later tell Shenon that Rove , with eyes on the 2004 election , had been preemptively " quarterbacking " commission - related damage control for the White House .
Nervous about the scrutiny , Zelikow called the secretary into his office , closed the door behind her and told Ms. Heitkotter to stop logging calls .
Alarmed over the propriety of the request she turned to Daniel Marcus , the Commission ’s General Counsel , who advised her to ignore her boss .
In September she logged two more incoming calls from Rove .
Outgoing calls to the White House were not logged ; nor were calls to and from Zelikow ’s personal cell phone .
Since the book ’s release , Zelikow has admitted to only two discussions with Rove , both of which he says strictly pertained to his work as a Presidential historian at the University of Virginia .
Zelikow insists he and Rove did not discuss the 9/11 investigation but Shenon ’s own White House sources reveal there were in fact ‘ ancillary conversations ’ about the workings of the commission .
Just days after publication of The Commission , former Navy Secretary Lehman , who had made the Rove " quarterbacking " allegation , defended Zelikow on MSNBC saying he fully expected Zelikow to be talking with White House officials , including Rove , as part of the commission ’s fight to secure access to documents .
On Pacific Radio , Zelikow was repeatedly pressed by Democracy Now host Amy Goodman ; clearly frazzled , he would not directly deny he told his Secretary to stop logging calls .
Recently I confronted Karl Rove personally about his contact with Zelikow .
I asked quite simply why he had called Zelkow in June , mentioning specifically the two logged dates disclosed in Shenon ’s book .
No surprise ; I was rudely stonewalled .
Thus , no comment from Rove about his alleged quarterbacking and preemptive damage control .
** # # # # **
Attorney General Spitzer ’s # 2 and purpose - built failures
Though undoubtedly the staffer with the most influence , Zelikow is not the only one pulled out of the shadows in The Commission ’s hidden history .
Shenon reveals that Dieter Snell , a former Asst. U.S. Attorney in New York and # 2 under Attorney General Eliot Spitzer , censored convincing evidence of high - level Saudi support in the U.S. for two of the future hijackers , Nawaf al - Hamzi and Khalid al - Mihdhar , who were monitored , but not watch - listed , by the CIA .
Snell , the leader of the investigative team focusing on the 9/11 plot , is depicted as ‘ cautious ’ as he applies a prosecutor ’s high " courtroom " standard to evidence his own team members insist should be included in the report .
Over the objections of his investigators , solid and damning evidence is effectively redacted , just as the infamous " 28 pages " of the Congress ’ Joint Inquiry Report had been , over the earlier objections of Senators Shelby and Graham , heads of the Senate Intelligence Committee .
Perhaps even more revealing , though not noted by Shenon , Snell relegates to the small print of back - page footnote 44 , an episode in which the Deputy Chief of the CIA ’s Bin Laden Unit , Tom Wilshire ( unnamed in the report ) quashes a cable drafted by an FBI detailee to the CIA , Doug Miller ( also unnamed ) .
In so doing Wilshire prevents the CIA from alerting the FBI ( and others in the CIA ) to important intelligence about Hazmi and Mihdhar , the first of at least half a dozen similar instances of withholding or obstruction between January of 2000 and early September 2001 , several of which also involved Wilshire .
At the time Hazmi and Mihdhar were first monitored by the CIA in Kuala Lampur , the CIA Director George Tenet and the FBI Director Freeh were both receiving daily briefings .
Shenon never poses the questions begged here .
But for her part , 9/11 widow and " Jersey Girl " Kristen Breitweiser dives right in , concluding this pattern of repeated ‘ failures ’ was " purposeful " ; their pervasiveness simply could not be chalked up to mere incompetence .
[ see …
http://www.huffingtonpost.com/kristen-breitweiser/enabling-danger-part-one_b_5951.html]
Shenon makes only brief mention of Snell ’s role in the Commission ’s cover -up of Able Danger , a top- secret Special Operations Command ( SOCOM ) project that five witnesses testified to a Department of Defense investigation as having linked Mohamed Atta , Hazmi , Mihdhar and Marwhan al - Sheehi to a Brooklyn cell over a year before the attacks .
Navy Commander Scott Phillpott , the head of the top - secret project , told Snell of the program ten days before the release of the final report .
The kicker : these details had already been revealed to Zelikow at Fort Bagram in Afghanistan months earlier by another Able Danger team member , Lt. Col .
Tony Shaffer .
Though asked to follow up personally with Zelikow upon his return to the US , Shaffer was twice rebuffed .
When all this surfaced in 2005 , it was met with denials and obfuscations forwarded by the obviously embarrassed former Commissioners and Shaffer was unjustly tarred and feathered by the military in an attempt to destroy his reputation .

" You lied to the American people "
On the night of the Democratic Convention in 2004 , then Senator Dayton , rather than join other Dems on the Convention floor or back - stage , stayed up until the wee hours of the morning , unsettled and angry by what he gleaned from the commission ’s account of the nation ’s air defense on 9/11 .
A few months later when presented with an opportunity on Capitol Hill to confront Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld and General Myers about the four wildly varying ‘ official ’ timelines they released , Senator Dayton burned through all ten of his allotted minutes for questions .
In outrage rarely expressed at Congressional hearings , he asked how the nation ’s defense apparatus , warned throughout the Spring and Summer , could have failed so completely .
He railed against what he called lies put forward in the changing NORAD timelines .
" You lied to the American people " he charged .
Neither witness , Myers or Rumsfeld , responded because the committee chair , Senator Snowe , quickly turned to prompt the next Senator .
We learn from Shenon that the General and the Secretary escaped further , and no doubt harsher , questioning over a possible perjury inquiry had the Commission voted to refer the matter to the Justice Department .
Instead the matter was referred the Inspectors General at the FAA and Department of Defense , neither of which have the power themselves to bring criminal charges .
To this day the lies of NORAD stand unaccounted for .

Censoring the Fog of War- games
Shenon ’s uncensored history is of course not exhaustive .
As just one example there is the question of war games , several of which were being conducted on 9/11 .
Though Congresswoman McKinney , a Representative from Georgia on the House side would ask about them , Senator Dayton did not ; and the Commission , as with so many ill - explained anomalies , ( see Sibel Edmonds State Secrets ‘ gag ’ or put-option trading in United and American , both footnoted ) relegated Vigilant Guardian , the one war game acknowledged by the military during public hearings , to the footnotes of the Report .
Others real - world exercises including Global Guardian and Vigilant Warrior , named in Richard Clarke ’s book , Against All Enemies , are not explained .
And despite the documented confusion within NORAD caused by Vigilant Guardian that morning , the Commission repeats General Myers ’ absurd claim before the House Armed Services Committee : that the exercises only heightened NORAD ’s response .
We can only speculate as to why the multiple war games , coincident and mirrored in the actual attacks themselves , were merely footnoted by the authors of the report , and whether Zelikow was involved in that decision .
It should be noted that Shenon ignores authors and academics , such as the prolific author David Ray Griffin or the controversial former LAPD investigator Michael Ruppert ( neither cited in his bibliography ) who have carefully critiqued the commission and built strong cases challenging the official story laid out in the 9/11 Report .
Unfortunately all too often , lack of intellectual courage and / or fear of the social and professional stigma of being labeled a ‘ conspiracy theorist ’ may have prevented official investigations from examining without prejudice all of the available evidence .
The result : trails have gone cold and investigators and investigative reporters are not even asking the right questions , much less answering them .
Shenon ’s work suggests that perhaps Zelikow , Snell and others within the Commission might have precluded such a fearless open - minded , less narrowly cast investigation .
Shenon reveals that early detailed outlines written at the Investigation ’s outset by Zelikow suggest that this was , in fact , the case .
As a result many have claimed it a ‘ cover - up ’ commission and a " 9/11 Omission Report " .

Rewarding Failure for all the marbles
A few months after the report ’s release I caught up with Philip Zelikow and Commissioner Kean at the 2004 National Book Awards in New York City where the 9/11 Report had been nominated in the non-fiction category .
When I finally located the honorees table , decorated with flowers , nominated books and flickering votives , I approached Zelikow .
I asked him how it felt to be responsible for what I called " the worst cover - up in American history " and then I suggested , only half in jest , that the 9/11 Commission Report had been nominated in the wrong category .
As I turned away from the now red-faced fuming former Director to greet Chairman Tom Kean with whom I had a friendly cordial relationship , I tossed a flyer that quoted a recent Harper ’s Magazine critique of the Commission on the table .
Just moments later as I was discussing Chairman Kean ’s latest holiday getaway to the islands , Zelikow thrust the flyer , now in flames from contact with a lit votive , between me and the chairman .
I grabbed it , snuffed out the fire , and stuffed it into my jacket pocket , all without hesitation or alarm .
Judging by the look on his face , Chairman Kean must have wondered if the Commission Director , on the eve of possible book award glory , had finally lost his marbles
Thanks to Philip Shenon we do know that Zelikow , among others , lost integrity and credibility in his direction of the most important investigation in our nation ’s history .
Writing his Acknowledgments this past December Shenon insists that , " if the full truth is ever told about September 11 , 2001 , " it will be the doing of the 9/11 families … .
" It has not been told yet . "
In response to Shenon ’s revealing expose , several of the 9/11 widows have now formally called for a new investigation .
Perhaps it ’s not too late to make the last word , the whole truth .
But that ’s up to you , to us , to make it an issue this election year , and every year until it is done .

An effective creative questionnaire allows you to gain relevant , focused , and helpful design information without taking up a lot of the client ’s time .
I use the term “ questionnaire ” because it ’s a familiar term , but as you ’ll see , some examples are n’t questions .
This article is primarily about developing a one - way questionnaire where you are n’t there to explain or expound on the questions you ’ve asked the respondent , though the same concepts apply whether you ’re communicating via email or during a face - to - face meet .
Keep it as short as possible
Long questionnaire forms , in my experience , tend to result in rushed responses .
Keep questions and the survey as short , concise , and clear as possible .
We have to respect the client ’s time .
Typically , a demand for a website arises when a business is just starting out or when current solutions can’t meet increasing demands ; either way , they ’ve got a lot on their plate already .
Instead of :
“ Think for a moment about your company ’s mission statement – How does that traverse into the online world and how will a website achieve your mission statement ? ”
simply say :
“ In your mind , what ’s the business value of having a website ? ”
The latter example is terse and unambiguous .
Let them do the writing , keeping yours to a minimum .
Include creative questions , preferably in the beginning
A creative question , in this context , refers to unconventional questions that have two goals :
to extract information indirectly – “ If your website was a car , what car would it be ? ” to get the respondent in a mood where they ’re comfortable to say anything without restraint .
An effective questionnaire gets the client ’s uninhabited , raw thoughts and emotions .
Including them at the start can set this tone early on in the process .
Examples of creative questions
Imagine a typical user browsing your website , what would they be thinking right now ?
Use one word to describe your website .
What features of your website would your competitors be most envious of ?
If your website disappeared for a week , what would your users miss the most ?
Provide example responses to focus and clarify your meaning
Your questions may seem crystal clear to you , but to the client , it may mean another thing .
Provide sample responses to direct your client ’s answers .
Some examples :
List down key words that you associate with your company .
Without prompts , you can get very colorful responses like “ awesome ” , “ da bomb ” , “ where I get money for my gambling debts ” .
Adding “ For example , a Spanish restaurant may use ‘ paella ’ , ‘ international ’ , ‘ culture ’ ” would make your question less vague .
, a Spanish restaurant may use ‘ paella ’ , ‘ international ’ , ‘ culture ’ ” would make your question less vague .
What types of designs do you like ?
You can indicate your expected answer by saying instead , “ Please view these websites [ then , list down some website addresses ] .
What do you like about them ?
What do you hate about them ? ”
Avoid unfocused open - ended questions
An open - ended question is one that allows the respondent to answer in a less - structured fashion .
For example , an open - ended question would be , “ what do you think about web 2.0 ? ” .
In contrast , a closed - ended question would be , “ What ’s one thing you like about web 2.0 ? ”
Open -ended questions are a necessity in design questionnaires , but avoid ones that are vague and overly generalized .
Examples
Describe the design you want .
You can focus the respondent ’s answers by saying instead , “ Write specific design features that you ’d like to see in the design mock - up ” .
Describe the nature of your business .
This can be revised to : “ Describe a typical day in your place of work ” .
Evolve ( tailor ) your questions
Web development projects typically take week to a month ’s worth of work .
This means that you can — and should — take the time to customize your questionnaires for each of your clients .
If you use a web - based form , this can be a bit more tedious , but it can be done by sending more questions in an email .
Not only will this allow you to gain information unique to the client ’s industry , it also shows that you ’re giving personal attention to their needs .
Typically , I prefer to have only ten questions per questionnaire , seven of which are my standard questions and three are tailored towards the client ’s particular organization .
What to do after you receive a response
Internalize it .
What I do after getting a questionnaire back is I read it thoroughly , once or twice .
I digest the information I ’m given by rewriting and rephrasing the responses on a text file that I keep open as I design the mock - up .
Embrace the subtleties of your client ’s responses , take notice of grammar or spelling mistakes , all of this can be significant in helping you learn about the people you ’re working with .
Example :
Website name : My AWESOME Company Tagline :
This is so awesome that I capitalized " Awesome " Preferred colors : none specified , but described as “ high - impact ” Look and feel : Web 2.0 , gradients , large text Key words ( design theme ) : fun , young , colorful
Ask for clarification if needed .
Do n’t be timid in following - up on answers that seem unclear to you .
Ask as soon as you can so that your client still remembers the questionnaire - answering session .
Use it to strengthen your mock - up presentation .
Use the responses while presenting your initial design mock - up to explain the design direction you took .
Quote responses verbatim , if appropriate .
For example , if you chose a sans - serif font face , you can say “ In your response , you indicated that you wanted a clean , modern , professional design , which is showcased in the mock - up by the dark - gray , Arial font … ”
If you chose green hues , you can say “ You mentioned that you needed a website that ‘ evokes a feeling of cleanliness and ‘ eco- friendliness ” , so I decided to use green hues to … ”
Use their responses to explain why you decided to use certain colors , a certain layout , why you avoided particular elements , etc .
Some other tips I ’ve found helpful
Outline the purpose and relevant information in an introductory paragraph .
Describe the purpose of your questionnaire .
Assert what you expect to get as a response .
Indicate the importance of the questionnaire .
Typically , I ’ll say something along the lines of “ You are a very important part of the design process so your responses here will prove to be a valuable asset throughout the project ” .
Let the client know how much time to take .
Most of the time , this avoids rushed responses .
I ask each respondent to take between 30 minutes to 1 hour so that they may properly answer the questionnaire .
Leave out the tech jargon .
It does n’t impress anyone , and it will only annoy them if they do n’t know what you ’re talking about .
Use terms that are common knowledge .
Fix flawed questions .
Every few projects ( usually I do it every three projects or so ) , I take my most current questionnaires and I evaluate each question for its usefulness and clarity .
Fill out your own questionnaire .
I ’ve found it very enlightening to fill out my own questionnaire form .
When you write the questions yourself , you do n’t really think too much about the effort and the process of responding to them .
I ’ve found questions where I thought , “ Man , I do n’t want to answer this , it ’s too damn long and I ’ve got so much stuff going on ” .
Try it , at the very least , it ’s a fun activity .
Rep. Jim McDermott ( left ) leaked a recording of House Minority Leader John A. Boehner and others .

Boehner 's wiretapping stance draws ire
When a federal judge ordered Rep. Jim McDermott to pay House Minority Leader John A. Boehner and his attorneys more than $ 1 million in damages and legal fees for leaking an illegally taped phone call to the media , Boehner said he pursued the case because “ no one — including members of Congress — is above the law . ”
Why , then , is the Ohio Republican trying to squash similar lawsuits against telecommunications companies who cooperated with the government in warrantless electronic surveillance , ask the attorneys behind the class action suits .

“ Mr. Boehner is trying to kick millions of Americans out of court in a wiretapping case while collecting more than $ 1 million in his own wiretapping case .
It ’s the height of hypocrisy and seems to indicate that members of Congress are entitled to their day in court but the average American is not , ” said Kevin Bankston , a senior staff attorney at the consumer rights nonprofit the Electronic Frontier Foundation .
The criticism comes amid continuing negotiations among House and Senate leaders in both parties as they seek common ground with the White House on updating the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act .
Boehner ’s efforts put him in the position of arguing that telecom companies are above the law in violating their customers ’ privacy rights , say those lobbying against letting the companies off the hook .
Boehner spokesman Michael Steel said the congressman supports retroactive immunity for telecom companies because they “ should n’t face lawsuits for helping our country in the wake of the Sept. 11 attacks . ”
The concerns of those opposed to immunity , Steel said , are “ outweighed by the compelling national security interests that we ’re talking about here . ”
McDermott , a Democrat from Washington state , leaked an illegally recorded phone conversation for political gain , Steel said , while the telecom firms are being sued for helping the government protect Americans in the war against terrorism .
“ This is like comparing the Watergate plumbers with our men and women in the armed forces fighting in Iraq and Afghanistan , ” Steel said .
But Michelle Richardson of the American Civil Liberties Union said it does n’t matter why the telecom companies cooperated in the government surveillance .
“ The only thing that matters is whether they broke the law and will they have to answer for that , ” she said .
In the case against McDermott , Boehner ’s attorneys argued in a court filing that “ private litigation to enforce the federal wiretapping act serves governmental interests of the highest order . ”
Boehner ’s suit stemmed from McDermott ’s leak of a 1996 phone conversation in which Boehner and House Republican leaders discussed how to spin an ethics investigation involving then - Speaker Newt Gingrich ( R - Ga . ) .
Earlier this year , McDermott was ordered to pay about $ 1.1 million to Boehner and his attorneys for violating Boehner ’s privacy .
In the debate before Congress over telecom immunity , Boehner has attacked Democrats for pandering to “ typical trial lawyers trying to find a way to get into the pockets ” of telecom companies .
And Steel argued that immunity opponents are outside the mainstream , noting that the Senate overwhelming approved retroactive immunity months ago .
If huge awards are a concern , lawmakers could set reasonable caps on damages instead of granting the companies immunity from court action , Bankston said .
He argues that the EFF and the ACLU , which are coordinating the suits , are n’t looking to get rich but , rather , want to learn whether the companies broke the law .
The groups are seeking penalties against the telecom companies to deter future illegal behavior — an argument Boehner should be familiar with .
“ Punitive damages are not imposed to give awards to plaintiffs ; they are imposed to punish and deter illegal conduct and to exact retribution on behalf of society for the violation of its laws , ” Boehner ’s attorneys , seeking damages and legal fees , argued in a court brief in the McDermott case .
The judge awarded Boehner $ 60,000 in damages and his attorneys more than $ 1 million in fees and court costs .
Steel said the award was so high because McDermott pressed on with the case after Boehner offered to settle if McDermott admitted guilt , apologized and made a charitable donation .
Bankston said he found it insulting that Boehner would attack the attorneys representing millions of Americans as money - grubbers while he and his attorneys were “ lining their own pockets . ”
The British Government is accused of being the chief obstacle to the signing of a treaty to ban cluster bombs , which have maimed and killed thousands of civilians worldwide .
Countries that have suffered the impact of the bombs , humanitarian groups and former commanders of British forces have called for the UK to drop its insistence on retaining cluster munitions , a stance , they say , that is likely to scupper hopes of securing an agreement at an international conference starting in Dublin today .
More than 100 countries are taking part in the talks .
Delegates will point out that the vast majority of cluster bomb victims are non-combatants .
Opponents of the weapon received the backing yesterday of Pope Benedict XVI , who called for a " strong and credible " treaty to end their use .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
The two sets of weapons at the heart of the argument are the M85 and the M73 , munitions fired , respectively , by artillery and rockets .
British officials claim these are " smart " weapons which minimise the risk of " collateral damage " and are essential for military operations .
The M85 is meant to self destruct and not pose a lingering threat to civilians .
However , according to the United Nations , 300 civilians were killed or injured in Lebanon , where Israel used the weapons in 2006 .
An Apache helicopter can launch 684 M73 bomblets in one attack .
They were used by the Americans in the 2003 invasion of Iraq .
Their use was criticised by US forces , who had to negotiate unexploded cluster munitions on their way to Baghdad .
The first two British soldiers killed in Kosovo were casualties of Nato cluster bombs they had been trying to clear .
Senior Foreign
Office sources said the UK was not prepared to give up the M73 and the system was " non-negotiable " .
There was said to be flexibility over the M85 , but the Ministry of Defence is expected to resist losing them .
The UK is said to be under strong pressure from the Americans – who are not taking part in the Dublin talks – to resist signing up to banning cluster bombs .
Defence officials in London say a range of issues is at stake , including munitions stored at US bases in Britain , and the legal status of British soldiers serving alongside Americans where the US may use cluster weapons .
There are said to be divisions within the Government over the Dublin summit .
Lord Malloch Brown , Foreign Office minister for Africa , Asia and the UN , is reported to have said he would be " uncomfortable " about a compromise that leaves some cluster bombs in the UK arsenal .
The Environment Secretary , Hillary Benn , favours an overall ban .
Campaigners say the Government must live up to Gordon Brown 's promise last year " to work internationally for a ban " on weapons that cause unacceptable harm to civilians .
" Insisting on keeping some weapons and saying they are not negotiable is a deal breaker , " said Simon Conway , a former British Army soldier who is director of the pressure group Landmine Action .
" The position of the UK is a huge stumbling block to achieving a comprehensive treaty .
Des Browne , the Defence Secretary , has told me himself that he did not believe the M73 was appropriate for counter - insurgency operations . "
Lord Ramsbotham , a fomer British Army general and chief inspector of prisons , is among a number of distinguished senior officers , including General Sir Rupert Smith , General Patrick Cordingley and Field Marshal Lord Brammall , who have asked the Government to sign the treaty .
Lord Ramsbotham , who flew to Afghanistan yesterday as part of a parliamentary delegation , said : " I am going to ask the commanders there whether they intend to use cluster weapons and I would be very surprised if the answer is ' yes ' .
There are moral objections to using cluster munitions , but tactical ones as well .
They were designed to stop Soviet armour in the Cold War .
There is no place for them in the type of warfare we are seeing now . "
Imagine running up to the bakery around the corner and coming across bread shaped like body parts .
Sound yummy ?
Artist Kittiwat Unarrom creates just that ; gruesome works of art out of bread .
Kittiwat Unarrom has a master 's degree in fine arts and creates bruised and battered heads , feet and other internal organs at a bread shop in Thailand .
He started using his skills and made sculptures out of bread .
This came naturally to him because his family runs a bakery .
The bread is made out of dough , raisins , cashews and chocolate .
He just adds his own touch to the finished product .
This makes me wonder how long the line wraps around the bakery in order to purchase this finely crafted delicious bread .
I would love to go over to my parent 's house with one of these .
Carefully setting the concealed bread on the table , I would wait until all of the food was served and innocently ask my mom if she could pass me the bread .
Imagine her surprise when she lifts open the cover and comes face to face with one of these gory delights .
Okay , so I 'd never be invited over to dinner again , but I think the look on her face would be so worth it .
I think this could be an excellent idea for restaurants .
They could use one of these heads as a bread bowl and serve spaghetti in it .
It would kind of be like eating brains , do n't you think ?

You are romantically involved with someone ( but not really ) .
You 're having a casual conversation ( but not completely ) .
And then semisuddenly , the query is posed : " Are we dating , or are we just hooking up ? "
This is the core issue of every unclear relationship , and it's a question that has no correct answer .
If you say you 're " dating , " pressure is placed upon both parties , and a degree of exclusivity is implied .
If you claim you 're " just hooking up , " you are a terrible person by default ; the inclusion of the word just will shatter a heart , and someone who is not you will soon be crying .
So how does one answer this question ?
Is there any response that works ?
Yes .
" Well , " you say , " I think we 're having a long , intimate party . "
This response is perfect .
The use of the word long indicates the potential for growth .
The word intimate simultaneously suggests privacy and sensuality .
And the word party makes everything seem playful , creative , and , most important , vague .
Moreover , this sounds like the kind of thing Mick Jagger would have said to Twiggy in 1978 had they collided in the coke room at Studio 54 .
In a sense , we 're all just having a " long , intimate party , " are we not ?
Everybody wins .

Black hole had 18th century feeding frenzy
About 300 years ago , the black hole lurking in the heart of the Milky Way woke from hibernation and entered a feeding frenzy , triggering a cascade of x-rays that reverberated off nearby clouds , researchers say .
The energy released by the event was so intense that echoes remain etched in an interstellar cloud today .
The findings , reported by Japanese astronomers , may explain why our galaxy 's black hole , known as Sagittarius A* , is so laid - back compared to similarly sized monsters in other galaxies .
" Perhaps it 's just resting after a major outburst , " says Kyoto University 's Tatsuya Inui , lead author of a paper in the Publications of the Astronomical Society of Japan .
The scientists combined data from a trio of probes scouting the cosmos for x-rays .
Data taken between 1994 and 2005 revealed a quick - lived but intense flash of x-rays from a large cloud known as Sagittarius B2 , which lies 300 light - years from the Milky Way 's black hole .
The key to unravelling the x-ray source was the detection of iron molecules in the spectral data , which shows the chemistry of areas the light had passed through .
Scientists believe the black hole 's frenzy spewed out x-rays that blasted electrons off iron molecules in the cloud .
The shift of electrons to and fro triggered sensors in x-ray detectors on US , European and Japanese satellites .
" By observing how this cloud lit up and faded over 10 years , we could trace back the black hole 's activity 300 years ago , " says co-investigator Professor Katsuji Koyama .
" The black hole was a million times brighter three centuries ago .
It must have unleashed an incredibly powerful flare . "
More recent outburst
Last year , a team of scientists headed by Dr Michael Muno at the California Institute of Technology discovered a fainter but more recent outburst from Sagittarius A* , which is between three and four million times as massive as our sun .
It too was discovered by studying x-rays reflected off a gas cloud .
During that outburst , a mass the size of the planet Mercury was devoured .
" It has been 50 years or so since the black hole had its last decent meal , " Muno says .
If x-ray sensors had been around then , the area around the black hole would have been 100,000 times brighter than it is today .
Feeding habits
Details of the black hole 's feeding habits are unclear .
One theory is that the black hole pulls in matter from the winds of nearby young stars .
The burst 300 years ago could have been caused by a supernova explosion that blasted material towards the black hole .
Controversial Decision German Lawmakers Loosen Limits on Stem Cell Research
German scientists have welcomed a decision by German lawmakers to loosen a law on importing stem cells , saying it is essential to allow them to compete internationally .
However the Catholic Church is vehemently opposed to the new regulation .
Geez , when a building built for supposedly one person is tall enough to aggravate my acrophobia , I 'd think that 's much too much .

What 's he going to shove in there with all that room ?
For some reason , I keep thinking he forgot to put a podium with a microphone and camera on the top balcony , and enormous screens on the ground , so he could rant and rave to anyone near .
Or it could just be my idea of what could be the cherry on top of the hilarious irrationality sundae !
But if he wanted it , he can have it , just wish he'd give me some money for one or two wild schemes of my own ...

Making the benchmarks repeatable , not relying on invariants that GHC does not promise .
Understanding the precise results , I want to know why a particular benchmark gives the results it does .

I 've been doing more work on my Haskell optimiser , and its going quite well .
Previously I 've been attempting to get some initial benchmark numbers , now I 'm revisiting each of the benchmarks with a view to :1 ) I 've increased the default data set to 45 Mb .
This should give more accurate results .
I 've also benchmarked on a variety of computers , and found that the relative difference between processor and disk speed makes a massive difference .
All the results given here are from my work machine .
On my home machine Supero is up to 4 times faster than GHC!2 )
It turned out that usingmeant that the gcc back end to GHC was inlining some primitive functions .
I 've now moved to usingwith ghc , which results in no inlining .
I 've also set appropriate definitions in the C to turn of inlining of their functions .
With all these steps , no programming language does any inlining insideor .
Since all programs do exactly the same number of calls to each function , this should not benefit / penalise any language , but is more consistent .
3 ) I 've moved from using my fake version of the IO Monad , to using GHC's IO Monad .
This change means that GHC no longer attempts to optimise my computations into constants , and means that future versions of GHC are guaranteed to behave in much the same way .
This also has the side effect that the code should be faster ( it is n't , discussed next , but it should be !
) 4 )
With more detailed and repeatable benchmarks , I 've started to look for the precise reasons why a particular benchmark performs as it does .
In doing so I 've noticed that GHC can place heap checks in the wrong place , sometimes fails to infer the correct strictness information and has too many stack checks .
I have reported each of these issues .
The benchmarks are performed with these problems present in the Supero results .
As far as I am able to tell , if these three issues were solved , Supero would always obtain the same speed as C ( with the same assembly code ) , or outperform C ( in one case ) .
5 ) I discovered an issue with thefunction , which I have brought to the attention of the Haskell library maintainers .
Thefunction as currently in the libraries performs two redundanttests per word detected .
The fix is simple , and has been applied to the libraries Supero uses .
Note that the GHC result has not had this fix applied , so could be expected to improve .
With all these modifications , it only remains to post updated benchmarks :
The benchmarks follow an expected pattern for character counting and line counting .
The C version is minimally faster than the Supero version , 1.5 % faster in both cases .
The Haskell version lags substantially further behind .
The one benchmark where this is not the case is word count .
In this benchmark Supero is 10 % than C !
This even includes the overheads of missed strictness , excessive heap checks and excessive stack checks .
Obviously this is a surprising result , so deserves more explanation .
The C code which performs word counting is : There are essentially two states - traversing through a sequence of spaces , or traversing through a sequence of non-spaces .
Depending on which state you are in , and where you are transitioning to , you may need to increment a counter .
The C code maintains this state information inHowever , this is not the fastest method .
If that 1 - bit of information was encoded in the program counter , i.e. by having different paths for being in a sequence of spaces vs non-spaces , the code can be further optimised : thevariable becomes redundant ; the increment test can be eliminated in one branch .
To implement two tight inner loops in C , where control can bounce between the loops , is not trivial .
One approach is to use , but this often disables some optimisations .
The other approach is to have nestedloops , with ato exit the inner loop .
Either way is unpleasant , and unnatural .
Contrast this low - level hackery , with the Haskell version :
The code is specified in a high - level manner .
By running this code through Supero , it automatically produces the necessary pair of tight loops , with transitions between them , using tail calls .
GHC takes this code and produces directly looping code , which is able to outperform the C equivalent .
My next step is to take the Supero program , and try it on a larger range of benchmarks .
I hope to tackle the nobench suite , competing against other Haskell compilers , rather than against C.

The new version may indeed require Mac OS X 10.5 Leopard , but if you 're a fan of keeping track of your real world stuff on your Mac , you 'll understand why .
For a recap , DL2 brings some pretty significant new features and a freshly updated UI .
At the top of the list is the ability to catalog far more than just media like DVDs and books ; users can now keep track of their gadgets , toys , tools , and just about anything else that Amazon carries .
Speaking of media , though , DL2 now also catalogs your entire iTunes library , including music , movies , TV shows , and even audiobooks .
While one of Delicious Library 's most appealing features has always been keeping track of things you lend to friends , though , note that you can't really do much with your iTunes media in DL2 besides keep track of it for record - keeping or insurance purposes ( certainly a drawback of going digital ) .
Other great new DL2 features include the ability to publish a browsable HTML library of all your stuff or just a specific
Shelf of selected items , as well as the ability to subscribe to your friends shelves to keep track of their stuff .
DL2 will also be the first Mac OS X app to allow AppleScripts to live anywhere in the app 's menu structure .
Per the example , a user could create an " Import from FileMaker " AppleScript for DL2 that lives under the File >
Import menu - - a script that is not bound to the AppleScript menu .
DL2 also does automatic currency conversion , so searching by value or sorting Shelves will analyze currencies on the fly to compare US dollars against Euros or any combination of 21 of the world 's currencies .
There is also a new iPhone export , though we have n't tested that feature just yet , as well as an iPhone - friendly version of the site DL2 exports .
One of the most significant changes behind the scenes is dramatically - improved overall performance , thanks to the company making the switch from XML to SQL for storing the library .
Developer Wil Shipley has stated that DL2 should handle tens of thousands of records like a champ now , and while our library is only a few thousand records strong , we can definitely see much - improved performance .
To our amusement , however , DL2 presents a warning that scrolling large Shelves may be a little jerky until Mac OS X 10.5.3 is released with some fixes for graphic bugs in Leopard .
I guess this is what the Delicious Monster crew meant when they said they 're doing some " stress - testing " of Leopard 's APIs with DL2 .
Whether you 're a current Delicious Library owner considering an upgrade or you 've never sat down to experience how useful your iSight can actually be , Delicious Library 2 packs a healthy dose of new features and overall refinement .
You can take the demo for a spin , and for a limited time you can get $ 10 off its price of $ 40 , or $ 5 off the upgrade price of $ 20 .
( Delicious Library 1 will also be $ 20 for Tiger users from now on . )
The line for the free money began to form about 7 a.m. Christmas morning .
Homeless veterans , drug addicts , pregnant women with children , and people in wheelchairs took numbered tickets and waited patiently on the sidewalk on skid row .
At 8:30 a.m. , when a man showed up nearby and started tossing wads of dollar bills into the air , police stepped in to check him out -- but he was n’t the famous “ Father Dollar Bill ” they all were waiting for , just a wannabe with far fewer bucks to throw around .
“ Father Dollar Bill ” is the Rev. Maurice Chase -- and every Christmas for the last 24 years , he has arrived on skid row carrying thousands of dollars in cash .
At 9 a.m . Tuesday , when he showed up at East 5th Street and Towne Avenue with $ 15,000 , people in wheelchairs immediately surrounded him .
His tradition is to give the first 10 people in wheelchairs $ 100 .
Others in line receive varying amounts , perhaps $ 20 or , more often , a few bucks .

Chase says he solicits the money from Los Angeles celebrities -- the families of Frank Sinatra and Bob Hope , billionaire Eli Broad .
Most Sundays , he ’s on skid row too , distributing smaller amounts , usually about $ 5,000 to $ 6,000 .
People in line often tell him how they ’ll spend it -- on hamburgers , ice cream and other treats they ca n’t get at the shelters .
He knows they ’re as likely to spend it on booze and drugs .
But he says he does n’t care .
That ’s not the point .
The point is to show them that they are not forgotten .
The first $ 100 bill he pulled from his black leather wallet went to an older man with a scraggly gray beard , worn watch cap and sweat shirt .
“ Thank you , father .
Merry Christmas , ” the man said , smiling for a dozen television cameras .

But after Joe Roberson had wheeled out of range , he climbed out of the chair , gripped the back handles and pushed it across 5th Street .
Roberson , 63 , says he ’s a Vietnam veteran from Shreveport , La. , and that he ’s usually in the wheelchair because of his bad back .
He ’s lived at downtown ’s Madison Hotel for nine years and said he planned to spend his $ 100 on canned goods and gifts for his friends at the hotel .
Oh , and blackjack .
Roberson likes to play at the Commerce Casino .
“ I have good days and bad days , mostly bad days now , ” he said as Maria Loera , 70 , wheeled by with her $ 100 .
A dwarf who stands 53 inches tall , Loera said she would save her money to replace her 2 1/2 - year - old electric wheelchair .

The chair , she said , has failing brakes and is down to one slow gear .
It cost $ 5,500 , but Medicare wo n’t replace it until it ’s 5 years old , she said .
“ I ’m trying to find a bargain maybe someplace , ” said Loera , who lives at the King Edward Hotel .
Chase ’s giveaways often take hours , and the line was still a block long and several people wide just before 11 a.m. when Tony House , 45 , spoke through rotting teeth .
He lifted his sweat shirt to show a hernia jutting from his belly .
Chase gave him $ 20 .
House crossed the street and headed for a store where he said he would buy some juice .
Then he would sleep off his pain near the Greyhound bus station .

Sometimes Chase gives pregnant women or mothers $ 100 , sometimes $ 20 -- but there ’s no guarantee .
Lisa Erwin ’s family of three received $ 6 .
Erwin , 40 , had seen the priest before and expected $ 6 to $ 20 .
She and her partner , Edwin Scott , 50 , planned to spend the money on milk , potato chips and McDonald ’s French fries for their 2 - year - old son , Eddie .
They ’ve been living on skid row for only a few months , Erwin said , but Eddie , who has blue eyes and blondish - brown hair , is already a regular .
As his parents towed him in a red wagon up 5th Street on Tuesday , strangers stopped to say “ Merry Christmas , ” watch Eddie suck his red lollipop and make him laugh .
One woman gave him a dollar .
Eddie smiled and handed it to his father .
They moved up the street , toward the shelter where Eddie and his mother live .
His father sleeps in a tent nearby , on the sidewalk at 3rd and San Pedro streets .

The couple , originally from the San Fernando Valley , had been living in Arizona , across the border from a casino where Scott worked , Erwin said .
They moved to Los Angeles this year for better jobs .
The jobs fell through , and they ran through their savings four months ago .
Scott said he had saved $ 500 for a new apartment .
Erwin said she had lined up a job as a homeless outreach worker on skid row .
She said she worried that nights on the streets were turning Scott too sarcastic , that in his absence her son was growing up angry .
They dream of camping out in the woods and planting a garden .
“ We ’ll get out of here , ” Erwin said as they walked away from Chase .
“ It just takes time . ”
Behind them , Anthony Cernas , 7 , waited his turn in line with his mother .
He was dreaming of a bicycle she could n’t afford after she lost her minimum - wage job at a Shoe Warehouse .
Advertisement
Chase gave Anthony $ 2 -- not enough for a bike .
Then he gave Anthony ’s mom $ 20 .
He would get his bicycle after all .
As the pair crossed Towne Avenue in search of a toy store that might be open Christmas Day , Chase handed two of his last dollar bills to a man in a blue watch cap who looked as if he was about to cry .
Patrick Givens , 44 , said he thought he was through with skid row .
The truck driver had spent seven months getting sober in a Pasadena program , moved into a halfway house downtown and even reconciled with his former wife .
Last week , he said , they bought a tree and presents for their two children .
Advertisement
Then his former wife called to say she ’d changed her mind about getting back together .
Givens said he drove to their house Wednesday night , gave his son $ 300 to buy the Sidekick cellphone he wanted for Christmas and then hit the streets “ to swallow my sorrow . ”
Two days ago , he lost the keys to his 2004 Kia .
He was waiting for a tow truck to unlock and start the car Christmas morning , feeling ashamed and missing his kids , when he heard about the free money .
He got in line .
But when he received the $ 2 , Givens was n’t sure what to do with it .
Two dollars would n’t buy a decent high .
It might buy a beer , he said , but he ’d decided to end his binge .
He needed to clear his head .
Maybe , he said , once the tow truck arrived , he would drive to his former wife ’s house .
She and the kids would be wondering where he was .
He would explain .
Then he would go to a hospital detox program and return to rehab .
He just needed some gas .
That $ 2 , he said , would come in handy after all .

Hillary Clinton has many admirable qualities , but candor and openness and transparency and a commitment to well - established fact have not been notable among them .
The indisputable elements of her Bosnian adventure affirm ( again ) the reluctant conclusion I reached in the final chapter of A Woman In Charge , my biography of her published last June :
“ Since her Arkansas years [ I wrote ] , Hillary Rodham Clinton has always had a difficult relationship with the truth ...
[ J ]udged against the facts , she has often chosen to obfuscate , omit , and avoid .
It is an understatement by now that she has been known to apprehend truths about herself and the events of her life that others do not exactly share .
" [ italics added ]
As I noted : “ Almost always , something holds her back from telling the whole story , as if she does n’t trust the reader , listener , friend , interviewer , constituent — or perhaps herself — to understand the true significance of events … ”
The Bosnian episode is a watershed event , because it indelibly brings to mind so many examples of this tendency– from the White House years and , worse , from Hillary Clinton ’s take - no - prisoners presidential campaign .
Her record as a public person is replete with “ misstatements ” and elisions and retracted and redacted and revoked assertions ...
When the facts surrounding such characteristic episodes finally get sorted out - usually long after they have been challenged - the mysteries and contradictions are often dealt with by Hillary Clinton and her apparat in a blizzard of footnotes , addenda , revision , and disingenuous re-explanation : as occurred in regard to the draconian secrecy she imposed on her health - care task force ( and its failed efforts in 1993 - 94 ) ; explanations of what could have been dutifully acknowledged , and deserved to be dismissed as a minor conflict of interest - once and for all - in Whitewater ; or her recent Michigan - Florida migration from acceptance of the DNC ’s refusal to recognize those states ’ convention delegations ( when it looked like she had the nomination sewn up ) to her re-evaluation of the matter as a grave denial of basic human rights , after she fell impossibly behind in the delegate count .
The latest episode - the sniper fire she so vividly remembered and described in chilling detail to buttress her claims of foreign policy “ experience ” - like the peace she did n’t bring to Northern Ireland , recalls another famous instance of faulty recollection during a crucial period in her odyssey .
On January 15 , 1995 , she had just published her book , It Takes a Village , intended to herald a redemptive “ come back ” after the ravages of health care ; Whitewater ; the Travel Office firings she had ordered ( but denied ordering ) ; the disastrous staffing of the White House by the First Lady , not the President - all among the egregious errors that had led to the election of the Newt Gingrich Congress in 1994 .
On her book tour , she was asked on National Public Radio about the re-emergence of dormant Whitewater questions that week , when the so - called “ missing billing records ” had been found .
Hillary stated with unequivocal certainty that she had consistently made public all the relevant documents related to Whitewater , including “ every document we had , ” to the editors of the New York Times before the newspaper ’s original Whitewater story ran during Bill Clinton ’s 1992 presidential campaign .
Even her closest aides - as in the case of the Bosnian episode18 years later - could not imagine what possessed her to say such a thing .
It was simply not true , as her lawyers and the editors of the Times ( like CBS in the latest instance ) recognized , leading to huge stories about her latest twisting of the facts .
“ Oh my God , we did n’t , ” said Susan Thomasas , Hillary ’s great friend , who was left to explain to the White House lawyers exactly how Hillary ’s aides had carefully cherry - picked documents accessed for the Times in the presidential campaign .
The White House was forced - once again - to acknowledge the first lady had been ‘ mistaken ; ” her book tour was overwhelmed by the matter , and Times ’ columnist Bill Safire that month coined the memorable characterization of Hillary Clinton as “ a congenital liar . ”
“ Hillary values context ; she does see the big picture .
Hers , in fact , is not the mind of a conventional politician , ” I wrote in A Woman In Charge .
“ But when it comes to herself , she sees with something less than candor and lucidity .
She sees , like so many others , what she wants to see . ”
The book concludes with this paragraph :
“ As Hillary has continued to speak from the protective shell of her own making , and packaged herself for the widest possible consumption , she has misrepresented not just facts but often her essential self .
Great politicians have always been marked by the consistency of their core beliefs , their strength of character in advocacy , and the self - knowledge that informs bold leadership .
Almost always , Hillary has stood for good things .
Yet there is a disconnect between her convictions and her words and actions .
This is where Hillary disappoints .
But the jury remains out .
She still has time to prove her case , to effectuate those things that make her special , not fear them or camouflage them .
We would all be the better for it , because what lies within may have the potential to change the world , if only a little . ”
The jury - armed with definitive evidence like the CBS tape of Hillary Clinton ’s Bosnian adventure - seems on the verge of returning a negative verdict on her candidacy .
A third red spot has appeared alongside the Great Red Spot and Red Spot Jr. in the turbulent Jovian atmosphere .
The visible - light images were taken on May 9 and 10 with Hubble 's Wide Field and Planetary Camera 2 .
On Earth , hurricanes form and dissipate in a matter of days .
On Jupiter , storms can rage for years or even centuries .
The Great Red Spot , a colossal storm twice the diameter of our planet , has lasted at least 300 years .
But now that mother of all storms is shrinking just as other spots emerge to challenge its status .
Observations of cloud cover over the past decade or so have suggested the huge , oval tempest was getting smaller as Jupiter 's climate changes .
But such observations are tricky because it's hard to find the edges of the storm compared with nearby clouds on the visible surface of a gas planet that is entirely shrouded in colorful clouds .
Nearby storms can nip off parts of the giant storm , and in turn the Great Red Spot can consume nearby clouds .
However , wind velocity data collected from 1996 to 2006 has allowed scientists to size up the storm more accurately by analyzing wind speeds and directions .
" The velocity data show that the Red Spot has been shrinking along its major diameter by about 15 percent over that period , " said Xylar Asay - Davis , who conducted the study along with Phil Marcus , Mike Wong and Imke de Pader at the University of California at Berkeley .
Not dying
The finding agrees with other studies of cloud cover , Asay - Davis said , and it puts the conclusion on more solid footing .
" Velocity is a more robust measurement because the clouds associated with the Red Spot are also strongly influenced by numerous other phenomena in the surrounding atmosphere , " he said .
It 's not clear yet why the storm is shrinking , but after 300 years of hanging in there , the spot is in no danger of disappearing anytime soon , Asay - Davis said .
It continues to kick up winds that routinely exceed 300 mph .
" We find that the Red Spot has been shrinking but not slowing down , " Asay - Davis told SPACE.com .
There is a balance of energy flowing in and out of the storm , either as it mixes with the surrounding atmosphere , consumes smaller storms , or when energy is radiated into space , he explained .
" We do n't fully understand all the sources of energy , or the ways the Red Spot loses energy , but these can become slightly imbalanced for a period of time , and this is likely to be what is causing the Red Spot to shrink -- less energy is being fed in and more is slowly dissipating away , " he said .
Asay - Davis and colleagues have used images from the Cassini spacecraft from the year 2000 to construct the highest resolution " velocity map " to date , showing wind speed over the whole planet between - 70 and 70 degrees latitude .
Gusts on Jupiter typically reach 250 mph .
The research was presented in November at a meeting of the American Physical Society fluid dynamics division .
Climate change
The ongoing research aims to grasp Jupiter 's overall , complex and changing climate .
The giant planet underwent a major upheaval from 2005 to 2007 when " a bunch of unusual weather patterns and color changes occurred all over the planet , " Asay - Davis said .
The changes spawned the Little Red Spot in 2006 , a plucky storm whose size and speed could eventually rival its big brother , other scientists say .
" In terms of maximum wind speed , the Little Red Spot as measured in 2007 and the Great Red Spot when last measured in 2000 are just about the same , " Andrew Cheng , a physicist at Johns Hopkins University said last May .
The Great Red Spot may not go away , but its status could be challenged .
" The Great Red Spot may not always be the largest and strongest storm on Jupiter , " said Glenn Orton , a planetary scientist at NASA 's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena , Calif .
What 's going on
Back in 2004 , Marcus , a mechanical engineer at Berkeley , predicted that in 2006 or so , climate changes in Jupiter 's southern hemisphere would destabilize jet streams and spawn new storms .
" We think that upheavals might be related to the way that vortices move heat around the planet -- when there are many vortices , they are very efficient at moving heat all the way from the equator to the poles , " Asay - Davis explained .
" But when there are fewer , they are likely to be much less efficient . "
Back in 1998 to 2000 , three large storms , all white ovals , merged .
That might have had a big impact on the entire planet 's climate .
" The south pole may be getting colder , while the equator gets a bit warmer , " Asay - Davis said .
" The recent upheaval may have been Jupiter 's way of adjusting or compensating for this climate change .
Eventually , we may see new vortices form that will mix up the heat again .
We hope that we can continue to produce wind field maps of Jupiter so as to keep monitoring the climate in the years and decades to come . "

U.S. baseball to play 4 games in Cary
The Associated Press
DURHAM - The U.S. Olympic baseball team will play four exhibition games in North Carolina before heading to the Beijing Games .
USA Baseball officials on Tuesday announced the team 's pre-Olympic schedule .
The U.S. will play Canada once at USA Baseball 's national training complex in Cary on Aug. 1 , and three times in Durham on Aug. 2 - 4 .
The Americans have qualified for the Olympics in baseball for the first time since winning the gold at the Sydney Games in 2000 ....
Mehdi Army fighters in Basra have defied government calls to disarm British forces have become directly involved in the fighting in Basra , as clashes continue between the Iraqi army and militiamen of the Mehdi Army .
The UK military said troops had launched artillery shells at a mortar crew in the al - Khalaf area of northern Basra , which had fired on Iraqi troops .
It is the first time they have directly joined the fighting since the Iraqi army operation began on Tuesday .
The British Army spokesman in Basra said the engagement had been a success .
' Complicated operation ' Iraqi government forces have been trying to wrest control of Basra and other Shia areas from the Mehdi Army - a Shia militia loyal to the radical cleric Moqtada Sadr .
I think we need to be prepared for this to run for a while
British army spokesman Major Tom Holloway
Militia defy call to disarm Across Iraq , fighting has claimed an estimated 200 lives since Tuesday .
The Iraqi Prime Minister , Nouri Maliki , has given the Mehdi Army until 8 April to lay down their arms - which they have refused to do .
In Basra , Britain has been playing a back - up role in the operations .
British aircraft have been patrolling the skies , but have not been used to attack .
The British army spokesman in Basra , Major Tom Holloway , told BBC News 24 that Saturday 's artillery was fired from the British base at Basra airport , following a request from Iraqi ground forces , who had been fired on by the mortar team .
It was part of the support plan already in place , he said .
" I would n't describe it as an escalation .
Of course , we have n't fired before , this is the first time , but this is something we were always ready to do . "
On whether British troops could end up going back into the city , he said : " We are here supporting Iraqi forces , and I think they 've said in the past they do n't foresee us coming into the city .
" British forces here plan on a wide variety of contingencies , and it would be inappropriate of me to discuss future plans . "
He said the Iraqi action in Basra was a " complicated operation " .
" I think we need to be prepared for this to run for a while . "
He also said artillery was used by the British troops " reasonably regularly " , but this was the first time during the current fighting .
' Stiffer resistance ' US jets also bombed two sites in the north of Basra during the day , targeting what it said were militant strongholds , according to the UK military .
The BBC's Adam Brookes , in Baghdad , said the US and British involvement in the fighting in Basra appeared to have started to grow in the last couple of days .
This meant the Iraqi armed forces were meeting much stiffer resistance than they expected , and were asking the coalition for help , he said .
" I would anticipate the British commanders will now be calculating - should these requests for help continue to come , just how much help they are able or willing to give an Iraqi operation that seems to be running into trouble . "
Basra was taken by British forces in 2003 .
They withdrew from the city to the airport last autumn , and handed over security to Iraqi forces in December .

What are these ?
Techies , VCs , and the press are always swooning over the glory of the Bay area .
This is where all the excitement , the money , and the people are , they say .
And that ’s true to the extent that your great big idea fits the current cultural mold of that environment .
If you ’re looking to build the next web 2.0 social media eyeball - collecting application , do n’t want to worry about boring details like revenues , and hope to either flip to Google for an early $ 20 million or get that Facebook billion - dollar valuation , the Bay area is exactly where you want to be .
No where else do you have the connections , the people , and the atmosphere available to make that dream happen .
But this strain of startups is a highly inbred line that holds more risks than most people realize .
It ’s not that they never work financially , enough people are sipping Margaritas on sunny beaches from towering buyouts to prove the contrary .
And it ’s not that they do n’t work socially — I personally enjoy YouTube as much as the next guy .
It ’s that the Bay area pipeline for building web businesses is n’t optimized to carry much else than these stereotypes .
Other people ’s money
If your idea for a web business is more along the lines of the mundane “ product * price = profit ” ( 3P ) variety , I think the culture of San Francisco and that famous 20 - mile radius around Stanford is anything but helpful .
I might even go as far as say it ’s downright harmful .
The flush availability of other people ’s money is simply too tempting .
When you ’re not spending your own money , it ’s easy to splash on a big open office on day one , a staff of 10 + in no time , and have few worries about paying the bills on the 1st of the month .
It takes away much of the urgency to make money that I think is critical to build sustainable businesses .
It gives you too many resources to be satisfied building simple tools for niche markets .
Everything becomes about catching that huge wave .
Fighting for talent
And besides the simple temptation of having a few million dollars in the bank account — even though they ’re not really yours and probably never will be — it breeds an asset bubble for everything else .
When tons of half - baked startups out there have a million - dollar bank roll , they ’re going to be looking pretty sharp when shopping for talent .
If you ’re a programmer or designer working in this area , you probably have more than a few friends or acquaintances who got filthy rich simply being on the ground floor of Google or YouTube or some other company that either made them a millionaire through acquisition or IPO .
Are you really going to be interested working for a company that simply aims to make a few measly millions for the first couple of years ?
Why settle for something that ’ll take 5 , 7 , 10 years to mature when you can instead just hop from company to company every 6 - 18 months in search of that lottery ticket .
So while there is undoubtedly legions of good people available , you ’re unlikely to be able to hire or retain them in an environment where every business magazine cover of is telling people that the next billionaire is even younger than the previous .
No wonder people feel stressed out to make it huge before they ’re 30 and will jump at any opportunity that looks like this might be it .
But where else ?
If San Francisco , the Bay area , and Sillicon Valley are n’t good places to start a web business of the 3P variety , where is ?
Well , I ’d say just about any place but .
Basecamp came from Chicago / Copenhagen , FogBugz from New York , Campaign Monitor from Australia , Shopify from Ottawa , Freshbooks from Toronto , Blinksale from Texas , and there are tons of other applications of the same ilk that come from all over the world .
So stop worrying to much about where you are and start worrying about how you ’re going to make your business succeed the old fashion way :
Through having a better product than the competition that people are willing to pay for .

Godwin this .
During this week ’s guest stint I ’ve managed to touch on Palestine - Israel , the New Deal , and Michel Foucault .
Steering clear of the real killer tripwires — i.e. , sex roles , the Democratic primaries , or emacs / vi — that leaves a final frontier of Internet mischief … .
On this day in 1945 , only three days after the occupation of their city by French troops , the remaining full professors of the University of Freiburg assembled to elect new officers and to restore the customs under which they had operated before 1933 , when their faculty , racially purged by the Nazis , elected as rector the philosopher Martin Heidegger .
( All details here come from Hugo Ott ; see more at the footnote . )
1
This is not a parable or an analogy .
It is a story of one episode in which civil authorities and academic governing bodies reckoned with a disastrous crossover between scholarship and politics .
One of the first orders of business for the reassembled professors was the question of what to do about Nazis among their colleagues .
They chartered an internal review committee for the purpose , and tried to keep jurisdiction over this process , without success .
City authorities were conducting their own reviews , and they designated Heidegger ’s house , among others , as a “ Party residence ” to be requisitioned for use .
The university protested , based on the opinion of legal scholar Franz Böhm ( an anti-Nazi dismissed from his post during Hitler ’s regime ) that for “ establishing political guilt ” one needed “ a proper court of law . ”
The French occupation authorities had actual jurisdiction over such cases , and they appointed a trio of professors who had been imprisoned under the Nazis to act and speak for the university .
These three became the nucleus of the university ’s denazification commission , which in due course all but let Heidegger off .
Their report in September 1945 acknowledged that he had stirred up the students against “ reactionary ” professors , that he
played an active part in transforming the university constitution in line with the “ leadership principle ” and in introducing the outward forms of Hitlerism ( e.g. the Hitler salute … ) into academic life … he penalized or sacrificed persons who were opposed to the Nazis , and even contributed directly to National Socialist election propaganda … .
But he had been rector only a year before falling out with the party ; as his onetime friend Karl Jaspers would later write , “ the special brand of National Socialism he concocted for himself had precious little to do with the real thing . ”
The report concluded that as “ [ i] t would be a serious and lamentable loss ” for someone as famous as Heidegger to go .
He should do a limited amount of teaching , and no administration or examination .
The French military government declared Heidegger “ disponible , ” which was all but harmless .
One professor and member of the commission , Adolf Lampe , dissented .
Along with Böhm and another anti-Nazi , Walter Eucken , Lampe began protesting formally .
Böhm , the lawyer who had from the start urged a regard for procedure , noted that other academics had already suffered harsher punishments for their connection with the Nazis , and Heidegger should not therefore get off lightly ; justice , as Böhm saw it , would have failed if it reached this inequitable conclusion .
He wrote in October ,
it makes me very bitter to think that one of the principal intellectual architects of the political betrayal of Germany ’s universities … should merely have been subjected to the stricture of “ disponibilité ” , and clearly feels no need at all to answer for the consequences of his actions .
Observing Heidegger going about his business , agreeing to give lectures and generally enjoying the privileges of academic life again , Lampe concurred : “ It must therefore be concluded that Herr Heidegger — contrary to what is assumed in the report placed before us by our denazification commission — has not undergone that radical change in his political thinking ….
In the absence of such a change we had no business to exonerate Herr Heidegger … . ”
The French occupation authorities tried to defuse the growing crisis by offering to move Heidegger to the university at Tübingen .
But Tübingen would not have him .
So with the government unwilling to do much , the case against Heidegger became , Hugo Ott writes , “ a purely internal affair ” to the University of Freiburg .
Heidegger asked that the faculty consult the philosopher Karl Jaspers for his opinion .
Jaspers had fallen out with Heidegger in the 1930s as Heidegger became more evidently enamored of Hitler and Nazism .
Jaspers wrote reluctantly but damningly , arguing
In our present situation the education of the younger generation needs to be handled with the utmost responsibility and care .
Total academic freedom should be our ultimate goal , but this can not be achieved overnight .
Heidegger ’s mode of thinking , which seems to me to be fundamentally unfree , dictatorial and uncommunicative , would have a very damaging effect on students at the present time … .
He should be suspended from teaching duties for several years , after which there should be a review of the situation based on his subsequent published work and in the light of changing academic circumstances .
The question that must then be asked is whether the restoration of full academic freedom is a justifiable risk , bearing in mind that views hostile to the idea of the university , and potentially damaging to it when propounded with intellectual distinction , may well be promoted in the lecture room .
Whether or not such a situation arises will depend on the course of political events and the evolution of our civic spirit .
In sum Jaspers recommended Heidegger be pensioned off and permitted to publish , but not to teach .
Full academic freedom required a marked recovery of the body politic , a restored civic spirit , and confidence in the resilience of the young .
In the middle of January , 1946 — nine months after reconstituting itself — the University Senate largely adopted Jaspers ’s views , denying Heidegger permission to teach , and saying he would be “ expected to maintain a low profile at public functions and gatherings of the University . ”
In December , 1946 , the French military government went a bit further , denying Heidegger his pension , but changed its mind about that in May 1947 .
So the ban on Heidegger ’s teaching stayed firm until 1949 , when the Faculty of Philosophy persuaded the university Senate to lift it , though not by an overwhelming or unbitter vote , and Heidegger was clear to lecture in 1950 - 51 .
From
Ott ’s account it appears that throughout the nine months it took to come to a resolution in the Heidegger case , university and government authorities influenced each other and that the opinions of academic experts within the academy — particularly Jaspers — carried a great deal of weight outside it .
Heidegger ’s critics within the university wanted him to pay a price as determined by a set of legitimate procedures .
And they — especially Jaspers — weighed academic freedom in the balance , carefully enough to believe it merited support for Heidegger ’s continued publishing career , but not for his teaching career until society had recovered to the point where it could sustain the onslaught of his dictatorial mode of thought .

Consumers in the United States did not spend as much in fourth quarter as expected and the reasons were clear : Lack of jobs , high energy costs , and home foreclosures .
In fact , consumer confidence in the economy hit a record low as the new year dawned , according to data collected by the Associated Press / Ipsos monthly RBC Cash Index .
Confidence in December was at 65.9 points -- using a 2002 benchmark of 100 points -- but slid to 56.3 points this past week .
In January 2007 the confidence level came in at 95.3 points .
" People are anxious because everything sounds pretty awful these days , " Bill Cheney , chief economist at John Hancock Financial Services Group , told the Associated Press .
Consumers cited reasons for feeling gloomy : Hiring stalled in December ( with the exception of government jobs ; ) home values have decreased due to record foreclosures ; credit for big - ticket items is more difficult to secure ; and gasoline and heating oil costs hold to their records .
" Consumers are gloomy .
The confidence reading suggests that people believe bad times are upon us , " wrote Richard Yamarone , economist at Argus Research .
Consumers also pointed fingers at the White House for recent troubles .
President George W. Bush 's approval rating in January slipped three percentage points to 33 percent .
However the White House has stated it plans to introduce an economic package , which will most likely be laid out during the president 's State of the Union address .
Officials are calling it a " rescue plan " and have signaled a possible tax break for some , and freezing mortgage lending rates on some jumbo loans .
Federal Reserve chairman Ben Bernanke stated yesterday that he would keep lowering interest rates to boost economic activity .
The Fed meets January 29 - 30 , and it is now widely expected to drop the rate by 0.5 percent .
Weak home values , harder - to - get credit , and high energy prices " seem likely to weigh on consumer spending as we move into 2008 , " Bernanke said yesterday .
The RBC consumer confidence index was based upon responses from 1,027 adults surveyed Monday through Wednesday this week .
Since Linus Torvalds presentation at Google about git in May 2007 , the adoption and interest for Distributed Version Control Systems has been constantly rising .
We will introduce the concept of Distributed Version Control , see when to use it , why it may be better than what you 're currently using , and have a look at three actors in the area : git , Mercurial and Bazaar .
What ?
A Version Control System ( or SCM ) is responsible for keeping track of several revisions of the same unit of information .
It 's commonly used in software development to manage source code project .
The historical and first project VCS of choice was CVS started in 1986 .
Since then many other SCM have flourished with their specific advantages over CVS : Subversion ( 2000 ) , Perforce ( 1995 ) , CVSNT ( 1998 ) , ...
In December 1999 , in order to manage the mainline kernel sources , Linus chose BitKeeper described as " the best tool for the job " .
Prior to this Linus was integrating each patch manually .
While all its predecessors were working in a Client - ( Central ) Server model BitKeeper was the first VCS to allow a truly distributed system in which everybody owns their own master copy .
Due to licensing conflicts , BitKeeper was later abandoned in favor of git ( Apr , 2005 ) .
Other systems following the same model are available : Mercurial ( Apr , 2005 ) , Bazaar ( Mar , 2005 ) , darcs ( Nov , 2004 ) , Monotone ( Apr , 2003 ) .
Why ?
Or a more precise question : Why Central VCS ( and notably Subversion ) are not satisfying ?
Several things are blamed on Subversion :
Major reason is that branching is easy but merging is a pain ( but one does n't go without the other ) .
And it 's likely that any consequent project you 'll work on will need easy gymnastic with splits , dev , test branches .
Subversion has no History - aware merge capability , forcing its users to manually track exactly which revisions have been merged between branches making it error - prone .
No way to push changes to another user ( without submitting to the Central Server ) .
Subversion fails to merge changes when files or directories are renamed .
The trunk / tags / branches convention can be considered misleading .
Offline commits are not possible .
. svn files pollute your local directories .
files pollute your local directories .
svn:external can be harmful to handle .
can be harmful to handle .
Performance
The modern DVCS fixed those issues with both their own implementation tricks and from the fact that they were distributed .
But as we will see in conclusion , Subversion did not resign yet .
How ?
Decentralization
Distributed Version Control Systems take advantage of the peer - to - peer approach .
Clients can communicate between each other and maintain their own local branches without having to go through a Central Server / Repository .
Then synchronization takes place between the peers who decide which changesets to exchange .
This results in some striking differences and advantages from a centralized system :
No canonical , reference copy of the codebase exists by default ; only working copies .
exists by default ; only working copies .
Disconnected operations : Common operations such as commits , viewing history , diff , and reverting changes are fast , because there is no need to communicate with a central server .
Even if a central server can exist ( for stable , reference or backup version ) , if Distribution is well used it should n't be as much queried as in a CVCS schema .

Even if a central server can exist ( for stable , reference or backup version ) , if Distribution is well used it should n't be as much queried as in a CVCS schema .
Each working copy is effectively a remoted backup of the codebase and change history , providing natural security against data loss .

Collaboration between peers made easy .
For an introduction to DVCS collaboration pratices , you might have a look at the Intro to Distributed Version Control ( Illustrated ) or possible Collaboration workflows .
You should also be aware that there are some disadvantages in opting for DVCS , notably in term of complexity ;
This decentralized view is very different from Central world and it might need some time to get used to for your developers .
Changeset tracking instead of file tracking can also be confusing even if very powerful and making it theoritically possible to track method move through file .
Who ?
The battle rages on !
Some of the Good and the Bad .
The good and the bad essentially from an updated ( because some old arguments are not true anymore ) compilation of blogs and my personal experience .
You should notice that it is a very short list of features ( ie git has more than 150 commands ) , and some issues might be more critical than others .
You should notice that in the survey , there was no option to choose Ruby as proficient language .
Should be interesting to add it for survey 2008 .
It 's also funny to see that ~ 1/3 of people use Distributed VCS ( here git ) in collaboration with ... 0 or 1 person !
Guis
gitk on Linux TortoiseHg on Windows OliveGtk on Linux
The guis look nearly the same with a preference for the effectiveness of gitk .
TortoiseHg ( with folder watch activated ) was really slow with a big repository like Mozilla .
A quick and non-exhaustive look at performance
Conditions of the bench
git is still leading the performance battle , but Hg and Bzr have made great improvements in the past year .
You should notice that Mercurial doubles the number of files in your repository ( the historic is kept per file in .hg / store /data ) .
It does n't seem to be a good choice for Windows system running on NTFS .
It 's also interesting to see that git takes a big advantage of the system when executing command .
While Hg and Bzr do not spend a big proportion of time in system , Git can take up to 10 - 40 % cpu time within system call , which raises the question as to how it will perform on Windows system where the git - developers wo n't have access to all the system performance trick they are used to with Linux .
Single Merges and Merge Queues should be tested , this is a tiedous part to benchmark .
Benchmarks should also be run on Windows as :
Even if your server is running on * nix , many developers are still having a Windows environment at work and DVCS transfered more processing on the developer station Performance might be really different on Windows machine .
When ?
Experience stories .
I had the chance to catch up with Kelly O'Hair from Sun about its choice for Hg for OpenJDK .
Sebastien Auvray : I read the reasons for migrating from TeamWare to Mercurial but had remaining questions .
Did you simply follow OpenSolaris choice ?
Kelly O'Hair :
To some degree yes , but the OpenSolaris choice also became the Sun wide choice to any Sun Software teams having to convert .
The OpenSolaris investigation was pretty complete and they had all the exact requirements we had .
We had to convert for OpenJDK , because TeamWare was unacceptable for an open source project , the answer of Mercurial was pretty obvious for us .
Or did you do a refreshed tournament and tried the other DVCS again ( git , ... ) ?
We did not do a detailed re-investigation , that seemed like a waste of time .
The only other possible choice in my view was git , and since git was n't giving Windows a priority , which we needed .
Again the choice was obvious .
OpenSolaris reports took place in April 2006 which is 2 years ago .
Understood .
Some things may have changed , git has improved , but the ball was rolling , and Mercurial was improving too .
Also did you encounter any specific problems in the migration ?
File permissions and ownership can be a problem in sharing a repository vis a NFS or UFS file system , so we finally setup a server to handle the shared repositories , the better way .
That could be made easier .
The other issue is that using hooks to rollback or filter pushes creates a window where someone could accidently pull changes that will be rolled back , so you have to use a pair of repositories , one for pushes and one for pulls , with an automatic sync after the hooks run to sync them up .
Using forests also introduces a problem because a forest push is just a set of individual pushes , and if one push failed , technically you would want to rollback all other pushes .
Nobody is doing this , and just taking their chances .
If the repositories in the forest are fairly independent , this is not a real problem .
In the day - to - day usage ?
Remains to be seen .
Change like this is easy for some , harder for others .
Given time , I think most people have and will adapt and learn to love it .
The concept of " working set files " ( having to do 'hg update ' ) and having to merge changesets that do n't seem to merge anything is confusing to people .
Also , the idea that they are pushing changesets and not files is something people have a problem with , " Why can't I just bringover this one file ? " .
What is better than TeamWare ?
Much much much faster than TeamWare .
Our teams in China and Russia are looking forward to full deployment because they do n't need to keep mirrors of integration areas .
Refreshes ( pulls ) are very fast over slow connections .
The state of the repository in Mercurial is well - defined , unlike TeamWare which allowed for partial workspaces , TeamWare was just a loose bag of individually managed files ( SCCS files ) .
The changeset concept was missing in TeamWare , along with the concept of well known simple state of the entire repository ( a simple changeset id ) .
Is there anything you 're missing from TeamWare ?
People are missing the email notifications and putback / bringover transaction history , but the changeset provides much of that .
What may be missing is somekind of repository transaction history , but again , email archives of Mercurial events could provide this .
Is Hg becoming the VCS of choice for Sun including internal projects ?
Or is Sun using it only for public projects that need openness ?
Both internal and external projects are converting , where it makes sense .
I 've seen a big increase in interest from internal projects that are taking the plunge .
I also caught up with Pierre d'Herbemont from VLC to get their opinion about git .
Sebastien Auvray : Firstly what was the version control system you were using prior to using Git ?
Pierre d'Herbemont : SVN and a git - svn mirror .
When did you migrate ?
We opened a git mirror of the svn tree , to ease VLC Google Summer of Code projects .
So that was back then .
Then we totally migrated to git on March 1st - 2nd 2008 .
Why did you chose Git over its competitors ?
Over SVN : Git is fast .
Branch is cheap .
Atomic Commits .
Rebasing on top of an other tree .
Over other distributed system : Proven user base ( Linux Kernel ) .
I have been successfully using it while working on Wine .
Git is sexy .
And Some core developers had experiences with Git , whereas no one has with Mercurial and such .
Nothing technical there .
Also did you encounter any specific problems in the migration ?
In the day - to - day usage ?
We encountered some troubles with Trac and buildbot .
Their support for Git is really minimal especially in their releases versions .
We had to checkout Builbot latest trunk .
For Trac we are using a crippled Git plugin .
Trac Git Plugin needs Trac 0.11 .
But Trac 0.11 is n't stable and has some known memleak that prevent us from switching .
So basically we are waiting for them to fix that ...
It took some times for some committers to get accustomed with Git .
But after two days , everything seemed fine .
And some Git- beginners starts to really enjoy Git .
So what ?
Choosing between Distributed VCS and Central VCS is far from being easy .
DVCS will definitely change the way you work and collaborate .
Subversion , one of the Central VCS leader , has not resigned yet in the performance and features battle , and 1.5 version should come up with good compromises .
It can count on its existing userbase and simplicity favor ( at the cost of some pain ) .
In very specific case like project dealing with large opaque binary files , Subversion would be better than DVCS because the client - side space usage stays constant .
Also if you use partial checkout heavily , svn will perform better ( but when massively used this reveals a problem in the setting of your modules ) .
Once you made the choice for either Distributed or Central solution , then it will also be hard to compare the competitors in their area as implementations / commands and at the end performances can be very different .
And there is no real existing benchmarks for the common operations .
In this hard battle , Bazaar lost many new really influencing early adopters ( Mozilla , Solaris , OpenJDK ) because of its poor performance of the beginning .
It also has to be said that Bazaar website is a lot more Marketing - oriented : by publicizing not - all - true differences with its competitors , or by publicizing benchmark comparison with its competitors only about Space efficiency while there 's no timing benchmark comparison of daily commands : diff , add , ...
I feel that even though the 3 projects started out at nearly the same time , bzr did face a lot more performance and design problem at the early beginning making it a bit less mature than its competitors now .
Yet unseen phenomenon , it seems as if some choices have emerged based on the language used by the communities : Java /
Sun related developments seem to be interested more in Mercurial while C / Linux / Ruby / Rails related projects are attracted by git .
Hope this article enlightened you and your experiences and feedbacks are always welcome !

Each command was run 8 times ( and the best and worst time were cut out ) .
They were done locally through the filesystem ( other protocol tests should definitely be done as even if DVCS are not coupled with a central server , network communications when badly implemented can lower user performance ) .
Version used are :
Repository consists in a snapshot of 12456 changesets ( from 20080303 , 70853 total revisions from the hg Repository ) , ~30000 files from Mozilla Repository ( originally hg formatted and translated into git repository thanks to hg - fast - export.sh for git and hg - fast - export.sh coupled with fast - import plugin for bazaar ) .
Default file formats were used and git repository size remained the same running git-gc ( which can be considered normal for a freshly migrated repository ) .
One file was modified ( dom/src / base/nsDOMClassInfo.cpp ) just like a benchmark test done by Jst 1.5 year ago .

WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
Where do fighter pilots traveling faster than the speed of sound go when they really need to " go " ?
Pilots have struggled for years with the lack of toilet facilities in flight .
Until recently , the answer has been : into a bag .
But it 's not a great solution .
" Piddle packs " -- heavy - duty bags containing absorbent sponges -- have been blamed for at least two crashes over the years , and they 're not always tidy .
A few years ago , after enduring years of complaints from pilots , the Air Force let it be known that it was looking for an answer .
A small medical equipment development company in Milton , Vermont answered the call .
" The DoD put out a list of projects they needed solutions for , " said Mark Harvie , president of Omni Medical Solutions .
" Bladder relief for pilots was one of the items on the list and we were looking for a new project , " he said .
Watch how apparatus makes it possible for pilots to drink up , fly high »
That project turned into the Advanced Mission Extender Device , known in military jargon as the AMXD .
After four years of testing by the Vermont Air National Guard and the Air Force and about $ 5 million in government and private funds , AMXD is spelling relief for pilots aloft .
Under the old system , pilots routinely avoid liquids before taking off to prevent the unmentionable .
But dehydration can make them more susceptible to the G - forces typically seen in fighter aircraft , Harvie said .
When nature 's call becomes too pressing to ignore , a pilot has to fly and unbuckle the harness at the same time -- while using both hands to maneuver around in a seat to which he or she is virtually molded .
The aerobatic maneuver is even harder for female pilots .
On long or cold - weather flights , the amount of gear and clothing made the maneuver nearly impossible , and pilots would sometimes have no choice but to relieve themselves in their flight suits .
In the AMXD , a cup for a man and a pad for a woman is strategically placed before the pilot dons a flight suit .
An instructional DVD tells pilots : " When the time comes to urinate , unzip the flight suit , remove the hose ....
The control unit will pump the urine from the cup to the collection bag , where it will be chemically gelled . "
See how the system works »
Pilots are free to think about other business .
Harvie said the reviews have been positive from pilots of both genders .
" One woman had the device taken away after testing and was quite unhappy about having to return to the old method , " he said .
" The AMXD worked as advertised .
I believe it 's a much better system and needs to be fielded ASAP , " says an unidentified pilot in a testimonial on the instructional DVD .
The Air Force recently bought its first 300 systems for U.S. pilots around the world at $ 2,000 each .
There 's room for expansion .
The air service has more than 4,200 fighter pilots who fly planes that have no bathrooms , planes like the F - 16 , F - 15 , A - 10 and the most advanced fighter , the F - 22 .
The system has already seen action in combat zones : Female helicopter pilots from the Netherlands used the system in Afghanistan .
Harvie said it 's too early to know whether the device will become standard issue , but it has attracted plenty of interest .
" The Navy and Army are starting to look at the system for ground troops and carrier pilots , and looking at a version for private - sector uses , " Harvie said .
Harvie said the Belgian Air Force has bought the system for its F - 16 pilots .

When it was published in 1968 , Carlos Castanedas groundbreaking ethnographic diary , The Teachings of Don Juan : A Yaqui Way of Knowledge , received enthusiastic reviews from both the academic community and mainstream critics .
Castaneda enjoyed immediate success and went on to write a series of sequels chronicling his apprenticeship to Don Juan Matus , a Yaqui Indian and sorcerer from Sonora , Mexico .
Combining anthropological observations with engrossing storytelling , The Teachings of Don Juan represented to many scholars an exciting new methodology in ethnographic literature , inspiring praise from such figures as Margaret Mead and Yaqui scholar Edward H. Spicer , who called the text a remarkable achievement . [ 1 ]
The doctoral committee at UCLA echoed Spicers esteem for Castaneda , awarding him a Ph.D. in 1972 for his third book , Journey to Ixtlan .
With fame came scrutiny , however , and the celebrity anthropologist soon met with controversy that would span his entire career .
Questions emerged over the existence of Don Juan , Castaneda ’s representation of Yaqui culture , and the basic authenticity of The Teachings as academics , scientists , and authors identified dubious elements in Castanedas ethnography .
Today , almost four decades after the book appeared and ten years since its authors death , the legacy of The Teachings of Don Juan is as much about the consequences of its debated legitimacy as it is about Carlos Castaneda himself .
Richard de Mille , son of Hollywood director Cecil B. de Mille , wrote two books on Castanedas published works and was one of his earliest and most outspoken detractors .
De Mille argued that Don Juan and his teachings are wholly counterfeit .
He presented a scathing indictment of academic malpractice , charging that the UCLA faculty and the University Press should be held accountable for a spurious work of scholarship .
A major point of contention among Castanedas critics is the conspicuous absence of evidence to support his claims that he actually did know and study under a Yaqui sorcerer named Don Juan .
When a university publishes an account of anthropological fieldwork , it is standard practice to require tangible proofs that the fieldwork actually took place .
With The Teachings of Don Juan , argues De Mille , this verification was never made .
He claims that basic support materials did not exist either , except in Castanedas highly developed imagination . [ 2 ]
De Mille suggests that the book was ultimately printed as a rebellious statement from marginalized sectors of the UCLA intelligentsia against more punctilious rivals .
In addition , the university press likely saw in Castanedas narrative a viable new youth market : wild - eyed denizens of the mushrooming counterculture , hungry for psychedelic yarns of Mexican Indians and peyote trips .
Regardless of the actual details of publication , the book did exceptionally well in both popular and scholarly markets , achieving unlikely success for a work shelved as anthropology .
In addition to its scientific classification , The Teachings of Don Juan bears the authoritative sub-heading , “ A Yaqui Way of Knowledge . ”
Many critics find fault with this title , noting that the character of Don Juan bears no resemblance to a Yaqui Indian .
Spicer , the anthropologist whose positive review lent early and enduring credibility to the text , admits in the same article that it is wholly gratuitous to emphasize , as the subtitle does , any connection between the subject matter of the book and the cultural traditions of the Yaquis . [ 3 ]
Although Don Juan is explicitly named as a Yaqui , Castaneda offers no details throughout the narrative to support this claim , and in fact depicts him engaging in activities associated with markedly dissimilar Indian cultures .
Don Juans use of peyote , datura , and psychotropic mushrooms , for example , is completely divergent from Yaqui tradition and more closely resembles Huichol and Navajo ritual practices .
Spicer theorizes that Don Juan , while perhaps of Yaqui descent , is more likely a cultural composite of various Indian and mestizo influences ; the subtitle , he assumes , was probably the work of a  publisher [ that ] went beyond Castanedas intention . [ 4 ]
Spicer is not the only Castaneda critic with relevant scientific experience .
Revered ethno- mycologist and early psychedelics proponent Gordon Wasson read The Teachings soon after its publication and wasted little time composing a letter to Castaneda .
Wassons questions , while politely worded , were directed to clear up what he felt to be anomalies in the mushroom rituals depicted in the book .
The notoriously candid Castaneda responded with uncharacteristic eagerness , no doubt excited to correspond with the man whose seminal writings on hallucinogenic fungi were a formative influence for him .
Yet his replies , as paraphrased in De Milles The Don Juan Papers , are curiously vague and evasive .
Most interesting is his answer to Wassons inquiries about Don Juans ethnic origin ; in response , Castaneda revises the rough biography offered in The Teachings , explaining that the sorcerer is not a pure Yaqui and therefore cannot be situated culturally , except in a guessing manner . [ 5 ]
As for the subtitle , Castaneda maintains that it was added per suggestion of the University Press who , prior to reading his manuscript , insisted on its inclusion to help categorize the book .
To imply that Don Juan is representative of all Yaquis , he says , was never his intention .
This admission stands in stark contrast to a comment made by the associate editor of the University Press who , in a letter to De Mille , states ,  The title of Castanedas book and the entire text are the work of the author . [ 6 ]
It seems then that Castaneda himself erroneously labeled his work as an exposition of a  Yaqui way of knowledge ,  and purposely so  but for what reason ?
De Mille suggests that , in aligning the book with a relatively obscure Indian tribe , Castaneda not only ascribed a scientific legitimacy to his account , but also sought to fashion a kind of red man no one had ever met ,  and in so doing , corner the market on a new pop-cultural archetype . [ 7 ]
With the overt nature of the subtitle in effect , whatever Don Juan teaches throughout the text becomes a  Yaqui way of knowledge by default .
It is then unnecessary for Castaneda to prove Don Juans  Yaqui - ness  to his readers ( unless of course , those readers happen to be Yaqui scholars , in which case he relies on clever obfuscation ) .
In the  Introduction to The Teachings , for example , Don Juans provenance is described quite briefly , and in rather broad terms :
 All he said was that he had been born in the Southwest in 1891 ; that he had spent nearly all his life in Mexico ; that in 1900 his family was exiled by the Mexican government to Central Mexico along with thousands of other Sonoran Indians . 
The  Yaqui Diaspora is well documented in the historical record , and little is offered in the way of authentication with this short synopsis .
Careful to avoid pigeonholing Don Juan into any recognizable ethnicity , Castaneda further muddies the image of his Indian with a caveat acknowledging the sorcerers murky heritage :  I was not sure ,  he maintains , whether to place the context of his knowledge totally in the culture of the Sonoran Indians .
But it is not my intention here to determine his precise cultural milieu . 
Prefacing the book with this disclaimer , Castaneda effectively shields his ethnography from charges of misrepresentation and fashions his depiction of the  Yaqui sorcerer in such a manner as to render the Indian cultureless  or as Spicer phrases it , suspended in cultural limbo . 
Don Juans origin is thus couched in ambiguity and skillfully blurred , rendering him both inoffensive to discerning critics and appealingly enigmatic to the lay reader .
However innocuous his presentation might appear , Don Juan nevertheless aroused the suspicions of more skeptical readers who exposed further aberrations in Castanedas work .
As the series progressed , many critics observed glaring discrepancies in the details and chronologies of events , as well as a general drift in tone from scholarly observation towards more whimsical storytelling .
Yet even with his first book , Castaneda ’s literary techniques invited some serious scrutiny .
The Teachings of Don Juan is allegedly a translation of the anthropologists field notes from Spanish to English , with occasional bracketed asides imparting the polyglot Indians original dialogue .
Why is it then , wondered some critics , that Don Juan tutors Carlos solely in their lingua franca  especially when certain concepts would doubtless be more genuinely articulated in his native tongue ?
The conspicuous absence of Yaqui terminology in the text raised the eyebrows of more than one scholar in Castanedas audience , and prominent critics such as Spicer , Wasson , and De Mille sounded the alarm to this anomaly .
In his letter to Carlos , Wasson inquires whether he managed to gather any Yaqui translations of the recurring philosophical terms Don Juan uses in his teachings .
Castaneda replies that he has , indeed , learned a few Yaqui words but is loath to expound further on the issue .
De Mille is far less congenial in his disputation , pointing out that the young anthropologist apparently learned not one word of Yaqui during his first five years with Don Juan ,  and then in later writings , makes reference to only two , rather commonplace terms . [ 8 ]
Spanish expressions abound , on the other hand , as Castaneda repeatedly employs the words brujo and diablero to denote those experienced in the knowledge of Yaqui sorcery .
Conveniently for Castaneda , brujo is sometimes used in Yaqui culture to refer to dabblers in black magic .
The nature of sorcery as practiced by Don Juan , however , differs strikingly from that traditionally understood to exist in Yaqui society .
Anthropologist Muriel Thayer Painter notes that , according to Yaqui belief , those persons that practice witchcraft ( i.e. , sorcery ) are timorous and feeble  both traits utterly incongruous with Don Juans depiction as a man who has vanquished fear  and is remarkably fit , despite his advanced age .
Furthermore , the knowledge of witchcraft is thought by the Yaquis to be an inborn quality ,  a power that can not be taught or inherited .
This statement directly contradicts Castanedas accounts of the art of Yaqui sorcery as a cycle of apprenticeship handed down across generations from a benefactor to his chosen man . 
In her book With Good Heart : Yaqui Beliefs and Ceremonies in Pascua Village , Painter presents a sampling of Yaqui vocabulary associated with spirituality :  morea ,  an equivalent to the Spanish brujo ; saurino ,  used to describe persons with the gift of divination ; and  seataka ,  or spiritual power , a word which is fundamental to Yaqui thought and life . [ 9 ]
It is indeed hard to believe that Castaneda ’s benefactor , a self - professed Yaqui , would fail to employ these native expressions throughout the apprenticeship .
In omitting such intrinsically relevant terms from his ethnography , Castaneda critically undermines his portrait of Don Juan as a bona fide Yaqui sorcerer .
Linguistic concerns aside , the Indian depicted in The Teachings of Don Juan departs from traditional Yaqui behavior in other significant ways , most notably in his usage of entheogenic plants such as peyote and psilocybe mushrooms .
As Spicer and several others have argued , Don Juans psychedelic forays are not consistent with our ethnographic knowledge of the Yaquis . 
His exploits do , however , resemble those of Native American tribes like the Huichols who have a well - documented history of peyote consumption .
Anthropologist and outspoken Castaneda critic Jay Courtney
Fikes spent several years embedded in a community of Chapalagana Huichols during which time he became intimately acquainted with shamanism and the ritual practices of Mexican Indians .
Once a fan of Castanedas work , Fikes soon grew disillusioned with what he viewed as outright caricatures of Huichol culture .
In his 1993 book Carlos Castaneda , Academic Opportunism , and the Psychedelic Sixties , Fikes explains how the character of Don Juan was likely modeled on Ramon Medina Silva , the Huichol shaman popularized by the ethnographic studies of Peter Furst and Barbara Myerhoff .
These anthropologists were UCLA graduates and peers of Castaneda , and there is convincing evidence that Ramon and Carlos had actually met prior to the publication of The Teachings .
A dramatic waterfall leap performed by Silva , allegedly with Castaneda as a witness , finds a curious parallel in his second book , A Separate Reality , wherein a companion of Don Juan performs similar supernatural feats at a waterfall .
Further complicating the matter , Fikes also disputes the veracity of Furst and Myerhoffs ethnography , noting that the Huichol shamanic practices they detail are at odds with his own findings .
In developing his account of Don Juan , suggests Fikes , Castaneda likely plagiarized from his classmates a distorted portrayal of Huichol culture in the character of Silva , and unscrupulously applied it to his fictional Yaqui sorcerer , thus perpetuating the misrepresentation of Native Americans across cultural boundaries .
The effect of this caricaturing is two - fold : first , as De Mille and Fikes bemoan , erroneous ethnographic research is quite difficult to remove from the anthropological record once canonized .
By accepting such questionable documents as authenticated knowledge , the truth about indigenous peoples becomes diluted with misinformation and ( perhaps more lamentable ) the halls of academia are tarnished with the elevation of charlatans to pedestals of high esteem .
Indeed , as he remarks in his  Introduction ,  Fikes heard nothing but praise for Castanedas first four books in his graduate studies at the University of Michigan in 1975 , despite their disputed validity . [ 10 ]
Second , the misrepresentation of the Yaqui people as portrayed by Castaneda negatively impacts Native American culture as a whole .
In order to assess this detrimental influence of Don Juan and his teachings , one must consider the social context into which he was born .
The decade colorfully referred to as the psychedelic sixties ,  with its adherence to counterculture ideology and self - exploration through drug use , was an era ripe for an iconic figure such as Don Juan to materialize .
As The Teachings of Don Juan introduced thousands of psychedelically - inclined readers to its mysterious sage , the deserts of Mexico were subsequently inundated with droves of  Don Juan seekers  determined to find , and be enlightened by , the elusive sorcerer .
Anthropologist Jane Holden Kelley reports the harassment of Pascuan Yaquis during the 1970s by long - haired hippies  in search of Castanedas muse .
Seizing an opporunity , the crafty villagers played along , divesting the deluded youths of money , booze , and cigarettes before they realized they had been duped . [ 11 ]
It was not the Yaquis , however , but the Huichols who bore the brunt of the hippie influx throughout the seventies .
As Fikes explains , the Yaquis offer relatively little to guru - seekers  since they do not use psychedelics and are somewhat more acculturated  than the peyote - ingesting Huichols .
He relates accounts of traditional Huichols harassed , jailed , shot at , and almost murdered by guru - seekers  and offers an anecdote depicting the attempted stabbing of his Huichol father by a gringo peyote hunter .
These incidents grew more infrequent with time , but the lasting impact of The Teachings on Native Americans , asserts Fikes , lies in the marketing of the Don Juan archetype .
New Age shamans modeled on Castanedas sorcerer exist in abundance in todays society .
Offering travel packages to psychedelic meccas , these pseudo - shamans profit from the misappropriation of rituals and liturgical objects sacred to Native American religions .
While some operations offer legitimate and conscientious experiences of traditional shamanism , others are little more than opportunistic scams .
As Fikes contends , such shameless exploitation trivializes  Huichol , Yaqui , or any Native American culture by masking or ignoring its true genius . 
Furthermore , these profiteers increase the Western fascination with psychedelic drugs such as peyote , bringing unwanted government attention to authentic Native American practices .
A New York Times article from July 23 , 1970 describes the plight of Oaxacan Indians suffering from the flood of American mushroom addicts  and the subsequent crackdown by Mexican authorities ; once considered a great medicine ,  the fungi are now contraband in Oaxaca . [ 12 ]
In the United States , similar legislative measures currently threaten Native Americans ’ religious freedom .
The Smith vs. Oregon decision of the Supreme Court , for instance , banned the ritual use of peyote among members of the Native American Church from 1990 until its repeal in 1993 .
Within a  War on Drugs political climate , the mystique engendered by Don Juan and his imitators represents a real and direct threat to the special rights 
Native American cultures have been granted in American society .
Most troublingly , the fallout from nearly four decades of Castaneda - inspired drug tourism in Mexico now threatens to wipe out some indigenous shamanic cultures entirely .
According to a recent National Public Radio report , the rampant , unsustainable harvesting of peyote by foreigners and drug traffickers from the desert surrounding Real de Catorce has placed the slow - growing cactus in danger of vanishing from the region .
The area is held sacred by the Huichol who regularly pass through the north Mexican desert on shamanic pilgrimages .
Once thriving in abundance along their route , the peyote cactus has become increasingly scarce , prompting the Indians to lobby the government for protection of the holy site .
If the peyote disappears , so does the unique knowledge system of one of Mexico ’s most vital remaining tribal cultures . [ 13 ]
* * *
Carlos Castaneda reemerged in the public eye in the early nineties espousing the virtues of a meditation technique he named Tensegrity , after a term coined by R. Buckminster Fuller .
Consisting of movements called magical passes  ( allegedly the lost knowledge of Mexican shamans in the lineage of Don Juan Matus ) , this discipline was taught by the author himself to devotees at exorbitantly priced seminar - workshops .
Castaneda had , in effect , fulfilled the Don Juan archetype , adopting the role of pseudo - shaman as identified by Fikes .
His death in 1998 was followed by the release of his final book , The Active Side of Infinity , rounding off the Castaneda oeuvre at an impressive thirteen titles .
Along with a multi-million dollar estate , the anthropologist - guru left behind him the legacy of a successful career marred by charges of academic fraud and opportunism .
His seminal achievement , The Teachings of Don Juan , has been simultaneously embraced and vilified since its appearance , yet its influence cannot be overstated .
Richard de Mille once speculated :  Is Carlos multistaged confessional narrative the next step in the history of ethnography , or a further development in the novel , an ultimate fiction ? 
Although the answer remains to be seen , almost forty years later it is evident that Castanedas work of ethnography and allegory  has had an indelible effect  for better or worse  on the way the Western world interprets entheogens and Native American culture .

Sally kinda sorta ( but not really ) distances self from ' terrorism '
by Jeremy Hooper
She may be stubborn about offering any sort of an apology , she may feel that she needs to retain legal counsel , and she might think that it 's proper to take emails that were sent to her and forward them to her buddy Peter LaBarbera so that he can publish them .
But at least Sally Kern does seem to see some degree of nuttiness in her gays / terrorism - linking comments .
In a new press release issued by the aforementioned Peter LaBarbera , Sally is quoted as saying :
Kern told Americans For Truth that “ perhaps my choice of the word ‘ terrorism ’ was not the best , ” but that her comments were meant to be applied to the culture ( war ) , in this way : just as terrorists seek to destroy America , homosexual activists are destroying the moral fabric of this nation .
OOOOOOOOOOOOOOH .
Now we get it .
Her comments were not literally meant to imply that we gays are like those who fly planes into buildings .
She was just trying to say that we 're like a cancer that is eating away at the world 's morality .
How could we have been so stupid ?!?!
We 're not terrorists ; we 're just a pervasive , corruptive force .
We 're not like , gonna bomb America or anything .
We just plan to slowly dissolve all that is good and righteous until every man , woman , and child collapses under the weight of our insidious agenda .
Thanks for clarifying , Sally .
But do us a favor , lamb :
Next time you try and disconnect yourself from a verbal misfire , please understand that the message is of far more concern than the semantics !
You might be seeing the light a little regarding your usage of the term " terrorism . "
However , your mindset is still firmly wrapped around the idea that gayness is gonna eventually make 9/11 look like a minor incident .
And that , S - Dog , is the real problem here .
LaBarbera Assails Homosexual Hate and Intimidation Campaign against Oklahoma Lawmaker Sally Kern [ AFT ]
**SEE ALSO : Sally has been fond of saying that her words have been taken out of context .
Well , Equal Rights Project has the transcript from not only the gay portion of her speech , but rather the entire thing .
See the context for yourself :
Transcript of the entire talk given by Rep. Sally Kern [ ERP ]
Your thoughts
Unfortunately , I 'll bet the 2 or 3 gay people she 'll be talking to are from the asskissers squad .
And in that case , the meeting will be a waste of time - for gay people .

Alexis Lemaire slouched back in his chair , crossed his legs and stared at the screen .
If he was aware of the chattering noise echoing around the museum , he showed no sign of it .
Staring at a 200 - digit number he had never seen before , his thick eyebrows twitched gently , his breathing slowed and he extended the middle finger of his right hand to tap the answer into the computer .
Lemaire 's last keystroke - which came exactly 70.218 seconds after he was first confronted with the random figure - revealed the number 's 13th root : 2407899893032210 .
Those 16 digits , and the remarkably brief time it had taken him to pluck them from his cerebral hardware , yesterday sealed the 27 - year - old Frenchman 's reputation as the world 's fastest human calculator .
" This is better than I had expected , " Lemaire said .
It was ; the tension of the test , at the Science Museum in London , appeared to have spurred him on to beat his own world record by two seconds .
Remaining reassuringly philosophical , the world 's top " mathlete " went on to explain his technique for unscrambling the 13th root in roughly the time it takes to scramble eggs .
" I have a multiplication table in my head .
It 's like learning normal multiplication tables but instead of 10 times 10 , it 's hundreds and thousands of different multiplications . "
Lemaire - who works for an artificial intelligence company while studying for his doctorate and still giving the odd class - is one of a handful of individuals with the ability to " see " numbers , memorise countless calculations and process information .
This allows them to solve complex mathematical problems in their head - and faster than most could do it using a calculator .
" It 's a combination of many skills and abilities ; memory , calculations and mathematical skills , " he said .
" I realised I was good at maths at nine after I was able to find for myself the square root of any eight - digit number I saw on the screen of a calculator . "
Lemaire tours the world , competing against himself and trying to outdo his previous personal best .
It is hard to know whether his quest is fuelled by adrenaline , ego or obsession .
But as far as he is concerned , it is a simple buzz that propels him from august institution to august institution where he tests himself with a laptop before a crowd .
" I do this because it 's very exciting when I get the answer right .
It helps me improve and it gives me a feeling that 's very pleasant and satisfying . "
That 's not to say that he is totally unnicked by arrogance : " Of course , " he added , " I get something psychological from it because no one else can do it . "
His " secret method " is evidently not something he intends to share .
Preparations for the calculation require four or five hours ' training a day .
Careful not to overdo it , Lemaire jogs to relieve the stress - and winds down by memorising numbers .
His final aim is daunting even by his own unique standards .
And beside it , his existing achievements lose some of their lustre .
" My main ambition is to control my brain so that it can calculate everything in life , like language , " he explained calmly .
" Then I want to upload my mind on to a computer so that it can have the same skills as me . "
Plans like that leave little time for a personal life .
But despite being a student at the University of Reims , he is not one for toasting his triumphs with champagne and carousing .
" That , " he said , looking distractedly at the numbers on the computer , " is not something I do . "
To anyone tracking delegates , it ’s been clear for more than a month that Hillary Clinton ’s candidacy is in mortal danger .
But as long as she was battling Barack Obama at the polls every week , she could hope to control the narrative of the Democratic race , even if she was losing individual contests .
And so her campaign kept sprouting new raisons d’être : the wisdom of superdelegates , the enfranchisement of Florida and Michigan , her supposed ability to carry big states .
No more .
We ’re now halfway through the six weeks between Mississippi and Pennsylvania , and this long interlude has washed away Clinton ’s spin .
Now her campaign is not only over .
It ’s obviously over .
For all the drama of the Democratic campaign , both candidates bobbed around in a very narrow range of support for most of February and March .
But that ’s changing right now .
In four of the past five days , Obama has gone over 50 percent in Gallup ’s tracking poll and has opened a lead over Clinton averaging seven points .
This is the first time either candidate has moved significantly beyond the fluctuations inherent in daily surveys , and it ’s the longest stretch one of them has spent as the leader since late February .
Obama is breaking out in a meaningful way .
Maybe Democrats liked what they heard in Obama ’s speech about Jeremiah Wright .
Perhaps all the talk about Hillary ’s ( not ) quitting is cementing his status as front - runner .
Bill Richardson and other superdelegates lining up for Obama could be having an impact .
But one thing is clear : Clinton ’s strategy of exploiting racial polarization among Democrats has failed miserably .
Wright cost Obama .
From the first week in March ( when the Wright controversy first broke ) to the third , his positive rating held steady at a rather incredible 82 percent among black voters , but dropped from 47 percent to 42 percent among whites , according to NBC / Wall Street Journal polls .
But Wright ’s wake cut Clinton even worse : During that same period , she fell twelve points among African - Americans , from 63 percent to 51 percent , and dropped five points among white voters , too , from 39 percent to a Bush - like 34 percent .
Clinton now performs particularly horribly across the upper Midwest and Pacific Northwest , where white Democrats trend progressive and like Obama .
In Iowa , Minnesota , Oregon , Washington , and Wisconsin , she now trails John McCain while Obama leads him , and she is doing markedly poorer in Connecticut and Virginia , too .
As Clinton surrogates pop up once every few days to reinject race into the campaign , they ’ve been trying to corral the last bloc where Hillary might run up her popular - vote totals , even more than ethnic Democrats in Pennsylvania : Scotch - Irish Appalachians in North Carolina , West Virginia , and Kentucky .
The campaign thinks of this demographic as Fox News Democrats — which is why Hillary supporters such as Ed Rendell keep showing up on , and sucking up to , Fox — while social scientists would call them “ low - information . ”
( Twenty - three percent of white Democrats who hold unfavorable views of Obama believe he is a Muslim . )
It must have been tempting for the Clintons , formerly of Arkansas , to believe Hillary could win over these voters fairly painlessly .
Instead , Clinton had farther to fall among blacks than she realized and is also cratering with whites nationwide .
Now look at the money .
Clinton said she raised more than $ 35 million in February , and at the start of last month , she had $ 33 million in cash on hand .
But it turns out that only $ 11 million of that was money she could spend during the remainder of the primary season ; the rest was general - election contributions .
Which means
Hillary never really got beyond her base of wealthy donors , many of whom maxed out on contributions to the nominating race .
Obama , in contrast , had $ 31 million to spend during the rest of the primaries .
Clinton also had a staggering $ 8.7 million in debts , not even including the $ 5 million she loaned her own campaign .
Indeed , the Hillary machine has taken to stiffing various small vendors .
One New Hampshire doctor rented a building he owns to Clinton ; it took so long for the campaign to pay him that he decided to forward its $ 500 check to Obama .
That kind of cash - stretching reeks of desperation :
Not paying your bills on time is a signal you might not be able to pay them at all .
It ’s also the sort of thing that reporters find out about when they have downtime to go digging — like videos of 8 - year - old girls on tarmacs in Bosnia .
Overall , Clinton was able to spend just $ 400,000 on TV ads last week , all in Pennsylvania .
Obama spent $ 2 million , in Pennsylvania , North Carolina , and Indiana .
And those proportions are n’t changing anytime soon .
Fifty - one percent negatives among white voters , no cash — and now a lead in Pennsylvania that has dwindled to five points :
They do n’t come any more stalwart than Hillary Clinton , but the next three weeks are going to be one long death march .

In the past few years , there have been several high profile cases of cheating and plagiarism among young academics .
In 2006 , Kaavya Viswanathan , then a sophomore at Harvard University , was accused of including whole passages practically verbatim from another author in her first novel .
Her book was eventually recalled by its publisher and her reputation as an author perhaps forever tarnished .
This past April , Yale student Aliza Shvarts , admitted to faking the circumstances of her senior performance art project , a controversial first - hand account of her ( faked ) abortion .
What made these well - educated , high - achieving women desperate enough to risk their reputations for 15 - minutes of fame ?
Could it be a constant pressure to succeed from parents , professors , bosses and popular media ?
A query into the Merriam - Webster dictionary shows the definition of success to be :
The attainment of wealth , favor , or eminence .
What troubles me about this definition is that it defines success through a third - party point of view .
Gaining favor ?
Having superiority ?
These are all things subject to other people ’s perceptions rather than a personal measure of fulfillment and meaning .
This drive to succeed , to achieve based on someone else ’s definition of success is wreaking havoc on our generation , a generation raised to believe that achievement is everything .
From a young age , most Millennials have been told they need to be “ well - rounded . ”
College admission boards wants students who can “ do - it - all , ” so children are being pushed at younger and younger ages into soccer teams , ballet lessons , foreign - language classes and more with rarely a thought as to whether a child really enjoys the activity or not .
Could this pressure - cooker environment with its non-stop schedule of activities and constant competition be to blame for the rise in student cheating ?
Or the reason so many young people flunk out of college , go on wild drinking binges , and rack up mountains of debt before the age of 25 ?
Where did we all go so horribly wrong ?
Brazen Careerist , Penelope Trunk , encourages readers to cut through the B.S. and think back to their happiest childhood memories to find their true passions :
Do you want to know what you should do right now ?
Do you want to know what your best bet is for your next career ?
Look at what you were doing when you were a kid .
Nothing changes when you grow up except that you get clouded vision from thinking about what you SHOULD do — to be rich , or successful , or to please your parents or peers … the possibilities for should are endless .
By measuring your own personal success against the standards of others ( not all of us can be Pulitzer - prize winning novelists or MVP athletes ) you cloud your own path to true fulfillment and happiness .
I recommend everyone read through Penelope ’s post and take a few minutes to recall a favorite childhood memory and identify positive traits about your true self that you could be doing more to cultivate .
You never know what you might be missing out on just because you never thought it important enough .
The Association of Chief Police Officers said that during the experiment Tasers would be made available at incidents of ' violence and threats of violence of such severity that they will need force ' .
The government 's own human rights watchdog threatened last night to launch a legal challenge to Labour 's plan to introduce a law that would let police detain terror suspects without charge for 42 days .
The Equality and Human Rights Commission says the key part of the counter - terrorism bill goes against human rights law and may breach the Race Relations Act .
As the home secretary , Jacqui Smith , renewed her appeal to Labour backbenchers to support the measure - amid growing international criticism - the EHRC prepared to brief MPs before the bill 's second reading in the Commons tomorrow .
The commission makes clear it will mount a legal challenge if the 42 - day limit wins parliamentary backing .
" If adopted , we may seek to use our legal powers to challenge the lawfulness of the provisions and to establish clear legal principles on the use of pre-trial detention , " it says in a briefing note to MPs .
The threat of a legal challenge from the EHRC , which has powers to take judicial review on legislation it considers may be in breach of the European Convention on Human Rights , is another setback to a government determined to increase the time terrorism suspects can be held without charge from 28 to 42 days .
Archbishop Desmond Tutu , Noam Chomsky and the American Civil Liberties Union have led an international outcry against the plan , which is opposed at home by the Tories and Liberal Democrats .
The government receives a further blow today when Lord Dear , the former chief inspector of constabulary , says a change in law would be a " propaganda coup " for al - Qaida .
In a Guardian article , Dear writes that every chief constable he has spoken to regards the change as unnecessary .
Dear writes : " Make no mistake , extending pre-charge detention would most certainly be a propaganda coup for al - Qaida and its ilk .
When I was an undergraduate reading law at university in the 60s , every self - respecting student had a poster of Che Guevara on their wall and knew something of the writings of [ Herbert ] Marcuse .
Both of those terrorist luminaries said repeatedly that the best course for a terrorist was to provoke a government to overreact to a threat by eroding civil liberties , increasing executive powers and diminishing due process by the denial of justice . "
The deep unease about the new measures was underlined by the EHRC .
Set up last October under the chairman Trevor Phillips , it has specific power to take legal action over potential breaches of the Race Relations Act .
The commission says it accepts that circumstances might arise which make an increase in the 28 day limit on pre-charge detention helpful to the police in obtaining evidence but this should not be at the expense of fundamental human rights .
It has told the Home Office that a " positive and compelling case " must be made before the maximum limit on pre-charge detention is raised , given its potential impact on liberty , the likelihood of its disproportionate impact on the Muslim community , and the risk of operational error .
" We consider that despite being restricted to particular and specific contingencies , the provisions set out by the Home Office are unlikely to meet threshold tests of public interest , justification or fairness , " the commission adds .
It says the proposed safeguard of parliamentary scrutiny of each order will be meaningless without giving MPs detailed information on each suspect .
Yet that would raise constitutional issues .
The commission says the proposed change also raises " very difficult issues " under race equality laws as it is being established to deal with a particular religious and racial minority .
The EHRC believes it carries a high risk of damaging community relations , as Muslims are more likely to be regarded with suspicion .
The government is expected to win a Commons majority tomorrow for the bill 's second reading .
But Smith faces the prospect of defeat when detailed votes are held on the 42 days issue at the report stage in May after the local elections .
She said yesterday she believed the 42 - day extension would be passed .
But she told the BBC : " I hope parliamentarians will take their responsibility seriously to give those that we task with keeping us safe from terrorism the tools that we need to do it .
I need to make the argument to parliament .
As home secretary my responsibility is to do what I believe ... it is necessary to protect this country from the serious , sustained , and in some ways growing threat from international terrorism . "
Smith stressed that the government was only taking a precautionary " reserve power " to increase the maximum period for detention without charge to be used in the exceptional circumstances of the country facing multiple terror plots .
Pushed to the brink of collapse by the mortgage crisis , Bear Stearns Cos. agreed -- after prodding by the federal government -- to be sold to J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. for the fire - sale price of $ 2 a share in stock , or about $ 236 million .
Bear Stearns had a stock - market value of about $ 3.5 billion as of Friday -- and was worth $ 20 billion in January 2007 .
But the crisis of confidence that swept the firm and fueled a customer exodus in recent days left Bear Stearns with a horrible choice : sell the firm -- at any price -- to a ...
Leonard Simpson is an unapologetic moron :
Like most people in Mingo County , West Virginia , Leonard Simpson is a lifelong Democrat .
But given a choice between Barack Obama and John McCain in November , the 67 - year - old retired coalminer would vote Republican .
“ I heard that Obama is a Muslim and his wife ’s an atheist , ” said Mr Simpson , drawing on a cigarette outside the fire station in Williamson , a coalmining town of 3,400 people surrounded by lush wooded hillsides .
Mr Simpson ’s remarks help explain why Mr Obama is trailing Hillary Clinton , his Democratic rival , by 40 percentage points ahead of Tuesday ’s primary election in the heavily white and rural state , according to recent opinion polls .
The media just got done spending nearly two straight months running clips of Barack Obama ’s Christian minister in an endless loop on television .
If you ca n’t make the connection that Barack Obama and his wife are Christians after that kind of saturation coverage , then you are willfully stupid .
Josh Fry , a 24 - year - old ambulance driver from Williamson , insisted he was not racist but said he would feel more comfortable with Mr McCain , the 71 - year - old Vietnam war hero , in the White House .
“ I want someone who is a full - blooded American as president , ” he said .
Well , what is that supposed to mean ?
None of the 22 Democrats interviewed by the Financial Times at the Clinton rally would commit themselves to voting for Mr Obama if he became the nominee , and half said they definitely would not .
The depth of opposition is particularly striking considering that Mingo County is one of the most Democratic places in West Virginia , having cast about 85 per cent of its votes for the party in the 2006 midterm elections .
If Mr Obama cannot win there in November , he has little chance of carrying the state .
Most people questioned said they mistrusted Mr Obama because of doubts about his patriotism and “ values ” , stemming from his cosmopolitan background , his exotic name and the controversy surrounding “ anti- American ” sermons by Jeremiah Wright , his former pastor .
Several people said they believed he was a Muslim – an unfounded rumour that has circulated on the internet for months – despite the contradiction with his 20 - year membership of Mr Wright ’s church in Chicago .
Others mentioned his refusal to wear a Stars and Stripes badge and controversial remarks by his wife , Mich­elle , who des­cribed America as “ mean ” and implied that she had never been proud of the US until her husband ran for president .
Frankly , this is exactly what I ’ve been talking about when I ’ve discussed how liberals and blacks are the both the most loyal and the most reviled blocs in the Democratic Party .
I ’m happy to seek new electoral college votes in Nevada , Colorado , New Mexico , North Carolina , Virginia , and Montana , and the Dakotas .
West Virginia is n’t going to look beyond the color of John McCain and Barack Obama ’s skin to make up their minds about who they vote for .
I know there are many fine people in West Virginia , just as there are everywhere .
But I ca n’t consider it a problem that Obama does n’t appeal to these voters .
Honestly , I ’d be more concerned if he did appeal to them .
A proof of concept program has been developed and demonstrated that allows significant and possibly large - scale exploitation of Session Initiation Protocol ( SIP ) , permitting an individual to tap into corporate VoIP networks .
The exploit could also be done at the ISP level , permitting an intruder to eavesdrop on large numbers of VoIP calls , perhaps simultaneously .
This is an extremely dangerous development , one that I have feared could happen once telephony networks are converted to TCP / IP .
This is a classic example of technology being developed and implemented without adequate consideration for security and privacy .
Other examples of technologies whose early editions were too weak for prime time : WiFi networks , analog cellular networks ( remember the clone wars ? ) , e-mail ( spam and spoofing are still significant problems ) , domain name service ( significant weaknesses abound ) , FTP , Telnet … shall I go on ?
Organizations that utilize VoIP and SIP trunks to branch offices or service providers need to consider protecting these communications with VPN technology .
SIP ’s security features alone cannot be relied upon to protect VoIP traffic .

Facebook co-founder and CTO Adam D’Angelo is leaving Facebook , according to multiple sources .
The reasons behind D’Angelo ’s departure have so far not been disclosed , but it ’s a strange move given D’Angelo ’s supposed close relationship with Mark Zuckerberg ; D’Angelo has been often cited as Zuckerberg ’s best friend .
It ’s also a rare employee move away from Facebook at a time the social networking giant is attracting the cream of Valley talent .
As CTO at Facebook , D’Angelo oversaw the Platform Development team , the Data team and new product design and architecture .
As well as holding a bachelor ’s degree in computer science from Caltech , D’Angelo was named one of the top 24 finalists in the international Topcoder Collegiate Challenge in 2005 , which competition which tests the ability to design and implement complex algorithms in a timed environment .
Could there be trouble at Facebook , or is D’Angelo simply looking for a new challenge , safe in the knowledge that he holds millions in Facebook stock ?
Time will tell : no doubt though that with those credentials he ’ll pop up somewhere soon .
( via VentureBeat )
Update : Kara Swisher reports rumors of “ tension with Zuckerberg ” as a reason , but the official line is D’Angelo wants to take some “ time off ” .
Another of Kara ’s sources claims “ D’Angelo felt his responsibilities were no longer fit well with his skills and interests . ”
Mr. Obama ’s rise has been built in part on the idea that he represents a break from the established identities that have defined many of the nation ’s divisions .
To many , he embodies a promise to bridge black and white , old and young , rich and poor  and Democrats , Republicans and independents .
Even so , Mr. Obama does not come to the campaign with a reputation as one of the most accommodating bridge - builders in the Senate .
And while he promises a very different politics from Mrs. Clinton , their voting records in the Senate last year were not strikingly different .
A recent analysis of key votes by The National Journal concluded that Mr. Obama had the Senate ’s most liberal voting record in 2007 ; Mrs. Clinton ranked 16th .
But of the 267 measures on which both senators voted , the National Journal analysis found that they differed on only 10 .
One of their major differences came on an amendment that called for the designation of the Revolutionary Guards in Iran as a terrorist organization ; while Mrs. Clinton supported it , Mr. Obama missed the vote , but said he opposed it .
Congressional Quarterly said Mr. Obama voted with his party 97 percent of the time on party - line votes last year ; Mrs. Clinton did so 98 percent of the time .
But it is Mr. Obama who is running on a promise of a new approach to politics .
Given that , he says he understands the criticism of his voting record , but argues that the Senate is so ideologically polarized it is hard not to end up on one side or the other .
“ The only votes that come up are votes that are purposely designed to divide people , ” he said .
“ It ’s true that if I ’m presented with a series of votes like that , I ’m more likely to fall left of center than right of center .
But as president , I would be setting the terms of debate . ”
Mr. Obama seems to be promising less a split - the - difference centrism than an ability to harness the support of all those voters who yearn for something new , beyond the ideological stalemate .
In his book “ The Audacity of Hope , ” he wrote , “ They are out there , waiting for Republicans and Democrats to catch up with them . ”
Da es sich bei Düsseldorf um die Landeshauptstadt von Nordrhein - Westfalen handelt , gibt es hierbei auch die meisten Möglichkeiten .

If you ’re a techie person , email is essential but it ’s hard to stay on top of all of it .
If you use Gmail and Firefox , here ’s a few tips to get email under control .
The first tip is remedial : keep most mailing list emails out of your inbox .
I already prune as much of my Gmail inbox email as I can .
I subscribe to a bunch of mailing lists , but add filters like “ If the email is to some - mailinglist , skip the inbox . ”
That way it does n’t clutter my inbox ( which is my to - do list ) , but it still gets indexed so that I can search for it later .
Once you ’ve done the first tip , you probably still end up with a lot of email .
How can you prioritize the most important emails , such as the emails from people that you work closely with ?
Here ’s how :
Install Firefox and Greasemonkey .
If you ’re a techie , odds are you already have both of these running .
Go to this page and click on the “ Saved Searches ” link to install a Greasemonkey script that augments Gmail with persistent searches .
This script was written by Mihai Parparita , a Google engineer who actually works on Google Reader , not Gmail .
Go into Gmail and you ’ll see a new sidebar with several example searches .
It looks like this :
To run a saved search , just click on the search you want to run in the sidebar .
Click on “ Edit Searches ” and add a new search for the team of people you work with .
How do you add a new search ?
It ’s easy .
Imagine that you work at Example.com and you work with a team of three people : Alice , Bob , and Carol .
This search would find emails from any of those people that are still in your inbox and that are directly to you :
to :me AND label : inbox AND ( from:alice@example.com OR from:bob@example.com OR from:carol@example.com )
So let ’s click on “ Edit Searches ” in the sidebar and add this new search .
Here ’s what you ’ll see :
Under the text “ Create a new persistent search ” fill in the “ Label ” field with something like “ My team ” and in the “ Query ” field , add a query like the one I mentioned , then click “ Save Changes . ”
If you want , you can move your new saved search up to the top of the priority list ( the script comes with a few default searches ) .
Now when you ’re facing a bunch of email in your Gmail inbox , you can click on the “ My team ” link and you ’ll see the most important emails that you need to respond to first .
You can add quite a lot of people , too . 🙂
There are all sorts of other tricks you can do with labels and persistent searches .
You could make a persistent search for different groups of people at work , or a search for email from your family .
Here ’s one last tip .
Suppose you work at Example.com and you get a mix of email from inside Example.com and from outside .
You want to exclude any outside email ( that is , any email that ’s not from example.com ) .
From the inbox , click on “ Create a filter ” .
In the From : field , enter the rule - example.com .
Then click “ Next Step ” and create a new label called “ outside ” and click to create the filter .
After creating the filter and label , you can do queries like “ to : me AND - label : outside AND label : inbox ” .
Now you easily can jump back and forth between handling internal and external email .
By the way , big props to the Gmail team for making a great web email product , the Firefox folks for making a great browser for Gmail plus the rest of the web , Aaron Boodman for his Greasemonkey script , and Mihai Parparita for his persistent searches script ( Aaron and Mihai both work at Google ) .
Oh , and I guess thanks also to the Google Code and open source team for offering the free source - code project hosting that Mihai is using for his scripts .
All of these projects help a ton of people in day - to - day life and generate massive positive karma . 🙂
Okay , anybody else want to offer their best email / Gmail productivity tip ?
Update : Paul Buchheit , one of the original architects of Gmail , dropped me a nice note to refine one of the tips above .
Here ’s the refinement , quoted with his permission :
Gmail query syntax is pretty flexible .
You can rewrite
( from:alice@example.com OR from:bob@example.com OR from:carol@example.com )
as
from:( alice|bob|carol)@example.com
I learn something new every day .
Thanks Paul ! 🙂
SAN FRANCISCO ( MarketWatch ) --
Venture capitalists scaled back their deal - making activity in the first quarter , pushing investments down more than 8 % from the previous period to their lowest level in more than a year .
According to the quarterly Money Tree report released over the weekend , venture capital investing totaled about $ 7.1 billion in the first quarter .
This is a decline from both the $ 7.8 billion raised in the fourth quarter and the $ 7.5 billion raised in the same period last year .
The decline in VC investing comes against a backdrop of continuing signs of an economic slowdown brought on by the global credit crunch and woes in the subprime mortgage market .
The slowdown has all but shut down the market for initial public offerings as well as mergers and acquisitions , the two most common avenues used by VC firms to cash in on their investments .
In a conference call , venture capital experts attempted to put a positive spin on the data , noting that investment activity still remains relatively high compared to the drop - off that occurred following the last economic slowdown in 2001 .
" We see from an early stage investing point of view , the economic slowdown has had an impact and perhaps people are being mindful of the economic slowdown , " Nina Saberi , managing general partner of Castile Ventures said on the call .
" But , at the same time , the effects of it are milder than you might imagine from listening to the evening news . "
John Taylor , vice president of research for the National Venture Capital Association , said VCs remain interested in new projects " albeit with a sense of caution . "
Early - stage decline
As in previous slowdowns , venture capitalists seem to prefer companies were they already have established relationships -- or made previous investments .
Companies that have not received venture capital funding in the past saw a decline in activity during the first quarter .
First - stage financings totaled $ 1.64 billion during the quarter , down 27 % from the $ 2.24 billion in first - time deals in the fourth quarter and down 4 % from the $ 1.7 billion in first time deals for the first quarter of last year .
" In the case of 2008 first quarter , 294 business plans were accepted and those companies were given funding for the first time so the industry is still taking on new projects and it's consistent with what we 've done in recent quarters , " Taylor of the NVCA said .
Early - stage investments totaled $ 1.66 billion for the first quarter , down 17 % from the fourth quarter .
Early - stage investing activity accounted for 23 % of all VC activity for the recent period compared to 26 % in the previous period .
Mixed bag for clean tech
The biotechnology and software sectors accounted for the largest share of venture capital dollars in the first quarter .
Biotechnology firms raised $ 1.27 billion in funding during the period -- largely flat with the sector 's performance during the previous period .
Software firms raised $ 1.26 billion during the quarter compared t0 $ 1.39 billion in the previous quarter .
The report noted that investments in the clean - tech area , which includes several of the formal industry sectors -- also saw a decline in the first quarter .
Clean - tech investments totaled $ 625 million for the first quarter , down 6 % from the fourth quarter .
However , clean tech also accounted for some of the largest deals in the quarter .
Range Fuels Inc. , an ethanol production firm in Broomfield , Colo. , raised more than $ 130 million in financing during the quarter , making it the largest VC deal for the period .
Suniva Inc. , a maker of solar - cell technology from Atlanta , raised $ 50 million during the quarter .
Another solar - power firm , Infinia Corp. of Kennewick , Wash. , raised nearly $ 50 million during the period .

On occasion , we all find ourselves knee deep in a heated discussion that seems to be escalating rapidly without any sign of resolution or agreement .
As soon as the intensity elevates , agitated personal emotions are bound to influence the direction and tone of the conversation .
These emotional influences usually cloud the open - minded exchange of information with a series of scripted , opinionated statements .
Once this happens , you can be fairly certain the discussion will result in little practical value .
In a heated argument we are apt to lose sight of the truth .
– Publilius Syrus
Emotional People
Think via Known Scripts
When people become inundated with a rush of emotion , they tend to fall back on predetermined personal beliefs as a foundation for their reasoning .
Some physiologists and cognition experts refer to these predetermined personal beliefs as “ scripts ” .
Someone consumed in an emotional state will think and communicate in a scripted fashion based entirely on what they presently believe to be true , instead of keeping their mind open to new information .
Break the Script to Ease Emotions
How do you ease emotions and restore order in a heated discussion so that the focus of communication realigns with the original intended purpose ?
The key is to ask a specific question that forces the emotional communicators to break out of their emotionally scripted thought process .
I call this “ The Break Script Technique ” .
If you can break their script , they will typically become cognizant of the current communication problem .
Questions with Known Answers Work Best
To successfully implement “ The Break Script Technique ” , you have to ask a simple , familiar , off - topic question .
Your question should be so common that most people , including the emotional communicators , have a reflexive , scripted way of answering it .
You are essentially breaking them out of one script by substituting it for another script they are familiar and comfortable with .
Here are a few example questions that can assist in breaking the emotional script :
“ Sorry to interrupt , but do you know the time ? ”
“ How are you doing ? ” ( or some variation … may be a bit odd in the middle of a conversation . )
“ What time do you usually break for lunch ? ”
Although off - topic , these questions will not seem unreasonable or inconvenient to the emotional communicators because they already know the answers to each .
The goal is to interrupt their train of thought just long enough to make them aware of their emotional state .
“ The Break Script Technique ” is not applicable in all situations , especially when untamed emotions have turned a civil discussion into a full - fledged argument .
However , if used correctly in the context of a fairly civil discussion , I have found this simple technique to be extremely effective .
NAHR AL - BARED in Lebanon was a wind - blown huddle of tents when the first refugees straggled here from Galilee in 1948 , the year of the Palestinian nakba or catastrophe .
Yet the camp somehow prospered , in spite of the Lebanese laws restricting Palestinians , and despite the influx of yet more refugees during Lebanon 's 1975 - 90 civil war .
By last year it had grown into a crowded but congenial town of 35,000 , complete with apartment blocks , schools and clinics .
The seaside camp was home to the busiest market in northern Lebanon , but also to a growing band of dour , bearded and fearsomely well - armed Islamist radicals .
They hailed mostly not from Palestine but from Saudi Arabia , Iraq , Syria and other countries that were making life difficult for jihad - obsessed Sunni militants .
Nahr al - Bared 's regular residents tended to shun them .
But there was little they could do to keep the 500 or so newcomers out .
The feeble Lebanese state takes no responsibility for its 12 Palestinian camps , and the refugees ' own institutions have weakened with the decline of the once - dominant Palestine Liberation Organisation ( PLO ) .
Last May police in the nearby city of Tripoli clashed with members of the group .
Their comrades took revenge by attacking Lebanese army posts , then retreated into Nahr al - Bared .
Worried by the addition of al - Qaeda - style radicals to Lebanon 's boiling sectarian stew , the army responded with fury .
Its siege of Nahr al - Bared lasted 106 days , during which the camp 's entire population was forced to flee and watch their homes being pounded into dust by artillery fire .
By the time the Lebanese army declared victory in September , some 47 civilians , 167 Lebanese soldiers and a claimed 287 armed guerrillas were dead .
The camp is slowly reviving .
Ten thousand residents have returned to the less damaged outlying areas .
The owner of a makeshift café on the rutted main street has painted a jaunty sign in rainbow colours .
“ We Shall Rebuild Al Bared and We Shall Return To Palestine ” , it promises .
Yet the utterly flattened centre of the camp , which housed 20,000 refugees , remains off - limits .
Yasser al - Hajj , a 27 - year - old engineer whose family came here from Safad in northern Palestine ( now part of Israel ) , takes a break from shovelling rubble out of a friend 's wall - less living room to point towards one of a dozen tilted stacks of collapsed concrete that loom just beyond a Lebanese army checkpoint .
The four - storey building contained all his extended family 's belongings , as well as their wholesale grocery business , the fruit of 60 years ' struggle in exile .
Mr al - Hajj assumes they have lost everything .
“ This is my generation 's nakba , ” he says dryly .
Such bitterness is widely shared among the world 's 10 m Palestinians , 70 % of whom are refugees or their descendants .
Other peoples have suffered great tragedies , but the Palestinians ' trauma not only refuses to reach closure , it has a horrible habit of repeating itself .
Worse yet , its effects continue to poison politics within the wider region and beyond .
In annual polling over the past six years , three - quarters of Arabs consistently place the issue of Palestine among their priorities .
In other words , little has changed since 1948 , when street sentiment prompted five reluctant Arab governments to send troops on a vain mission to block the creation of Israel .
During the ensuing war , the Palestinians ' initial nakba , more than half the native population of Palestine , some 750,000 people , fled or were driven from the territory that became the Jewish state , whose troops then barred their return and systematically razed 531 of their ancestral villages .
The six - day war in June 1967 brought the remaining 22 % of historic Palestine under Israeli rule , and pushed out 250,000 more refugees .
In exile , Palestinians have been harassed , attacked or chased away .
PLO fighters were forced to flee Jordan after an uprising in 1970 .
Lebanese Christians destroyed the camps of Tel Zaatar and Qarantina in the 1970s , and massacred Palestinians at Sabra and Chatila in 1982 .
Israelis besieged the PLO in Beirut the same year , sending PLO leaders to secondary exile in Tunis , and the Syrians did the same in Tripoli in 1984 .
In 1991 300,000 Palestinians , many of them wealthy and long - settled , were hounded from Kuwait after their leaders foolishly praised Saddam Hussein 's invasion of the Gulf emirate .
Libya 's erratic ruler , Muammar Qaddafi , deported thousands more in the 1990s , saying that since they had signed the Oslo peace accords with Israel , Palestinians should “ go home ” .
Since the invasion of Iraq in 2003 , nearly all its 20,000 Palestinians have been forced to the borders , where some still languish in dusty desert camps .
One nation , divisible
It is a testimony to the tenacity of Palestinians that they have kept alive a sense of nationhood in the face of so much adversity .
Yet the obstacles to sustaining their cohesiveness as a people are today greater than ever .
Around 5 m Palestinians live in historic Palestine , under Israeli control .
In the West Bank , Israeli settlements and military zones take up 40 % of the land .
In response to the second Palestinian intifada , or uprising , that began in 2000 , Israel laced the territory with walls , fences and checkpoints that box its 2.5 m Palestinian residents into dozens of largely separate enclaves .
Since the Islamist party , Hamas , took control of Gaza last June , its 1.5 m people have been confined within the strip 's 146 square miles ( 378 sq km ) , kept alive on a drip - feed sustenance of international aid .
The 1.1 m Palestinians inside Israel are far better off , though they have long suffered legal and economic discrimination .
They are increasingly isolated from their brethren .
Israel bars them , as its citizens , from travelling to Gaza or to most Arab countries , and their cousins in the occupied territories are unable to visit them since Israel , to keep suicide bombers out , has cancelled most permits .
Right - wing Jewish Israeli politicians stir up rhetoric about Palestinian Israelis as “ fifth columnists ” .
Small wonder that in a recent poll 62 % of them expressed the fear that Israel would one day expel them .
The 250,000 Palestinian residents of East Jerusalem , which Israel annexed in 1967 , have Israeli residence permits .
But if they move to the West Bank or travel abroad to work , they risk losing for ever their right to live in the city of their birth .
Outside historic Palestine the picture is mixed .
Most Palestinians in Jordan enjoy Jordanian citizenship and hence relative freedom , though their voting power is diluted by blatant gerrymandering in favour of “ East Bankers ” , the original Jordanians .
Lebanon , Syria and Egypt grant Palestinians not passports but a laissez - passer that immigration officers tend to regard with suspicion .
That aside , Syria , with its pan-Arab Baathist ideology , gives its 450,000 Palestinians almost all the rights of citizens except the right to vote , which is not much use in a dictatorship anyhow .
By contrast , Lebanon , out of fears that naturalising the country 's 350,000 Palestinians , most of them Sunni Muslims , would tip the delicate sectarian power balance , denies them the right to own property or to work in dozens of white - collar professions .
Even if they are third - generation refugees in Lebanon , they risk losing their right to re-entry if they stay abroad longer than six months .
Egypt , home to just 70,000 Palestinians , is slightly kinder .
Palestinians may travel for up to a year , if they get special permits .
But Egyptian authorities are notoriously pernickety .
Lana Baydas , a British - educated professor at the American University in Cairo , has waited 18 months for residency papers , during which time she has had to fly 18 times to Syria , the only country she can travel freely to on her Syrian - Palestinian laissez - passer , so as not to outstay her month - long Egyptian “ tourist ” visas .
When she tried to explain the bother to a friend , she says ruefully , the reply was , “ Ca n't you just stop being Palestinian ? ”
Ironically , it is Palestinians in the farther shattat or diaspora , beyond the Arab world , who feel the most secure .
Antonio Saca , the president of El Salvador , is one of the 100,000 Salvadoreans of Palestinian origin , most of them Bethlehemites who left to escape the collapsing Ottoman empire almost a century ago .
There are at least 300,000 Palestinian - Chileans , composed of various waves of emigration .
America has maybe a quarter of a million Palestinians , mostly middle - class professionals , and there is a similar - sized but more recent émigré population in Europe , where it has been easier for new exiles to find refuge .
Distance and borders are not the only things that divide Palestinians .
There are also stark , and growing , gaps between rich and poor , between secularists , Muslims and Christians , between myriad political factions — and between refugees , non-refugees and ex-refugees .
You are where you come from
The UN Relief and Works Agency ( UNRWA ) is responsible for the welfare of the 4.5 m registered Palestinian refugees in the Middle East .
Around half of the Palestinians in the occupied territories , including most of the people in Gaza , are refugees ; about a quarter of Palestinian Israelis also lost their original homes .
Living conditions vary enormously .
In the West Bank , only about a third of the refugees live in camps , and even there UNRWA tents have long since been replaced by tightly packed slum housing .
Refugees are fiercely proud of their status , with even the rich and successful clinging to their identity .
They may buy large villas , but often next to the camps .
The 20,000 inhabitants of Balata camp , at the edge of the northern West Bank city of Nablus , still speak with the accent of villages in what is now Israel , even if they are second - or third - generation camp - dwellers .
When UNRWA offered to buy land to house refugees outside Jenin 's refugee camp after parts of it were flattened by Israeli bulldozers , the residents refused .
Similarly ,
Nahr al - Bared 's homeless residents are lobbying to ensure that when their camp is rebuilt , it will still be sectioned into districts named for the Galilee villages the original refugees came from .
In Jordan 's capital , Amman , the rich and often secular Palestinians who live on the hilltops shun the religiously conservative poor whose houses pack the slopes and valleys .
West Bank city - dwellers still shudder at the memory of an influx of job - seeking Gazans during the 1990s , before Israel severed links between the territories .
The traditionally more affluent Palestinian Christians have been the likeliest to emigrate , becoming an ever smaller minority , and sometimes a persecuted one as militant Islamism has grown in strength .
An Israeli prime minister , Golda Meir , famously jibed in 1968 that “ there is no such thing as the Palestinian people . ”
Respectable historians now accept that Palestinian nationhood began to form in the 19th century .
But at the time of the nakba their sense of nationhood was still more tenuous than that of the Jews two millennia ago , who went into exile with a dense religious tradition and centuries of biblical self - rule already under their belts .
The world 's diverse Palestinian communities are tied together less by history than by the narrative of dispossession and the dream of returning home .
For all his failings , Yasser Arafat , who headed the PLO and its dominant faction , the secular Fatah party , from 1969 until his death in 2004 , can be credited with maintaining and strengthening the Palestinians ' fragile identity .
And he did so while engineering the shift in their aspirations that made peace with Israel a conceptual possibility — a shift from hankering after all - too - tangible lost land to the much more abstract promise of a nation - state , on a much smaller bit of that land .
But in 1993 Mr Arafat made what most Palestinians now regard as the error of agreeing to the Oslo peace accords , which gave no firm promise of a Palestinian state in return for the recognition of Israel , and which eventually collapsed after the failure of talks at Camp David in the summer of 2000 .
Many conflict - weary Palestinians would have been satisfied with simply having a passport and a secure place to call home .
But to the poorer refugees , Oslo smelt of a sell - out .
As Jewish settlement in the West Bank accelerated , the newly installed Palestinian Authority grew more corrupt and negotiations collapsed into bloodshed , ever more Palestinians rejected Arafat 's brand of nationalism and turned to Hamas .
Hamas 's strengths
The credo of Hamas , born in 1987 as an offshoot of Egypt 's Muslim Brotherhood , is the recuperation of all of historic Palestine for Islam , though over the years it has come to accept the idea of a “ long - term ” ( several decades , say its leaders ) truce with Israel .
Hamas built its credibility through social programmes , a reputation for honesty and its rejection of a peace process that it saw biased in Israel 's favour .
AP
But when will this lovely land really be his state ?
Many of the Palestinians who voted Hamas into power in the 2006 parliamentary elections did so not because they agreed with its ideology but just because Fatah was so awful .
Fatah 's subsequent , American - backed effort to destabilise the new government only added to Hamas 's lustre , and prompted the Islamists to undertake what they regard , with some justification , as a pre-emptive coup in Gaza last summer .
Israel 's attempts to suppress Hamas have backfired .
The result of its blockade on Gaza is that an opinion poll in February showed the Hamas leader in Gaza , Ismail Haniyeh , beating the Fatah chairman , Mahmoud Abbas , for the presidency for the first time ever .
Palestinian deaths since the start of the second intifada stand at over 4,700 and rising , while hundreds of thousands have been impoverished , further hardening attitudes towards Israel .
The latest peace talks , launched at Annapolis last November , have changed little on the ground .
A growing number of Palestinians seem persuaded that Israel has so entrenched itself in the West Bank that a two - state solution is already out of reach .
Around a quarter now say they favour a binational state with equal rights for all — which most Jewish Israelis would never accept .
This too is to Hamas 's advantage .
Its political opponents base their position on secularism and the two - state idea — and both values are eroding .
Rumblings of dissent have emerged from within Fatah too , placing pressure on Mr Abbas to toughen his negotiating stance .
“ If Abu Mazen [ Mr Abbas ] agrees to anything without the right of return for all refugees , then there will be an intifada of the refugees , ” says Shami Shami , a Fatah member of parliament from the Jenin refugee camp .
Talk of the “ right of return ” sets alarms ringing in Israel : if all the refugees returned , Israel would be swamped and Jews would no longer be a majority .
In practice , Mr Shami , like most politicians in Fatah , subscribes to a known formula : the conflict must be resolved along the lines of UN General Assembly Resolution 194 of 1948 , which states that “ the refugees wishing to return to their homes and live at peace with their neighbours should be permitted to do so at the earliest practicable date , ” and decrees that compensation should be paid to the rest .
The biggest poll on how many refugees would actually choose to return was done in 2003 by Khalil Shikaki , a leading Palestinian pollster .
He asked refugees in the West Bank , Gaza , Jordan and Lebanon if , given the choice , they would go to Israel , go to ( or stay in ) a Palestinian state , or take citizenship elsewhere .
Those who did not go to Israel would get compensation .
Overall , 10 % said they would want to move to Israel ( it was 23 % in Lebanon and 5 % in Jordan , reflecting the differing conditions of refugees there ) .
Some challenge Mr Shikaki 's findings , partly because he added the stipulation that return would be limited to a quota agreed to by Israel , which would undoubtedly be minuscule : informal figures of 10,000 a year have been bandied about , half the current rate of Jewish immigration .
More might opt for return if they felt there was a reasonable chance of getting it .
Even so , the poll suggests that for most Palestinians recognition of their legal “ right ” is more important than physical “ return ” .
Full return is unrealistic , agrees Abbas Shiblak , who founded SHAML , a refugee research centre in Ramallah .
“ But we can't renounce the right of return because it means we accept the Israeli narrative and version of history , which no one will accept . ”
Not that compensation for the rest would be a minor obstacle .
The Aix Group , an Israeli - Palestinian - French economic study team , estimates that a fair package of resettlement or rehabilitation for the 4.5 m registered refugees would run to between $ 55 billion and $ 85 billion .
Given the tangled mess of responsibilities , foreign countries would be expected to stump up .
At present , though , even a decent settlement over the land , let alone the refugees , looks a very long way away .
Mr Abbas , presiding over only part of the putative Palestinian state — and that precariously — is in no position to take the steps that Israel demands of him to implement a peace deal .
Ehud Olmert , Israel 's prime minister , cannot concede an inch without incurring the wrath of rightists .
The two sides are currently negotiating what the Israelis have already downgraded to a “ framework agreement ” rather than a full peace deal discussed at Annapolis .
The prognosis is poor .
But if , against all expectation , they should agree on , say , the exact amount of land that Israel is prepared to relinquish in the West Bank and Gaza , even without specifying the shape of the border , it could make this sad 60th anniversary of the nakba almost celebratory .
Every spring , the Earth blooms .
Scientists call it greenup : New buds sprout , fresh leaves unfurl , and continents turns green .
Exactly when greenup takes place each year is the result of an algorithm embedded in the DNA of plants .
They track the rising temperature in spring , gauge the rainfall , measure the lengthening days , and then calculate when to start growing .
People have been trying to figure out the greenup algorithm for millennia .
Farmers needed to know when to plant their crops ; herders needed to know when pastures would be ready for their herds .
In China and Japan , greenup records reach back 5,000 years .
In 18th - century Europe , greenup became a hobby .
A wealthy British landowner named Robert Marsham noted the days on which oaks began to bloom .
His children and their children continued to record the coming of spring for 211 years .
They were joined by other citizen scientists , who work together today through online networks such as Project BudBurst .
Professional scientists are managing networks of their own .
Mark Schwartz at the University of Wisconsin oversees 1,100 sites in the United States where researchers track the greenup of lilacs .
Among the many things these networks have revealed is that the greenup algorithm is n't a simple calendar .
Plants do not bloom on the same day every year .
In a cold spring , greenup may come late ; in a warm one it may come early .
But over the past few decades , the greenup records have revealed something new .
On average , greenup has been arriving steadily earlier and earlier in the year .
Spring , in other words , is on the march .
There was a good reason to expect this to happen :
The planet has gotten warmer .
Today Earth 's average temperature is 1.2 degrees Fahrenheit higher than it was a century ago .
The consensus ( .pdf ) of the world 's climate scientists is that humans are mainly responsible for that rise by releasing heat - trapping gases like carbon dioxide .
In a rapidly warming world , you might well expect plants to respond with a faster greenup .
But nature does not play by simple rules .
Xiaoyang Zhang and his colleagues at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration analyzed satellite observations of greenup from 1982 to 2005 .
In much of North America greenup is coming earlier – in some places more than three weeks earlier than in 1982 .
But in 30 percent of North America , the greenup comes later – in some cases more than three weeks later .
In the past , scientists have noticed delayed greenups in several places .
Zhang 's new map makes clear that it's not just happening in a couple of isolated valleys .
So why is it happening ?
It has to do with something called a chill unit .
If you grow peaches for a living , you know all about chill units .
They measure how much cold a plant experiences during a winter .
And chill units are essential to a good crop of peaches .
When plants go dormant at the end of summer , many of them have to experience a certain amount of time in cold weather before they can grow on schedule in the spring .
If a peach tree does n’t get enough chill units , it ca n’t respond promptly to the warmth of spring .
It is still in a zombie - like dormancy , and it can only rouse itself after the spring gets even warmer .
Zhang and his colleagues discovered that global warming has been affecting chill units .
North of about 35 degrees latitude – a line that cuts through North Carolina – plants still get enough chilling in the winter to be ready for the spring .
When the warm temperatures come early , they start growing .
That ’s why much of the northern part of the continent is experiencing early greenup .
But south of that line , plants have lost as many as 11 chilling days .
Now they come into spring still dormant , and only after spring has gotten warmer can they finally start to come to life .
There ’s probably more to the new greenup map than chill units .
The NOAA team did not take water into account , for instance .
Rainfall has been changing across North America over the past 23 years , and it may have put a thumb on the greenup scales .
Nevertheless , warmer winters have had a big effect on greenup , and they will have an even bigger one if , as climate scientists project , temperatures rise several degrees over the next century .
The NOAA scientists predict that in Canada and the northern part of the United States , greenup will start even earlier .
In the far south , it will start even later .
And in a band stretching from North Carolina all the way up to New Jersey , spring will make an about - face .
In this band , spring is now coming earlier than before , but in a matter of decades it will lose so many chill units that spring will start coming later .
These shifts will force peach farmers – and other farmers , too – to change how they raise crops .
Insects , birds and other animals will also get a rude surprise .
They time their own life cycles to match plant cycles , but have different genetic algorithms ( to factor temperature , rainfall , length of days , etc. ) that set when they hatch or migrate .
The plants they depend on for food may come too early or too late for them .
What makes the greenup map especially important is that it shows that global warming is not some simple , all - or - nothing thing .
It ’s always tempting to use an easy shorthand and say that the Earth is ablaze , as if global warming were a switch that was turned on or off .
Climate change denialists sometimes try to exploit this yes - or - no way of thinking by finding one bit of data that defies the trend .
A single cold year , or a single place where the temperature has not risen , is not proof that global warming is a hoax .
The fact that spring is coming later and earlier in large parts of North America does not either .
In fact , a close look at how plants really work shows that this greenup map is just the sort of thing you ’d expect global warming to do .
Like everything in nature , global warming wo n’t submit to simple overgeneralizations .
But its complexity offers no comfort , either .
Spring is changing fast – in ways we are only beginning to understand .

Barack Obama now faces a new challenge – one that is sure to be much more scandalous than anything he ’s seen so far .
If the allegations are to be believed , it ’s also a scandal that his campaign has tried to cover up .
A Minnesota man has come forth , claiming that he took cocaine in 1999 with Obama , the then - Illinois legislator , and participated in homosexual acts with him .
Larry Sinclair , the man making the claims , said his story was ignored by the news media .
Still not willing to let this one slip quietly under the rug , Sinclair made a YouTube video in which he made his case .
It ’s had over half a million views already , but the story has still been largely ignored by the news media .
Sinclair ’s next step was to file a suit in Minnesota District Court , in which he alleges threats and intimidation by the Democratic presidential candidate ’s staff .
Still out to prove that he is telling the truth , Sinclair said he is willing to submit to a polygraph test .
A website ( WhiteHouse.com ) has come forth offering him $ 10,000 for the right to record the polygraph test , and another $ 100,000 if he passes it .
Sinclair lives in Duluth , Minnesota , and in his filing , charges that his civil rights have been violated by Barack Obama and the Democratic Party .
Obama , David Axelrod of AKP Message & Media in Chicago , and the Democratic National Committee have been named as defendants in the case .
Sinclair , who describes himself as gay , claims they met in an upscale Chicago lounge .
They left in Sinclair ’s limo , where the drug use and sex allegedly took place for the first time .
Sinclair says that Obama smoked crack cocaine , and that he snorted powder cocaine provided by Obama .
Sinclair , 46 , says that he no longer uses drugs .
He claims to be physically disabled , but says that he was not physically impaired in 1999 when they met .
Regarding the claims , Sinclair said :
“ My motivation for making this public is my desire for a presidential candidate to be honest .
I did n’t want the sex thing to come out .
But I think it is important for the candidate to be honest about his drug use as late as 1999 . ”

NBC confronts Hillary with ' slum lord ' photo Michael Roston and David Edwards
Published : Friday January 25 , 2008

Print This Email This On Friday morning 's episode of the Today Show on NBC , host Matt Lauer discussed Monday night 's testy debate between presidential candidates Sens. Hillary Clinton ( D - NY ) and Barack Obama ( D - IL ) .
In particular , he focused on her allegation that Obama had represented Tony Rezko , the indicted Chicago businessman whom she referred to as a " slum lord . "
Lauer then presented Clinton with a photo of Rezko posing between Sen.
Clinton as first lady and her husband during his presidency .
He asked if she remembered meeting Rezko .
Clinton said she did not , and parried , " I do n't have a 17 - year relationship with him . "
The senator also argued that it was n't unfair for her to bring up Rezko during the debate .
" I try not to attack first , " Clinton said , " but I have to defend myself and I do have to counter punch . "
Clinton then argued that the debate between the two candidates should focus on their position on important issues , and implied that she was the most viable candidate to defeat Senator John McCain if he was the Republican candidate .
" Let 's focus on what we want to do for the country and most importantly focus on the great difference between us and the Republicans , " she argued .
" Senator McCain has said it would be fine with him if we were [ in Iraq ] 100 years .
It 's not fine with me . "
A clip of the exchange is presented below .
This video is from NBC's Today Show , broadcast January 25 , 2008 .
Transcript via closed captions
:: It is perfectly legitimate to draw comparisons and contrasts .
And I think both senator obama and I have made it clear that we do want to focus on what we each would do for our country .
It has been obviously an incredibly intense campaign .
I think it 's cause for celebration that we have an african - american , a woman running for the highest position in our country , the toughest job in the world .
:: Right , but --
:: But I do want to make it clear that our campaigns have to stay focused on what , you know , the legitimate differences are , so we can give voters information that will enable them to make the right decision .
:: On monday night in south carolina , it did n't always stay focused on that , senator .
I want to run a clip .
This is where you were attacking senator obama in particular about his work connected to what was called the so - called slum lord in chicago , a guy named tony rezko .
Take a look at the clip .
:: I was fighting against those ideas when you were practicing law and representing your contributor rezko in his slum landlord business in inner city chicago .
:: That was monday night , senator .
I know you do n't have video , you can't see what i'm about to put up on the screen right now .
But i'm going to put up a picture right now that we 've received .
This is a picture of you and your husband , bill clinton , posing with that same man , tony rezko .
It 's undated , i'm going to ro -tel you right now .
We know it 's him .
We do n't know when it was taken .
We think it was during your husband 's presidency .
I 'm curious , do you know anything about the picture ?
do you know when it was taken ?
do you remember meeting this man ?
:: No , I do n't .
You know , I probably have taken hundreds of thousands of pictures .
But of course , matt , you did n't show what preceded what I said , which was a direct attack , one of several that was leveled against me by senator obama .
:: I understand .
It was a counter punch , I understand that .
:: It was a counter punch .
I try not to attack first , but I have to defend myself and I do have to counter punch .
No , I do n't know the man .
I would n't know him if he walked in the door .
I do n't have a 17 - year relationship with him .
But I think with a we ought to be looking at is how we go forward talking about the issues .
I do think , however , that this is a campaign , it 's a contest .
It 's something that is very important to each of us running , to our supporters , to those who believe in us .
And I took a lot of incoming fire for many , many months and I was happy to absorb it because obviously I felt that that was part of my responsibility .
:: I guess what i'm saying , though --
:: As it gets toward the end of the campaign , you 've got to set the record straight as I tried to .
:: Right .
But does it make sense to use someone like this , tony rezko , against senator obama , when there 's really no such thing as political purt anymore ?
I know you stand at events and stood as first lady along with your president and they fired 200 people by you a night --
:: A thousand people .
:: This man , he made a contribution to the dnc back in march of 2000 .
If there 's no such thing as being able to fully vette who you come in contact with , is it appropriate to make this attack on your opponent ?
:: I think you have to look at the facts .
There 's a big difference standing somewhere taking a picture with someone you do n't know and have n't seen since and having a relationship that the newspapers in chic chicago have been exploring .
Let 's focus on what we want to do for the country and most importantly focus on the great difference between us and the republicans .
I think you saw that again in their debate .
They 're sticking with the failed policies of president bush , more in iraq .
Senator mccain has said it would be fine with him if we were there 100 years .
It 's not fine with me .
Yes --
:: Real quickly , the latest poll --
:: So you have to -- right , you have to draw those comparisons and I think that 's fair .
Militant attacks and strikes have pushed up oil prices President Umaru Yar 'Adua has ordered Nigeria 's state - run oil company to demand nearly $ 2bn in arrears from two major oil companies .
The government say Royal Dutch Shell and ExxonMobil have not paid taxes and production sharing costs they owe on two offshore oil fields .
The companies say they have followed the law and are in discussions with the government .
Militant attacks and funding troubles have seen Nigeria cut its production .
" ExxonMobil affiliate fully complies with all laws and regulations and has paid taxes and royalties to Nigeria accordingly , " AFP reported ExxonMobil responding .
" Our affiliate routinely has ongoing discussions with a number of government agencies on a variety of topics , including tax .
We do not comment on ongoing discussions , " it said .
Shell Nigeria Exploration and Production Company ( Snepco ) refused to comment while there were " ongoing discussions " between it and the government .
Contract negotiations
The Production Sharing Contracts agreed with the oil majors in the deep water production fields are coming up for renegotiation .
A BBC correspondent says the price of oil has rocketed since they were first negotiated and the government may be trying to improve their negotiation position .
At the same time , the Nigerian National Petroleum Company ( NNPC ) has not been able to fund its share of the joint venture agreements for on - shore oil production , and is trying to find other ways of paying for them , says the BBC's Alex Last in Lagos .
Militant idea Militant attacks and strikes by Nigerian oil workers have helped push oil prices to record highs .
The defence ministry has suggested militant attacks could be brought under control by employing the very militants conducting the attacks to police the pipelines , newspaper This Day reported .
" We will engage them to police oil pipelines , but they must first form themselves into limited liability companies for us to discuss with them , " Defence Minister Yayale Ahmed told a House of Representatives committee on Tuesday .
" That 's a matter for the defence ministry to comment on , " a spokesman for the oil company Royal Dutch Shell told the BBC .
A defence ministry spokesman was not available for comment .

What are these ?
The former US president Jimmy Carter has called for his country to resume trade relations with Iran , which he described as a " rational " nation .
Speaking at the Hay Festival yesterday , Mr Carter also suggested the US should provide nuclear power technology and fuel to Iran as a show of goodwill .
" What happens if , in three years time , Iran has a nuclear weapon , " Mr Carter asked .
" I 'm not sure that is going to happen , but if it does , what do we do ?
They are rational people like all of us in this room .
Do they want to commit suicide ?
I would guess not .
So what we have to do is talk with them now and say to them we want to be their friends .
The United States must let Iran know that we want to give them fuel and everything they need for a non-military nuclear programme .
Twenty - five years ago we cut off trading with Iran .
We 've got to resume trading to show Iran we are friends . "
During the Carter administration , 52 American diplomats were held hostage by the Iranians for over a year , and only freed on the last day of his presidency in 1981 .

Mr Carter also criticised President George Bush , saying it was a " serious mistake and terrible departure " from the actions of previous US presidents not to engage with countries with which they differed .
" The president of the administration in Washington is the first one to have ever done this and I think we close off ourselves from any sort of rational accommodation of the views of other parties in order to reach out on major goals , " said Carter , in a further interview with Sky Arts , to be broadcast today .
MEXICO CITY ( Reuters ) - Mexico ’s top electoral body ordered broadcasters to stop running a controversial TV ad on Monday that compares a firebrand leftist leading a siege of Congress to dictators Hitler and Pinochet .
Former presidential candidate Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador speeches to supporters during a meeting as Mexico celebrate the 70th anniversary of the expropriation of Mexico 's oil industry at Mexico City 's Zocalo in this March 18 , 2008 file photo .

The TV ad , funded by a Mexican businessman angry at a blockade of Congress by opposition lawmakers trying to derail an oil reform plan , says the antics of protest leader Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador are endangering democracy .
“ The complaints committee decided unanimously to order the withdrawal of the spot from today , ” a spokesman for the Federal Electoral Institute told Reuters .
Leftists seized Congress podiums on April 10 to block a government proposal to lower barriers to private investment in the oil sector , controlled by the state since 1938 .
The action has left Congress paralyzed .
“ Who shuts congresses ?
In 1933 , Adolf Hitler in Germany .
In 1939 , Benito Mussolini in Italy .
In 1973 , Augusto Pinochet of Chile , ” the ad says , over grainy footage of the Nazi leader , his fascist ally in Italy and Chile ’s late military dictator .
The 30 - second spot was a flashback to conservative ads run in the 2006 election campaign calling the former rights activist and then presidential hopeful a danger to Mexico .
“ Our democracy is in danger .
Our peace is at risk .
Mexico does not deserve this , ” the voice - over said .
The left - wing Party of the Democratic Revolution had asked the electoral institute to order the spot off the air .
Lopez Obrador infuriated President Felipe Calderon by claiming his narrow defeat in the 2006 was fraudulent and paralyzing central Mexico City with sit -in protest camps .
Concerned about increasingly heated rhetoric and street protests over the energy proposal , Calderon ’s National Action Party had also condemned the ad and said it should be withdrawn .
Left - wingers , who say the proposed energy bill would amount to a sneaking privatization of oil monopoly Pemex , have vowed to stay put until Congress closes for the summer on April 30 , unless the PAN offers a four - month debate on the issue .
Years in parentheses denote when a director 's term expires .
About the Board of Directors
Under Section 4 of the Federal Reserve Act , each Federal Reserve Bank , including the Federal Reserve Bank of New York , operates pursuant to the supervision of a Board of Directors , in addition to the general supervision of the Board of Governors in Washington , D.C. The Bank ’s Board of Directors has nine members , all chosen from outside the Reserve Bank , who are divided into three equal classes — designated A , B and C .
The Class A and Class B directors are elected by the member commercial banks of the Second District .
The Class C directors are appointed by the Board of Governors .
Each year , one Class C director at each Reserve Bank is designated by the Board of Governors as chair of the Bank ’s Board of Directors , and a second Class C director is designated deputy chair .
Class
A directors are required to be representative of the member banks in the District and for the most part they have been officers or directors of member banks or their holding companies .
Class B and Class C directors are required to represent the public “ with due but not exclusive consideration to the interests of agriculture , commerce , industry , services , labor and consumers . ”
Neither Class B nor Class C directors may be officers , directors or employees of any private sector bank or bank holding company .
In addition , Class C directors may not own shares in any bank or bank holding company .
The purpose of these rules is to ensure that a diversity of viewpoints and backgrounds is represented on each Reserve Bank board .
Typically , a Reserve Bank board will include representatives from local industry , the non-profit sector and the banking sector .
The roles of Reserve Bank directors generally fall in three principal areas : overseeing the management of the Reserve Banks , participating in the formulation of national monetary and credit policies and acting as a “ link ” between the government and the private sector .
In the exercise of its management oversight responsibilities , a Reserve Bank ’s Board of Directors reviews and establishes with management the Bank ’s annual goals and objectives , reviews and approves the budget , and conducts an independent appraisal of the performance of both the Bank ( including its efficiency and productivity ) and its president and first vice president .
The Reserve Bank directors supervise , through a general auditor whom they appoint , and who reports directly to them , the maintenance of an effective system of internal auditing procedures .
Directors have a special role with respect to monetary policy and credit policy .
In this function , directors , with their diverse backgrounds , bring to the Federal Reserve System the greatest benefits of regional autonomy : a diversity of viewpoints on economic and credit conditions .
This input helps the Federal Reserve anticipate changing trends in the economy .
The Federal Reserve Act gives each Reserve Bank the power to establish discount rates , subject to review and determination by the Board of Governors .
Another principal responsibility of each Reserve Bank board is to select a Bank president who , in its judgment , will be qualified to participate in the monetary policy deliberations and decisions of the Federal Open Market Committee .
Effective July 21 , 2010 , the Dodd - Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection
Act allows only Class B and Class C directors to participate in the presidential appointment process .
In addition to the Federal Reserve Act , the role of the New York Fed ’s board is also addressed in the Bank ’s bylaws and in the charters for the three board committees — the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee , the Audit and Risk Committee and the Management and Budget Committee .
These further define the Board ’s role and responsibilities as well as the limitations on its role and responsibilities .
The Bank ’s bylaws make clear that particular bank supervisory and regulatory matters do not fall within the purview of the Bank ’s Board of Directors .
Further , Class A directors may not participate in personnel or budget decisions related to the Bank ’s Financial Institution Supervision Group , nor may they comprise a majority of the membership of either the Audit and Risk Committee or the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee .
Furthermore , all directors , like all Reserve Bank employees , are generally precluded from participating in any matter in which they have a financial interest .
These constraints are designed to minimize the risk of an actual or perceived conflict of interest at the board level .
The securities backing a $ 29 billion Fed loan to Bear Stearns Cos. consist primarily of “ mortgage backed securities and related hedge investments , ” the Treasury Department says .

Remember the brouhaha when Apple told a third - grader to get lost when she wrote a letter to Steve Jobs about her ideas to improve the iPod ?
Well , compare that to how Nokia treats its users ' suggestions :
Nokia researchers did n't quite know what to expect when , in March , 2007 , they posted a mobile phone application called Sports Tracker on a company Web site that is open to the public .
The program , still a work in progress , was designed to let runners and cyclists take advantage of the global positioning capability included in some Nokia models .
Users can record workout data such as speed and distance , and can plot routes .
The response to Sports Tracker was overwhelming .
Eventually more than 1 million people downloaded the program and used it for sports the developers never dreamed of , such as paragliding , hot - air ballooning , and motorcycle riding .
More importantly , the users avidly provided criticism that Nokia ( NOK ) then used to make improvements .
Based on reader feedback , for example , developers added the capability to create online groups where users can share favorite routes and even photos they took along the way .
" People were misusing the application in creative ways , " says Jussi Kaasinen , a member of the team at Nokia Research Center in Helsinki that developed Sports Tracker .
You 've heard of user - generated content ?
Sports Tracker is an example of how Nokia has begun experimenting with user - generated innovation .
That 's the premise behind Nokia Beta Labs , a Web site where the Finnish handset maker lets users test the latest smartphone software .
Instead of people recording silly Web cam videos for YouTube or inventing frivolous advocacy groups on Facebook , they can help make the mobile Internet more useful .
The photo above is Sam from Accra , India Ghana , who sketched his dream phone in open studios set up by Nokia 's design team where users can submit their best ideas .

The six most quoted " too awesome to be true " stats that , in fact , are ...
Unfortunately , some people are so desperate for interesting facts to quote , that they 'll just pull them right out of their ass .
Then those facts get repeated , by -- you guessed it -- people like us .
Every once in a while , you 'll hear a statistic so striking you can hardly believe it 's true .
Our first impulse is to repeat it , because knowing interesting things tends to make people like us better .

6 You Accidentally Swallow About 8 Spiders a Year
This extremely commonly believed statistic has been fed to us by countless internet chain mails , and probably by some know - it - all kid who sat next to you in some class or other .
When you sleep , you open your mouth to breath ( and drool on your pillow ) , and supposedly this is the ideal window of oppurtunity for all the spiders who hang out near your bed hoping to be eaten alive .

Why Is It a Load of Crap ?
Well , first of all , this a real kick in the crotch of the intellect of spiders everywhere .
Although spiders are occasionally seen doing stupid things , it 's safe to assume they have enough wit to realize when they 're about to crawl through the mouth of a damned giant .
If the giant white teeth are n't enough to deter them from going spelunking down your dark , wet throat ( apparently no other animals have these ) you 'd think the heavy draft and deafening snoring sounds would be some sort of indication of how terrible a home your mouth would be .
Who Started It ?
Back in 1993 , people were already getting fooled by online urban legends at an amusing rate .
So , a columnist for PC Professional named Lisa Holst decided to prove that you could make up anything on the internet and people would believe it .

She did this by making up a set of facts that were utterly ridiculous , the spider myth among them ( which itself was taken from a collection of insect folklore that dates back to the 1950s ) , and unleashing it on the world in the form of emails .
In a twist of oh - so - predictable irony , people who forwarded chain mail about this just " happened " to forget to include the fact that these were completely fake .
Who Was Fooled ?
Ask a group of internet strangers and you 'll find at least a handful of people who wholeheartedly believe this myth .
Presumably because they read it somewhere .

In 2006 The UK's Daily Mirror warned that " the average person will swallow anything from eight to 20 spiders before they die . "
Not satisfied to go along with the normal fudged data , The Mirror upped the ante of retardation by adding " A spider is also likely to drink from your eye at least THREE times in your life .
Some experts have suggested they are attracted by the vibrations of snoring and the smell of undigested food - a good reason to floss your teeth before bedtime . "
Really , is that what it takes to get the UK to worry about dental hygiene ?
President Bush yesterday signed legislation into law that will bar health insurance companies or employers from denying or canceling coverage , hiking premiums or making decisions on hiring , firing and compensation based on genetic test results .
The Genetic Information Nondiscrimination
Act of 2008 ( GINA ) sailed through the Senate in late April , following a year of political wrangling , and a week later passed the House by a 414 - to - 1 margin .
Rep. Louise Slaughter ( D - N.Y. ) , a microbiologist with a master 's degree in public health , introduced the first genetic antidiscrimination legislation 13 years ago .
GINA supporters believe the act will encourage people to take advantage of the more than 1,000 genetic tests now available to diagnose and assess risk of diseases without fear of losing their jobs or being denied insurance coverage for doing so .
SEOUL ( Reuters ) - South Korea said on Thursday it had culled 3 million farmed birds and confirmed three more outbreaks of bird flu , as the country grapples with its worst avian influenza outbreak in four years .
Slideshow ( 3 images )
In just two weeks South Korea has confirmed 15 cases of the deadly H5N1 strain , raising alarm as the highly virulent virus is spreading at its fastest rate since the country reported its first case in 2003 .
The farm ministry said on Thursday it had seven new reports of suspected bird flu outbreaks at poultry farms in North and South Jeolla provinces , some 320 km ( 200 miles ) south of Seoul , where the first bird flu recurrence for a year was reported earlier this month .
It also said it would slaughter hundreds of thousands of birds in the most severely affected southwestern part of the country , as it confirmed three new outbreaks of the deadly H5N1 in the area late on Thursday .
The country raised the risk level for bird flu to the second highest on Wednesday and sent 200 soldiers to kill and bury birds , as an outbreak was confirmed at a farm in Pyeongtaek , just 60 km south of Seoul , bringing the disease closer to the capital .
But South Korean authorities have come under heavy criticism as the highly pathogenic virus continues to spread , despite their rigorous efforts , and as they have failed to provide clear explanations for the cause of the fast spread .
The farm ministry said its quarantine work would focus on speeding up slaughtering and investigating possible causes of the spread such as migrating birds and transport workers who have been moving around affected sites and other parts of the country .
The fast - spreading outbreak has hit poultry consumption , posing a big threat to farmers already struggling with high animal feed prices .
Han told related ministers to consider helping farmers with tax benefits , financial assistance and budget spending .
South Korea , which estimates it will spend 32 billion won ( $ 32.4 million ) on quarantine work in the current outbreak , also plans to introduce insurance products that offer up to 2 billion won compensation if a human infection is reported following poultry consumption .
Chicken sales in the past 15 days have dropped 60 percent at four major retailers surveyed by the farm ministry , while prices of chicken and duck dropped up to 10 percent .
The country had seven bird flu outbreaks between November 2006 and March last year and 19 cases between December 2003 and March 2004 , when it had to kill 5.3 million birds .
No human deaths have been reported .
Some 240 human deaths have been reported globally from the H5N1 strain and 380 confirmed cases of infection since 2003 , according to World Health Organisation data .
You could be forgiven for thinking that invisibility cloaks are a few R&D dollars away from hitting the high streets .
Not so .
While it ’s true that a number of high profile cloaks have been built , the best of these work only in the radio and microwave regions of the spectrum and then only in at a single frequency and in two dimensions .
So unless you are a flatlander viewing the world through microwave eyes , these cloaks are not much use .
The one claim for an optical invisibility cloak works only inside a strange , exotic material made from gold nanorods and even then over a distance of a only few nanometres .
What an invisibility cloak has to do is steer light around an internal cavity in way that makes it appear to have passed straight through .
That ’s possible , in theory , if you can design a material in which its permeability and permittivity ( the way it interacts with an electromagnetic wave ) can be tailored throughout its structure .
That can be done relatively easily at microwave frequencies .
The materials in question are extraordinary honeycombs of repeating patterns of split ring resonators and wires .
The pattern has to be about the same size as the wavelength of the microwaves– a few centimetres or so .
So why not just make everything smaller to match the wavelength of visible light ?
The first reason is that we ’re talking about a material with a feature size measured in nanometres and that is just beyond what ’s possible today .
The second is that optical frequencies tend to match the resonant frequency of electrons within these materials .
What that means in plain English is that the materials absorb light rather than transmit it ( which is why the one demonstration so far has worked only over a distance of a few nanometres before the light was absorbed ) .
So what to do ?
One idea is to make the cloaks out of lasing materials which constantly replace the light as it is absorbed .
But a better one is to create a material that does n’t absorb light in the first place .
There ’s no way to get rid of the electronic resonance that is responsible for absorbing light so the trick is to design a structure in which the resonance can be made to cancel itself out or help to propel the light through the material .
So physicists are desperately examining the properties of various nanostructures to see whether they might have the properties that fit the bill .
Today , Andrea Alu and Nadar Enghet at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia , publish an analysis of just such a metamaterial made of nanoparticles arranged in a ring , as shown above .
They say that this material gives “ cleaner magnetic dipole response ” .
Unfortunately , they are less clear over whether they ’ve hit the jackpot with regards optical invisibility .
In fact they ca n’t be sure whether this will have the required properties at optical frequencies or not .
The trouble is that it ’s not possible to know the bulk properties of a material made from a particular nanostructure without some heavyweight calculating .
And choosing which structure to investigate is little more than guesswork at the moment .
As Alu and Enghet show with this work .
Back to the drawingboard , I ’d say .
Looks as if they ’ll need to kiss a few more frogs before they find their prince .

BRAVE firefighters who saved a woman engulfed in flames were verbally reprimanded for leaving the door of their engine open as a leaked report has revealed .
The North Manchester crew was quizzed by a member of a brigade inspection squad who had turned up to observe the rescue .
Firefighters had been called to a blaze and when they arrived at the scene found a woman on fire in the garden .
The crew rushed from their engine and beat the fire out before giving the woman CPR .
But a report says that despite their life - saving actions , the crew were challenged by a member of the brigade 's Performance Review Team ( PRT ) over the open door and leaving a blood donor sticker in the cab window .
The report , which was commissioned by the brigade and written by academic Peter Moran , says : " The crew were called to help a woman on fire in a front garden during which they had to beat out the fire on her and give her CPR .
" A member of the PRT in attendance inquired as to why the pump door had been left open and why there was a blood donor sticker in the window . "
The report was carried out to try and discover why Greater Manchester firefighters feel undervalued and why they regard relations with higher management difficult .
Since June 2005 the PRT has carried out spot checks at stations and incidents to monitor performance and standards .
Negative
But the report found : " The PRT was raised at some point during every watch visit and it is no exaggeration to state that they are deeply resented by operational fire crews who regard their function as overwhelmingly negative .
" It is the firm belief of operational crews that the PRT are there to find fault with them - they never received positive feedback - the words `catch us out ' and `pettiness ' cropped up with regular monotony . "
The PRT also made a dawn visit to Bury Fire station last year and reported three firefighters for sleeping on the floor instead of £ 400 reclining chairs .
In his report Mr Moran reveals other `trivial issues ' for which firefighters have been reprimanded or threatened with a reprimand include :
* Chinstraps undone ( on the way from an incident ) .
* Helmets hung the wrong way round .
* Shirt left on back of chair .
* Rubbish left in a station rubbish bin when new watch were due to start shift .
Mr Moran 's report contains comments from a number of firefighters about the PRT .
One North Manchester firefighter said : " The PRT use scare tactics and bullying .
They are there to enforce policies and beat us with a stick .
They have to find something wrong or they get told off . "
Offensive
Another said : " The whole concept of it is offensive .
You 're fighting a large fire and you 've got some bloke stood next to you waiting for you to make a mistake .
It 's intimidating .
We are hard working people - the PRT is part of the culture of catching out and inventing reasons to try and catch people out . "
County Fire Officer Barry Dixon said : " Reviewing how we perform as a Fire and Rescue Service is essential if we are to further improve the first class service we provide .
" The Performance Review Team ( PRT ) has been instrumental in offering advice and support on all aspects of performance , identifying best practice and any areas of improvement .
" Their role of supporting Borough Commanders to establish an effective means of managing performance has , there is no doubt , made Greater Manchester a safer place to live , work and visit .
" Since June 2005 , Dwelling Fires , Commercial Property Fires and Vehicle Fires have decreased by over 3000 .
In addition , injuries to members of the public have decreased by 34 % and fires involving rubbish , skips and waste have been reduced by 2000 over the last year .
" The Manchester Evening News recently raised concerns over issues such as BA procedure and officer development , many of these points had been previously identified by the PRT and is part of an improvement plan .
" Since the introduction of PRT in June 2005 there has been a 25 % reduction in accidents at incidents , a significant contribution in fire - fighter safety .
" Although some may not like being assessed doing their job it is a matter of life in the modern work place that we monitor to reduce accidents and improve performance . "

The movie , which is a conceptual interpretation of the data , was made by Cosmovision , a group led by Dr. Wolfgang Steffen of the Instituto de Astronomia , UNAM , Ensenada , Mexico ( see below ) .
The animation features a bright " knot " that moves through the jet away from the black hole .
An outburst of visible light , X - rays , and gamma- rays is seen as the knot reaches maximum speed at the edge of the region with coiled magnetic field ( twisted light - blue lines ) .
A second outburst occurs when the knot passes through and is compressed by a stationary shock wave ( the " X " shaped feature ) .
Caption : Illustration of a shock wave ( bright " blob " in the upper jet ) following a
spiral path ( in yellow ) as it moves away from the black hole and through a section of
the jet where the magnetic field ( light blue curved lines ) is wound up in a coil .
This caused the
first brightening seen in visible , X - ray , and gamma - ray light ; later , the
shock passed through the stationary X - shaped compression in the jet and
brightened a second time .

BURSTS OF RADIATION REVEAL HOW BLACK HOLES MAKE JETS
At the cores of many galaxies , supermassive black holes , millions of times more massive than the Sun , propel powerful jets of charged particles outward at nearly the speed of light .
Just how they perform that feat has long been one of the great mysteries of astrophysics .
The leading theory says that the particles are accelerated by tightly - twisted magnetic fields close to the black hole , but confirming that idea required an elusive close - up view of the jet 's inner throat .
Now , using the National Science Foundation 's Very Long Baseline Array ( VLBA ) radio telescope , along with NASA 's Rossi X-ray Timing Exporer and a number of telescopes observing at visible wavelengths , astronomers have watched material winding a corkscrew outward path and behaving exactly as predicted by the theory .
" We have gotten the clearest look yet at the innermost portion of the jet , where the stream of particles is actually accelerated , and everything we see supports the idea that twisted , coiled magnetic fields are propelling the material outward , " said Alan Marscher of Boston University , leader of an international research team .
" This is a major advance in our understanding of a remarkable process that occurs throughout the Universe , " he added .
Marscher 's team includes Boston University senior research associate Svetlana Jorstad , graduate student Francesca D'Arcangelo , and undergraduate students Haruki Oh and Alice Olmstead , as well as researchers from the University of Arizona 's Steward and Multiple Mirror observatories , the University of Michigan , Georgia State University , St. Petersburg State University in Russia ( with a telescope at the Crimean Astrophysical Observatory ) , the University of Southampton and Cardiff University in the UK , Metsahovi Radio Observatory of the Helsinki University of Technology ( TKK ) , and University of Turku in Finland , Perugia University Observatory in Italy , and Abastumani Astrophysical Observatory in the Republic of Georgia .
The astronomers studied a galaxy called BL Lacertae ( BL Lac ) , located about 950 million light - years from Earth .
BL Lac is a blazar , the most energetic type of black - hole - powered galactic core .
A black hole is a concentration of mass so dense that not even light can escape its gravitational pull .
Supermassive black holes - about 200 million times the mass of our Sun in the case of BL Lac - in these galaxies ' cores power jets of electrically charged particles and intense radiation .
Material pulled inward toward the black hole forms a flattened , rotating disk , called an accretion disk .
As the material moves from the outer edge of the disk inward , magnetic field lines perpendicular to the disk are twisted , forming a tightly - coiled bundle that , astronomers believe , propels and confines the ejected particles .
Closer to the black hole , space itself , including the magnetic fields , is twisted by the strong gravitational pull and rotation of the black hole .
Theorists predicted that material moving outward in this close - in acceleration region would follow a corkscrew - shaped path inside the bundle of twisted magnetic fields .
They also predicted that light and other radiation emitted by the moving material would brighten when its rotating path was aimed most directly toward Earth .
Marscher and his colleagues anticipated that there might also be a flare later when the material hits a stationary shock wave called the " core " some time after it has emerged from the acceleration region .
" That behavior is exactly what we saw , " Marscher said , when his team followed an outburst of radiation from BL Lac .
In late 2005 and early 2006 , the astronomers watched BL Lac with an international collection of ground - and space - based telescopes as a bright knot of condensed material was ejected outward through the jet .
As the material sped out from the neighborhood of the black hole , the VLBA could pinpoint its location , while other telescopes measured the properties of the radiation emitted from the knot .
Bright bursts of light , X rays , and gamma rays came when the knot was precisely at locations where the theories said such bursts would be seen .
In addition , the property of the radio and light waves called polarization rotated as the knot wound its corkscrew path inside the tight throat of twisted magnetic fields .
" We got an unprecedented view of the inner portion of one of these jets and gained information that 's very important to understanding how these tremendous particle accelerators work , " Marscher said .

MOVIE !!
that you can download in any of 3 formats .
The movie illustrates what we think is going on near the center of BL Lac .
This is an animation ( not from real data ) created by Cosmovision * .
360 sq. pixels best for computer screens )
ntsc version ( for US television , video codec : DVC - PRO )
pal version ( for European television )
Description of the movie :
The supermassive black hole ( with a mass of about 200 millions times that of the Sun , which corresponds to an event horizon that is about twice as large as the size of the Earth 's orbit around the Sun ) is just a very tiny black dot at the center .
Surrounding it is an accretion disk of gas and dust from interstellar space that is slowly falling into the black hole while rotating around it in nearly circular orbits .
( Despite the black hole 's strong gravity , the gas has too much inertia because of the rotation of the disk to fall directly into the black hole .
Instead , it swirls around until a process similar to friction slows it enough to fall past the event horizon . )
The accretion disk contains a magnetic field that is twisted by the rotation ( which is faster closer to the black hole ) .
A coiled magnetic field creates a pinching force that focuses the plasma ( charged particles that move together ) into a narrow jet as it flows away from the black hole .
( The magnetic field itself is probably kept from expanding excessively by pressure from a wind that we think surrounds the jet . )
We think that outbursts of radiation from blazars are triggered near the black hole , where some explosive event ( such as " reconnection " of magnetic field in places where oppositely directed magnetic fields come in contact ) shoots extra energy down the jet .
This probably forms a shock wave that moves down the jet along a spiral path .
The jet flow velocity increases with distance from the black hole , driven by magnetic forces .
As the speed approaches the speed of light , the radiation is beamed more and more in the forward direction , similar to focusing a halogen flashlight .
Since the jet points almost in our direction , the radiation from the shock wave gets most intense when the velocity reaches its maximum value , 0.98 times the speed of light .
This actually creates an illusion that the bright knot of material made by the shock is moving 5 times faster than light travels .
A few weeks later , after the emission has faded as the material in the shock expands and cools , we see a second brightening when the material is compressed by a stationary shock wave created by a pressure difference between the jet and the gas of the surrounding galaxy .
The crucial aspect is what happened during the first flare .
The polarization - which indicates the direction of the magnetic field - made about 1.5 rotations .
So , that means that the blob passed through a coiled magnetic field .
( In order to break the symmetry so that the polarization from different parts of the coil do n't cancel , the blob needs to cover less than 100 % of the width of the jet and it needs to follow a loose spiral path . )
We surmise that the reason for the rise in brightness is the acceleration of the blob as it passes through the region of coiled magnetic field .
All of this is exactly what was predicted by theorists , especially Nektarios Vlahakis ( U. Athens , Greece ) and Arieh Konigl ( U. Chicago ) .
But previous observations did not have frequent enough VLBA imaging combined with polarization observations and closely spaced measurements of the radio , visible , and X - ray brightness to fill in enough pieces of the puzzle to determine what is happening physically in the jets .
We hope that we can get an even better look at the jet - maybe see even closer to the black hole - when NASA 's GLAST satellite observatory is launched in May , providing us with data showing how the brightness of gamma- rays changes with time .
And in 2012 , a Japanese radio antenna , VSOP - 2 , is scheduled for launch into a large Earth orbit .
This will allow better resolution of the radio images so that we can see finer detail than is currently possible .
Here are 3 freeze - frames from the movie showing the shock in different parts of the jet as it moves away from the black hole .
The first represents the shock wave while it is still in the acceleration zone where the magnetic field is coiled .
The 2nd shows the shock as it exits this region , just after it reaches its brightest point .
The last frame shows the moving shock passing through the stationary " X " shock that we call the " core . "

Newer Data
We included BL Lac in our monitoring program starting in 2005 .
( We also monitored it less intensively in 1999 - 2000 . )
The light curve from the more recent period is shown below .
( We need to collect optical data from our collaborators for the period after early 2007 ) .
We note that there are signs that flares appear in pairs , as in late 2005 .
Notice the very high X - ray point in late 2006 , which coincided with the peak of an optical flare .
The X - ray spectrum steepened significantly , which we interpret as a sign that synchrotron radiation becomes dominant over inverse Compton scattering as the cause of the X - ray emission .
When this happens , the variations in brightness are often too rapid for us to follow well with our 3 - times - per - week monitoring with RXTE .
We will fill in the optical light curve and marking the " ejections " of superluminal radio knots seen with the VLBA ( the upward arrows in the top panel ) when the data become available .

Science and technology reporter , BBC News
A detector at the Large Hadron Collider is regarded as a " lower priority "
Physicists and astronomers have three weeks to make the case for a number of high - profile projects at risk of being cut from the UK 's science portfolio .
The lists of facilities and experiments include spacecraft , telescopes and hardware for particle accelerators .
The scientific worth of each is being assessed as administrators seek to plug an £ 80 m hole in their finances .
A decision on their fate will follow the period of consultation and is expected by April 2008 .
" Every single programme we looked at was worthwhile - there was not a dud amongst them , " Sir Peter Knight , head of the panel which compiled the lists for the Science and Technology Facilities Council ( STFC ) , told BBC News .
However , the STFC , which looks after some of the largest science centres in Britain , cannot fund all of the projects it is currently committed to after an unfavourable government spending review last year .
Projects under threat include an upgrade to the Merlin radio telescope array ( e- Merlin ) at Jodrell Bank and the UK infra-red telescope - the world 's largest telescope dedicated to infrared astronomy , based in Hawaii .
Tight focus
To decide which STFC projects and facilities are priorities , Sir Peter and other advisors were asked to draw up two lists - split between particle physics , astronomy and nuclear physics ( PPAN ) , and physics and life sciences ( PAL ) .
GEO 600 is a " high priority " project PPAN projects include telescope arrays , upgrades to particle accelerators and robotic space missions such as ExoMars .
PAL projects include upgrades to the Diamond Light Source synchrotron .
" We had to make difficult choices , " said Sir Peter .
" There are imaginative people who have put their careers on the line for these projects and they are good projects . "
" High priorities " such as Venus Express and the gravity wave detector GEO 600 are likely to be safe from cuts .
However , 29 lower priority projects , which include UK involvement in the ALICE experiment for the Large Hadron Collider ( LHC ) particle accelerator , which comes online later this year , could be at risk .
ALICE - a large ion collider experiment - will study high density matter .
Some scientists believe the list has been fudged and that certain areas of science have fallen through the net .
For example , all ground based solar terrestrial physics facilities have been earmarked as " lower priority " , described by one researcher as " absurd " .
In addition , professional bodies such as the Royal Astronomical Society have challenged the classification of certain projects , such as UK involvement in the Hinode space observatory and the upgrade to Merlin , as " lowest priority " .
The reason for these oversights , some researchers believe , was that the STFC advisory boards were too small ( the PPAN board consists of eight people ) and therefore did not represent every area of science they were making decisions about .
Telescope decision Scientists now have three weeks - thought to be too short a time by many in the community - to submit evidence to a consultation in an effort to boost their project above the cut - off point .
Any submission will be reviewed by a series of panels set up to assess different disciplines .
Funding for the Gemini telescopes is safe " A whole part of the consultation exercise could be to reveal something that we 've ignored or neglected - in which case we better change our minds otherwise there is no point having a consultation , " said Sir Peter .
Some projects have already secured funding , saving them from the cuts .
For example , the Gemini observatory appears as a lower priority on the list .
However , following negotiations last week , UK astronomers once again have access to two of the world 's best telescopes .
" It would have cost us money up front to withdraw , " explained Professor Walter Gear , who led the PPAN assessment .
" If we can continue doing excellent science on Gemini for the same funding - the same amount of money - as it would have cost us to withdraw up front and lose all that science then clearly we are going to remain in Gemini . "
The STFC hopes to recoup some costs by selling observing time .
If it does not , funds for Gemini will have to be taken away from other projects .
" Possible closure "
An instrument for the Mercury probe Bepi-Colombo also appeared as a lower priority .
But a deal signed with the European Space Agency ( Esa ) meant there was " no credible option for withdrawal " .
Examples such as this have led to accusations that lower priority projects are being funded ahead of higher priorities because of existing agreements rather than because they will deliver the best science .
" Given that we have such a huge problem we have to consider stopping things that are already funded and Bepi [ Colombo ] is one of those , " said Professor Gear .
" However we have made an existing commitment which cannot be reneged upon and so it has to continue to be funded .
Similarly with Gemini . "
STFC is seeking money from external sources for other " low priority " projects such as the e-Merlin project at Jodrell Bank .
The council is in discussions with the Northwest Development Agency and Manchester University about how best to fund the expansion .
It is also seeking international partners for UKIRT but has warned that if they fail to materialise " closure would have to be considered " .

What are these ?
Steno is a threat to people who are already ill Hospitals could face a growing threat from a deadly bacterial infection , warn scientists .
An analysis by the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute found Stenotrophomonas maltophilia has the capacity to develop drug resistance rapidly .
There are currently less than 1,000 reports of Steno blood poisoning in the UK a year - a third of which are fatal .
But the Genome Biology study warns it may eventually prove harder to treat than superbugs such as MRSA .
The degree of resistance it shows is very worrying
Dr Matthew Avison
University of Bristol
At present , Steno infections are responsible for less than 1 % of all healthcare acquired infections .
Most infections are in severely ill patients whose immune systems have already been weakened .
Steno spreads through wet areas such as taps and shower heads , and can cling to equipment such as ventilator tubes and catheters , growing into a " biofilm " coating which is difficult to remove .
Dr Matthew Avison , from the University of Bristol , who co-led the research team , said : " This is the latest in an ever - increasing list of antibiotic - resistant hospital superbugs .
" The degree of resistance it shows is very worrying .
Strains are now emerging that are resistant to all available antibiotics . "
Dr Lisa Crossman , who also took part in the research , said that cracking the bacterium 's genetic code should help scientists to find new way to combat its threat .
However , the Health Protection Agency said the threat should not be over - stated .
A spokesperson said : " The infection does not spread in the manner of MRSA or C. difficile - there is little spread between patients , and infections are mostly caused by one - off strains . "
A Department of Health spokesman said : " Clean and safe treatment in the NHS is a top priority for the government .
" We have committed an investment of £ 270 m per year by 2010 / 11 to support infection prevention on top of the extra money that the NHS has already invested in better education and training , upgrading isolation facilities , new equipment and better surveillance . "

And Mr. Penn , asked about the extent to which the campaign might move to draw tough contrasts in the weeks ahead , responded with an e-mail message that suggested Mrs. Clinton did not intend to roll out any new lines of attack now .
“ It is really up to the press to dig deeper and vet him now , ” he wrote .
“ That ’s not our job . ”
Mrs. Clinton woke up Wednesday to the realization that she had lost nearly every advantage she once could claim over Mr. Obama : money , momentum , a lead in national polls and an edge in delegates .
Polls suggest that Democrats now view Mr. Obama as more electable than Mrs. Clinton .
After her ninth and 10th defeats in a row on Tuesday in Wisconsin and Hawaii , Mrs. Clinton is running out of time .
Her advisers said they still see a road to victory , but acknowledged that it was narrowing .
Her goal now , they said , is to do well enough in the remaining states , particularly Ohio , Texas and Pennsylvania , to close Mr. Obama ’s lead among elected delegates as the contest moves beyond the primaries and caucuses and into the hands of elected officials and party leaders who serve as so - called superdelegates .
She is pressing challenges to Mr. Obama ’s qualifications as a candidate and as a president , and to a certain extent playing for time , hoping that some unexpected event will alter the dynamics of the race in her favor .
There are no large differences between Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Obama on big issues , leaving her struggling to try to gain ground by such means as criticizing him for not agreeing to enough debates .
And Mr. Obama himself has been a tricky target for the Clinton campaign ; Mrs. Clinton ’s associates said that with him seeking to become the first African - American president , race has loomed over their prolonged and sometimes tortured debates about how to discredit him .

The deployment of Bill Clinton to raise questions about Mr. Obama ’s qualifications opened Mrs. Clinton to attacks of running a racially tinged campaign .
That was particularly unwelcome considering the extent to which this campaign had looked to Mr. Clinton to keep Mrs. Clinton competitive among African - American voters .
BUFFALO , N.Y . --
A comprehensive new study authored by University at Buffalo scientists and their colleagues for the first time documents in detail the dynamics of parts of Greenland 's ice sheet , important data that have long been missing from the ice sheet models on which projections about sea level rise and global warming are based .
The research , published online this month in the Journal of Glaciology , also demonstrates how remote sensing and digital imaging techniques can produce rich datasets without field data in some cases .
Traditionally , ice sheet models are very simplified , according to Beata Csatho , Ph.D. , assistant professor of geology in the UB College of Arts and Sciences and lead author of the paper .
" Ice sheet models usually do n't include all the complexity of ice dynamics that can happen in nature , " said Csatho .
" This research will give ice sheet modelers more precise , more detailed data . "
The implications of these richer datasets may be dramatic , Csatho said , especially as they impact climate projections and sea - level rise estimates , such as those made by the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) .
" If current climate models from the IPCC included data from ice dynamics in Greenland , the sea level rise estimated during this century could be twice as high as what they are currently projecting , " she said .
The paper focuses on Jakobshavn Isbrae , Greenland 's fastest moving glacier and its largest , measuring four miles wide .
During the past decade , Jakobshavn Isbrae has begun to experience rapid thinning and doubling of the amount of ice it discharges into Disko Bay .
" Although the thinning started as early as the end of the 18th century , the changes we are seeing now are bigger than can be accounted for by normal , annual perturbations in climate , " Csatho said .
In order to document the most comprehensive story possible of the behavior of Jakobshavn Isbrae since the Little Ice Age in the late 1800s , Csatho and her colleagues at Ohio State University , the University of Kansas and NASA used a combination of techniques .
These included field mapping , remote sensing , satellite imaging and the application of digital techniques in order to glean " hidden " data from historic aerial photographs as many as 60 years after they were taken .
By themselves , Csatho explained , the two - dimensional pictures were of limited value .
" But now we can digitize them , removing the boundaries between them and turning several pictures into a single ' mosaic ' that will produce one data set that can be viewed in three - dimensions , " she said .
" By reprocessing old data contained in these old photographs and records , we have been able to construct a long - term record of the behavior of the glacier , " said Csatho .
" This was the first time that the data from the ' 40s could be reused in a coherent way . "
The data from the historic photos were combined with data from historical records , ground surveys , field mapping and measurements taken from the air to document important signs of change in the glacier 's geometry .
Csatho explained that conventional methods of assessing change in glaciers have depended on documenting " iceberg calving , " in which large pieces at the front of the glacier break off .
" But we found that you can get significant changes in the ice sheet without seeing a change in front , " she said .
Other key findings of the paper are that two different parts of the same glacier may behave quite differently and that a glacier does not necessarily react to climate change as a single , monolithic entity .
" Climate forces are complex , " Csatho said .
" For example , we found that the northern part of Jakobshavn was still thinning while the climate was colder between the 1960s and the 1990s . "
Csatho , who is a geophysicist , added that the research is the result of a strong interdisciplinary team involving experts in glaciology , ice sheet modeling and photogrammetry , the science of making measurements based on photographs .

At UB , research in Csatho 's remote sensing laboratory -- < http://rsl. geology .

Krabill of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration 's Cryospheric Sciences Branch .

A key objective of the congressional testimony by Gen. David Petraeus this week will be to defend the George W. Bush administration ’s strategic political line that it is fighting an Iranian " proxy war " in Iraq .
Based on preliminary indications of his spin on the surprisingly effective armed resistance to the joint U.S. - Iraqi Operation Knights Assault in Basra , Petraeus will testify that it was caused by Iran through a group of rogue militiamen who had split off from Moqtada al - Sadr ’s Mahdi Army and came under Iranian control .
But the U.S. military ’s contention that " rogue elements " have been carrying out the resistance to coalition forces was refuted by Sadr himself in an interview with al - Jazeera aired March 29 in which he called for the release from U.S. detention of the individual previously identified by Petraeus as the head of the alleged breakaway faction .
The idea of Iranian - backed " rogue " Shi’ite militia groups undermining Sadr ’s efforts to pursue a more moderate course was introduced by the U.S. military command in early 2007 .
These alleged Iranian proxies were called " Special Groups "  a term that came not from Iran or the Shi’ites themselves but from the Bush administration .
In April , after U.S. forces captured a former spokesman for Sadr , Qais al - Khazali , Petraeus himself announced that they had detained " the head of the secret cell network , the extremist secret cells , " he said .
Petraeus referred to it as " the Khazali network . "
U.S. military spokesman Brig .
Gen. Kevin Bergner asserted in early July that Khazali ’s network was a " Special Group , " which was financed , armed , and trained by the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps and in some instances was even " directed " by it .
He said Iran was using a Hezbollah operative to organize such groups to do its bidding in Iran .
The identification of Khazali as head of a " rogue " faction was highly suspect , however .
One of Sadr ’s most trusted aides , Khazali had played a key role in recruitment for the Mahdi Army in its formative stage in 2003 .
He had gone underground in late 2004 , just after heavy fighting in which the Mahdi Army had suffered heavy casualties and just as Sadr was entering into a long period of retreat from military operations .
In a March 30 , 2007 , press briefing , Maj. Gen. Michael Barbero of the U.S. Joint Staff said both Khazali and his brother were linked with the " Sadr organization . "
A pro-war military blogger named Bill Roggio , who maintains close relations with the U.S. command in Baghdad , revealed in February 2007 that the real purpose of the line about Iranian - controlled " Special Groups " was to facilitate Petraeus ’ strategy of dividing the Mahdi Army .
" The ‘ rogue element ’ narrative provides Mahdi Army fighters and commanders an ‘ out , ’ " wrote Roggio .
A Mahdi Army unit commander could either " choose to oppose the government and be targeted , " he observed , " or step aside and join the political process . "
U.S. Ambassador Ryan Crocker ’s first comment on the armed resistance in Basra in a March 26 interview emphatically denied that the forces resisting the Iraqi- U.S. operation represented Sadr ’s Mahdi Army .
" What you ’re seeing there is not a rising by Jaish al - Mahdi [ Mahdi Army ] , " Crocker insisted .
It was " a subset of Jaish al - Mahdi , the so called ‘ special groups ’ that really are basically just criminal militias that are the difficulty here , " according to Crocker .
An article by neoconservative military historian Kimberly Kagan in the Wall Street Journal April 3 suggests , however , that Petraeus has slightly reformulated the proxy war line in light of the obvious role played by the Mahdi Army itself in limiting the advance of the U.S. - Iraqi operation .
Kagan is married to Fred Kagan , one of the main author ’s of Bush ’s surge policy , and is a full member of the administration ’s team for conveying its political - military thinking to the elite public .
Her article evidently reflects conversations with Petraeus and other officials in Baghdad during the previous week .
Kagan , unlike Crocker on March 26 , makes no effort to deny that the Mahdi Army itself was fully involved in the armed resistance in Basra , Baghdad , and elsewhere .
But she claims that it was " Special Groups "  not the Sadrists  who " coordinated the unrest and attacks of the regular Mahdi Army in the capital and provinces . "
Furthermore , Kagan describes the Mahdi Army as " a reserve from which the Special Groups can and will draw in crisis . "
And Sadr himself is dismissed as ultimately a figurehead .
" For all of his nationalist rhetoric , " writes Kagan , " Mr. Sadr is evidently not in control of his movement . "
The new version of the proxy war narrative still attributes ultimate control over the most powerful Shi’ite political - military force in the country to the shadowy " Special Groups . "
But in an interview with al - Jazeera taped just before the Basra operation was launched and broadcast on March 29 , Sadr demanded the release of Qais al - Khazali , whom Petraeus had identified as the head of the alleged " Special Group " that had broken away from Sadr , from U.S. custody .
That confirms the earlier indications that Khazali was never involved in a breakaway faction , and that what the U.S. command refers to as " Iranian - backed Special Groups " never existed .
The March 30 story by McClatchy ’s Leila Fadel on the ending of the Basra crisis shows that Iran ’s real strategy in Iraq bears no resemblance to the one portrayed in the U.S. proxy war narrative .
Fadel reported that Brig. Gen. Qassem Suleimani , commander of the Quds ( Jerusalem ) brigades of the IRGC , brokered a cease - fire with Sadr after representatives of the Shi’ite parties now supporting the Maliki government traveled secretly to Qom , Iran March 29 - 30 , to ask for his intervention .
Suleimani ’s role in reducing the violence in Basra underlines the reality that Iranian power in Shi’ite Iraq is based on its having worked with and provided assistance to all the Shi’ite parties and factions .
Iran ’s determination to stay on good terms with all the Shi’ite factions has made it the primary arbiter of conflicts among them .
Iran has no reason to look for a small splinter group to advance its interests when it already enjoys a relationship of strategic cooperation with the government itself .
The Mahdi Army has received training in both Lebanon and in Iran and has undoubtedly used financial assistance from Iran to procure weapons .
But Sadr revealed in his al - Jazeera interview that he had told Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei on a trip to Iran that he did not agree with the " political and military interests " that Tehran had pursued in Iraq .
That was an apparent reference to Iran ’s pronounced tilt toward Sadr ’s Shi’ite rivals who remain in power with joint U.S. - Iranian support .
Ironically , when Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad visited Iraq in early March , both Maliki and Supreme Council chief Abdul Aziz al - Hakim publicly dissociated themselves from the U.S. " proxy war " line , insisting that Iran was restraining Sadr rather than egging him on .
The interest of Bush administration in keeping the proxy war line alive has nothing to do with Iraqi realities , however .
As a strategic weapon for justifying the administration ’s policies toward both Iraq and Iran , the theme of Iranian interference through " Special Groups " is bound to be a central thread in the testimony by Petraeus and Crocker this week .

CLOSE-UP : JOHN MCCAIN CLOSE-UP : JOHN MCCAIN
In - depth : McCain news , photos , video , timeline , more ... John McCain on the campaign issues : Iraq | Immigration | Health care | Education | Abortion | Gay civil rights WASHINGTON ( AP )  John McCain 's national finance co-chairman has stepped down , the latest casualty of a presidential campaign eager to cauterize damage caused by its ties to lobbyists .
Former Texas Rep. Thomas G. Loeffler , one of McCain 's key fundraisers , resigned in the wake of a new McCain policy on conflicts of interest that required campaign volunteers to disclose their lobbying connections .
" Mr. Loeffler has resigned from his position with the campaign , " McCain spokesman Tucker Bounds said Sunday .
Loeffler , who runs the lobbying shop The Loeffler Group , is the highest profile departure from McCain 's inner circle since a summer 2007 shake - up cost McCain his campaign manager and chief strategist .
MCCAIN CAMPAIGN : The new conflict policy Among Loeffler 's clients is the European Aeronautic Defence and Space Co. , the parent company of plane manufacturer Airbus .
Northrop Grumman Corp. and EADS won a lucrative contract to provide air refueling tankers for the Air Force .
McCain helped scuttle an earlier contract in 2004 that would have gone to a competitor , Boeing Co. Loeffler 's firm also has lobbied for other foreign interests and foreign governments .
Newsweek reported over the weekend that Loeffler 's firm was paid $ 15 million by Saudi Arabia .
The news magazine also said Loeffler listed meeting McCain along with the Saudi ambassador to " discuss US - Kingdom of Saudi Arabia relations , " even though Loeffler told a reporter last month that he had not discussed his clients with McCain .
McCain 's new policy prohibits any staffer on the campaign from being a registered lobbyist or foreign agent .
Part - time volunteers for the campaigns , such as Loeffler , have to disclose whether they are registered lobbyists or lobbying on behalf of foreign entities .
Under the policy , dated May 15 , such volunteer advisers cannot lobby McCain or his legislative staffs during the period they serve on the campaign .
The work of lobbyists close to McCain had become fodder for critics , undermining McCain 's image as a reformer who has tried to restrict the influence special interests in government .
Barack Obama , McCain 's likely November opponent , was asked about the latest resignation while campaigning Sunday in Oregon .
" It appears that John McCain is very much a creature of Washington , " he said .
" One of the things we 've said is if we 're going to changes policies ... that we were going to have to change how Washington works .
We can't have special interests dictating what 's happening there .
It does appear that over the last several weeks John McCain keeps on having problems with his top advisers being lobbyists in some cases for foreign governments or other big interests that are doing business in Washington .
That , I do n't think , represents the kind of change the American people are looking for . "
Responding to Obama 's comment , McCain campaign spokesman Tucker Bounds said : " Just a few years ago when Barack Obama was beginning his career in politics he was launching it at the home of William Ayers , an unrepentant domestic terrorist who his chief strategist said Senator Obama was certainly friendly with .
If Barack Obama is going to make associations the issue , we look forward to the debate about Senator Obama 's associations and what they say about his judgment and readiness to be commander in chief . "
McCain advisers Doug Goodyear , who was to run the Republican convention in St. Paul , Minnesota , and Doug Davenport , a regional campaign director for the Mid-Atlantic states , also resigned this month .
Both worked for DCI Group , a consulting firm hired to improve the image of Myanmar 's military junta .
When the policy was announced last week , McCain fired energy policy adviser Eric Burgeson , who represents energy companies as a lobbyist .
The campaign also asked Craig Shirley to resign from McCain 's Virginia leadership team because he was behind an independent group that has been criticizing Democrats Hillary Rodham Clinton and Obama on the Internet .
McCain 's new policy also states that no one with a campaign title or position may participate in so - called 527 groups , which can raise unlimited amounts of money for television ads not controlled by campaigns .
But the policy also underscored the fine line McCain has drawn .
Several top strategists working on his campaign are lobbyists who have taken leaves of absence from their jobs to work for McCain .
Among them are campaign manager Rick Davis , whose past clients have included a Russian industrialist , and Charlie Black , a high profile Washington lobbyist with domestic and foreign clients
In adopting the policy and making it public , the McCain campaign sought to stabilize the bad press he was getting and turn the tables on his most likely Democratic opponent .
" Sen. McCain has put forward the most strident policy to date , " said McCain spokeswoman Jill Hazelbaker .
" It now falls on Barack Obama to meet this level of transparency and disclose which lobbyists are serving as advisers to his campaign . "
Obama has been a vocal critic of Washington lobbyists and , unlike McCain , has refused to accept contributions from federal lobbyists and from political action committees .
However , he has accepted money from the corporate executives who retain lobbyists and who have special causes before Congress .
He also has had unpaid advisers with federal lobbying clients .
Some campaign officials previously had lobbying jobs .
Earlier this year , Obama deputy campaign manager Steve Hildebrand told the Associated Press the campaign has no problem with lobbyists volunteering to work , but no federal lobbyists are on the campaign 's payroll and they cannot donate money or collect it from others .
" We 're not going to prevent people from being volunteers on this campaign , " he said .
Hildebrand said he gave up federal lobbying work for an environmental group , as a condition of taking his paid staff position .
According to lobbying records , Hildebrand was lobbying on behalf of climate change legislation written by McCain and Sen. Joseph Lieberman , from Connecticut .

More memos have recently surfaced that were written early in the Bush administration by John C. Yoo from the Justice Department ’s Office of Legal Counsel  the man who gave us the administration ’s horrifyingly narrow definition of torture as physical pain that must be “ equivalent in intensity to the pain accompanying serious physical injury , such as organ failure , impairment of bodily function , or even death . ”
As difficult as it is to believe , the recently released memos are even scarier for the republic than is the original torture memo .
Yoo  attempting to defend the ultra- expansionist view of executive power that the Bush administration , especially Vice President Dick Cheney , has endorsed  wrote memos boldly asserting that the president ’s power during wartime is nearly unlimited .
For example , he argued that Congress has no right to pass laws governing the interrogations of enemy combatants and that the executive can ignore such laws if passed , and can , without constraint , seize oceangoing ships .
The memos also argue that military operations in the United States against terrorists are not subject to the Fourth Amendment requirement for search warrants or the Fifth Amendment requirement for due process .
This staggeringly broad interpretation of executive power and the president ’s commander - in - chief role would make the nation ’s founders jump out of their graves .
The founders originally conceived of the Congress and the states being the most powerful branches of government .
But the Cold War , and all the hot wars within it , unconstitutionally expanded the chief executive ’s powers into the imperial presidency , which George W. Bush through his “ war on terror ” is trying to convert into “ hyper- imperial ” mode .
Purposefully , in response to the horror of European monarchs regularly marching their countries to war using the blood and treasure of their people , the Constitutional Convention enumerated the large number of Congress ’s powers in the longer Article I , and gave most of the powers related to defense and foreign affairs to the people ’s branch .
In particular , the war power  the power to decide whether , when , and how the nation would go to war  was given to Congress .
The chief executive , whose much shorter list of powers was enumerated in the much more brief Article II , was given the commander - in - chief role , but this was intended narrowly , only as commander of U.S. troops on the battlefield .
Instead of declaring war , which has fallen out of fashion , the Congress , after 9/11 , passed a resolution authorizing the president to go after al - Qaeda overseas , but deliberately omitted domestic activities from that authorization .
So it is doubtful whether the United States is really “ at war ” in the first place .
Also , Democrats and Republicans alike , at the time the resolution was voted on , declared that they were not endorsing a broad expansion of the president ’s authority as commander in chief .
Furthermore , to show how narrowly the founders originally conceived the commander - in - chief role to be , an episode from early in the republic ’s history is illustrative .
During the quasi-war with France in the last years of the 1700s , Congress authorized President John Adams to seize armed French ships sailing to French ports .
Adams exceeded the congressional authorization by ordering the seizure of such vessels sailing to or from French ports .
The Supreme Court , in the case Little v. Barreme , ruled that Adams had exceeded the authority Congress had delegated to him .
So much for Bush ’s supposed intrinsic authority to seize all oceangoing ships without congressional authorization .
Similarly , in 1952 , in the Truman administration during the Cold War , the first imperial president seized the steel mills under his alleged “ inherent power ” as commander in chief  supposedly to prevent paralysis of the national economy and using the rationale that soldiers in the Korean War needed weapons and ammunition .
By a wide margin , in the case Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer , the Supreme Court struck down Truman ’s executive order to seize the mills , because it had no statutory or constitutional basis .
In other words , the court essentially ruled that the president was commander in chief of the armed forces , not of the country .
Yoo ’s argument that Congress has no right to pass laws that impinge on the president ’s claim to an excessively broad interpretation of his role as commander in chief  and that the chief executive has a right to ignore any such laws passed  is astounding .
This paradigm is essentially rule by presidential decree , which violates the core of the constitutional system of checks and balances , and for which the United States regularly criticizes despots in foreign countries .
Finally , the Fourth Amendment ( requiring warrants for any search ) and the Fifth Amendment ( the right to due legal process ) contain no exceptions for wartime .
In fact , in a republic  where the rule of law should be king  crises and wartime are exactly when people ’s rights are most likely to be endangered and when safeguards are especially needed .
So in times of both war and peace , the military ( or related agencies , such as the National Security Agency ) and law enforcement need to be required to get warrants for surveillance and to give people due process .
Even more tragic and dangerous for the republic than the quagmires of Iraq and Afghanistan have been President Bush ’s Yoo - surping of power from the other two branches of government and the creation of the “ hyper- imperial ” presidency .
Three women from the Texas polygamist sect that was raided by authorities April 3 put on
a bizarre performance when they were interviewed by ABC News earlier this week .
Now
the superstrange video has made its way onto YouTube .
In the bizarre clip , the women — identified only as Nancy , Marie and Esther — answer
questions in remarkably similar sing - song voices and speak almost in unison .
Clad in
matching dresses and looking like they just stepped out of a time machine set to 1880 ,
the women project an eerie Star Trek - meets - Little House on the
Prairie vibe .
They complain oh so meekly about the raid that left 416
children in state custody as authorities try to get to the bottom of what , exactly , was
going on at the Yearning for Zion Ranch .
" We were taken without any explanation , " Esther says .
" We were taken at gunpoint , and there ’s just no
papers served .
It was just like we ’re animals … .
And our children were
taken away . "
In the five - minute interview , the women defend their lifestyle , which is built on beliefs of the Fundamentalist Church of
Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints .
They also claim that the allegations that triggered the raid
are false , and bridle ( quite politely ) when the interviewer asks if they ’ve seen underage girls being
married on their compound .
" It ’s not a compound , " says Marie , wearing an unbelievably strange smile .
" It ’s our ranch
and it ’s our home . "
It remains to be seen how this case will play out in court , but this interview offers a peek
into what seems to be a completely alien world .
Watch it if you dare .

NEW YORK ( Reuters ) -
The longer oil prices remain above $ 100 , the worse things are likely to get for the U.S. dollar .
With the greenback hitting all - time lows and no end to its slide in sight , oil exporters are likely to shift a larger share of their revenues into other currencies .
That weakens the dollar further , making dollar - denominated oil more costly for American consumers .
Inflation fears also prompt investors to buy commodities as a hedge and favor strong currencies over the weak dollar .
It ’s what Morgan Stanley global currency strategist Stephen Jen called a “ vicious circle ” that can be very hard to break .
“ A lot of the premium in commodity prices now is directly correlated to dollar weakness , and you need to see a dollar turnaround for oil prices to pull back and U.S. growth to start to pick up again , ” said Greg Salvaggio , an FX trader at Tempus Consulting in Washington .
If that does n’t happen , some worry that investors could stop buying U.S. Treasury debt , causing interest rates to spike , inflation to worsen and living standards to slide .
That ’s troubling news , particularly now that economists believe the United States has already entered a recession that may prove more persistent and painful than any since the 1930s .
At current prices , Jen said oil exporters stand to earn $ 2.1 trillion in annual revenues , with some 90 percent of it likely to be poured into global capital markets .
In the case of the Middle East oil exporters and Russia , Jen said much of the money is likely to be managed by state - run wealth funds , which are far more willing to invest in riskier , non -dollar assets than central bank reserve managers .
“ Sovereign wealth funds are not loyal dollar buyers .
They are more likely to buy equities over sovereign bonds , and that is not a pattern that ’s friendly to the dollar , ” he said .
Already down about 7 percent this year alone against a basket of major currencies , the dollar also has fallen to record lows against the euro and Swiss franc and a 12 - 1/ 2 - year low against the yen .
In addition to equities , Jen said the flows of future oil revenue are likely to favor the yen and emerging market currencies over both the dollar and the euro .

MIDEAST DOLLAR PEGS NEXT ?
Rising oil prices and the rapid growth of foreign - exchange reserves have added some $ 2 trillion in assets to these funds ’ coffers in recent years .
Jen has predicted holdings could rise to $ 12 trillion by 2015 .
Some analysts also warn that higher oil prices increase the pressure on countries such as the United Arab Emirates and Qatar to unhitch their currencies to the dollar and peg them to a basket of currencies instead .
High oil prices and a weak dollar have translated into rising inflation in these economies .
And with the dollar pegs , central banks have been forced to mimic recent rate cuts from the Federal Reserve at a time when many economists feel they should be increasing interest rates to dampen higher prices .
In a recent research note , analysts at Danske Bank said a move away from dollar pegs would send the dollar sharply lower and would likely put heavy pressure on U.S. stocks and bonds .
But Brad Setser , a fellow in geo-economics at the Council for Foreign Relations , said political ties to the United States and hopes of a future currency union will likely leave Mideast oil exporters closely tied to the dollar .
That would require their central banks to keep accumulating dollar reserves to maintain the fixed exchange rate , likely offsetting diversification by their sovereign wealth funds into other currencies .
Some also say a U.S. recession will eventually slow growth in the euro zone and beyond , causing commodity prices to ease and letting the U.S. dollar regain some ground against other currencies .
“ I can foresee a situation 12 - 18 months down the road where U.S. assets and the dollar will look cheap and very attractive , ” said Mike Moran , senior currency strategist at Standard Chartered in New York .
Recently I published the above photo .
It ’s been a popular photo and was selected yesterday by the TWIP ( This Week in Photography ) podcast this week as their winner for a recent photo challenge that they did on portrait photography .
The photograph has a lot of meaning for me and I thought I ’d use this opportunity to talk about the story behind the photograph .
I ’m somewhat embarrassed and ashamed about the story behind such a beautiful portrait which is why I have n’t shared the story until now .
But the photo has been a learning experience for me and I think and hope that the photo ’s impact on me has made me a better person and a better photographer in terms of how I interact with strangers in the future .
I hope that by sharing the story I can also encourage others with how they interact with strangers .
Below is the comment I left on the TWIP blog where they announced this photo as this week ’s winner with the story behind the photo :
“ Hey , thank you for choosing my photo for the photo of the week .
I took the photo on a recent trip to Portland .
On the trip I was pretty much shooting non-stop for 4 days and nights .
Every so often you take a photograph that has personal impact on your life .
This photo is one of those for me .
I took this photo on the Burnside Bridge in Portland .
The Burnside Bridge is one of the areas of Portland where homeless people congregate .
There are a few homeless shelters there and lots of homeless people hang out just underneath the bridge .
I was up shooting the bridge at night and the “ Made in Oregon ” neon sign that can be seen from the bridge .
While I was shooting I was wearing headphones and listening to music on my iPhone .
As I was walking across the bridge this man , this beautiful man , approached me saying something while I had my headphones on .
In a moment that I am very ashamed of I did not remove my headphones .
Instead I said back to the man that I did n’t have any money .
I said this to the man without having heard what he was asking me .
I could tell from his expression that he was annoyed by my response .
At this point I took my headphones off to hear what he was saying .
What the man said to me was that he did n’t want my money .
That he was not asking me for money , that he was asking me if I would take his photograph .
I was very embarrassed .
First off , I did n’t even have enough respect for another human being to take my headphones off and hear him out in the first place .
And secondly I ’d jumped to a conclusion that the man simply was trying to get me to give him money .
I felt bad that I ’d insulted this man .
And I felt ashamed of the way I ’d treated another human being .
The lens that I had on for shooting his portrait was not optimal .
It was a 14 mm ultra wide angle .
I was too embarrassed to try and delay the man while I switched lenses so I took the shot with the 14 mm .
This meant that I had to try and get very very close to him to shoot the portrait .
It also meant that I needed to stand far enough away from him so as not to exaggerate his facial features with the lens .
To make matters worse I was shooting up on the bridge with a tripod and trying to get a hand held shot in low light with an f /2.8 lens is not easy .
I fired off about 6 shots and one of the shots at 1/4 second exposure turned out .
After shooting the man I thanked him and he thanked me .
After our interaction on the bridge I could not get my interaction with this man out of my head for the next few days .
I was so ashamed at myself for jumping to the conclusion that I had and for not removing my headphones to speak with the man when he approached me .
This beautiful man had approached me and wanted nothing more than to be photographed by a stranger .
He was giving his image to me and I felt that I ’d treated him so badly .
I also felt bad that I did n’t even try to get his name or an address or something afterwards to send him the photograph .
I had been taken by surprise by the interaction and was flustered and had acted poorly and thoughtlessly .
After this interaction though I began to imagine that the man was an angel .
And that he ’d been sent to me by God to confront me about the way that I interact with , or rather the way that I typically avoid other human beings .
That I needed to look at people more as human beings worth spending time with and less as annoyances that get in the way of my shooting .
This interaction made me decide to try and make a greater effort in the future to connect with strangers on a human level .
I hope someday that I might meet this man again to let him know that our interaction had great meaning for me .
And also to give him a copy of the portrait that I ’d taken of him .
I imagine that I ’ll never know who this man is .
And maybe he was not a man at all , but as I ’d imagined , rather an angel who had shown himself to me only long enough to confront my own callousness and snap a photograph . ”

The new totalitarians Burma and the rebirth of a terrible idea
( Rungroj Yongrit / European Pressphoto angecy ) IN THE PAST few weeks , the secretive nation of Burma suddenly landed on the world 's front pages , as small demonstrations by monks spiraled into massive protests and triggered a violent crackdown by the military government .
Such an impromptu uprising surprised many observers .
Searching for explanations , some have cited the rising price of fuel , which is subsidized in Burma ; this summer , the regime allowed the price to skyrocket , adding to the economic misery of average Burmese people .
But behind the unrest also lies a larger explanation , one that makes the isolated country a critical test of foreign policy .
Burma 's brutal ruling junta , which has long kept power through force and fear , is taking the next step and transforming itself into one of the world 's few totalitarian regimes .
It has recently moved beyond its years of authoritarian rule , in which it controlled politics but allowed some degree of personal freedom , toward more absolute control of its citizens ' lives .
As totalitarian regimes die out in other parts of the world , Burma has been clamping down on the last vestiges of dissent , creating a personality cult around the junta 's leader , and isolating itself by moving Burma 's capital away from Rangoon to a remote town .
Burma 's transformation bucks the global trend away from such tightly repressive societies .
For years , totalitarianism loomed as the West 's mortal enemy , a terrifying force that drove the massive purges of Stalinist Russia , the bizarre personality cult of Albania , and the wholesale eradication of intellectuals in Maoist China .
But in the years since the Cold War , totalitarianism has appeared to be in wide retreat .
With the advent of mobile phones , satellite television , and cheap , fast Internet access , it has become nearly impossible for any government to totally isolate its people from the world , or to dominate their private lives .
In Laos , where the Communist government once created a personality cult around its revolutionary founder , city - dwellers can watch news reports about their country on television from Thailand .
In China , the Communist Party continues to stamp out organized dissent but no longer tracks ordinary citizens ' every movement , and many people can afford to buy homes and give themselves a degree of domestic privacy .
Even in North Korea , which spent decades walling itself off , cheap cellphones smuggled across the border from China have created some tiny cracks in Kim Jong - Il 's regime .
But in Burma , the junta has headed in the opposite direction .
Last week 's protests most immediately speak to the sufferings of the average Burmese , but they also send an important signal at a moment when a handful of governments - including Zimbabwe and Venezuela - are showing fresh signs of totalitarian rule , building personality cults and infiltrating their citizens ' private lives .
As it quickly becomes a central topic for the UN and the Bush administration , Burma will prove a test of whether these repressive regimes have any future at all .
Burma has been run by its military since the 1960s , when the armed forces took power in a coup .
The army has always maintained a tight lid on political unrest .
In Burma 's last big wave of protests , in 1988 , the military allegedly killed thousands of demonstrators .
After 1988 , the junta remained an authoritarian regime , controlling politics and savagely repressing opponents , most famously prodemocracy opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi .
But it still maintained some links to foreign nongovernmental organizations , governments , and businesses , giving Burma 's government and people some contact with the outside world .
UN agencies had a major presence in Rangoon , and , at least for a time in the 1990s , foreign companies invested in Burma , hoping for a share of its significant offshore petroleum resources .
The country even experienced a small tourism boom .
The junta 's power was shared among its top three leaders , Than Shwe , Maung Aye , and Khin Nyunt .
In the past five years , however , that balance has begun to change .
Than Shwe , described by Burmese exiles as a paranoid control freak , has consolidated more power around himself .
Than Shwe turned on Khin Nyunt , the regime 's face to the outside world , throwing him under house arrest and jailing many of his supporters .
( Than Shwe allegedly also has tense relations with Maung Aye . )
Than Shwe has also begun dominating state - controlled television , which portrays him as a godlike figure blessing pagodas around the country .
He has increased support for the Union Solidarity and Development Association , or USDA , a state - sponsored youth group reminiscent of Mussolini 's fascist youth organizations .
" Insiders say he wants to be remembered as a benevolent king , " writes Burmese analyst Aung Zaw .
He notes that Than Shwe has been emulating Burma 's old absolute monarchs , who commanded total loyalty , built shrines to reflect their power , and made decisions on the advice of astrologers .
Indeed , two years ago , and allegedly on the advice of his astrologer , Than Shwe moved the entire government from Rangoon to an obscure town in central Burma , where the regime is building a series of palatial complexes .
The town 's name , Naypyidaw , means " abode of kings . "
The junta has limited communication inside Burma and access to technology .
It has curtailed cellphones by making them prohibitively expensive for average Burmese , and created comprehensive Internet filtering , though activists have been able to smuggle out some photos of recent demonstrations .
Than Shwe also has placed severe limits on foreign organizations in Burma , essentially making it impossible for them to operate .
In June , the International Committee of the Red Cross , unable to visit political prisoners in Burma , issued a rare censure of the Burmese government .
Two years earlier , the Global Fund to Fight AIDS , Tuberculosis , and Malaria pulled out of Burma , saying it was too difficult to work because the government was increasingly restricting the travel of aid workers .
Around the country , the USDA has stepped up its monitoring and intervention in the lives of average Burmese , harassing people if they even appear in private to be questioning the government .
The result is a paranoid regime increasingly divorced from the world , and even from most of Burma 's people , many of whom remain in Rangoon , the largest city .
Having disregarded the advice of Burma 's few remaining technocrats , the regime has destroyed the economy : Rangoon suffers from frequent blackouts , and in some parts of the country as much as 60 percent of the population lives in poverty .
Outside Burma , a sophisticated global network of activists has developed to push for democracy in the country .
Yet so far , Burma 's more democratic neighbors have done little to put pressure on Than Shwe .
In the 1990s , India supported the democracy movement in Burma ; today , hungry for petroleum and worried that instability in Burma could spill over its borders , India has largely kept quiet .
So has Thailand .
China , meanwhile , has actually helped prop up the Burmese government , providing aid to the regime despite Western sanctions , blocking UN resolutions designed to put more pressure on the junta , and regularly shipping arms to the brutal Burmese military .
Today , China has become Burma 's most important foreign ally .
It 's possible that the Burmese regime 's isolation will start to undermine its ability to rule .
In the past , some degree of openness probably allowed the Burmese regime to anticipate and forestall protests .
Now , isolated in its jungle capital , the government may not have anticipated the impact of fuel increases on average people .
The Burmese generals also may not have understood how growing military patronage for Burma 's Buddhist clergy , by building pagodas and supporting monasteries , infuriated many monks .
The generals made this mistake once before .
In 1987 and 1988 , when the military was ruled by Ne Win , another unpredictable dictator with a cult - like approach to governance , the regime suddenly declared certain currency notes worthless .
( Ne Win also allegedly consulted astrologers before making major policy decisions . )
This bizarre move sparked demonstrations in 1988 that drew millions of Burmese , ultimately triggering a harsh crackdown by the regime .
But that took place during the Cold War , and before the Internet and the rise of global nongovernmental organizations .
In 1988 , stories and photos from the Burma uprising took time to make their way into the foreign media , but today photos of the protests appear on foreign websites about Burma the same day .
In 1988 , repressive governments ruled much of Asia , so it was not surprising when few regional leaders stood up for the battered Burmese people .
In 1988 , the United States remained locked in a titanic struggle with the totalitarian Soviet Union , and all other conflicts took a lower priority .
Today , the situation is vastly different .
Democracy has taken root in Asia , the Cold War is a relic , and the United States has committed itself to global democratization .
Inside Burma , Than Shwe is attempting to turn back the clock , seemingly an impossible task .
But if Than Shwe stays in power , unchallenged by neighbors who covet Burma 's resources and unperturbed by a UN that refuses to sanction him , he may be able to extend his control of society .
If so , he will show he is no anachronism - and provide an example to other tyrants still standing .

Bale 's other films include American Psycho and The Prestige Christian Bale is to play rebel leader John Connor in three sequels to the Terminator franchise , its producers have revealed .
The Welsh - born star , who is soon to be seen in Batman Begins sequel The Dark Knight , has already started shooting the first of those films , Terminator Salvation : The Future Begins .
" He 's really an actor 's actor , so we 're very proud , " said Victor Kubicek of film company Halcyon .
Charlie 's Angels director McG is directing the new film , which is due to be released on 22 May 2009 .
" Christian was our first choice and he's a big fan of The Terminator , so we 're very lucky , " Kubicek told the BBC at the Cannes Film Festival .
" But with Batman he 's already done the whole franchise thing , so we were n't sure he 'd respond . "
Luckily , said Kubicek 's business partner Derek Anderson , " he read the script and he loved it , so he 's signed on for all three . "
US rap star Common will also have a lead role in the film , as will Australian actor Sam Worthington , who will soon be seen in Titanic director James Cameron 's science - fiction epic Avatar .
Schwarzenegger played the Terminator in three blockbuster films
The producers would not reveal whether Arnold Schwarzenegger would reprise his role as the Terminator .
Nor would they discuss character names or plot details .
" We can't talk about the story points at all , " said Kubicek , adding the project was being kept strictly under wraps .
" Not everyone gets to see the script .
They only see the part of the script that 's relevant to the job they 're doing . "
But the producers promised not to disappoint fans of the time - travelling franchise , which has also spawned TV series The Sarah Connor Chronicles .
" We 're both huge Terminator fans and we 're just approaching it from the point of view of what we'd like to see , " said Anderson .
" Any time we 're feeling pressure we just take a step back and say , as fans , ' what would we like to see ? ' "

The Chinese unit is believed to be accommodated in the Holiday Inn in the centre of Mutare .
Their behaviour in the hotel has caused comment amongst the hotel employees .
The Chinese Embassy in Harare has denied any knowledge of Chinese troops in the area , and has suggested that they might be a privately - hired force , there to protect the interests of local Chinese - owned companies .
The Chinese , witnesses say , patrol in full uniform , and carry pistols , and their sudden appearance has terrified some local residents .
The unit formed part of a heavy security deployment in the city centre , used to crush the MDC 's nationwide strike designed to force the release of the election results .
Mystery surrounds alleged sightings of a troop of 20 armed Chinese soldiers , said to be patrolling the streets of Mutare , the eastern border town , shoulder - to - shoulder with Zimbabwean security forces this week .
One told me : " It was a great shock when they checked in , wearing full military regalia and carrying pistols openly .
They do n't allow us access to their rooms for cleaning purposes , and they do not eat here , although they have paid for full accommodation including meals . "
The unit is said to move out on patrol , then return to the hotel every two hours .
They are booked in at the hotel for one week , ending this weekend .
Further evidence of Chinese involvement in Zimbabwe came with the confirmation that a Chinese freighter loaded with arms destined for Harare has been cleared to dock in Durban , South Africa .
The ship is the An Yue Jiang , and South African police are said to have confirmed that the cargo is armaments and weapons .
It is thought that the Zimbabwe government ordered the consignment to bolster its depleted arsenal , amid fears of anti-government riots in the aftermath of the elections .
Meanwhile the leader of the MDC , Morgan Tsvangirai , who is said to have survived two recent attempts on his life , has taken steps to secure the safety of his family , his staff and himself by moving to a new base in neighbouring Botswana .
He met the new president of Botswana , Ian Khama , last week .
Today he was expected to fly in to Harare , by private jet , for a press conference .
He has been meeting with other heads of state this week , and also with the leader of the minority MDC faction , Arthur Mutambara .
The two met in Johannesburg to discuss ways of working together in a new parliament .
ASH Smyth : When Chinese whispers are unnerving
You can visit the standard cathedrals , museums and art galleries when you travel — and enjoy them , too — but what about illegal border crossings , vampires or sewers ?
These are the themes of just some of the bizarre tours that I ’d really like to join when I ’m on my next big trip .
Vagabondish is reader - supported .
When you buy through links on our site , we may earn an affiliate commission .
Read our disclosure .
To be honest , usually I run a mile from tours .
I ’m not into being told what time to get back on the bus or not having the freedom to choose which famous sight to skip .
But when a tour is planned to give you an entirely different experience of a place , including telling you weird and wonderful stories of aspects usually ignored by a guide book or a regular tour , then I ’m all for it .
#1 : The Illegal Border Crossing Tour in Mexico
This tour at Parque EcoAlberto in Mexico is my number one pick because it ’s truly unusual .
When I first read that this tour will recreate the experience of being a Mexican trying to illegally cross the border , I was n’t sure that it was quite the right thing to do ; but according to a New York Times reporter who tried it , the locals want tourists to understand the experiences and traumas that illegal immigrants face .
Take this night - time guided hike and you ’ll be chased in the dark , shot at by ( fake ) police and you may or may not make it under the fence .
But you ’ll definitely have an interesting story to tell the folks back home .
# 2 : The Vampire Tour of San Francisco
Special vampire tour guide Mina Hawker encourages her tour guests to come in costume when they want to learn about the vampires of the Nob Hill area of San Francisco .
She is ( apparently ) a vampress created by Count Dracula , and she ’s now lived in SF for a century , passing on local vampire legend .
Right !
But in case you start to get worried ( I was ) , the website carefully mentions that they do n’t visit any stops that are “ seriously gothic or dark ”  .
To make sure you arrive on time they raffle off a “ vampire - related prize ”  at the start of each tour , too .
It ’s full of gimmicks but sounds like a fun night out .
# 3 : The Bon Scott ‘ We Salute You ’ Tour
If you ’re a fan of old Aussie band ACDC , you ’ll know Bon Scott was their lead singer , who died at just 34 of alcohol - related misadventure .
But his spirit lives on in the form of the We Salute You tour run by a small company in Perth , Western Australia .
This tour involves a lot of ACDC music on the bus and visits to Bon Scott ’s home , school and grave , finishing up at one of his favorite pubs .
# 4 : The Karaoke Ghost Tour of Sydney
Ghost tours are a dime a dozen these days – so common that I nearly did n’t think I could put one on a list of bizarre tours .
But how about a Karaoke Ghost Tour ?
That ’s a bit more original .
I ca n’t explain at all why Sydney should be the host city for a karaoke ghost tour , and I ’m also a bit disappointed to learn that it ’s not the ghosts that do the singing , but I ’m intrigued just the same .
The tour takes you to some ghostly spots of Sydney and tells you all kinds of stories about the local ghosts , and then DJ SpookeOke will let you karaoke the rest of the night away ( in the bus ! ) with a lot of ghost music .
Whatever that is .
# 5 : The Sewer Tour of Paris
So it turns out that in Paris , you can even take a tour of the underground sewers .
I was wondering who would want to , until I read an old interview at the Savvy Traveler which explained , at least according to one French woman , that many people are curious about what happens to the water and , well , the other stuff , when they take a shower or flush the toilet .
You can check the official Musée des égouts de Paris website for more details , or if you do n’t believe me that such a tour exists .
# 6 : The Scandal Tour of Washington DC
Probably every capital city around the world needs a scandal tour , and the Gross National Product comedy gang have created a popular and funny tour experience for the visitor .
They eschew blindly traipsing around a bunch of government buildings , in awe of the fact that people in these places actually run the country .
Rather , they dig inside gossip on major political scandals , and seeing exactly where these things happened , can make this kind of sightseeing a whole lot more interesting .
# 7 : The Harry Potter London Taxi Tour
Yes , you can visit Platform 9Â ¾ in your black London taxi on a Harry Potter Tour .
And if you choose the full - day version of the tour , you can also get out into the English countryside and see quite a few of the locations used to shoot the films .
Harry Potter is a real growth area for English tourism , it seems , and this one company alone has dozens of versions of the Harry Potter tour .
You can even take an airport layover tour if you ’re just flying through Heathrow or Gatwick enroute to elsewhere , and save money by using a trainee guide .
At the end of the day , however , they unfortunately do n’t guarantee that you ’ll learn any magic tricks .
Any of these tours get you itching to sign on too ?
There are hundreds more where these came from , and every major city around the world has their own underground wave of unusual tours .
It ’s not so easy to find them , but do some internet research before you arrive and you can also try asking at tourist offices or checking the racks of tourist brochures there — most often for smaller , cheaper brochures , probably not in a prime position in the racks .
Take a chance on an unusual tour and you ’re bound to end up with an unforgettable experience , and a good story to spread around later .
There is a new post that re-releases the script as a Firefox Plugin .
Find it here .
After the warm reception for the first version of our Enhanced Google Analytics , we decided to add some new functionality .
( Nothing like a few kinds words to keep us in the giving mood . )
The first script created a couple new tables in the Google Analytics interface that highlight recent changes in referral visits .
It uses Greasemonkey , an add - on for Firefox that allows a user to insert javascript directly into a webpage .
Our update gives you even more ability to understand the data in Google Analytics :
At the suggestion of Avinash Kaushik , the new script works for keyword data , helping you see how organic search traffic is changing .
An increase in a keyword may indicate a general change in user interests and / or improved performance on search results .
My coworker Pete Skomoroch also suggested that I add the ability to see declines in referrals and new keyword searches .
With the help of Paul Irish , the script is now better able to interface with the date widget on the Google Analytics site .
$ ( document ) .ready ( function ( ) { $ ( ’# qxlfd1 ’ ) .hide ( ) ; $ (’# qxlfd2 ’ ) .hide ( ) ; $ ( ’# qxlfd0’).click ( function ( ) { if ( $ (’# qxlfd1 ’ ) .is( ’: hidden ’ ) ) { $ ( ’# qxlfd1’).slideDown ( " slow " ) ; $ (’# qxlfd2’).slideDown ( " slow " ) ; } else { $ ( ’ # qxlfd1’ ) .slideUp( " slow " ) ; $ (’# qxlfd2’) .slideUp( " slow " ) ; } } ) ; } ) ;

The Ten Commandments have no business in U.S. courtrooms .
They are in stark conflict with the U.S. Constitution and values and have no place in our courthouses or public buildings .
A judge cannot follow both the Commandments and the law without violating one or the other .
Of the Commandments , only two can reasonably be described as valid bases for laws : the imprecations against murder and theft .
The first four commandments are clear violations of the religious liberties guaranteed under the Constitution .
If a person of Hindu belief were to walk into a courtroom seeking justice and see these commandments , that person could reasonably conclude that his or her beliefs are illegal under the law .
This stands in stark contrast to the First Amendment : “ Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion , or prohibiting the free exercise thereof … ”
Commandment 3 breaks the First Amendment guarantee freedom of speech .
Commandments 5 , 9 and 10 are generally good advice , but probably also fail the First Amendment test .
It ’s worth noting that even within Christendom there is no agreement on what the Ten Commandments say .
They are never listed as such in the Bible , and they are worded differently in the books of Exodus and Deuteronomy .
Protestant and Catholic groups traditionally break them down differently , with the Catholics understandably playing down the part about worshiping idols and graven images .
So if a law were passed requiring the Ten Commandments to be posted in every courtroom , immediate conflict would arise over which version to use .
This , incidentally , is exactly why the Founding Fathers believed it wise to keep government out of the religion business , and vice versa .
The Ten Commandments in plain English :
1 . You must worship no god except the Jewish / Christian / Muslim god , Yahweh ( Jehovah ) .
2 . You will not make or worship idols or graven images , like people of many other religions ( not to mention lots of Christians ) do .
3 . You will not speak god ’s name in vain .
4. Remember the Sabbath day ( whichever day you happen to believe that is ) and keep it holy .
5 . Honor your father and your mother .
6 . Do not murder ( unless the government says it ’s OK ) .
7 . Do not commit adultery .
8 . Do not steal .
9 . Do not lie .
10 .
Do n’t covet other people ’s property .
I 'm writing this piece because of what happened to me this morning on my way to work .
It scared me and I know it might make you a little concerned too .
Let me start by saying that something has been bothering me on the freeway lately .
Actually , it 's been bothering me on the city streets , too .
And in the parking lot .
These things seem to be multiplying like rats , appearing everywhere , getting in the way , making driving difficult .
I 'm talking specifically about that modern urban blight professional mothers like myself have to deal with every single day -- small cars taking up the road .
My Hummer H2 as it rests in my driveway .
It was clear and sunny this morning , and I was in 8 am rush hour traffic on the freeway , start - stop - start as usual , with my typical morning commute setup - a Venti latte in my left hand , a cell phone in my right hand , and my palm pilot in my lap .
As I neared my exit , I was just getting through my second latte , I had my boss on the phone and my son waiting on hold , and I was trying to jot some things down into my Outlook calendar with the stylus I was holding in my teeth .
Then suddenly , out of nowhere , I look up and there 's this tiny Ford Focus in front of me , or should I say , going underneath me as my front tires rolled right up onto its trunk and onto its tiny roof .
I drive an average - sized Hummer H2 " Road Bully " , it weighs four tons , and this miniature Focus could n't have been more than one tenth my vehicle 's weight and size .
I could barely even feel it until I was right on top of it .
Luckily I managed to stop before I rolled right over the driver himself .
Long story short - I almost did n't make my 9:30 department coordinator meeting , but luckily I was able to back up off the Focus .
I made it out of there before the police came thanks to four wheel drive and off - road tires .
You can go right through a swampy ditch in an H2 and it feels like you 're driving on brand new pavement , I swear .
After my little scare with the blue Focus , I started to look around more , and I noticed that there were a lot of small cars on the road ... a lot !
If you just tilt your side mirrors ten degrees down you 'll be surprised what you see driving next to you .
There 's all these little silver Accents and red Miatas , tiny little Echos zipping this way and that .
I started to wonder if maybe the Focus I ran over this morning was n't my first - just possibly the first I ever looked up in time to notice ?
The suspension on an H2 is excellent , you can drive over a foot - tall curb and not even feel it , so it 's likely my Focus incident was n't my only accident that morning .
I pulled into the parking lot outside my office building , and there were small cars there too .
I was always aware that there were a few small cars in the parking lot , but I just assumed building management placed them there to help people step down out of their SUVs .
But now that I was paying more attention , I noticed they were driving around the parking lot too , and people were getting in and out of them .
There was no damage to my vehicle , thank God .
My husband and I had to take out two separate loans and pull our son out of private school just to buy it .
Between monthly payments and the ridiculous gasoline prices lately — it costs me close to eighty dollars every three days just to fill up my tank !— there is n't much in the family budget left for higher insurance premiums or body work .
Later that morning during my break , I pulled into the Starbucks lot , and I noticed more of the same .
Small cars , everywhere .
I watched a family of four squeeze out of a little Corolla , which I just could n't believe because I thought those only seated one .
I do n't know what mothers are thinking towing their children around in those flimsy , matchbox - sized tin boxes .
Not only does the diminutive size of these vehicles make them difficult to see on the street , but they are also virtual death traps .
Imagine if you hit one head - on in your H2 , your Excursion , your Nissan Xterra , or your Chevy Avalanche ; you would pulverize someone !
How can a mother in good conscience tow her precious children around in one of these tiny things ?
I 'm one hundred percent comfortable hauling my first - grade boy and all his little boyfriends to and from their activities , because all modern SUVs have front , side and back airbag curtains , and in an H2 we 're high above traffic .
Nobody has to bother even putting on their seatbelts .
But these little cars could be squashed by my truck and I might not even feel it given how low they ride and how light their bodies are .
I 'm actually scared to look at my undercarriage .
I wrote a letter to my congressmen asking that they look into the issue and possibly propose legislation that would set a minimum size a passenger vehicle must be to be allowed on the road .
I think a reasonable minimum size would be like a Jeep Cherokee .
I will let you know what I hear back .
As a full - time management consultant for a large insurance firm and a part - time mother , naturally safety is a major concern of mine .
I urge every mother reading this to look at the size of her own car , and ask herself if she really feels safe towing precious cargo like her children and groceries around in it , or if maybe she should trade it in for something a little bigger .
Let me know what you think .

Indiana Jones Crystal Skull Opening Weekend Box Office $ 101 Million
After tepid reviews at the Cannes Film Festival , Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull was launched in 4,260 theaters and found an eager audience over the Memorial Day weekend .
Thursday debut numbers were low at $ 25 million but things picked up for the weekend with an estimated $ 101 million , bringing it 's total gross including Thursday to a respectable $ 126 million .
Chronicles of Narnia : Prince Caspian , in it 's second weekend in theaters has earned a total of $ 91 Million .
Iron Man , which debuted on May 2 , has earned a whopping $ 252 million for its three week run .
The Steven Spielberg directed movie is the fourth action adventure film in the series made famous by Harrison Ford .
After a 19 year break , the 65 year old actor set out to convince audiences that he was still viable as the swashbuckling hero .
According to those in the know , the slumping economy and high gas prices may have put a crimp in the way people spend their money but movie reviewers believe that this does n't translate to a slower box office .
Most feel that when times get tough people head to the darkened movie theaters to temporarily forget about their own woes .
Harrison Ford has been in a six year relationship with Hollywood actress Calista Flockhart .
The couple met at the 2002 Golden Globes when she spilled wine on his award .
She has an adopted seven year old son Liam .

First Offensive Underway
The United States military offensive against Iran may have begun with a swiftly escalating series of operations directed against the Mahdi Army , a Shiite militia led by cleric Muqtada al - Sadr , which had been observing a six month old cease - fire .
Overall circumstances in support of this conclusion :
* If attacks against Iran are to commence soon , then it makes sense to weaken those forces considered likely to irrupt in response to such an attack :
Better to attack those forces first and separately , throwing them off balance and subjecting them to prolonged siege , thereby depleting their assets and revealing their larger weapon capabilities and stores , prior to an attack on Iran itself ; * If attacks against Iran are to commence soon , then it makes sense to force an end to the Mahdi Army six month cease - fire and to establish general conditions of conflict , during which accusations and operations against Iran would appear less unprovoked ; * The recent Bush and Cheney " peace " trips occurred within the planning and operating context of not only the current offensive , but also part of an event platform for operations whose scale and duration certainly extend beyond the forces deployed in the port of Basra during the last week in March , leaving the distinct impression US actions are plan rather than event driven .
Iraqi circumstantial elements :
* Operations against the Mahdi Army are large scale , coordinated attacks : Starting with raids and arrests in the Shiite neighborhoods in Baghdad and following - up immediately by a claimed 30,000 man police and Iraqi army offensive in Basra , which required months of planning and logistical preparation , even if largely imagined ; *
The operations were timed to occur immediately after the Bush - Cheney Middle - East trips and before the administration 's presentation of its force level plans to Congress ; * The operations were directed against what US and Iraqi governments say are Iranian assets in Iraq : US and Iraqi government officials have repeatedly charged that the elements attacked were those supported by Iran ; *
The local police and army units in Basra were bypassed : long considered unreliable , the Basra police and army units , which were expected to melt away in any general insurrection , have been largely replaced ( and possibly contained / detained ) by units sent from the north in the Iraqi government 's single largest military operation ; * Sadr 's call for civil peace demonstrations in Baghdad to protest US attacks were met with an unprecedented three day , 24 hour curfew ; * Throughout all of this , US forces have been held almost entirely in reserve , with their likely use to occur as each Mahdi Army element is fixed in defensive positions by the Iraqi army , depending on circumstances , such as hitting Mahdi Army strong points , supporting weakening Iraqi government operations , and killing / capturing Sadr . * General Petraeus claimed in a BBC interview about the Green Zone attacks , " Tehran had trained , equipped and funded insurgents who fired the barrage of mortars and rockets . "
* General Petraeus in a videoconference with the president on Monday , during the briefings reported by officials , recommended taking " up to two months " to evaluate security in Iraq before considering additional withdrawals .

After a contentious battle that included allegations of spying , Burger King announced on Friday that it had reached an agreement to improve the wages and working conditions of tomato pickers in Florida .
At a news conference on Capitol Hill , the hamburger chain , based in Miami , said it would pay tomato prices adequate to give workers a wage increase of 1.5 cents a pound .
A penny a pound will go into the workers ’ pockets .
The extra half - cent is intended to cover additional payroll taxes and administrative costs for tomato growers .
The 1 - cent increase means that for every 32 - pound bucket of tomatoes they pick , the workers will earn 77 cents , instead of 45 cents .
That is a 71 percent increase , the first substantial one in decades for the workers .
At the old wage , a farm workers ’ group said , the pickers typically earned $ 10,000 to $ 12,000 a year .
“ If the Florida tomato industry is to be sustainable long term , it must become more socially responsible , ” said Amy Wagner , a senior vice president at Burger King .
She estimated that the wage boost would cost Burger King about $ 300,000 a year .
I am going to share some of my experiences with you on social media marketing to tell you what is the best social media website for your website and why .
You may have noticed over the past 2 weeks that I have geared a couple of my posts a little more towards the social media .
I wrote mostly listed posts , with short , sharp information and lots of pictures – social media nuts loves these posts !
eg .
I will share my results from these posts with you , to determine what is the best social media website and why .
First off , lets just name the main social media websites out there :
Digg StumbleUpon Del.icio.us Reddit Other Niche Social Media Websites ( ie. DesignFloat is a Digg like site for design )
So what is the best social media website for your website and why ?
To determine the ‘ best ’ social media website for you it depends on what your after .
The usual main reasons for targeting social media websites are for :
Traffic
Subscribers
Regular Readers
Links / Exposure
Money
I am going to look at these 5 reasons and will be doing so by comparing stats from Google Analytics and my own experiences .
Check out the stats for the three pages mentioned above .
Digg
Traffic
As you can see , by getting onto Digg ’s front page , it will literally bring thousands of visitors usually within a few hours , but how good is the traffic ?
The average Digg visitor only stayed on Just Creative Design for 1:12 and only 17 % of 43 , 000 stayed on my website to check out more of my articles .
The real value of this traffic is usually not that great as the huge amount of traffic usually brings down most sites ( JCD went down for about 1 hour when we were getting 2000 requests per second ) however it does boost your Alexia rank , get exposure , and build links .
43,654 Visitors is not something you can really get anywhere else apart from Digg so if it is visitors and traffic your after , go for Digg .
Subscribers
You would think after 43,000 + visitors to your site you would get at least some subscribers but after my experience only about 1 % of all the visitors subscribed to JCD , 430 subscribers from 43,000 ?
But I ca n’t be sure that they all came from Digg .
About 100 had unsubscribed by the next day .
Regular Readers
This is something I have not been able to track , but usually if you want regular readers I would target smaller social media sites in your niche as they are more interested in what you have to write about .
An example is DesignFloat , which is a Digg like site for designers .
Links / Exposure
This is something you ca n’t control but Digg sure does bring exposure to your blog , links were scarce but you do pop up on other social media sites such as popurls and jimmyr which also bring a good amount of traffic .
Money
Not worth having PPC ( Pay Per Click ) ads on your site with Digg , after 60000 page views , only 4 people had clicked on my Google Adsense ads .
Digg users generally do not click on ads and they have ad blockers installed .
If you have a CPM ( Cost Per Mile Impressions ) ad system installed this would be more beneficial .
Affiliate marketing on Digg is a bit questionable , but generally not successful .
Other things worth mentioning :
Digg does bring a mad amount of comments both on your site and on the digg site , for example my recent article 30 Fonts that all designers must own brought over 350 comments to Digg and 50 here on Just Creative Design .
Be aware that comments are not always nice but just ignore these !
StumbleUpon
Traffic
The traffic from SU is steady , and in general pretty good in turnover for regular readers .
Although it does not bring in huge amounts of visitors all at once like Digg nor in as huge numbers .
SU users stayed on Just Creative Design for longer in general and visited at least 2 pages before leaving .
You will also notice that it had a very low bounce rate compared to other sites , with 58 % of visitors staying on the site !
SU users are generally more inclined to stay on your website plus the visitors are steady and usually new ( 94 % new ) .
Subscribers
Also hard to track , but generally it has a bit better turnover of subscriber numbers after a good stumble post .
I would say about 4 % subscribe .
Regular Readers
A little better than Digg however not as good as targeting niche social media site as I said before .
Links / Exposure
Exposure is good , and usually you get links back to people that do posts on ‘ the best of so and so ’ or link love .
If your post is getting stumbled it may be a good idea to submit the article to other niche social media sites .
Money
Usually SU users do not click on ads , so this is a bit tough , try using a CPM ( Cost Per Mile ) advertising solution , something I am going to try soon .
Del.icio.us
Traffic
Traffic usually comes in short bursts , however they are usually more interested in finding out who the author is and what the site is about and they also stay on the site for longer than Digg and Stumble Upon users .
Not as many visitors as Digg or SU however a bit better quality traffic as they explore your site more .
Subscribers
Have not been able to track this for Del.icio.us users but if they are interested in your blogs topics and sees your site has value , I imagine a small percentage would subscribe .
Regular Readers
Also hard to track so ca n’t really comment on this one .
Links / Exposure
Your website is shared amongst all the other users in Del.icio.us which is always great , as you get more exposure and traffic as people bookmark you for future reference .
Money
More likely to click on ads however only a small percentage do so as you can imagine , a lot better than SU or Digg in this respect .
Other things worth mentioning
Generally if your post makes Digg and it is a resourceful post , your post will also make Del.icio.us and other social media sites .
Reddit
Traffic
Not as many visitors as Digg , SU or Delicious but any traffic always helps !
Generally they visit just the page that was posted , hardy ever look around your site , and hardly stay on your site at all .
Not that valuable traffic , but traffic none the less .
Subscribers
Close to nil .
Regular Readers
Hardly any at all .
They usually are interested in the one page that is being linked too .
Links / Exposure
Exposure is good as you will get nearly all new visitors to your blog , however they wo n’t stick around or write about your post .
Money
A CPM ( impressions ) ad system would work best here .
Niche Social Media Websites
When I say niche social media websites I mean ones that are targeting at your niche , for example Design Float is a digg like site for design related subjects only .
Traffic
Less traffic but a lot more valuable in turn of turnover .
Visitors are very targeted so are more inclined to subscribe to your blog and explore your site .
Design Float has been great for sending visitors my way and is also a sponsor for this site , but I do notice only about 40 % of them are new visitors which means I do get a lot of returning visitors .
Subscribers
As touched on above , users from niche social media sites are more likely to subscribe as they are interested in what your blog is about and wo n’t want to miss out on what you have to say .
Regular Readers
The best out of any social media site as they are pretty much guaranteed to be interested in your blog .
Links / Exposure
The best also as you will get link backs from other blogs who write on the same topic as you .
Money
This depends on the type of advertising you have , if you have targeted ad words for instance then what you write about will reflect what ads are shown .
This means if I wrote about design , design related ads are going to show up , and if people are coming from a niche social media site , they are more inclined to click on the ads as it will reflect their interests .
As for affiliate ads , it depends on what your trying to sell .
CPM would also work but I am in no way a monetizing expert , as I am not in this for the money .
Conclusion :
If you want lots of visitors and traffic , lots of comments , and thousands of visitors ( and maybe your site brought down ) and a big batch of subscribers go with Digg .
.
If you want good steady traffic go with Stumble Upon .
You will also get a small number of subscribers and they will explore your site at least on average 2 pages .
.
You will also get a small number of subscribers and they will explore your site at least on average 2 pages .
If you want short bursts of traffics and a bit of site exploration and link ups go with Delicious .
. Reddit users come and go , so this is pretty much only good for page view numbers .
users come and go , so this is pretty much only good for page view numbers .
Niche social sites are the best way to go if you ’re after subscribers and targeted traffic .
What are your experiences with social media ?
What works best for you ?
This post was another submission for Vivien ’s Social Media Group Writing Project , a project where you can learn more about Social Media .
And also Randa Clay ’s Ad Group Writing Project which is based around writing a post on a advertising slogan .
I based my post on “ Make yourself heard ” by Ericsson .
What better way to get heard than by social media ?
Barack Obama is planning to declare himself the effective winner of the long - running contest with Hillary Clinton at the close of the Kentucky and Oregon primaries tomorrow .
At that point , he should have passed one of the last remaining milestones in the race , securing more than half the 3,253 elected delegates .
To exploit this he is to shun the tradition of hosting a party in one of those two states after the polls close and instead hold a rally in Iowa , a decision full of symbolism .
It was in Iowa on January 3 that Obama won the first of the 49 Democratic contests so far and irretrievably damaged Clinton 's reputation for invincibility .
His campaign team is anxious to bring the contest to a close to reunite the party after the longest primary season since 1980 - and one of the most acrimonious .
It also wants to concentrate on the fight against the Republican presidential nominee , John McCain , in November .
But Clinton is not yet ready to surrender .
" There are some people who have been saying for months that this is over , and every time they say it , the voters come back and say , ' Oh no it 's not , we 're not ready for it to be over , ' " she told supporters in Kentucky on Saturday .
She has already said she intends to fight on until at least the last two primaries , in South Dakota and Montana on June 3 .
In spite of her defiance , Clinton and Obama supporters are already engaged in informal discussion about preparing for her accepting that the race is over .
Clinton 's team will seek concessions , possibly a cabinet post or the Obama team taking over her campaign debt of $ 20 m ( £ 10.2 m ) .
The Washington Post yesterday reported that top fundraisers of the two candidates have had private talks about merging the campaigns .
One of them , Mark Aronchick , a Philadelphia lawyer who has raised more than $ 1 m for Clinton 's run , said : " Only if we do this right , and see this through in the right way , will there be a chance for a full , rapid and largely complete unification of the party . "
According to the Obama team , he is just 17 short of securing half of the elected delegates , who will help to choose the nominee .
" After winning 32 of 49 contests , Barack is within reach of an absolute majority .
We believe that the winner of the majority of elected , pledged delegates should and will be the Democratic nominee .
We need to do absolutely everything we can to help put Barack over the top , " read a campaign email to supporters .
Clinton 's team will counter that the decision on the nominee rests with 4,050 delegates ( the 3,253 elected ones plus 797 superdelegates ) and Obama will not have reached a majority of more than half of those , 2,026 , by tomorrow .
Obama secured another superdelegate yesterday , bringing his overall total to 1,908 , compared with Clinton 's 1,718 .
But he is already behaving as if the race is over and focusing on campaigning in the states he will need to win the Oval Office in November .
His campaign has sent teams into battleground states to recruit volunteers and register Democratic voters , as well as preparing ads for use against McCain .
" Obviously , we do n't want to wake up the morning after we become the nominee and not be prepared , " said Obama 's campaign manager , David Plouffe .
Obama is to spend three days this week in Florida , one of the largest of the swing states and one that could be vital to Democratic chances of taking the White House .
He is not planning to visit Kentucky , which is also predominantly white and which Clinton is expected to win easily .
Clinton 's team concedes he is likely to win Oregon .
Even if Obama lost tomorrow 's primaries , the proportional representation system should award him enough delegates to reach the target of more than half the elected delegates .
Kentucky has 51 delegates at stake and Oregon 52 .

Democratic frontrunner Barack Obama may have gotten blown out in Kentucky , but he is cruising to big win in Oregon tonight , and earlier this evening at a rally in Des Moines , Iowa , Obama promised that change is coming to America .
Obama said that he does n’t see a divided Democratic Party , but an energized one , “ Some may see the millions upon millions of votes cast for each of us as evidence that our party is divided , but I see it as proof that we have never been more energized and united in our desire to take this country in a new direction .
More than anything , we need this unity and this energy in the months to come , because while our primary has been long and hard - fought , the hardest and most important part of our journey still lies ahead . ”
He then laid out his basic theme for the general election , change versus experience .
“ We face an opponent , John McCain , who arrived in Washington nearly three decades ago as a Vietnam War hero , and earned an admirable reputation for straight talk and occasional independence from his party .
But this year ’s Republican primary was a contest to see which candidate could out - Bush the other , and that is the contest John McCain won . ”
Advertisements
He continued , “ We will face our share of difficult and uncertain days in the journey ahead .
The other side knows they have embraced yesterday ’s policies and so they will also embrace yesterday ’s tactics to try and change the subject .
They will play on our fears and our doubts and our divisions to distract us from what matters to you and your future .
Well they can take the low road if they want , but it will not lead this country to a better place .
And it will not work in this election .
It wo n’t work because you wo n’t let it .
Not this time .
Not this year . ”
He concluded by talking about his campaign in populist and revolutionary terms , “ It ’s what led high school and college students to give up their vacations to stuff envelopes and knock on doors , and why grandparents have spent all their afternoons making phone calls to perfect strangers .
It ’s what led men and women who can barely pay the bills to dig into their savings and write $ 5 checks and $ 10 checks , and why young people from all over this country have left their friends and their families for a job that offers little pay and less sleep .
Change is coming to America . ”
The change versus experience theme has been so good to Obama that he would have to be insane to change it , especially when he is facing another opponent in the fall that seems to be happily wrapping the incumbent label around himself .
Early exit polling in Oregon shows that Obama split the vote with Clinton on working class voters and white women .
In my opinion , Obama has the perfect message for this year .
Now he only needs to figure how to broaden its appeal to more Democrats .

Why does Anders stay with Starbuck , when she treats him like crap ?
How will Col .
Tigh deal with learning he 's a totally different person than he thought he was ?
What 's up with Tory 's sexuality ?
Michael Trucco ( Anders ) , Rekha Sharma ( Tory ) , and Michael Hogan ( Tigh ) answered these , and several other questions yesterday at New York Comic - Con .
Plus we saw a new trailer that included some important scenes from upcoming episodes .
Spoilers after the jump .

Before the questioning even began , Sci Fi screened a quickie trailer spliced together with scenes from episodes to come .
It 's hard to say what 's fact and what is fiction with all the character dream sequences that have happened so far in BSG , but this is what I put together from mere half seconds of footage .
Adama Knows — Or Does He ?
Adama figures out who the four cylons are aboard his ship .
I based this on a quickie moment where you see Adama drinking next to Chief Tyrol and Adama leans over and sneers , " I guess they can't take being married to a cylon . "
Plus there seems to be a huge Tigh and Adama fist fight in the works from a quickly cut scene where the two were throwing down .

Granted , the Chief never had that much religion to begin with , besides stating that he was son of a prophet and figuring out the Eye of Jupiter .
But a bald chief takes a run at a cylon screaming something about their one true god .

Starbuck 's command is being challenged and it's down to the wire problems take over her Mission : Find Earth trip .
I based this on a lot Starbucks crew members yelling at her and then eventually Helo ( on the communicator ) that they only had a little time left .
Yeah this one 's a little predictable it's not like they were just going to find Earth in the next episode , or do they ?
Important Questions Answered , Or No Commented
Q : What was your initial reaction when you heard you were going to be a cylon ?
Michael Hogan :
For me it was disbelief .
As Hogan it was disbelief .
I thought that 's kitschy that 's cheap .
Of everybody who 's ever been on Battlestar Galactica , Col .
Tigh was second to last of who should be a cylon .
And so I thought of course it 's obvious that will be the surprise .
So I did n't believe it , I did n't like it .
I had actually said numerous times once we were shooting Battlestar Galactica , am I ever glad that I 'm not playing a cylon .
But over the four years that we 've been doing this .
The powers that be have never steered me wrong , I may have disagreed with them , and sometimes they go along with me .
But when they 've stuck to their guns , I mean wow look what they put Tigh through so I got to stick with them

Rekha Sharma : I was so excited .
I started squealing in my room .
I came out and told my friends what I just read .
And then I proceed to behave really calmly because it was an early draft , things could change , do n't get too excited you could get knock off early ... [ fake yells ]
But I 'm going to be a cylon .
I 'm still here so we 'll see how that goes .
Michael Trucco :
My first reaction was , so I guess I 'm coming back .
I was only supposed to be around for two episodes .
Somehow I hood winked them into keeping me around for about 20 more .
It was great it , it was obviously a bit of a surprise for all of us .
I got teased and you largely think that they are bullshitting you because there are so many rumors and lies .
I kept thinking there is no way in hell that they would pick me as a cylon .
When I found out I read ahead , the first thing I did was call Ron and David and tried to figure out what were the implications for our character .
How does this reconcile the last two and a half years , suddenly we have this new found identity .
So we worked it out and I think it worked out pretty good .

How did you work with " All Along The Watchtower ? "
Michael Hogan : I had Bob Dylan 's version and Hendrix 's version in my trailer .
I of course was alive when that first came out .
These fools were n't , it was just too much to have them in my trailer it cranked it to the max and Hendrix is just wailing away .
And Rekha , ' going oh my god . '
So I thought , " Welcome aboard . "

Do the actors treat you differently now that you 're cylons ?
Michael Hogan :
That 's all backstage .
They treat us with great respect .
Michael Trucco :
They were jealous .
Did you get any backstory for Tory ?
Does she always cry during sex ?
Rekha Sharma :
They did not create a backstory for Tory besides her job .
I spoke to Ron Moore at a party .
He said he would love to know what my thoughts were .
I got to be part of a collaborative experience of creating my characters backstory so that 's really fun and really exciting .

Michael Trucco :
Who did the crying during sex part ?
Rekha Sharma : Michael Angeli is responsible for that .
Apparently there is some person he knew through someone , this is a true story apparently .
So he wanted me to carry that torch .

Michael Trucco :
You did n't cry when you were with Anders ?
Rekha Sharma :
Hell no ... my personal choice was to make that a lie because I was n't happy to be in bed with the guy who ruined my life on New Caprica .

Does being a cylon change how you feel about the show ?
Michael Hogan : Hearing that Col .
Tigh is a cylon .
Its like all of a sudden you develop schizophrenia ...
All of a sudden a switch does n't go off in your head and you go , 'oh I 'm a cylon . '
Tigh had been through so much in his life .
With substance abuse [ and ] dealing with being incarcerated .
He will often lose his balance .
So now this thing of hearing this music in his head it is n't oh I 'm a cylon and now I see things in a different way .
It 's trying to deal with what is this .
And if I 'm a cylon , if it 's true I 'm an awful danger .
I have to deal with this because I 'm the oldest man probably alive .
I 've had more battle combat than anyone alive .
So if I 'm a cylon and something is going to snap I 've got to watch out .
So it 's not a comfortable thing to deal with .
If I am a cylon , then I 'm a dangerous person — then I 've got to watch out .

Is Ellen coming back ?
Michael Hogan : I 'm not sure because I did n't see the promo for that .
But an interesting thing for BSG , if you read a script where you 're shot you do n't have to worry about it because there are flashbacks and dreams .
It was this season opener where I take the gun up and shoot Adama .
And I imagined that .
But that actually was a good scene because that shows you how Tigh is reacting to being a cylon .
If there was an indication that Ellen is coming back ...
I have n't stopped thinking about Ellen since I had to take her life .
So who knows what will happen ?

What is it about Starbuck that keeps you coming back ?
Michael Trucco :
Yeah I have a thing for angry sex .
I mean Anders .
It 's a survival instinct , is n't it ?
Think about this : I probably hooked up with one of the most powerful women left .
There are only like 40,000 of us left so I 'm kind of hedging my bets .
If I 'm going to hook up with somebody there 's not a lot of options out there .
She treats me like shit but my survival instinct it matters more than me .
To be living is probably best secured being in the company of Starbuck and Galactica .
There is a survival aspect to that .
Yes there 's a love and a loyalty , but the relationship has been tumultuous to say the least .
Now we 've added this new - found layer .
I think the beginning of this season I think we saw Anders need to relate .
He 's looking for a kindred spirit .
Anders has this secret that he desperately wants to tell her and hopes that she already knows it .
I think there 's a certain attraction to the volatility .

Are you going to keep the eye patch ( as a souvenir ) ?

Bacteria That Snack on Antibiotics Share
Advertisement
A new study has turned up hundreds of bacterial strains that are not only antibiotic - resistant — they literally eat the life - saving drugs for breakfast .
Harvard University researchers found the new bugs while scouring soil samples for bacteria capable of converting agricultural waste into biofuels .
They discovered that many of their specimens ( such as this example , shown in false color ) could withstand antibiotic concentrations up to 50 times stronger than the threshold for antibiotic resistance .
It turned out that unlike most known bacteria , the new organisms actually relied on natural or synthetic antibiotics for their sole source of energy .
Drug - resistant bacteria pose a growing problem , particularly in hospitals , where they may easily spread between patients , shrugging off even the most powerful antibiotics .
These so - called superbugs do not feed on antibiotics .
But some of the new organisms , described in Science , are relatives of known human pathogens such as the deadly E. coli strain O157 : H7 , raising the possibility that the soil - dwellers might transfer even nastier abilities to our microbial foes .

CanSecWest
A brand - new MacBook
Air running a fully patched version of Leopard was the first to fall in a contest that pitted the security of machines running OS X , Vista and Linux .
The exploit took less than two minutes to pull off .
Charlie Miller , who was the first security researcher to remotely exploit the iPhone , felled the Mac by tapping a security bug in Safari .
The exploit involved getting an end user to click on a link , which opened up a port that he was then able to telnet into .
Once connected , he was able to remotely run code of his choosing .
The feat won him a $ 10,000 prize paid by Tipping Point , whose Zero Day Initiative pays bounties to researchers for responsibly disclosing vulnerabilities .
The hack came during the Pwn2Own contest , which is being held at the CanSecWest conference in Vancouver .
The competition took place in a conference room overlooking the city 's Burrard Inlet , a harbor where pontoon planes took off and disappeared into black rain clouds shrouding nearby Grouse Mountain .
A small round of applause broke out immediately after contest officials confirmed Miller 's exploit was legit .
At time of writing , the Windows and Linux machines were still standing .
Under contest rules , Miller was forbidden from providing specifics of his hack .
He said he chose Apple over the other machines because " I thought of the three it was the easiest " .
He said he did n't test the exploit on any other platform .
As a Mac user , he added , he felt an incentive to exploit the system because he believes it will help make the platform stronger .
Miller , who works for Independent Security Evaluators , received help from co-workers Jake Honoroff and Mark Daniel .
Miller 's win came on day two of the contest , which gradually eases the rules for what constitutes a qualifying exploit .
Not a single attendee entered the contest on day one , when all vulnerabilities had to reside in the machine 's operating system , drivers or network stack .
Winners were eligible for a $ 20,000 prize .
On day two , the attack surface was expanded to include browsers , mail applications and other common applications , and the bounty was reduced to $ 10,000 .
Contestants on day three will be allowed to attack still more applications , such as Skype , QuickTime and browser plugins for a $ 5,000 prize .
The Safari exploit came a day after Secunia warned of two critical vulnerabilities in the Apple browser .
As we 've said in the past , one benefit of the Pwn2 Own contest is its ability to eliminate economic variables from the argument over whether a given platform is vulnerable to attack .
Given the proper incentive , it 's safe to say that any is ripe for the picking . ®
Many of the abuses the report describes have previously been disclosed , but it was not known that F.B.I. agents had gone so far as to document accusations of abuse in a “ war crimes file ” at Guantánamo .
The report does not say how many incidents were included in the file after it was started in 2002 , but the “ war crimes ” label showed just how seriously F.B.I. agents took the accusations .
Sometime in 2003 , however , an F.B.I. official ordered the file closed because “ investigating detainee allegations of abuse was not the F.B.I. ’s mission , ” the report said .
The inspector general , Glenn A. Fine , found that in a few instances , F.B.I. agents participated in interrogations using pressure tactics that would not have been permitted inside the United States .
But the “ vast majority ” of agents followed F.B.I. legal guidelines and “ separated themselves ” from harsh treatment , the report says .
The report says that the F.B.I. “ had not provided sufficient guidance to its agents on how to respond when confronted with military interrogators ” who used interrogation techniques that were not permitted by the F.B.I. , and that fueled confusion and dissension .
But it also says that “ the F.B.I. should be credited for its conduct and professionalism in detainee interrogations in the military zones . ”
Jameel Jaffer , who tracks detainee issues for the American Civil Liberties Union , took a more critical stance , saying the report shows “ the F.B.I. ’s leadership failed to act aggressively to end the abuse . ”
Mr. Jaffer said the report “ only underscores the pressing need for an independent and comprehensive investigation of prisoner abuse . ”
The report documents in greater detail than ever before the conflict between the F.B.I. and the C.I.A. over interrogation methods , which began with the capture of Abu Zubaydah , a senior Qaeda figure , in Pakistan in March 2002 .
F.B.I. agents began the interrogation using traditional rapport - building methods , and one agent even provided personal care for Mr. Zubaydah , who had been shot three times and grievously wounded , “ even to the point of cleaning him up after bowel movements . ”
But C.I.A. personnel who took over the case within a few days began to use harsher methods that one F.B.I. agent described as “ borderline torture , ” and which the C.I.A. has acknowledged included waterboarding , in which water is poured over the prisoner ’s mouth and nose to create a feeling of suffocation .
The report describes extensive debate inside the F.B.I. over the next six months over whether it should continue to observe or assist the C.I.A. with interrogations using harsh methods it believed were counterproductive .
Bourgeois Taco Truck Petition Ξ August 28th , 2009 | → Comments Off on Bourgeois Taco Truck Petition | ∇ Uncategorized |
The LAPD ’s crackdown on some of the more upscale trucks on the Miracle Mile portion of Wilshire last week is resurrecting fears that law enforcement is still willing to find any excuse to hassle food trucks at the behest of competing restaurants .
An online petition is circulating ( we did n’t start it this time … I promise ) with the hopes of expressing customers ’ anger at having their options limited due to picky parking tickets .
Do your civic good deed for the weekend and hopefully law enforcement can start enforcing laws that affect us , rather than the bottom line of Big Taco .

Loncheros Update Ξ June 10th , 2009 | → 5 Signatures | ∇ Uncategorized | Wow !
It ’s been a while since we ’ve updated this site as various battles have been going on in the courts but until lately , there has n’t been much to report on .
Today the Los Angeles Times website reported that volunteers from the UCLA Labor Center helped fight the city ordinance that until recently had n’t been enforced against the trucks .
The city ordinance was similar to the county ordinance in that it limited trucks to between 30 minutes and an hour ( depending on the exact area ) .
The more important difference for many of us is that this directly affected many of the trucks we visit : ( Echo Park ’s Taco Zone and Eagle Rock ’s Leo ’s Tacos for example . )
Even the popular more gourmet incarnations of these trucks were often in violation of these rules and could have been cited and eventually put out of business were the LAPD to enforce the ordinance against them .
( Think of every time Kogi parks on a city street for more than 60 minutes ! )
The bad news here is that we doubt the fight is over .
The good news is that the politicians have been dealt another setback which will force them to negotiate a more reasonable solution with the loncheros .
If you want to thank someone , congratulate the truck owners , or just enjoy some good food and music , the Loncheros Association will be celebrating their recent granting of trade association status tomorrow night at the UCLA Downtown Labor Center .
The group promises presentations by the affected members as well as by supportive politicians and community leaders .
If a similar event in East Los Angeles last year is any barometer , come hungry .

We reviewed it on our sister site ( with a mixed opinion ) , but what we are adamant about is what the truck represents to the larger community of loncheros : “ Kogi parks on city streets , and while they move locations pretty frequently , ( you have to follow their locations via their website ) the proposed laws the Board of Supervisors was pushing last year would have made this type of entry - level capitalism very risky for chef Roy Choi .
Instead , our city has another unique culinary institution that is quickly maturing beyond paper plates and tin foil . ”
Keep up the good work Kogi , and we ’ll visit again when the lines get a little shorter .
It looks like our cousins across the pond are even getting on the taco bandwagon .

If you ’re looking for a way to have a fun time , eat cheap , and educate your friends , why not take them on a taco truck tour of Los Angeles ?
Things are quiet on the legislative front but do n’t let the county ’s seeming docility fool you .
West Hollywood has begun cracking down on hot dog carts and a bit farther afield , Italy has banned the opening of any new “ ethnic ” restaurants .
Think that kind of discrimination can’t happen here ?
Engage in any conversation ( especially on the NELA mailing list ) about the trucks , and someone is bound to use the terms “ anchor baby ” , “ peddle ” , “ illegal alien ” , and “ infestation ” .

Schlafly ’s honorary degree : a travesty of a mockery of a sham
By Kathy G .
The decision on the part of Washington University , the highly respected research university located in St. Louis , Missouri , to award an honorary degree to the odious Phyllis Schlafly is deeply distressing to me .
One reason why is that this story has gotten nowhere near the attention it deserves , either from the mainstream media or from the left blogosphere ( although there are a few blogs that , against the grain , have been on the case ) .
I think part of the problem is that , these days , many people have no idea who Phyllis Schlafly was and is .
And , compounding that , a lot of folks do n’t understand what awarding an honorary degree means .
I will try to correct what I see as those lacunae , or misunderstandings , in this post ( which I ’ll warn you right here , is exceedingly long ) .
Let me start by posing a question : how would you feel if a great university decided to bestow its highest award — an honorary doctoral degree — on Ann Coulter ?
Or on Karl Rove ?
Well , the reprehensible Schlafly is very much their equivalent , as I ’ll explain later .
Washington University has defended its outrageous decision to honor Schlafly with these disgusting weasel words :
Alumna Phyllis Schlafly ’s articulation of her perspectives has been a significant part of American life during the last half of the 20th century and now the 21st century , serving as a lightning rod for vigorous debate on difficult issues where differences of opinion are profound and passionate .
Not only should a university serve as a place where such discussions take place , but it may also choose to recognize those who provide leadership and articulation — both pro and con — on vital issues .
Well , yes , there can be doubt that Phyllis Schlafly has been a “ significant part of American life , ” that she has been a “ lightning rod , ” that she has shown “ leadership . ”
As Alan Wolfe pointed out in a 2005 review of a biography about Schlafly that appeared in The New Republic ( but which , unfortunately , is unavailable online , because the TNR archives are still screwed up , as they have been for about a year now ) :
If political influence consists in transforming this huge and cantankerous country in one ’s preferred direction , Schlafly has to be regarded as one of the two or three most important Americans of the last half of the twentieth century .
. .
Had she never been born , the Constitution would now include an Equal Rights Amendment .
I am in complete agreement with Wolfe here — Phyllis Schlafly is indeed probably “ one of the two or three most important Americans of the last half of the twentieth century . ”
That is a bitter and painful truth , but a truth nonetheless .
Wolfe again :
Critchlow [ author of the Schlafly biography Wolfe is reviewing ] is right to insist on Schlafly ’s influence–but influence is a neutral category .
It may be a force for good or a force for ill , depending upon the ideas that animate it .
Let it be said of Phyllis Schlafly that every idea she had was scatter - brained , dangerous , and hateful .
The more influential she became , the worse off America became .
The officials at Washington U. can piously murmur all the bland words they please about “ difficult issues where differences of opinion are profound and passionate , ” but let ’s get real : when you award someone with an honorary degree , you are making a value judgment .
You are saying that the honoree — because of her exceptional intellectual , creative , or entrepreneurial talents , or her extraordinary contributions to American life , or the world — is so distinguished that she has rightfully earned the highest honor a great university can bestow .
Let ’s not kid ourselves : plenty of fairly hacktackular people — mediocre sitcom stars , not especially distinguished politicians , and the like — are regularly rewarded with these babies .
But very rarely — in fact , almost never — do you see a great university honor someone who , throughout her public life has shown nothing but contempt for the values of the academia , values such as intellectual honesty and integrity , rational discourse , and the dispassionate pursuit of knowledge .
Who has been , not a champion of human rights and human progress , but rather , at every turn , sought to thwart the aspirations of millions of female and nonwhite Americans and deny them equal justice under the law .
Who has attempted to leave the world a far worse place than it was when she came into it , and in many ways has succeeded at this .
All right , you may ask : specifically , what is my bill of indictment against Phyllis Schlafly ?
Dear lord , where do I even begin ?
Well , let ’s start with something that I think should be very disturbing indeed to a great university like Washington U. : Schlafly ’s deeply ingrained habit , from the beginning of her public career well into the present , of crackpot conspiracy - mongering .
Early on Schlafly was a member in good standing of the John Birch Society .
You know them — they were an organization of redhunters so freakishly obsessed and paranoid that they famously believed President Eisenhower was a “ conscious agent ” of the international communist conspiracy .
Schlafly first became well - known for her slim 1964 volume — a pamphlet , really — supporting the presidential candidacy of Barry Goldwater , A Choice Not An Echo .
The book has been described as
a conspiracist theory in which the Republican Party was secretly controlled by elitist intellectuals dominated by members of the Bilderberger banking conference , whose policies were allegedly designed to usher in global communist conquest .
And yes , to be sure , in that book she did n’t explicitly identify those communist international bankers as Jews — but then again she did n’t have to , did she ?
Later on , Schlafly ’s conspiracy theories took more of a black helicopters , anti-UN , anti -“ one - world government ” flavor .
In recent years , she has been identified as one of the leading proponents of conspiracy theories about the National American Union — the belief that “ behind closed doors , the Bush administration has collaborated with the governments of Mexico and Canada to merge the three nations into one Socialist mega- state . ”
Given her anti-intellectual conspiracy - mongering , it ’s not surprising to learn that Schlafly rejects the theory of evolution and believes that creationism ( or “ intelligent design ” ) should be taught in schools .
It must be said , though , that it is startling to read that she blames the Virginia Tech shootings on that school ’s English department .
But it ’s not just through anti-intellectualism and paranoid conspiracy theories that Schlafly has lowered the tone of political debate in this country .
Do you enjoy the ugly and vicious character of political discourse in George Bush ’s America — the way conservatives cast aspersions at everything from their opponents ’ patriotism to their gender identity ?
The way every political issue under the sun becomes fodder for cheap and sleazy sensationalism ?
Well then , you would just love Phyllis Schlafly .
To this day , Schlafly is an ardent admirer of Joseph McCarthy , and that ’s not surprising , since her tactics of smearing and redbaiting greatly resemble his .
Alan Wolfe explains :
The ugliness of American politics today can be directly traced back to Schlafly ’s vituperative , apocalyptic , character - assassinating campaign against the ERA .
In Slander , her 2002 contribution to American letters , Ann Coulter described Schlafly as “ one of the most accomplished and influential people in America ” and “ a senior statesman in the Republican Party . ”
Coulter was right .
Karl Rove only perfected what Phyllis Schlafly invented .
And the wild , filthy rhetoric of Coulter and some of her screaming reactionary colleagues owes a great deal to Schlafly .
We are lucky , come to think of it , that Schlafly flourished in the days before cable .
I can hardly believe that someone whose entire public career as a writer and speaker is littered with lies , smears , conspiracy theories , and shrill , ugly rhetoric would ever be rewarded with so high an honor as an honorary doctorate from a great university .
But there are yet more reasons why every decent person should consider Phyllis Schlafly beyond the pale .
There is , for example , not just her style of argument , but the content of her political views .
Which is very disturbing indeed .
Schlafly has always been an energetic proponent of the view that in America , nonwhites should not enjoy equal rights under the law .
Here , for example , is what Wolfe has to say about the relationship between Schafly , the Goldwater - for - president boom , and the civil rights movement :
The origins of the Goldwater boom could be traced to a meeting between Nelson Rockefeller and Richard Nixon in 1960 when , in return for Rockefeller ’s support , Nixon agreed to endorse a civil rights plank calling for “ aggressive action to remove the remaining vestiges of segregation or discrimination in all areas of national life . ”
This was too much for the right - wing activists from the South and Southwest , who were intent on taking over Abraham Lincoln ’s party for their own bigoted ends .
Goldwater had voted against the Civil Rights Act of 1964 , and conservatives such as Schlafly loved him for it .
Conservatives maintained that their opposition to the Civil Rights
Act was based on a preference for state ’s rights over federal power , but no one , least of all their enthusiastic followers , was fooled .
Conservatism was in large part a revolt by whites against the aspirations of blacks , and whatever success it enjoyed was a by - product of the backlash that it generated .
Her views on race remain unchanged , lo these many years later .
Unsurprisingly , Schlafly ( again quoting Wolfe here ) “ strongly ” endorsed “ Lee Atwater ’s use of Willie Horton to scare voters away from Michael Dukakis . ”
She continues to be ( Wolfe ’s words ) “ anti-immigrant and hostile to minorities . ”
She has fairly recently , for example , described Mexican immigrants as “ invaders ” seeking to take control of America .
Her views on military and foreign policy are equally retrograde , which is perhaps not surprising given her notorious pronouncement that “ The atomic bomb is a marvelous gift that was given to our country by a wise God . ”
Predictably , she attacked Nixon ’s opening to China , as well as Nixon ’s , and later Reagan ’s , arms negotiations with the former Soviet Union .
Her writings on military and arms policies were spectacularly ill - informed and dangerous , as Wolfe explains :
[ Schlafly ] teamed up with kooky former military officers such as Admiral Chester Ward to write a series of screeds which , if anyone had taken them seriously , would have brought the United States into a full - scale nuclear war with the Soviet Union .
The United States , Schlafly and Ward insisted , should build a first - strike nuclear force capable of destroying the Soviet Union , adding , along the way , an ABM system in case the Russians should attack us .
Their ideas had a certain intuitive appeal , but only to those completely ignorant of how the world really worked .
So long as the Soviets could respond to any attack on our part by launching an attack of their own , and so long as there was even a remote possibility that an ABM system would fail , deterrence , which Schlafly and Ward denounced , was the only strategy available .
Published by obscure firms , their books deteriorated in both coherence and sales over the years .
Yet Critchlow presents the views of Schlafly and Ward as if they were part of a responsible discussion about American nuclear strategy .
“ The debate between the two sides , ” he writes , “ was technical , with different assumptions brought to the table … .
Still , evaluating specific weapons systems allowed much room for honest disagreement on both sides . ”
This is gibberish .
There never was a “ debate ” between two “ sides , ” both of which were “ honest . ”
There were foreign policy officials making tough decisions about protecting American lives against Soviet missiles and there was , off in the far corners of the lunatic fringe , a group of embittered reactionaries writing furious diatribes taken seriously by no one –except , that is , Critchlow .
It is true that in the late 1970s and early 1980s critics of deterrence emerged who entertained ideas of “ nuclear war - fighting ” and “ nuclear victory ” ; but they were genuine defense intellectuals , whatever the merits of their arguments , and Schlafly was a raving amateur .
Schlafly ’ has had a powerful , and entirely negative , influence on the political direction of this country , and on the tone of our political discourse .
But there is no question that the thing she has been most famous for is being an antifeminist .
Throughout her career , she has been given to such outrageous statements as “ Sexual harassment on the job is not a problem for virtuous women , except in the rarest cases ” and “ By getting married , the woman has consented to sex , and I do n’t think you can call it rape . ”
But she is best known for almost single - handedly stopping the Equal Rights Amendment ( ERA ) .
The ERA was a proposed amendment to the Constitution that simply said “ Equality of rights under the law shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any State on account of sex ” and that Congress would have the power to enforce this by legislation .
It was first proposed in 1923 and was added in the platforms of the Republican and Democratic parties in the 1940s .
It languished for decades , until the feminist movement of the 1970s began a campaign to get it passed .
In 1971 , it was approved in the House of Representatives by 354- 23 and by a vote of 84 to 8 in the Senate the following year .
Soon it was passed by 35 of the 38 state legislatures needed for ratification .
But then Phyllis Schlafly organized an anti-ERA drive , demagogically claiming that the law would destroy families , deny Social Security benefits for housewives and widows , and mandate unisex bathrooms .
Her efforts were so stunningly successful that the proposed amendment was dead in the water by 1982 .
It ’s hard to say what material difference the ERA might have made to the lives of American women .
Many legal scholars believe it would make it easier for women to prevail in cases of sex discrimination , because for the first time it would make sex , like race , a suspect classification demanding strict legal scrutiny ( rather than the intermediate level of scrutiny it currently requires ) .
Under the ERA , a number of Supreme Court decisions such as last year ’s outrageous Ledbetter ruling , which protects employers from lawsuits over pay discrimination , might very well have gone the other way .
But perhaps , more than anything else , the ERA would have been a symbolic gesture , granting women , at long last , the dignity of equal protection under the Constitution .
At any rate , the defeat of the ERA marked a turning point for the feminist movement .
The backlash had arrived in full force , and from that moment on , women saw precious little progress on the legislative , political front .
Although socially , culturally , and economically , there would continue to be much improvement , politically , American feminists have been preoccupied with holding onto the rights they ’d thought they ’d already secured ( such as the right to abortion ) rather than agitating for new ones ( such as universal child care or universal paid leave ) .
I ’ve been working hard trying to understand why a great university like Washington U. ever saw fit to honor Schlafly in the first place .
It ’s not a matter of denying Schlafly freedom of expression , because granting an honorary degree , which implies an endorsement of the honoree , is not the same as inviting a person to speak on campus , which does not .
Universities hold events where all kinds of highly controversial people speak all the time , and that ’s how it should be .
A mere speech by Schlafly would not be out of bounds ( unless it was at some sort of official event that implied the university ’s endorsement , such as graduation ) .
Nor do I believe that conservatives should never receive honorary degrees .
There are conservative scholars who do work that is respected within academia — many economists , for example — and they would not be inappropriate candidates for such an honor .
Nor would I have a problem with conservative pundits , so long as they ’re sane and genuinely distinguished ( which these days admittedly narrows the field to practically zero ) , such as the late William F. Buckley .
I ’ll even grudgingly accept the reality that conservative Republican elder statesmen are regularly awarded these things .
Though even here there are limits — while personally I would n’t protest the awarding of a degree to George H.W.
Bush , even though I find him pretty hateful , far - right lunatics like Cheney , Dubya , and Jesse Helms should be entirely out of bounds .
But Schlafly , as I ’ve explained , is another matter entirely .
In its statement , the university says the decision was made by an Honorary Degree Committee consisting of students , faculty , staff , and members of the Board of Trustees .
The Committee must approve all candidates unanimously , after which the Board of Trustees must then approve all the Committee ’s selections unanimously .
I am stunned that all those people thought that a figure as noxious as Schlafly merited so high an honor — that there was n’t a single person who objected .
How ignorant can all those people , many of them quite distinguished , I ’m sure , be ?
Though probably at least a few of the board and committee members who voted to honor her are conservatives , I ’m willing to bet that the overwhelming majority are not exactly McCain supporters .
I ’d guess that most of them are liberals of one sort or another , and I suspect the decision to honor Schlafly came out of a misguided attempt to be “ fair . ”
It ’s a distressing fact that many liberals , anxious not to be seen as “ biased ” or as condescending to conservatives , in fact bend over backwards to be “ fair and balanced ” towards them .
Such behavior then allows them to congratulate themselves on their “ tolerance ” and “ open-mindedness . ”
Though , to be “ fair , ” so to speak — such behavior does come out of a genuinely decent liberal instinct to be evenhanded .
But this way madness lies .
Because , as much as conservatives may whine and scream to the contrary , liberalism and conservatism are not moral equivalents .
Because , on the one side you have the thinkers and activists who have advanced freedom , social justice , and human rights , and on the other , you have those who have attempted to thwart all those things .
King George III is not the moral equivalent of George Washington .
Jefferson Davis is not the moral equivalent of Abraham Lincoln .
Joe McCarthy is not the moral equivalent of Walter Reuther .
George Wallace is not the moral equivalent of Martin Luther King .
And Phyllis Schlafly is not the moral equivalent of Betty Friedan .
So if you ’re going to be handing out honorary degrees to political activists , conservatives are always going to come up short .
And that is how it should be .
Right now , I ’m thinking about what a bitter , infuriating experience graduation will be for so many Washington U. students this year .
Did you know that , in addition to honoring Schlafly , there will be a commencement address given by Chris Matthews ?
To paraphrase D. at Lawyers , Guns and Money , this has got to be the Worst .
Graduation .
Ever .
If I were a parent who ’d spent a small fortune to put my kid through Washington U. , I ’d be beside myself with rage .
Graduation should be a joyous event , a celebration of an important achievement , a time for students to rejoice at their entrance into the adult world .
But this graduation will be something entirely different .
Look at the crystal - clear and quite powerful message that Washington University is sending to its female graduates , through its selection of Chris Matthews as commencement speaker and Phyllis Schlafly as the recipient of an honorary degree .
They ’re saying that it ’s far more important for them to suck up to , respectively , media elites and the conservative movement , than it is for them to honor the dignity and aspirations of their female students .
That giving their imprimatur to one of the biggest sexists jerks in the media today , and one of the greatest enemies of women ’s advancement in American history , is a far greater priority for them than respecting their own female graduates .
That must be one hell of a bitter pill to swallow .
What a lovely parting gesture to students about to venture forth into “ the real world . ”
If you oppose Washington U.’s decision to award Schlafly the honorary degree , I suggest that you join two anti-Schlafly Facebook groups — this one and this one .
Both groups list actions you can take and Washington U. officials you can contact to register your protests .
I do think there ’s hope they will back down .
Just last week Northwestern University reversed its decision to award an honorary degree to Jeremiah Wright , so there is precedent for this sort of thing .
I will continue to follow this story on my blog , The G Spot .
Oil has broken through the landmark $ 100 a barrel , driven by a slumping dollar , geopolitical instability and worries over a winter fuel supply crunch .
See how the price of oil has risen - and fallen - since 1970 against a background of key world events .
1973 ARAB-ISRAELI WAR
Alarmed by Israeli successes , the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries ( Opec ) orchestrated the Arab oil embargo , sending prices soaring by 400 % in six months .
It was the first time oil had been used as a political weapon , putting pressure on the US which , in turn , persuaded Israel to accept UN mediation on the crisis .
1979 IRANIAN REVOLUTION
Months of turmoil in Iran led to the exile of the Shah and the declaration of an Islamic republic .
It also led to a reduction in oil production and , at one point , the flow of crude oil from Iran was almost halted .
Nervousness about the stability of Iran brought together the other major Arab oil - producing states to ensure supply and increase prices .
1980 IRAN - IRAQ WAR
Iran weakened by the revolution was invaded by Iraq in September 1980 .
By November , the combined oil production of the two countries was only one million barrels a day , 6.5 m fewer barrels than the year before .
It meant a worldwide reduction in crude oil production of 10 % .
The combination of the Iranian revolution and the Iran - Iraq war caused crude oil prices to more than double from $ 14 in 1978 to $ 35 in 1981 .
1986 OIL PRICE CRASH
Higher oil prices led to a reduction in demand as consumers and industry looked at ways of becoming more energy - efficient .
The price rise also led to increased exploration for new sources of oil outside the traditional oil - producing regions .
Saudi Arabia suffered from the reduction in revenue , made worse by new Opec quotas which meant it had also been forced to reduce production .
It responded by increasing production in early 1986 .
Crude oil prices plummeted below $ 10 per barrel - but the Saudi revenue remained about the same .
1990 GULF WAR
Iraq wanted to gain control of the world 's third largest oil producer to give it more control over the world market .
Following the Gulf war to liberate Kuwait , crude oil prices entered a period of steady decline , reaching their lowest level in 1994 for 21 years .
1997 ASIAN FINANCIAL CRISIS
The rapid growth in Asian economies came to a halt leading to lower consumption of oil - just at a time when Opec had begun increasing production .
The combination sent prices plummeting , through to December 1998 .
2001 9/11
Oil prices suffered a downturn as Russian oil production increased , and the US economy went into decline .
Opec tried to stem the reduction by cutting production - but the terror attacks on 11 September sent oil prices plummeting again .
Prices were down by about 35 % by the middle of November .
Opec delayed cutting production again until early 2002 , when prices began to move upwards once more .
2003 IRAQ WAR
The American - led invasion of Iraq led to the loss of oil production in the Gulf state .
In mid- 2002 , there were over six million barrels per day of excess production capacity and by mid 2003 , this had dropped to below two million .
It dropped still further in 2004 - 5 .
A million barrels per day is not enough spare capacity to cover for any sudden drop in production and it led to an increase in prices .
2006 LEBANON CONFLICT
Although neither Israel nor Lebanon are oil producers , the conflict increased tension in the Middle East sending prices soaring .
2008 $ 100 BARREL
Geopolitical tension in Kenya , Algeria and Pakistan , as well as the threat of US sanctions against Iran have played their part .
At the same time , there are fears of a cold winter in the US and Europe , and increased demand from China and India as well as the US .
The falling US dollar has also driven up oil prices as they have to gain to compensate for a slide in the currency .
JOHANNESBURG 
The High Court of Zimbabwe on Monday dismissed an opposition demand for the immediate release of the results of a presidential election held 16 days before .
Independent monitors say that the country ’s autocratic president , Robert Mugabe , trailed badly in the vote and that he may have lost outright .
The opposition Movement for Democratic Change , contending that Mr. Mugabe and the military are illegally clinging to power , has called for people across the country to protest by staying home from work on Tuesday .
“ We are working with a regime that has perfected the art of interfering with the judiciary , ” said an opposition spokesman , Nelson Chamisa .
“ The court has chosen to be a pillar in a collapsing regime . ”
Zimbabwean election officials said in a state - run newspaper that on Saturday they plan to start a recount of the presidential and parliamentary votes in 23 districts .
A ruling on an opposition challenge of a recount is expected Tuesday in the same court system that rejected the opposition ’s case on Monday .

A new form of suspension that promises to revolutionise the experience of people who drive heavy goods vehicles has been designed by a Cambridge academic .
The novel E - shaped suspension will enhance driver control , improve comfort and increase safety .
It will also reduce fuel consumption and cut the cost of fitting specialist equipment to vehicles so that they can cope with different loads .
At the moment , commercial and heavy good vehicles need to have their suspension fine - tuned in accordance with the load they are carrying , so that drivers can control them .
For example , a vehicle with soft suspension is suitable for light loads , but becomes difficult to control if it has to carry extra weight .
On the other hand , giving a vehicle hard suspension can make it easy to handle with a heavy load , but the driver and passengers will be in for a bumpy ride once the load is removed .
PhD researcher Salah Elmonselhy , from the Department of Engineering at the University of Cambridge , has proposed an E - shaped suspension design that gets around the problem by using two springs instead of the single spring used in standard suspension .
The springs are placed opposite to one another , but can work together when needed .
The first operates under light loads , while the second is more tightly set , so that it provides greater stiffness only when the weight of the vehicle ’s load is heavier .
As a result , the vehicle ’s suspension adjusts itself , according to the vehicle ’s needs .
“ Suspension is an ongoing problem for commercial and heavy goods drivers as it can’t always be tuned to a level that balances control , comfort and safety , ” Salah said .
“ This innovation will give drivers more control over their vehicles whatever the weight the suspension has to bear .
The good news is that no extra tuning will be required due to the E - shape . ”
During driving , the vehicle ’s suspension is also pushed or pulled by other forces which are created by braking , cornering and acceleration .
Salah ’s proposed idea is so flexible that with a few additions , the suspension is not affected by these forces .
Salah Elmonselhy has already received an international honour from the Society of Automotive Engineers ( SAE ) , in recognition of his “ E - springs ” invention .
The Society of Automotive Engineers is the world premier society for advancing mobility in Land , Sea , Air , and Space .

IN the YouTube video , Liz Spikol is smiling and animated , the light glinting off her large hoop earrings .
Deadpan , she holds up a diaper .
It is not , she explains , a hygienic item for a giantess , but rather a prop to illustrate how much control people lose when they undergo electroconvulsive therapy , or ECT , as she did 12 years ago .
In other videos and blog postings , Ms. Spikol , a 39 - year - old writer in Philadelphia who has bipolar disorder , describes a period of psychosis so severe she jumped out of her mother ’s car and ran away like a scared dog .
In lectures across the country , Elyn Saks , a law professor and associate dean at the University of Southern California , recounts the florid visions she has experienced during her lifelong battle with schizophrenia  dancing ashtrays , houses that spoke to her  and hospitalizations where she was strapped down with leather restraints and force - fed medications .
Like many Americans who have severe forms of mental illness such as schizophrenia and bipolar disorder , Ms. Saks and Ms. Spikol are speaking candidly and publicly about their demons .
Their frank talk is part of a conversation about mental illness ( or as some prefer to put it , “ extreme mental states ” ) that stretches from college campuses to community health centers , from YouTube to online forums .
Two burglars who threatened a woman in her Warwickshire home called for an ambulance after she collapsed .
Police said the men kicked in the back door of the house in Watling Street , Dordon , at about 2300 BST on Monday .
However , while they were searching the house , they came across the woman who lived there .
They threatened her and she collapsed .
Officers said the men , who were white and in their late teens or 20s , then called an ambulance before fleeing .
The woman was checked by an ambulance crew and was said to be suffering from shock but was not hurt .
One burglar was described as being of stocky build and had light brown hair , the other man was shorter with a thin face and dark short hair .
Police have urged anyone with information to contact them .
Supermarkets and planning regulation
Rachel Griffith , Heike Harmgart
The UK retail sector ’s performance has been disappointing compared to the United States , where significant productivity gains are attributed to greater dynamism .
A number of analysts have blamed the UK ’s woes on planning regulation and urged liberalisation .
But the evidence presented in this column shows that the impact of planning regulation is overstated .
The retail sector has been responsible for a large share of the relatively poor performance of the European Union compared to the United States , and policy - makers and academics have focused on regulation as one potential reason .
Policy proposals such as The Services Directive aim to deregulate these markets and thus increase competition across Europe .
Recent work suggests that the adoption and use of technology was an important contributor to the US productivity acceleration of the late 1990s .
The literature emphasises the importance of entry for productivity growth in US retail , enabling the more rapid introduction of information and communication technologies ( ICT ) in newer stores and leading to reallocation from less productive to more productive stores .
1
In contrast , UK productivity growth has largely come from incumbents .
As in other EU countries , the UK retail sector has experienced relatively low productivity growth and concentrated market structure .
UK competition authorities have repeatedly investigated the supermarket industry .
Attention has focused on land use regulation as one of the root causes of this poor performance .
Previous academic work looking at the French retail sector ( Bertrand and Karamtaz 2002 ) found that regions with more restrictive planning regulation had lower levels of employment .
Do UK planning regulations inhibit entry that drives productivity growth ?
UK planning regulations
The UK reformed its planning regulations in the mid-1990s .
The new regulations severely restricted the ability of firms to build new large - scale out - of - town supermarkets .
An influential report by McKinsey ( 1998 ) highlighted these reforms to planning regulations as one of the major policy issues affecting productivity in the UK , and in response the UK has undertaken a number of reviews of the land - use planning system in England , with particular focus on the impact on productivity .
Despite this interest , there is relatively little sound empirical evidence on the impact of land use regulation .
Work commissioned by the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister ( ODPM ) has suggested that land use regulation has had a large impact on entry of new large stores , mainly by comparing entry rates before and after the reform of 1996 , as shown in Figure1 .
Before this major reform , approximately similar numbers of small and large stores were opened , while after the reforms , there was a rapid rise in the number of smaller format stores opened .
However , the problem with such a before - and - after comparison is that it does not account for other factors that may also have affected the shift towards smaller store formats - for example , other commercial and strategic reasons that UK supermarket firms may have moved into the smaller store format .
Planning regulation and market structure
In a recent paper , Griffith and Harmgart ( 2008 ) , we consider the impact that planning regulation has had on market structure in the UK supermarket industry , taking into account some of these other factors .
We show that when we do not take these other factors into account , we incorrectly attribute other contemporaneous changes to the regulatory reforms .
We use variation in the way that the regulations were implemented across local authorities to identify the effect of regulation on market outcomes .
We compare the impact of regulation across store types that were and were not affected by the regulation .
We model firms as profit maximising .
We assume consumers demand the bulk of groceries in " one- stop " and the residual in a " top - up " shop , a common way to model consumer demand in the economics literature .
We assume that firms make decisions about entry into the large store format independently of the number of small stores , whereas the decision to enter into the small store format takes the number of large stores as a given .
We think this is a realistic assumption , motivated by the one - stop versus top - up model of shopping behaviour .
We use information on the geographic concentration of economic activity in town centres in the UK to define local markets .
Our empirical estimates suggest that profits are higher in regions where there is a larger population , and that the factors that affect variable profits suggest that these are higher for larger stores ( above 15,000 square foot ) in areas with lower unemployment , further away from another town centre , with more density of office floor space .
Unsurprisingly , higher retail land values are associated with lower profits .
Large stores are more profitable in the South of England , while smaller format stores are more profitable in more working class areas .
For all stores , fixed costs are lower in the North .
Our findings show that when we do not control for these observable differences that affect fixed costs , our estimates of the effect of planning regulations is over twice as large as when we condition on these factors .
Overall we find that planning regulation did have a statistically significant impact on the number of firms operating in a region ( the market equilibrium ) , so it does represent a barrier to entry .
A one percent increase in the approval rate of planning applications has a similar magnitude of effect ( but opposite sign ) as a one percent increase in the unemployment rate .
To further quantify the economic impact of the reform , we use additional data to look at how the price of groceries vary with the planning regime .
We find that restrictive planning regimes are associated with a small but statistically significant increase in food prices .
What role has regulation had in shaping market structure ?
Our results suggest that the impact of planning regulation may have been overstated .
While it has had an impact , the overall impact seems to have been relatively small in terms of the price that consumers face .

1 While it is likely that ICT usage is higher and more effective in newer shops , it is not clear whether a market with fewer large out - of - town stores or more small in - town - stores will lead to more entry and exit .
It may also be that ICT is easier to adopt in larger out - of - town stores .

Students in public schools learn as much or more math between kindergarten and fifth grade as similar students in private schools , according to a new University of Illinois study of multi-year , longitudinal data on nearly 10,000 students .
The results of the study appear in the May issue of the influential education journal Phi Delta Kappan .
" These data provide strong , longitudinal evidence that public schools are at least as effective as private schools in boosting student achievement , " according to the authors , education professor Christopher Lubienski , doctoral student Corinna Crane and education professor Sarah Theule Lubienski .
The new study is the first published study to show that public schools are at least as effective as private schools at promoting student learning over time , they say .
Combined with other , yet - unpublished studies of the same data , which produced similar findings , " we think this effectively ends the debate about whether private schools are more effective than publics , " said Christopher Lubienski , whose research has dealt with all aspects of alternative education .
This is important , he said , because many current reforms , such as No Child Left Behind , charter schools and vouchers for private schools , are based on that assumption .
The debate essentially began three years ago with the publication in Phi Delta Kappan of a previous study by the Lubienskis , which challenged the then - common wisdom - supported by well - regarded but dated research - that private schools were superior .
In that 2005 study , they found that public school students tested higher in math than their private school peers from similar social and economic backgrounds .
In another , more - extensive study in early 2006 , they built on those findings , and also raised similar questions about charter schools .
Both studies were based on fourth - and eighth - grade test data from the National Assessment of Educational Progress ( NAEP ) .
The conclusions of the husband - and - wife team seemed " crazy radical " at the time , Sarah Lubienski said , and generated significant controversy .
They were supported , however , later in 2006 , with similar findings in U.S. Department of Education studies comparing public schools with privates and with charters , which looked at NAEP test data on both math and reading .
( Unlike literacy , math is viewed as being less dependent on a student 's home environment and more an indication of a school 's effectiveness , Sarah Lubienski said . )
Critics of these previous studies , however , have cited the lack of longitudinal data showing the possible effect over time of different types of schooling .
The studies of NAEP data were only snapshots , they said , showing student achievement at a single point in time .
The studies did not address the possibility that some students may have entered private school at a lower level of achievement .
The new study was designed , in part , to address that issue , the authors say in their PDK article .
The data for the new study came from the database produced by the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study , Kindergarten Class of 1998 - 99 ( or ECLS-K ) , administered by the National Center for Education Statistics ( NCES ) , part of the U.S. Department of Education .
The ECLS -K database includes both student achievement and comprehensive background information drawn from a nationally representative sample of more than 21,000 students , starting with their entry into kindergarten in the fall of 1998 .
The most recent data available for the U. of I. study was gathered in 2004 , in the spring of the students ' fifth - grade year .
The sample used for the study included 9,791 students in 1,531 schools ( 1,273 public , 140 Catholic and 118 other private schools ) .
To better determine the effects of attending different types of schools , the sample included only students who had stayed in the same type of school - though not necessarily the same school - throughout the years covered .
As in the previous studies , the researchers used a statistical technique known as hierarchical linear modeling to control for demographic differences between students , as well as schools .
Among the demographic variables included in looking at students were measures of socioeconomic status ; race and ethnicity ; gender ; disability ; and whether the child spoke a language other than English at home .
Among the variables included in looking at schools was the average socioeconomic level of its students , its racial or ethnic composition , and its location ( urban or rural ) .
The NAEP data had included similar information , but its quality and controls on its collection were not as strong as for ECLS -K , according to Sarah Lubienski , who studies math education and specializes in statistical research .
" It 's one reason this study feels more definitive than the NAEP studies , " she said .
After controlling for demographic differences among students and schools , the researchers ' found that public school students began kindergarten with math scores roughly equal to those of their Catholic school peers .
By fifth grade , however , they had made significantly greater gains , equal to almost an extra half year of schooling .
Part of the explanation , Sarah Lubienski said , might lie in the fact that Catholic schools have fewer certified teachers and employ fewer reform - oriented mathematics teaching practices - something they found in research for another study , accepted for publication in the American Journal of Education .
Public school students also " rivaled the performance of students in other ( non-Catholic ) private schools , " the researchers wrote .
After adjusting for demographics and initial kindergarten scores , they found that achievement gains between kindergarten and fifth grade were roughly equal .
The number of private schools in the study did not allow for drawing conclusions about other subcategories of private schools , such as Lutheran , conservative Christian or secular , Sarah Lubienski said .
In their earlier NAEP research , they found that Lutheran schools , for instance , performed on par with publics , while conservative Christian schools performed lower than all other school types .
" It is worth noting , " the researchers write in analyzing their results , " how little variation school type really accounts for in students ' growth in achievement ...
Specifically , while all of the variables in our model together explained 62 percent of the achievement differences between schools , school type alone accounted for less than 5 percent of these differences , with demographic considerations accounting for a much greater share . "
Put another way by Sarah Lubienski , " school type alone does n't explain very much of why these scores vary ... in truth , whether the school is public or private does n't seem to make that much difference . "
The researchers go on to write that they " personally see private schools as an integral part of the American system of education " and " there are many valid reasons why parents choose private schools and why policymakers may push for school choice . "
Academic achievement , however , may no longer be one of those reasons , they write .
" Claims that simply switching students from one type of school to another will result in higher scores appear to be unfounded . "
They suggest " moving away from a simple focus on school type and instead examining what happens within schools . "

At work from home ( WFH ) as it is now for some employees , laptops are electronic devices that are often used .
Will be a big problem if in conditions like this there is a damaged laptop device .
One of the damage problems that occur on laptops is the keyboard .
The keyboard can be damaged because it is used too often for typing .
When your laptop keyboard has been damaged even some buttons can not be used , you do not need to panic .
Before buying a new laptop or bringing it to a repairman , try to fix it yourself .
Here ’s how to deal with a non-functioning laptop keyboard summarized from various sources :
1. Ensuring Damage to the Laptop
Damage to a laptop keyboard can have two causes , namely software or hardware .
How to check it ?
Try to access your laptop ’s BIOS .
If you can enter and use the keyboard , then most likely there is damage to the software .
2. Clean the keyboard
If only a few keyboard keys are damaged , while the other keys are still functioning properly there may be a pile of dust on the keyboard .
To get rid of dust effectively , the most basic thing you can do is to tilt your laptop at a 75 degree angle and shake your laptop to get rid of the dust .
Another way to lift the dust , you can use masking tape between the keyboard .
Make sure the tape used is still sticky .
3. Restart the Laptop
If suddenly the entire keyboard does not respond , chances are the problem is in the software / driver .
Try restarting your laptop , maybe this is enough to fix it .
However , if it has not been resolved in this way , an error might occur so that the hardware connected to the laptop does not function as it should .
4. Restore Windows
If your keyboard stops working after installing every new application or changing settings , try restoring your Windows .
Most likely this will solve the problem .
The trick is
Click the Start menu and from there , click Control Panel
Highlight the System and Security menu option then select Back up your computer
Then click Open System Restore
After the above command is done , your laptop will automatically reboot .
If it all happened because of system damage , the keyboard should be working again .
5. Fix Keyboard Driver
Problems with non-functioning laptop keyboards ( https://www.detik.com/tag/laptop), it could also be because your keyboard driver is not up - to - date or there are destructive applications that cause the keyboard to be less responsive .
You can check in the following way
Click the Start menu and select Control Panel
In Control Panel , click System and Security and select Device manager
Select the keyboard and you will find the driver menu options below it
If you have a yellow triangle on it with an exclamation mark in it , that means there is a problem .
You should immediately update the keyboard driver on the official website of your laptop manufacturer .
6. Bring to the Official Service Center
If all the above methods you have tried and no results or not work , then the problem occurs with your laptop hardware .
You should immediately bring your laptop to the official service center so that it can be quickly repaired .
However , if the problem is quite heavy on your laptop , the cost involved is also quite expensive .
Then you need to think again to repair or buy a new device .
Cult members have emerged from the cave over recent months
The last remaining members of a Russian cult who had barricaded themselves inside a cave , waiting for the end of the world , have come out .
The eight men and a woman left the cave reportedly overcome by the stench from the bodies of two people who had died .
Thirty - five followers of self - declared prophet Pyotr Kuznetsov entered the cave , in the country 's central Penza region , last November .
They had threatened to blow themselves up if police tried to remove them .
A local official quoted by Interfax news agency said the remaining members had decided to leave because there was a " threat of poisoning from toxic corpse fumes " .
Reports of the two deaths emerged last month .
One man who left the cave on 1 April said one member had died from fasting and the other of cancer .
Prophet
Thirty - five cult members initially went into the cave , about 650 km ( 400 miles ) south - east of Moscow .
Most emerged gradually , but a few remained inside defying police pleas to leave .
The sect , who call themselves a devout splinter group of the Russian Orthodox Church , believes doomsday will occur this month .
Mr Kuznetsov , who calls himself Father Pyotr , declared himself a prophet some years ago and has attracted followers in Russia and Belarus .
He did not join his followers in the cave , and has been receiving treatment in a psychiatric clinic .
He has been charged with setting up a religious organisation associated with violence .

Bush 's ' War Crimes ' & Misdemeanors Facing a tough reelection fight in 2004 , George W. Bush expressed outrage over leaked photos showing U.S. military police at Iraq ’s Abu Ghraib prison abusing detainees , who were paraded naked before female guards , threatened by attack dogs , chained in “ stress positions ” and forced to wear ladies underpants on their heads .

Printer friendly President Bush assured the American people that he “ shared a deep disgust that those prisoners were treated the way they were treated . ”
Other administration officials pinned the blame on a “ few bad apples ” and dismissed the prison guards ’ claim that they were told to “ soften up ” the detainees for interrogation .
Now , a report by the Justice Department ’s Inspector General reveals that months before those abuses at Abu Ghraib , nearly identical tactics were used against “ war on terror ” detainees at Guantanamo Bay , Cuba , and at CIA prisons – and that FBI complaints about the tactics went up the chain of command back to Washington .
FBI agents at Guantanamo even opened a file that they labeled “ war crimes ” to document the systematic violations of the Geneva Conventions and laws against torture that they witnessed – before being told by superiors to close the file .
According to the Inspector General ’s report , the FBI protests reached the White House but went unheeded .
Instead , the prisoner abuses spread to Iraq where the Abu Ghraib prison was “ Gitmo- ized ” with the same harsh and bizarre tactics applied to Iraqi detainees .
So , the new Inspector General ’s report adds to the growing body of evidence that – in the months before Election 2004 – Bush only feigned shock about what was being done to detainees in American custody .
The evidence is now overwhelming that Bush knew of – and approved of – those violations of the rules of war and basic human decency , that the “ war crimes ” catalogued by the FBI agents could be traced to him .
In April 2008 , ABC News reported , citing unnamed sources , that during the early days of the “ war on terror , ” senior Bush aides met in what was called the Principals Committee to calibrate the level of harsh techniques that would be used against detainees .
At the time , the Principals Committee included Vice President Dick Cheney , National Security Adviser Condoleezza Rice , Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld , Secretary of State Colin Powell , CIA Director George Tenet and Attorney General John Ashcroft .
“ The high - level discussions about these ‘ enhanced interrogation techniques ’ were so detailed , these sources said , some of the interrogation sessions were almost choreographed – down to the number of times CIA agents could use a specific tactic , ” ABC News reported , adding : “ These top advisers signed off on how the CIA would interrogate top al - Qaeda suspects – whether they would be slapped , pushed , deprived of sleep or subjected to simulated drowning , called waterboarding , sources told ABC News . ”
Asked about his subordinates setting these interrogation rules , Bush told ABC News correspondent Martha Raddatz that “ yes , I 'm aware our national security team met on this issue .
And I approved . "
[ ABC News , April 11 , 2008 ] Moral Leader ?
Yet , in 2004 , by dismissing the grotesque scenes at Abu Ghraib as an aberration , Bush portrayed himself as a moral leader who was furious that some low - level American soldiers would misbehave in such a fashion .
After the photos became public , Army Sgt. Sam Provance was the only uniformed military intelligence officer at Abu Ghraib to support the guards ’ claim that the prisoner abuse was part of the “ alternative interrogation techniques ” that had made their way from Guantanamo to Abu Ghraib .
Provance , however , was punished for his candor and pushed out of the U.S. military .
The Bush administration then went ahead and pinned the blame on the MPs .
[ See Consortiumnews.com ’s “ The Ghosts of Abu Ghraib . ” ]
Eventually , 11 enlisted soldiers were convicted in courts martial .
Cpl. Charles Graner Jr. received the harshest sentence – 10 years in prison – while Lynndie England , a 22 - year - old single mother who was photographed holding an Iraqi on a leash and pointing at a detainee ’s penis , was sentenced to three years in prison .
Protected from the scandal ’s fallout , Bush was rewarded with a second term in the White House .
Later , he began to treat the Abu Ghraib case like some freak accident that the media had blown out of proportion .
At a press conference on May 25 , 2006 , Bush complained , “ We ’ve been paying for that for a long period of time . ”
However , it ’s now clear the President did n’t pay much of a personal price at all .
The more complete record now available indicates that Bush was a knowledgeable participant in the sadistic treatment of detainees , not an innocent bystander .
Indeed , on Feb. 7 , 2002 , Bush signed the key memo that cleared the way for the abuses , asserting that the Geneva Conventions ’ prohibitions against the degrading treatment of prisoners did not apply to “ unlawful combatants , ” including al - Qaeda and the Taliban , the militant Islamists who had ruled Afghanistan at the time of the 9/11 attacks .
Many casual readers missed the import of Bush ’s phrasing , which stressed that captives would be treated “ humanely and , to the extent appropriate and consistent with military necessity , in a manner consistent with the principles of Geneva . ”
The operative phrase in the memo turned out to be “ to the extent appropriate and consistent with military necessity . ”
In the Bush administration ’s view , that was a loophole you could drive a truck full of abusive tactics through .
[ For more on Bush ’s theories of presidential power , see our book , Neck Deep . ]
Fresh Evidence
The Inspector General ’s report , released May 20 , 2008 , also provides fresh evidence that senior Bush aides signed off on the harsh treatment of detainees .
In spring 2002 , when FBI agents objected to the treatment of badly wounded al - Qaeda captive Abu Zubaydah – what one agent called “ borderline torture ” – they were assured by CIA personnel “ that the procedures being used on Zubaydah had been approved ‘ at the highest levels , ’ ” the Inspector General ’s report said .
But one of the FBI agents , called “ Thomas ” in the report , still passed on his concerns to his superior , FBI Counterterrorism Assistant Director Pasquale D'Amuro , who soon pulled the FBI agents out of the interrogation .
D’Amuro , in turn , took the issue of Zubaydah ’s interrogation to FBI Director Robert Mueller ; Michael Chertoff , then Assistant Attorney General in charge of the Justice Department ’s Criminal Division ; and other senior department officials , the report said .
During a meeting with his superiors in summer 2002 , D’Amuro said he learned that the CIA had obtained a legal opinion from the Justice Department opening the door for the harsh interrogations .
That was an apparent reference to memos written by John Yoo of the Justice Department ’s Office of Legal Counsel , claiming that the President ’s commander - in - chief authority gave Bush the right to ignore laws if he deemed that necessary to protect the nation .
“ After his meeting at Chertoff 's office , [ D’ Amuro ] met with Director Mueller and recommended that the FBI not get involved in interviews in which aggressive interrogation techniques were being used , ” the Inspector General ’s report said .
“ He stated that his exact words to Mueller were ‘ we do n't do that , ’ and that someday the FBI would be called to testify and he wanted to be able to say that the FBI did not participate in this type of activity .
“ D'Amuro said that the Director agreed with his recommendation that the FBI should not participate in interviews in which these techniques were used . ”
D’Amuro said he objected to the harsh techniques because they were less effective in gleaning reliable information ; complicated later prosecutions ; violated moral standards ; and “ helped al - Qaeda in spreading negative views of the United States . ”
Up the Ladder These FBI concerns made there way up the ladder to Bush ’s National Security Council .
Mueller ’s chief of staff Daniel Levin said he attended a meeting at the NSC at which CIA techniques were discussed and an attorney from the Office of Legal Counsel [ OLC ] defended their legality .
“ Levin stated that in connection with this meeting , or immediately after it , FBI Director Mueller decided that FBI agents would not participate in interrogations involving techniques the FBI did not normally use in the United States , even though OLC had determined such techniques were legal , ” the Inspector General ’s report said .
FBI agents also crossed swords with Pentagon interrogators over similar abusive techniques instituted at Guantanamo , especially the harsh questioning of suspected 20th hijacker Mohammed al - Qahtani between Nov. 23 , 2002 , and Jan. 15 , 2003 .
During this period , military interrogators tied al - Qahtani to a dog leash and made him perform dog tricks ; repeatedly poured water over his head ; put him in painful stress positions ; questioned him for periods of 20 hours straight ; stripped him naked in front of a woman ; held him down while a female interrogator straddled him ; called his mother and sister whores ; accused him of homosexual tendencies ; made him dance with a male interrogator ; ordered him to pray to an idol shrine ; and subjected him to extreme temperatures .
At one point in December 2002 , al - Qahtani was taken to a hospital suffering from low blood pressure and low body core temperature , what one FBI agent termed hypothermia .
The FBI ’s objections to al - Qahtani ’s interrogation also were brought to the attention of senior officials in Washington , according to the Inspector General ’s report .
David Nahmias , a counsel in the Justice Department ’s Criminal Division , told the IG that he was “ fairly confident ” that department officials raised the al - Qahtani issue at a meeting of the Principals Committee .
Nahmias also said he believed Attorney General Ashcroft spoke with someone at the NSC , mostly likely NSC adviser Rice , about the FBI concerns regarding al - Qahtani .
“ When asked if anything ever happened as a result of these meetings , Nahmias said that DOJ officials were continually frustrated by their inability to get any changes or make progress with regard to the al - Qahtani matter , ” the report said .
Ashcroft , who resigned in November 2004 shortly after Bush won a second term , declined to be interviewed by the Inspector General .
Lack of Action
But the reason for a lack of action on the FBI complaints is now more obvious .
The FBI ’s evidence of “ war crimes ” went up the chain of command , all the way to the White House , the NSC and the Principals Committee – precisely where the abusive policies had been developed in the first place .
Before senior FBI officials grasped this high - level support for the mistreatment of detainees , some FBI agents were instructed to compile the evidence for a “ war crimes ” file at Guantanamo .
“ At some point in 2003 , however , ” the Inspector General ’s report said , the FBI agents at Guantanamo “ received instructions not to maintain a separate ‘ war crimes ’ file , … that investigating detainee allegations of abuse was not the FBI 's mission . ”
When the ugly reality of how the United States was treating detainees finally surfaced in spring 2004 with the Abu Ghraib photos , Bush and his top aides pretended that they were innocent parties as shocked as everyone else .
By laying the blame off on a “ few bad apples , ” Bush managed to get through the November 2004 election relatively unscathed .
And now that the truth is finally coming to the surface , it appears to be too late for him to be held accountable for “ war crimes ” and other abuses of his presidential powers .
Some members of the Democratic - controlled Congress have expressed outrage over the latest disclosures and want hearings .
But – if recent history suggests anything – it is that the Bush administration will brush aside congressional inquiries , and the Democrats , who long ago took impeachment off the table , will surrender once again .

Alarm clocks are the nemesis to blissful sleep .
Some people require more than what a normal alarm provides to yank them from dreamland .
Nobody likes to be awoken before the body wakes them up , so artificial mechanisms ( a.k.a. Alarm Clocks ) have been the method of torture to pull our tired bodies out of our warm blanket of unconsciousness .
Creative designs and gadgetry provide these following alarm clocks an advantage against your sleepiness and prevent them from getting blamed for your lateness .
Heres my top 10 :
Shocking Alarm Clock :
For the masochists out there , this clock will be the perfect method of waking you up .
A seemingly normal clock , you turn the alarm off in the conventional way but with the added bonus of a hopefully harmless , shocking electric jolt .
Yow .
Link WaterGun Alarm Clock :
For the handy people who want to wake up in a splashy mess , this DIY video provides instructions on how you can rig your typical alarm clock to wake you with a squirt from an attached watergun .
Wetness or deadly electric shock if not made properly ensues !
Link Bomb Alarm Clock :
This Japanese product provides the excitement and stress of bomb diffusers every morning upon wake up .
This alarm will sound a recorded voice 3 minutes before your wake time that the bomb will explode .
You must diffuse the clock in the correct sequence .
If you fail , a loud explosion will sound .
Fun !
Link Clocky Alarm Clock : Clocky is the father of all alarmsthatgobeyondsound .
Originally a research project at MIT by Gauri Nanda , clocky ’s design consists of a furry clock with two wheels .
This hardy alarm clock will thrust itself forward and back in a random sequence at your wake time and will hide itself in a new place in your room for you to find to deactivate .
Link Retail Version Here :

Update : Chrome Version !
Standup Wakeup Alarm Clock :
This elegant design is a alarm clock embedded in a rug .
To deactivate the alarm you must stand on the rug .
This forces you to get up and off the bed to turn the alarm off .
Unfortunately , this is only a proof of concept and not available as a product to purchase .
Link Laser Target Alarm Clock :
A likely candidate for gamers , this alarm has a target which you must shoot with a laser gun .
The aim and concentration requires you to fully wake up .
Link Kuku Alarm Clock : shaped roughly as a chicken , the alarm triggers the clock to ‘ lay ’ 5 tiny eggs into a basket .
To stop the alarm you have to insert the eggs back into the clock one by one .
( When you think about it , thats somewhat weird , to shove the eggs back into a chicken who just laid it )
Link Broken Sfera Alarm Clock :
This alarm clock hangs from your ceiling .
When the alarm goes off , you reach up and touch the clock to set the snooze which then retracts the alarm clock closer to the ceiling .
After a while , you ’re going to have to get up to turn the alarm off .
Link Jigsaw Puzzle Alarm Clock : Like that childhood favorite Perfection , the alarm pops out 4 jigsaw pieces from the top and can only be stopped by finding the pieces that scattered around the clock and refit the puzzle .
Similar to Puzzle
Link Blowfly Alarm Clock :
This alarm has a helicopter like device that takes off from the base .
Your job is to catch or find the flying rotors and place it back on the clock base to stop the alarm .
If the excitement of the search does n’t wake you , the cutting blades severing your fingers will .

Honorable Mentions : ( a.k.a. all others that I find on the Interwebs )
With creative engineering , there are always solutions to any problem .
Its man vs machine , I ’m sure each of these devices could be conquered in the name of sleep , but at least provides challenges to our dreaded morning ritual , waking up .
Do you know of any others ?
What are your creative methods of waking up ?

Hillary Sinks with the ' Kitchen Sink ' Ever since George H.W. Bush went into “ campaign mode ” in 1988 and exploited black convict Willie Horton to dirty up Michael Dukakis , it ’s been a staple of modern politics that you can negate your own high negatives by driving up those of your opponent .

Printer friendly Except in 1992 , when the “ Passportgate ” scheme for demeaning Bill Clinton ’s patriotism blew up in Poppy Bush ’s face , some effective smear has been associated with every Bush national campaign .
Think of John McCain ’s “ black child , ” Al Gore ’s “ delusions ” and the Swift Boat lies about John Kerry ’s heroism .
Indeed , dirty politics has been a hallmark of the Bush Family Dynasty – and Bill and Hillary Clinton clearly were taking notes .
[ For details on the Bush schemes , see Secrecy & Privilege and Neck Deep . ]
So , perhaps it should have been expected that Hillary Clinton would borrow the Bush family ’s playbook when her presidential campaign prepared to throw “ the kitchen sink ” at Barack Obama .
Sen .
Clinton , who has long suffered from high negatives , needed to boost up those numbers for the Illinois senator .
Sadly for the Clinton campaign , however , the strategy appears to be backfiring .
Though the coordinated attacks against Obama ’s character and judgment may have damaged him some , a new poll shows that Sen.
Clinton may have hurt herself more .
“ Both Democrats , and especially New York 's Sen. Clinton , are showing wounds from their prolonged and increasingly bitter nomination contest , which could weaken the ultimate nominee for the general - election showdown against Sen. McCain of Arizona , ” the Wall Street Journal reported .
“ Even among women , who are the base of Sen.
Clinton 's support , she now is viewed negatively by more voters than positively for the first time in a Journal / NBC poll . ”
[ WSJ , March 27 , 2008 ]
In a Journal / NBC poll just two weeks ago , Clinton was in positive numbers with voters overall , 45 percent to 43 percent .
However , in the new poll , Clinton ’s overall negatives rose to 48 percent and her positives sank to 37 percent .
Even more stunning , Clinton is now drawing a net - negative rating among women , with 44 percent of women having a negative impression of Clinton versus 42 percent with a positive view .
Two weeks ago , 51 percent of women had a positive opinion of Clinton .
Clinton also is sinking among white voters , who view her negatively by 51 to 34 percent .
Obama has slipped , too , with white voters , down five points , but he still gets a net positive rating of 42 to 37 percent .
Among all voters , Obama is rated positively by 49 to 32 percent , roughly parallel to Republican John McCain , who registered a 45 to 25 percent positive rating .
The bottom line for Sen.
Clinton may be that in throwing the “ kitchen sink ” at Obama , she did n’t realize that it was tied to her ankle .

LONDON ( Reuters ) - Richard Burton had no doubt that “ God put me on this earth to raise hell . ”
Peter O' Toole was awarded an honorary Oscar for lifetime acheivement during the 75th Annual Academy Awards at the Kodak Theatre in Hollywood , California , March 23 , 2003 .
OSCARSPLUS REUTERS / Lucy Nichols
For Peter O’Toole
“ Booze is the most outrageous of drugs which is why I chose it . ”
Richard Harris “ loved the excitement of my drinking days .
Life is made from memories which is a pity as I do n’t remember much . ”
Oliver Reed readily admitted “ I do not live in the world of sobriety . ”
Critics might argue that this quartet of larger - than - life actors squandered their talent in far too many appalling movies because they were too busy chasing their drinking demons .
Not so says author Robert Sellers in “ Hellraisers : The Life and Inebriated Times of Richard Burton , Richard Harris , Peter O’Toole and Oliver Reed . ”
“ They got away with the kind of behavior that today ’s vapid bunch of film stars could scarcely dream of because of their mercurial acting talent and because the press and public loved them , ” he writes in the book , being published on May 29 .
He hailed “ four extraordinary lives lived extraordinarily . ”
Richard Harris , star of “ Camelot ” and “ This Sporting Life ” along with some real stinkers , reveled like the others in living life to the full .
“ Look at a photograph of me from the old days and I ’m going to one of my film premieres with a bottle of vodka in my hand .
Tom Cruise has a bottle of Evian water .
That ’s the difference , ” the outlandish Irishman once recalled .
When drunk , he would rush into traffic and attack passing cars with his bare fists .
He once threw a wardrobe at his wife .
O’Toole , who soared to fame in “ Lawrence of Arabia , ” once beat up a policeman after seeing some of his colleagues rough up a prostitute .
Burton twice faced angry husbands brandishing guns after he had seduced their wives .
Reed got the juvenile cast of the musical “ Oliver ” drunk after spiking the children ’s drinks with vodka .
But , as the book so tellingly relates , non -stop debauchery inevitably took its toll -- even with a fitting final curtain .
Burton , a great classical actor who opted instead for the lure of Hollywood and the tempestuous charms of “ Cleopatra ” star Elizabeth Taylor , died of a cerebral hemorrhage .
He had jotted down as his own epitaph a line from Shakespeare ’s The Tempest : “ Our revels now are ended . ”
Reed , on the point of reviving his flagging career with a screen - stealing performance in “ Gladiator , ” keeled over and died after arm - wrestling a bunch of sailors in a pub in Malta .
Harris , whose last claim to film fame was as teenage wizard Harry Potter ’s headmaster , was given the perfect send - off by one of his sons in the morgue -- he dipped his fingers into a pint of Guinness stout and wetted his dead father ’s lips with it .
So that just leaves O’Toole as the last one standing -- without an ounce of regret .
“ I loved the drinking and the waking up in the morning and finding I was in Mexico .
It was part and parcel of being an idiot , ” he concluded .

A council that used controversial powers to spy on a family to check whether they were living in the correct school catchment area has done the same to keep an eye on local fishermen , it emerged yesterday .
Poole borough council is using the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act ( Ripa ) - a law brought in to combat terrorism and cyber crime - to scrutinise people gathering shellfish .
The Dorset harbour has valuable populations of cockles , oysters , mussels and clams .
Officials used the controversial law to make sure stocks were not being harmed or taken from banned areas .
Human rights campaigners said the revelations , which the council released under the Freedom of Information Act , illustrated why the Ripa law should be reformed .
Shami Chakrabarti , director of Liberty , said : " You do not use a sledgehammer to crack a nut .
You can care about serious crime and terrorism without throwing away our personal privacy .
" The law must be reformed to require ' sign - off ' by judges , not self - authorisation by over - zealous bureaucrats . "
Last month the council admitted spying on a family to check they were living in the correct school catchment area .
Jenny Paton , 39 , Tim Joyce , 37 , and their three daughters had their movements scrutinised and timed by an undercover official .
A detailed log of the family 's activities was kept with statements including " curtains open and all lights on in premises " , but no action was taken against them .
Since then it has emerged that councils are using the powers for a variety of offences , such as littering or dogs fouling pavements .
Some local authorities have used the act more than 100 times in the last 12 months to conduct surveillance , mainly against people suspected of being linked to rogue trading , benefit fraud and antisocial behaviour involving criminal damage .
Poole and other councils have argued that the act is not simply intended to target very serious criminals and terrorists .
According to the Home Office , the act " legislates for using methods of surveillance and information gathering to help the prevention of crime , including terrorism " .
Poole said it had used the act 17 times since 2005 .
In March of that year , it used the law to " ascertain which person caused damage to a barrier " .
In September 2006 , Poole used it again to " identify persons continually vandalising door entry systems to ground floor flats " .
In addition , the council used the powers to try to find out who was stealing from a tip and to monitor a property from which it thought drugs were being dealt .
On four occasions the powers were used to see if fishermen were gathering shellfish from a prohibited area in Poole harbour .
Council officials have said the surveillance lasted on average for two weeks for the purpose of " preventing or detecting crime or for preventing disorder " .
Tim Martin , head of legal and democratic services at the council , said : " Illegal shellfish dredging can cause harm to the conservation of stocks in the harbour and could also lead to a potentially serious public health risk if illegally fished stock is not fit for consumption . "

Gershom Gorenberg writes :
But Jews should be joining Catholics on this one .
If McCain were as pro-Israel as Hagee says he is , the candidate would want nothing to do with Hagee .
You do n’t back a democracy by siding with someone who regards a handgun as the means to change policy .
There is a certain dissonance between supporting a country and giving theological justifications for the murder of its elected leader .
We do n’t even have to talk about Hagee 's earnest hopes for war on Israeli soil , or his classic theological delegitimization of Judaism .
I completely agree , but of course it does n't seem like it 's going to be in the cards .
It was about a year ago today that I found myself wondering why AIPAC was putting Hagee on a panel described as " Two eloquent voices from diverse backgrounds explore the history of U.S. involvement in the Middle East and how Americans from all faiths can find common cause in supporting Israel . "
It 's certainly true that Hagee 's group , Christians United for Israel , shows that Americans can support Israel for all sorts of reasons , ranging from concern for the welfare of the Jewish people to a desire to see Israel conquered by a Russo - Arab alliance in order to hasten the End Times , but sometimes the whole " big tent " concept can go too far .
Presumably what 's happening is that we have a lot of snobs among the leaders of American Jewry who figure they can use and manipulate rednecks like Hagee .
And maybe so .
Still , it seems to me that in a country where we 're a tiny minority group , it makes a lot more sense for American Jews to build alliances with non-Jews who are n't aiming at our short - term destruction .

Mr Charest said the crucifix will remain in Quebec 's parliament
The government of the Canadian province of Quebec has rejected a proposal to remove a crucifix from above the speaker 's chair in the parliament .
Quebec Premier Jean Charest said the crucifix was related to 350 years of history that could not be erased .
The proposal was made in a report into how Quebec 's French - Canadian - and traditionally Roman Catholic - population can accommodate minorities .
The report was commissioned to address a perceived identity crisis in Quebec .
' Reasonable accommodation ' Quebec has struggled in recent years as the birth rate of its white , French - Canadian population has fallen and immigration - much of it from Asia and the Middle East - has increased .
Philosopher Charles Taylor and sociologist Gerard Bouchard held months of public hearings across the province last year to hear the views of Quebecers on what they called the " reasonable accommodation " of minorities .
The crucifix is about 350 years of history in Quebec that none of are ever going to erase , and of a very strong presence , in particular of the Catholic Church
Jean Charest , Quebec Premier Premier Charest launched the commission after a number of controversies involving immigrants and minority groups .
A YMCA in central Montreal - Quebec 's largest city - was criticised for frosting windows so that Jewish students at a seminary across the street would not be able to see scantily - clad exercisers .
Most notably , the small town of Herouxville banned the stoning of women and the wearing of facial coverings despite having few minorities among its 1,300 residents .
The Bouchard - Taylor report recommends that the government take steps to ensure that immigrants embrace Western values and learn French and that francophones - about 80 % of Quebec 's population - help immigrants integrate .
But Premier Charest drew the line at removing the crucifix from the provincial parliament in order to emphasise the government 's secular nature .
" We cannot erase our history , " said Mr Charest .
" The crucifix is about 350 years of history in Quebec that none of are ever going to erase , and of a very strong presence , in particular of the Catholic Church . "
The church was very influential in Quebec society until the 1960s , but its dominance has waned since then .

What are these ?
twisted.web.server ,
If you 're not already familiar with Subtext , you should probably watch this video to learn about it .
I 'm not a big fan of the Subtext programming model .
But it does convey one idea that I really , really like ..
This is a very powerful idea , and I think it 's a pity that it has n't really caught on .
Most programmers subscribe to the idea of model / view separation ; this phrase has especially come back into vogue with the popularity of systems like Django and Rails .
But programmers are only a fan of this as far as it comes to " end-user " applications .
For our own tools , rigidly gluing the model to the view ( and both the model and the view to the persistence format , execution model , and innumerable other details ) is the order of the day .
Indeed , Python 's own popularity is due in large part to the relative beauty of its syntax .
One of the problems this causes is a language gap .
Guido mentioned this in his Py3K talk : different programming communities are already choosing identifiers based on their natural languages .
The conflation of real - names and binding - names also creates a more subtle problem in Python : when you want to deprecate a name , let 's say , you have to choose another name — probably one which is n't as good .
If the binding name were , as in Subtext , an internal identifier rather than the user interface accessible to everyone , this would be an easier thing to do .
For that matter , a large part of the Py3 K effort itself is a change to Python 's user interface ; if Python were an interactive program with a separated model and view , it would be much easier to change this without changing everyone 's code at the same time .
IDEs like PyDev for Eclipse and Wing IDE do n't really address the problem of " program as bag of bytes " .
They provide tools , it 's true , but those tools still treat a program as semi-structured information .
One of the things you do most frequently in an IDE like this is type some code , which at least temporarily puts your program into a totally invalid state .
As you 're typing " def " , your module is syntactically invalid .
Once you 've finished adding arguments , and a docstring or method body it 's valid again , but only until you make your next change .
If you 're using a tool to edit somethingthan a program , like , say , Inkscape , as you move between different states in your drawing ( add a line , change a gradient , resize a shape ) each one is a valid SVG document if you were to save it .
This is one of the reasons that I do n't really use IDEs ; despite their features , the core of the experience is still hammering away on a bunch of text files , and for that , it ishard to beat Emacs IDEs are n't the only tools which could benefit from a truly structured interpretation of code .
Version control systems , for example , could benefit immensely by having higher level operations .
How often do you really want to know " who changed this line of code last " ?
I do n't know about you , but personally , I want to ask questions like " when was this method defined " and " was it ever moved from another module " .
These questions are difficult or impossible to ask of modern version control systems ( even the really good ones ) .
Another issue with programs being effectively unstructured is that they 're not discoverable .
If you want to draw a line in Inkscape , you do n't need to look up the SVG syntax for drawing a line ; you can just hunt around for the " line " button .
This is especially important for students , who frequently forget basic things like " how do you define a method " or " what does it mean when a function is outside a class " while learning .
Squeak addresses this problem , somewhat : there 's still a lot of text floating around , but your program itself is a bunch of objects you can look at One of my perpetual second week project s is to make an IDE that understands Python as the serialization format of a graph of objects — modules , classes , and functions — rather than text .
This could work on existing Python programs , and it would n't need to introduce any wacky new programming paradigms in order to do it : simply treat Python as a runtime and a serialization format , and parse / serialize Python code as if it were any other type of data , like Inkscape does for SVG .
Since I 'm never realistically going to do it , does anyone else want to ?
Has somebody else done it already ?
Trump and his envoys have trashed Europe 's confidence in the US .
The damage might be irreparable
The grand myth of environmentalism is that it 's all about saving the Earth .
It 's not .
The Earth will be just fine .
Environmentalism is all about saving ourselves .
That may seem a bit counter - intuitive ; after all , the Earth is certainly central to the rhetoric , the memetics of environmentalism .
Most environmental discussions focus on ecological dynamics , with references to human beings typically limited to enumerations of the various insults we 've visited upon the planet .
Given the degree of culpability we bear for the current state of the planet , this is entirely appropriate .
But the rhetorical focus of environmentalism on the planet obscures the fact that what human beings have done to the Earth pales in comparison to past disasters hitting our world , from massive asteroid strikes to super - volcano eruptions killing off 90 + % of the Earth 's species .
In fact , over the course of our planet 's lifespan it 's experienced every form of ( non- human - engineered ) apocalypse on the Eschatological Taxonomy up to Class IV -- in comparison , humans have yet to unleash even a Class 0 Apocalypse .
And in every case , the Earth has recovered , and life has once again flourished .
We sometimes make the conceptual mistake of thinking that the way the Earth 's ecosystem is today is the way it will forever be , that we 've somehow reached an ecological end - state .
But even in an eco-conscious world , or one devoid of humans entirely , natural processes from evolution to geophysical and solar cycles would continue .
The Earth 's been at this for a long time , literally billions of years ; from a planetary perspective , a quadrupling of atmospheric carbon lasting 10,000 years ( for example ) is little more than a passing blip .
The fact of the matter is that , no matter how much greenhouse gas we pump into the atmosphere or how many toxins we dump into the soil and oceans , given enough time the Earth will recover .
But human civilization is far more fragile .
Human civilization could not withstand and recover from the same kinds of assaults the planet itself has shrugged off in eons past .
We remain entirely dependent upon myriad Earth services and systems , from topsoil and clean water to carbon cycles and biodiversity .
Activities that undermine those critical services and systems quite literally threaten the survival of human civilization .
The fundamental resilience of the Earth 's geophysical systems simply means that , when we ignore our effects on the planet , we 're simply making ourselves disposable , just another passing blip in the planet 's long history .
In trying to minimize the harmful impacts of human activities upon the global ecosystem , environmentalism supports the continued healthy existence of humankind .
To me , this too is entirely appropriate .
Despite its many flaws , I 'm a big fan of human civilization .
I marvel at our capacity to organize matter and information , at our ability to learn from mistakes and pass that learning down to subsequent generations .
Civilization -- writing , cities , trade , the whole lot of it -- makes us unique on this planet and , as far as we can tell so far , in our part of the universe .
Destroying that through malice or negligence is the worst form of crime , and the height of tragedy .
Part of a focus upon civilization , however , is the recognition that we do not exist in isolation , that we are dependent upon an enormous variety of complex systems .
As a result , our continued existence requires the continued success of those systems .
In order to save ourselves , we have to minimize actions which damage and disrupt the environment .
Like any social movement , environmentalists argue over tactics and goals , and some eco-activists will disagree with my characterization of the purpose of environmentalism .
But the reality is that -- at least with current technologies -- there 's nothing that we can do to truly put the planetary biosphere at existential risk .
It will recover from what we now do , albeit in a different form than today .
But what we can do is so violate the integrity of the planet 's ecosystem that the Earth can no longer support us .
Critics of environmentalism often claim that eco-activists hate humans , that we value the Earth more than we value ourselves .
With very few exceptions , nothing could be further from the truth .
Environmentalism is fundamentally about making sure that human beings , and human civilization , can continue to thrive on our home planet for centuries , millennia to come .
Environmentalism , in its demands for respect for nature , ultimately demands that we respect ourselves .
Happy Earth Day -- and Happy Civilization Day .

Global Cooling ?
[ 1998-2005 data shows cooling trend ]
ACUF ^ | 6/24/6 | Dennis Avery
Posted on by ZGuy
The official thermometers at the U.S. National Climate Data Center show a slight global cooling trend over the last seven years , from 1998 to 2005 .
Actually , global warming is likely to continue but the interruption of the recent strong warming trend sharply undercuts the argument that our global warming is an urgent , man -made emergency .
The seven - year decline makes our warming look much more like the moderate , erratic warming to be expected when the planet naturally shifts from a Little Ice Age ( 1300  1850 AD ) to a centuries - long warm phase like the Medieval Warming ( 950 1300 AD ) or the Roman Warming ( 200 BC  600 AD ) .
The stutter in the temperature rise should rein in some of the more apoplectic cries of panic over man-made greenhouse emissions .
The strong 28 - year upward trend of 1970 1998 has apparently ended .
Fred Singer , a well - known skeptic on man-made warming , points out that the latest cooling trend is dictated primarily by a very warm El Nino year in 1998 .
 When you start your graph with 1998 ,  he says ,  you will necessarily get a cooling trend . 
Bob Carter , a paleoclimatologist from Australia , notes that the earth also had strong global warming between 1918 and 1940 .
Then there was a long cooling period from 1940 to 1965 .
He points out that the current warming started 50 years before cars and industries began spewing consequential amounts of CO2 .
Then the planet cooled for 35 years just after the CO2 levels really began to surge .
In fact , says Carter , there doesnt seem to be much correlation between temperatures and man-made CO2 .
For context , Carter offers a quick review of earths last 6 million years .
The planet began that period with 3 million years in which the climate was several degrees warmer than today .
Then came 3 million years in which the planet was basically cooling , accompanied by an increase in the magnitude and regularity of the earths 1500 - year Dansgaard - Oeschger climate cycles .
Speaking of the 1500 - year climate cycles , grab an Internet peek at the earths official temperatures since 1850 .
They describe a long , gentle S - curve , with the below - mean temperatures of the Little Ice Age gradually giving way to the above - the - mean temperatures we should expect during a Modern Warming .
Carter points out that since the early 1990s , the First Worlds media have featured an increasing stream of alarmist letters and articles on hypothetical , human - caused climate change .
Each such alarmist article is larded with words such as if ,  might ,  could ,  probably ,  perhaps ,  expected ,  projected  or modeled  and many . . . are akin to nonsense .
Carter also warns that global cooling not likely for some centuries yet is likely to be far harsher for humans than the Modern Warming .
He says , our modern societies have developed during the last 10,000 years of benignly warm , interglacial climate .
But for more than 90 percent of the last 2 million years , the climate has been colder , and generally much colder , than today .
The reality of the climate record is that a sudden natural cooling is more to be feared , and will do infinitely more social and economic damage , than the late 20th century phase of gentle warming . 
Since the earth is always warming or cooling , lets applaud the Modern Warming , and hope that the next ice age is a long time coming .

This can't be true .
Why , 19 " leading climatologists " just told USA Today that Algore 's movie is 100 % correct , except for the part where he gets the Antarctic and Greenland ice sheets mixed up .

Interesting .
We arrived in the Frozen North in late June of 1986 , and on Independence Day it was over 100 degrees .
I had to take my youngest daughter home with heat exhaustion .
The following summer was similar .
Since the early 90s temps have noticeably cooled , to the point where so far this summer the temps have averaged in the mid to upper 60s and have only occasionally gone into the 70s .
Furthermore , in this officially semiarid region , it it 's not raining or showering , it 's smoking ( forest fires ) .
Something to think about , just for the record .

One thing I 've found effective is to challenge " Goreian " global - warming chicken - littles to put their money where their mouth is .
Gore bought " Certified Emission Reduction Credits " to make his air travel promoting his slide show and movie " carbon neutral " .
Tell anyone who insists that this is a crisis and that we have to " do something " ; that they can copy Gore ; and refer them to the " Survey of Offset Services " at this site :
http://www.freerepublic.com/perl/post?id=1658580%2C1
The price of these " offsets " is about what we would be paying Russia , etc. under Kyoto .
Tell them to " put up or shut up " .
Most wo n't put up ( or shut up either , unfortunately ) -- those who do are deluded ; but , at least they gain my respect for demonstrating their sincerity .
I do n't care if they waste their money -- just so long as they do n't force me to waste my money too ( as Kyoto would have done ) .
It 's almost impossible to have a reasoned debate on this topic ; since it 's become a presumed " moral " issue , and also is shaping up to be a wedge issue for the U.S. Presidential election .

The American presidential election is rapidly drawing near .
The race is becoming more intense and the field of candidates has narrowed to such that a detailed look at each of their platforms makes sense .
The focus of this article is on Barack Obama , one of the leading contenders for the Democratic Party ’s nomination .
Of primary interest for traders in the forex markets is his economic policy , though there is significant overlap between his positions on taxes , trade , and the economy .
In addition , his proposed health plan and energy plan , for example , both carry important economic implications , and hence should be considered within the context of how his presidency would bear on the US economy .
Since his platform is broad , complex , and often nuanced , we have distilled it into ten more manageable subdivisions , which are laid out below .
Increased Tax Equity : Mr. Obama ’s tax policy typifies the liberal stance of his party , favoring a system that is equitable and progressive , above all else .
The core component of is tax policy would bring tax relief to the middle - class .
Whether he would pay for this " relief " through a tax increase on the upper class or through budget cuts is uncertain .
It will not be financed through a bond issue ( increase in government debt ) , as he has pledged to balance the budget .
[ More on this below ] .
In addition , Mr. Obama has pledged to eliminate so - called " tax havens " for the wealthy and loopholes in the tax code exploited by special interest groups .
It is expected that this increase in tax revenues will partially offset the middle class tax cut .
How Mr. Obama ’s tax policy would impact economic growth defies prediction .
Subscribers to the infamous " Laffer Curve " would argue that a fall in middle - class tax rates would theoretically increase unemployment and hence , increase government tax revenues .
However , since America ’s wealthy contribute a disproportionately large share to the coffers of the Federal government , a tax increase on the rich could theoretically lead to a decline in government tax receipts .
This idea remains controversial , and most politicians conveniently err on the side of the argument that is consistent with their politics .
This lack of clarity means it ’s inappropriate to comment definitively in this article .
Fair Trade : Barack Obama ’s trade policy eschews both protectionism and unbridled globalization in favor of the more fashionable " fair trade . "
Insofar as trade is conducted fairly , he is an advocate .
On the other hand , when governments are belived to use unfair tactics , such as subsidies , dumping , and exchange rate manipulation , he favors countervailing efforts to block such trade .
For example , he has vocally argued that the perceived undervaluation of the Chinese Yuan represents an indirect subsidy for Chinese exporters , and he favors legislation that would " equalize " the playing field .
In addition , Mr. Obama supports an increase in America ’s domestic manufacturing sector and a consequent increase in employment .
As with some of his other policies , he has been vague on how this would be achieved , whether through subsidies or tariffs , or a less conventional method .
Finally , Mr. Obama supports energy independence , which basically translates into less reliance on foreign oil and gas producers .
In its entirety , this loosely sketched trade policy represents a significant break with the unapologetic free - trade stance of the current Bush administration .
While it is doubtful that many of these measures could be implemented , the trade imbalance could be singlehandedly reversed by a decrease in energy imports , which represents an estimated 35 % of the total deficit .
Classical economic theory dictates that in order to correct a trade imbalance , a nation ’s currency must depreciate proportionately .
If this theory is applied to the US , a shrunken trade deficit achieved by an Obama presidency should stem the multi- year decline in the Dollar .
Employment Versus Growth : Mr. Obama ’s criticisms of the Bush Administration ’s economic policy have centered around the " jobless recovery , " whereby America ’s economy enjoyed strong growth while the unemployment rate hardly budged .
Accordingly , Mr Obama would prioritize employment over economic growth .
Since free - trade is theorized to maximize growth , Mr. Obama ’s " fair trade " policies could come at the expense of efficiency , and hence GDP growth .
On the other hand , he supports rural investment , increased access to capital among minorities and the poor , and improvements in the nation ’s transportation infrastructure .
All of these measures are consistent with both employment and growth .
In addition , his support for renewable energy , innovation ( via an R&D tax credit ) , and a greater emphasis on math and science education , aim to cement America ’s status as the world ’s leader in technology and innovation .
The current flow of capital and labor ( albeit not always ideas ) favors developing countries , so Mr. Obama ’s proposals are somewhat against the grain .
The payout for the US economy could be large but it could also be costly .
Support for the environment :
One of the recurring themes of Mr. Obama ’s campaign is support for the environment .
While environmentalists have delighted in promises of marine and forestry preservation , the direct economic implications are less cut - and - dried .
It has long been argued that economic growth and concern for the environment are diametrically opposed .
This notion is certainly belied by the boom in alternative energy , which is supported by Obama .
In addition , Obama ’s proposed cap on carbon emissions could force businesses to become more efficient .
However , it could also come at the expense of output , as corporations curtail production to be meet more stringent environmental standards .
Finally , Mr. Obama is a staunch proponent of ethanol , part and parcel to his pursuit of energy independence .
While this directly benefits the US economy , it has also been shown to increase food prices as land is diverted from food production to energy production .
Thus , while GDP would increase and the US would likely receive more foreign capital , the purchasing power of US consumers as well as the value of the Dollar would be eroded .
Expansion of Home Ownership : Barack Obama has promised to make home ownership both easier and more affordable , especially for poor families .
Unfortunately , one of the byproducts of the current expansion of such housing has been the subprime lending crisis , one of the primary causes of the economic downturn .
Of course , Mr. Obama has also pledged to crack down on so - called “ predatory lending , ” in which complex mortgage products with artificially low interest rates are used to lure unsuspecting borrowers .
Skepticism of Business Establishment :
While not stated explicitly in his platform , Mr. Obama is generally opposed to “ big business . ”
He has pledged to rein in predatory lending through increased regulation of mortgage companies .
He uses hostile language to describe healthcare insurance companies and managed care organizations , which he views as part and parcel of the never - ending rise in healthcare costs .
In addition , he will fight special interest lobbies generally , and the mortgage lobby specifically by making it easier for individuals to declare bankruptcy .
Currently , there is a loophole which exempts certain obligations ( namely mortgage payments ) from re-negotiation during bankruptcy , and presumably this would be modified .
Then there is his concern about M&A between large companies , which he perceives as anti-competitive and limiting of consumer choice .
The icing on the cake will take the form of an investigation of conflicts of interest on Wall Street , where consolidation has created situations where pre-existing client relationships can compromise objectivity .
In short , the the business establishment is dreading an Obama presidency , with its strict regulatory climate and consumer protections .
Some analysts believe that the stock market performs better under Republican presidents because of the perceived friendliness with Wall Street , but ultimately economic factors will predominate , and good investors do n’t put too much stock in the President ’s ability to sway the markets .
Support for small businesses :
It may come as a shock to those who have grown accustomed to the handful of large corporations dominating the business landscape that the brunt of the US economy is powered by small businesses .
In fact , one of the few positions Mr. Obama shares with President Bush is his support for small businesses .
Accordingly , he will use a combination of tax relief and healthcare subsidies to facilitate growth in this vital sector of the economy .
The healthcare subsidies will take the form of direct reimbursement for healthcare benefits paid by small businesses , many of whom are struggling to provide health insurance for their employees .
This could prove difficult to implement because of the tremendous costs involved , and would need to be offset by cuts in other areas of the budget .
Labor Equity : Unions remain a bastion of the Democratic Party , and a large source of conflict with the Republican Party .
To his credit , Mr. Obama ’s position is somewhat more nuanced than that of his Party .
He supports a broad spectrum of labor rights , including enhanced protections for the right to unionize and promoting a work - life balance , perhaps by expanding the Family & Medical Leave Act which was signed into law during the Clinton administration .
His final goal of a higher Federal minimum wage has been largely preempted by individual states , which have taken much initiative in this regard .
Labor rights are similar to environmental protections in that both are seen as antithetical to economic growth .
Free - market economists are typically opposed to unions and wage floors because they necessitate wages higher than what the market would otherwise pay .
Accordingly , Mr. Obama ’s position represents a sop to the fear of cheap foreign labor ( whether immigrants or workers abroad ) percolating in the working class .
This jives with his fair - trade policy , which would prioritize domestic employment over efficiency .
Foreign Policy : Mr. Obama ’s foreign policy would be decidedly less aggressive than that of the Bush administration .
He favors soft power , in the form of diplomacy and foreign aid , over the hard power of a strong military .
Controversially , he has volunteered to meet with all foreign heads of state without any prerequisites .
At the same time , he has also pledged to continue expanding the military , both in terms of manpower and technology .
The economic implications of foreign policy cannot be overstated .
Due in part to the ongoing wars in Iraq and Afghanistan , it now costs the US government an estimated $ 1 Trillion per year to conduct its foreign policy .
In addition , it has been estimated that the total costs of the war in Iraq could exceed $ 3 Trillion by the time the US has successfully extricated itself .
The majority of this outlay will be financed by debt .
Thus , a Barack Obama presidency can be expected to increase the budget of the defense department but decrease discretionary military spending .
In addition , the US maintains embargoes and / or limits trade with certain nations for political reasons , which could also change if Mr. Obama was elected .
Finally , the price of oil is connected with geopolitical events .
This is exacerbated by the fact that a significant portion of the world ’s oil is controlled by regimes that are viewed as hostile by the US .
This is reflected in the significant risk premium ( estimated by some analysts at $ 20 per barrel ) currently built into the price of oil .
Improved relations with these governments ( Venezuela , Iran , Nigeria ) could lead to a reduction in the price of oil .
Fiscal Discipline : From an economic standpoint , fiscal policy represents a natural segue way from foreign policy , because it is among the largest components of the Federal budget .
Mr. Obama has pledged to restore fiscal discipline by curtailing earmarks and re-introducing a system of PAYGO into the budgeting process , whereby spending increases must be simultaneously offset before they can be approved .
Social security will be shored - up , and further reinforced through incentives to save for retirement .
Lower medicare costs will be obtained through negotiations with healthcare insurance and pharmaceutical companies .
Overall , the goal is modest one : a balanced budget .
An impressive agenda , to be sure , but Mr. Obama ’s senatorial record on fiscal policy is mixed .
On the one hand , he spearheaded ethics reform legislation to cut Congressional waste and only designates earmarks for public projects .
On the other hand , he voted against using the Program Assessment Rating Tool ( PART ) to pay down the Federal deficit by automatically reducing spending on programs deemed ineffective .
He has also voted against cuts in entitlement spending and agriculture subsidies .
Thus , if Mr. Obama has any real intention of reducing the national debt , or at least of balancing the budget , he may have to break with his Party .

Cellulite hell : Mischa is clearly having issues with cellulite despite her youth as the back of her thighs are very dimpled
Host : Mischa was in Australia on presenting duties at the MTV Awards
Smoker Mischa is not often seen without a packet of cigarettes which may provide a clue as to why the young actress should be blighted by the stubborn fat .
The nasty habit is one of the reasons that can be attributed to the premature emergence of her cellulite .
Mischa was staying at the uber - luxurious Qualia Resort on Hamilton Island with her mother Nuala after flying over to attend the MTV Music Awards .
She told an Australian newspaper : " I went jet skiing and scuba diving and saw some beautiful coral .
" I have n't had a vacation in a long time so I just laid out and relaxed - it 's just been the two of us with our own pool .
" Real mother - daughter time . "
However , there were reports that MTV was disappointed with her " lacklustre " presence .
And she was understandably upset .
She said : " That 's wild .
I was asked to present and do a half - day of press and phoners and I did that .
" I was just quiet because I was chilled .
" I went to quiet dinners in Sydney so I could meet people and experience the city .
" I really like it here . "
So what ?

I am sitting in a coffee shop this morning breathing a sigh of relief .
After almost 5 years of blogging , I am done .
This past year , my heart just has n’t been into it , and I think that is reflected in the lackluster posting compared to previous years .
I had a contract to fulfill with Creative Weblogging , and it ends today .
Over the next few days , you will see many many changes in this blog .
A new design , some new writers , and an overall change in the attitude and approach of the site .
Pick up the feed because it will be worth your while .
Five years ago I was 26 years old and I was working as a digital design engineer in Florida .
Now I am 31 , living in Louisville , KY , and have my first child on the way any day now .
My work is probably best described as building a web platform for local media companies under the assumption that the web is going more local , and consulting part - time to pay the bills .
Sometimes when I look back on the past 5 years , I am amazed at how much I ’ve been through , and how much of it has been public – published right here .
I have asked the new owner to give me a login to the new Businesspundit , so that I can come post here and there when I feel like I have something to say and want to get it out to a larger audience ( as opposed to the 30 visitors a day I get at my new blog ) .
The grind of writing every day has become boring , and I just want the chance to do more research and write less often , but with better insight and supporting evidence .
Five years ago , my views on business were very very different than they are today .
So I thought for an appropriate last post , I would examine the top 10 things about business that I view differently than I did 5 years ago .
I am not saying these are gospel , or even that they are correct .
I think absolutism is a sign of closed mindedness and that any intelligent person should always be adjusting their views slightly in light of new evidence and changing times .
Five years from now , I will probably read this post and think that I was wrong about some of these .
Nonetheless , this is where my mind stands today .
10 . Luck Matters
Five years ago , I would have said success was mostly skill and effort , but in the past five years I have met countless bright hard working entrepreneurs who did n’t get the right break .
I have also met a few no talent hacks who got lucky .
In general , I think a small percentage of highly successful people are just lucky and not talented .
Most are both talented and lucky , and a few were just so super talented they did n’t need luck .
Call it a bell curve .
Talent and hard work will put you in a good position , but to get to the upper echelons of success , I think most of us need some good luck and timing .
9. Touchy Feely vs. Analytical
I used to be very “ Fast Company ” in my approach to business .
I believed it was all about the soft stuff .
The key to success was making employees happy and having some crazy Google - like workspace .
There is still some truth to that , but now I lean heavily on the economics of an industry for success .
It is soooo much easier to be successful in a business with good economics , even if you make some mistakes , than in an industry with lousy economics but a hip fun workplace .
For entrepreneurs , I think the key approach should be to look for opportunities in markets where the economics are changing .
8. Beware of the Hype
I used to be in awe of people who got a lot of publicity .
My first smack in the face came when a PR company called me for a business launch and had written a quote for me .
They wanted me to approve the quote .
So that ’s how the game works eh ?
Since then , I have a love - hate relationship with PR .
I realize it is important to stay “ top of mind , ” but at the same time , it is so contrived and artificial most of the time that I hate to be a part of it .
The lesson here is that when you see someone sitting on a panel at a conference , when you see them get an article published in a magazine or newspaper , when you see them cited as an industry leader , that does n’t really mean you should listen to them or that they have any idea what they are talking about .
Do your own research and ask them tough questions .
Do n’t base your awe of them on their aphorisms .
7 . It is Always Easy to See What You Want to See
It took me almost 2 years to find a financial partner for my first business .
Then a few months into it , I realized the margins would never be what I wanted them to be .
Dozens of people told me why it would n’t work ( lousy industry economics , primarily ) but I did n’t listen .
It was sexy and cool , and I wanted to be sexy and cool to .
I saw what I wanted to see .
I did n’t listen .
The problem is that when you are doing new things , people are almost always critical .
So how do you know when to listen to them and when to ignore them ?
I do n’t have a good answer to that , but I know that every day I ask myself if there is evidence that my views are wrong on this or that .
For instance , I am convinced that top level aggregation of local information is the wrong approach to local web media , yet that is what almost everybody is doing .
Instead , I believe you need to take the mass customization approach – a backend that aggregates , but a bunch of front - ends that are unique to each city .
I do n’t see any evidence that this is wrong , but it keeps me up some nights wondering why I am only aware of 2 companies that are taking my approach , and 200 that are taking the opposite approach .
6. Do Stuff
I used to plan and talk , plan and talk , plan and talk .
I ’m not criticizing planning or talking … they can be beneficial , but now I prefer to do something instead of talking .
Your plans will probably be wrong on anything that is new , so you may as well just start doing .
Doing stuff gives you a better “ feel ” for a business than all the planning in the world .
Plus , once you get labeled as a doer , everybody wants to work with you because they have all been burned by planners and talkers .
Of course , doing takes a lot more time .
It ’s also much harder .
And once you adopt the doing mentality , you risk doing stuff just for the sake of doing stuff , but action for action ’s sake is sometimes the wrong approach .
5. Failure Does n’t Really Matter
It is embarrassing to fail .
We all wish we could string together a bunch of wins .
I used to be concerned about looking stupid , or dealing with the criticism that can come with failure , and while I wo n’t say I like it and embrace it , I will say that it does n’t bother me nearly as much as it used to .
One reason for that is many “ failures ” are only temporary setbacks , and if you do n’t let them scare you and demoralize you , they can be turned into wins .
The second reason is that failure is almost always a great learning experience , and you can charge valuable consulting fees by finding companies who want to get into a space and selling them the more efficient learning curve they can get by avoiding the mistakes you have already made .
4. Find Your People
Search is the key process you need to master .
I used to think that I needed to be more persuasive .
I thought the key to raising money , hiring good people , or selling a lot of whatever it is I was selling was to learn how to convince skeptics .
No .
Spend your time finding investors who are looking for ideas like yours instead of convincing investors who do n’t care that they should listen to you .
Spend time finding employees who believe in what you are doing instead of convincing potential hires that they should want to come work for you .
Spend time searching for a customer who needs and wants what you have , instead of trying to convince someone who does n’t that they should want it .
Do n’t try to change other people .
Try to find the people who are like you in the ways that are most important .
Work on meeting and connecting with the people who matter .
3. Revenge is a Waste of Time and Energy
Business can lead to situations that make you angry and make you want to go crush an ex-employee , ex-customer , competitor , or whoever .
While spite may be a good motivator , revenge is typically a lousy use of resources .
Blow it off .
Take the high road .
If you get ripped off , do n’t spend all your time trying to get back at the guy , just suck it up and move on .
If your focus on revenge distracts you from the real focus of your business , then your nemesis has just won a second time by making you less successful .
2. Help Others Reach Their Goals
Five years ago , I would have said you should monopolize talent , force people to do what you wanted , not what they wanted , lock people in , and in general do whatever it takes to keep everything tilted in your favor ( maybe that is why I favored the trimmings of a happy workplace mentioned above … because I did n’t believe work itself could be happy ) .
Now I believe that everyone has dreams and if you can help them reach those dreams , most of them will go to the ends of the earth to help you out down the road .
When skilled employees are ready to move on , do n’t be mad , be happy for them .
When customers have outgrown you and need a different type of provider , help them find what they need , do n’t be angry at them .
Do n’t be one of those people who only takes and takes in a relationship .
Be a giver , even if other people call you a sucker .
In the long run , you will be better off .
1. Relationships , relationships , relationships
The single biggest thing that I have learned is that relationships matter .
People like to work with people they trust .
Five years ago , I thought I would be a successful entrepreneur some day because I would hole up in my house and read all kinds of technology and business books and play with lots of software and then have some breakthrough insight that would shake up the world on its own .
Now I think if I am ever highly successful , it will be because a bunch of people helped me get there .
My biggest regret at this point in my life is that I wasted my MBA years by not networking .
I skipped almost every networking event we ever had because I thought it was a waste of time and I was better off studying or reading .
I should have spent that time networking and getting to know my classmates .
In December , we decided to give up our search for funding and turn to services work to bring in revenue and keep our product development hopes alive .
We went from $ 0 in revenue in November to an expected $ 40 K in March , and we have enough potential business in the pipeline that if we close just part of it we will be over $ 100 K in revenue a month by the fall .
Almost all of that business came from relationships .
Some of the relationships are relatively new , but still , my point is that no one contacted us through a web site and we have n’t done any advertising .
We just started talking to friends about the stuff we are doing and our network of relationships started sending us business .
It saved us from having to shut down our own hopes and dreams .
If we end up successful , it will be because of other people .
It will be because of the relationships we have .
I hope you can take something away from what I have learned .
I also hope you will keep reading as this blog enters new ownership .
I will still pop in on occasion to say hello and contribute some insight , and you can always follow me at my new blog .
Thank you for helping me think through so many issues over the past 5 years , and as always , thanks for reading .
WHILE economic growth in OECD countries will slow in 2008 , increased growth in emerging - market countries will help to offset the impact on the global economy .
The credit squeeze and falling housing prices will take their toll in important markets : the Economist Intelligence Unit predicts that America and Japan will be among the ten slowest - growing economies next year .
Wretched Zimbabwe will see its output shrink dramatically .
Many of the fastest - growing economies , such as Angola and Sudan , will be fuelled by soaring oil and mineral prices .
China too will continue to expand rapidly .

Mettere in discussione la leadership di Veltroni all ’interno del PD in questo momento sarebbe una follia .
Farebbe sprofondare il partito in una crisi nera , proprio nel momento in cui dovrebbe essere più unito per affrontare la difficile stagione che si prospetta .
Eppure c’è questa possibilità : come direbbe Massimo Cacciari , il centrosinistra è pieno di “ capre pazze ” che potrebbero mettere in discussione la guida del partito sull ’ onda emotiva della sconfitta elettorale .
Ma come ho già detto , il progetto politico di Veltroni non va giudicato sul breve periodo : era francamente molto difficile recuperare in così poco tempo lo svantaggio .
Si sono però poste le basi per la creazione di una sinistra riformista , un partito di governo che l’Italia non ha mai avuto .
Questo processo deve continuare con la famosa radicazione sul territorio e probabilmente verrà convocato in anticipo il congresso del partito per pianificarla .
Non dimentichiamo infine i milioni di cittadini che hanno votato per le primarie del Pd , e che hanno legittimato Veltroni come leader del partito .
Da qui deve ripartire per continuare sulla strada che ha cominciato a tracciare .
( CNN ) --
Two teachers at a Baltimore , Maryland , high school say they were attacked by students , and one says such assaults are commonplace , according to CNN affiliate WBAL .
" No learning place should be this violent , " art teacher Jolita Berry said of the school where she teaches .
The school district says it is investigating and will take appropriate action , but both art teacher Jolita Berry and English teacher Marc Standish say the administration has failed to protect and support them .
" I looked over , and her friends were cheering her on .
And before I knew it , she hit me in the face , " Berry told WBAL .
She showed the station a cell - phone video depicting what she said was a student beating her last Friday .
Individuals in the video are difficult to identify , and no charges have been filed , WBAL reported .
Berry said her principal told her she brought the attack on herself .
" On one hand , she told me that she is sorry that this happened to me , " Berry told WBAL .
" But then she turned right around and told me that telling a student that I was going to defend myself was a trigger word .
I triggered them . "
Berry called the administrative response frustrating .
" Too many times this has happened at this school and at other schools , and nothing 's being done .
No learning place should be this violent , " she said .
Baltimore City Schools public relations department said it would have no comment beyond a statement issued by Bennie Williams , the district 's chief of staff , that says the district has " a fundamental commitment " to keep schools safe .
" We take any disruption of the learning environment extremely seriously and respond immediately and forcefully to any disruption .
...
We are currently investigating the specific incident at Reginald F. Lewis High School to determine appropriate action .
...
We are treating this incident with the utmost seriousness , " the statement said .
But the problem goes beyond one incident , Standish said .
He told WBAL that students regularly issue " very visceral threats " against him .
" I just had a couple last week , and it 's just everyday routine , " he said .
Standish said he has filed a grievance with the district through the teachers union .
Union President Marietta English met with about 20 principals Wednesday evening to discuss teacher safety .
" We really want to implement some policies that principals can follow [ so ] that teachers wo n't be having to be afraid to come in their classrooms or come into their schools , " she told WBAL .

Whoever they paid to put this together made this one as a joke , so when Microsoft said ' What the hell is this crap ? ' they could say it was a joke and hand them the real one which they had with them the whole time ...
Except Microsoft never said anything , so they just kinda had to keep their mouth shut and sneak away .

A slice of today 's British countryside .
Giant butternut squash nestle in the ground waiting to be plucked and dispatched to satisfy gastropub tastes .
Half a dozen workers trudge behind a tractor bending down to pick and load the squash .
And the only person in the field who 's British is the bloke driving the tractor .
The rest are all from Eastern Europe .
The crew of Latvians , Lithuanians and a Pole includes a former nurse who 's earning four times what she was making in the hospital back home .
It 's monotonous , physical work with 60 - hour weeks , but no - one 's complaining - or taking a tea break .
The TV translation says it all
" It 's wonderful here , " says Mariusz , fresh in from Poland .
A dream workforce for the farmer surveying the workers toiling on his land outside Peterborough .
" We have a job to get anyone else to do the work . "
He has all but given up on using locals to work in the fields .
" They do n't work as hard . "
In fact , they barely work in the fields at all .
The agency supplying this farm with labour has had hundreds of Eastern Europeans pass through its doors in the last two years - and all of three English people .
" We 've a job to get anybody else to do the work , " says farmer Cam Allan .
" The rates of pay are above minimum wage .
It 's just finding the people to do this type of work we 've got . "
The agricultural sector would be in dire straits without the immigrants willing to do the hard graft on the land .
Labour which can net workers up to £ 25,000 - a- year with overtime .
' Prefer to sign - on '
But that 's not enough to entice some of the local lads picking up their dole money in Peterborough .
A constant trickle of young men are in and out of the office collecting their state benefits .
But there 's little appetite for taking one of those vegetable - picking jobs of up to £ 7 - an - hour .
One group of lads :
Job for £ 7 an hour - " I prefer to sign on than do that "
" No mate I 'd prefer to sign - on than do that . "
" I do n't want to work in like no cornfield . "
" I do n't want to work with a load of foreigners . "
Another lad is picking up his last benefits cheque .
He 's just got a job after 12 months of searching .
" I think because of all the foreigners " he says .
" I know people do n't like it , but I 've never had trouble getting a job before .
I 've been going for jobs and they 've got over 200 people applying for them . "
The massive influx of Eastern Europeans may be keeping parts of the economy afloat , but is there a social cost ?
Britain has experienced its biggest wave of migration in centuries in recent years .
No - one really knows how many Eastern Europeans have come to Britain .
The official figure is 800,000 .
One in 10
A fair few have ended up in Peterborough - enticed by the demand for farming and factory work .
Immigrants now make up around one in 10 of the city 's population .
Some locals say Peterborough is creaking under the pressure .
They should put a stop to immigration totally
Hema Patel
Charles Swift has been a local councillor for 55 years .
As leader of the city council in the early 1970s , he agreed to house Asian families who had been forcibly expelled from Uganda - prompting National Front pickets against him .
But the councillor feels this latest influx has gone too far - with not enough government money to recognise the real scale and impact of the recent immigration .
He points out the local GP surgery which has received a thousand immigrant patients in the last six months and a primary school coping with 24 languages .
" The ordinary chappie in the street , if you stop and talk to them , they 're right pig - sick , fed up to the teeth .
They can see standards deteriorating all the way round and they repeatedly say to you 'enough is enough Charles .
We 've had enough of it ' . "
Putting down roots
Resident Hema Patel agrees .
" They should put a stop to immigration totally , " she says " ... whether they be Europeans , from the Far East , whatever .
And they should sort out the problems now . "
The local farmers and factory owners would say Peterborough has n't had enough of it .
They 're still short of labour .
But with immigration it's hard to see beyond the particular impact it 's having on your immediate life - and that impact will be very different between a boss trying to keep his business afloat and someone whose street has become a magnet for immigrants .
What 's striking in Peterborough is how many of the recent migrants are actually here for the long haul - and not just a year of two to make some money and head home
In a church hall , a Polish politician addresses a room full of his countrymen - seeing whether any might be tempted back home to a country now short of workers .
Out of the whole room , only one Pole says she is considering going back home .
The rest are here to stay .
One young mother says , " I 've a flat here now and my children are with me .
They 're at school and have made friends here .
So I could n't go back to Poland now - even if the situation there improved very quickly . "
The Poles are Coming will be broadcast on Tuesday , 11 March at 2100 GMT on BBC Two .
So , there 's good workers , workers who seem are very hard working and willing to work , pay their taxes which in turn go into schools , surgeries , etc .
Then you 've got people that are unemployed , willing to take money from the state and like to moan a lot .
Which group are having a more detrimental effect on the community ?
I just feel that dressing this up as an immigration issue is just an excuse for people to be racist , and the ' general public ' are only parroting what the media has fed them without really having thought about it .
Jen , Brighton
I recently resigned from a job of 9 years because of the immigration problems .
Out of the 33 staff I was responsible for , 28 were either Polish or Lithuanian .
Only one could speak English , the rest I had to speak to through a translator .
This was something I had neither the time or energy to do .
It was also a health and safety risk , as they could n't read the warning signs on the machines we worked with .
If they can't speak English , they should n't be allowed in our country .
And what can Poland and Lithuania offer any Brit in need of a job ?
Absolutely nothing !
Sort it Gordon Brown
David Thompson , Workington , Cumbria
I have no problem with immigration per se , and indeed feel that Britain has been stronger for it , particularly after the wars .
However , I agree in part with the comment in the article from Hema Patel .
We need to stop the flow , at least for now , and shore things up , fix the things that are breaking , and make it better for people here now .
That way we can make it a better place for people in the future , both born and raised and immigrant alike .
If a water pipe is leaking you do n't keep pumping water through it .
You stop the water further up the pipe , carry out repairs and then let it come back through when the pipe is strong enough again .
We do n't have to stop immigration forever , but we clearly do need to stop , analyse what is happening and where it will take us and fix things that need to be fixed now
Paul Manley , Cardiff
Its always the government supplied services - health , education and transport mainly - that seem to have difficulty with increased demand due to immigration .
How come pubs , supermarkets , and other private suppliers are not having the same problems ?
Do immigrants not eat or drink ?
Or perhaps the bureaucrats just can't be bothered to do their job , and provide services in the quality and quantity that is demanded .
Robert , London
There should be no option if you are fit and on the dole work or no money , the whole system needs shaking up to make it easier to work for a few weeks then go back on the dole .
I think half the problem is the governments .
If you find seasonal work often the difficulties getting back on to the dole especially if you have a family is a real issue .
So yes there should
Ian Turner , Redruth Cornwall
Its the same problem that we have here in the US .
There are jobs that are vacant and pay well .
However , people do n't want to take them because they are labor jobs .
If we were to stop immigration and crack down on illegal workers , a huge part of our economy would shut down .
We would n't have the goods we enjoy at cheap prices .
Not to mention the undesirable duties that keep a city going would be non existent .
No one stops to think about the people that pick the fruit that eat everyday or about the people that clean up parks and other public spaces .
If those workers were n't here , then who would fill those jobs ?
Not the people that feel entitled to make twice that much with benefits .
Jennifer Johnson , Austin , Texas , US
£ 7 an hour and they 'd rather sign on - If they are fit and well then their benefits should be stopped - they will have to work then .
Julian , Leeds , England
I 'm 53 , a fully qualified mechanic .
I 'm employed but fear my company may close .
I 've worked hard and continually since the age of 16 .
If my company closes I 'll have to look for another job .
At my age I 'll be lucky .
All the jobs are being taken up by foreigners .
Andrew Lewis , Newport W / Wales
£ 7 per hour does not equate to £ 25 k a year , particularly if the work is only seasonal .
It 's against working time regulations to expect anyone to work 60 hour weeks without tea breaks .
The writer must be living in some Victorian reality writing such a biased article suggesting the locals should be happy with such work .
Perhaps it is not enough to live on .
Perhaps some locals would be happy to work 60 hour weeks abroad where the salary equated to , say £ 70 k in local wages , where the employers would probably then call the locals lazy .

Why are we giving benefit cheques to able - bodied men in this country while there are jobs to be done ?
They do n't want to work , and instead receive our taxes ;
We do n't want to work for them and give them our taxes !

WASHINGTON - An intense debate erupted during the Ford administration over the president 's powers to eavesdrop without warrants to gather foreign intelligence , according to newly disclosed government documents .
George H.W. Bush , Donald Rumsfeld andare cited in the documents .
The roughly 200 pages of historic records obtained by The Associated Press reflect a remarkably similar dispute between the White House and Congress fully three decades before President Bush 's acknowledgment he authorized wiretaps without warrants of some Americans in terrorism investigations .
" Yogi Bera was right :
It 's deja vu all over again , " said Tom Blanton , executive director for the National Security Archives , a private research group that compiles collections of sensitive government documents .
" It 's the same debate . "
Senate Judiciary Committee hearings begin Monday over Bush 's authority to approve such wiretaps by the ultra-secretive National Security Agency without a judge 's approval .
A focus of the hearings is to determine whether the Bush administration 's eavesdropping program violated the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act , the 1978 law with origins during Ford 's presidency .
" We strongly believe it is unwise for the president to concede any lack of constitutional power to authorize electronic surveillance for foreign intelligence purposes , " wrote Robert Ingersoll , then - deputy secretary of state , in a 1976 memorandum to President Ford about the proposed bill on electronic surveillance .
George H.W. Bush , then director of the CIA , wanted to ensure " no unnecessary diminution of collection of important foreign intelligence " under the proposal to require judges to approve terror wiretaps , according to a March 1976 memorandum he wrote to the Justice Department .
Bush also complained that some major communications companies were unwilling to install government wiretaps without a judge 's approval .
Such a refusal " seriously affects the capabilities of the intelligence community , " Bush wrote .
In another document , Jack Marsh , a White House adviser , outlined options for Ford over the wiretap legislation .
Marsh alerted Ford to objections by Bush as CIA director and by Rumsfeld , Henry Kissinger and Brent Scowcroft over the scope of a provision to require judicial oversight of wiretaps .
At the time , Rumsfeld was defense secretary , Kissinger was secretary of state and Scowcroft was the White House national security adviser .
Some experts were n't surprised the cast of characters in this national debate remained largely unchanged over 30 years .
" People do n't change their stripes , " said Kenneth C. Bass a former senior Justice Department lawyer who oversaw such wiretap requests during the Carter administration .
The National Security Archives separately obtained many of the same documents as the AP and intended to publish them on its Web site Saturday .
The documents include one startling similarity to Washington 's current atmosphere over disclosures of classified information by the media .
Notes from a 1975 meeting between Cheney , then White House chief of staff , then - Attorney General Edward Levi and others cite the " problem " of a New York Times article by Seymour Hersh about U.S. submarines spying inside Soviet waters .
Participants considered a formal FBI investigation of Hersh and the Times and searching Hersh 's apartment " to go after ( his ) papers , " the document said .
" I was surprised , " Hersh said in a telephone interview Friday .
" I was surprised that they did n't know I had a house and a mortgage . "
One option outlined at the 1975 meeting was to " ignore the Hersh story and hope it does n't happen again . "
Participants worried about " will we get hit with violating the First Amendment to the Constitution ? "
CIA Director Porter Goss told lawmakers this week that recent disclosures about sensitive programs were severely damaging , and he urged prosecutors to impanel a grand jury to determine " who is leaking this information . "
The National Security Agency earlier asked the Justice Department to open a formal leaks investigation over press reports of its terrorism wiretaps .

Foreword --
This paper surveys Linux 's suitability for use by owners of very small businesses and the self - employed .
It was written by Howard Fosdick , a self - employed database consultant who finds Linux fairly well - suited to his needs , and reckons it has saved him thousands of dollars in recent years .
Running a business on desktop Linux
by Howard Fosdick
Spread the word :
digg this story
How many are self - employed in the United States ?
No one knows for sure , but estimates range around twenty million .
Add to this millions of small businesses , and you have a huge pool of workers who run their businesses on personal computers .
Dentists , handymen , shop owners , yoga instructors , lawyers ... all require reliable , easy - to - use computers for their work .
Should they use Linux ?
Here 's my take as someone who has run his one - person business on Linux for several years .
I 'll be objective .
This is not a promotional piece .
Let 's state up front that I have an advantage over many business Linux users because I 'm an IT professional .
Yet we all depend on business Linux .
What We Want
What do the self - employed require of their computers ?
The list varies by the person and the kind of work they do .
Here are the essentials :
Easy to use
Workers want to spend time on their business , not learning computer programs
Help is readily available
People want quick answers to problems
Reliable
The system should " just work " without losing data or messing up applications
Run office applications
Everyone needs office suites , email , and web access
Compatible
It 's essential to exchange email and office documents with customers and suppliers
Run business applications
These vary by the business
Manage finances
Everyone must " keep the books " somehow
Inexpensive
Computers are overhead
Performance
Nothing is worse than a slow computer when you 're trying to get your work done
Small business workers are on their own , without IT support .
They depend on computers and just want to do their jobs without computer headaches .
I feel the same way .
Though I 'm an IT professional , I can't squander time on random PC issues .
I need to get my work done .
How Does Linux Rate ?
I 'll discuss each of the criteria in light of my Ubuntu experiences .
Ubuntu is the most popular Linux , it 's consumer - oriented , and it's one of the two Linuxes I use .
Easy to Use --
As a hobby , I fix up computers donated to charity , which we then give to deserving families .
I observe adults and children using Linux for the first time .
Most instantly recognize the graphical user interface as just another Windows - like GUI .
( Microsoft has done an excellent job in training computer users to adapt to GUI changes , having altered the user interface in every Windows release . )
You may need to point out which programs are equivalent to the Windows programs they 're used to , but most have little difficulty switching to Ubuntu .
It 's the same with applications .
OpenOffice programs do not look much different than their Microsoft Office counterparts .
Users tentatively explore the menus to find the functions they want , and usually they succeed .
Only when trying advanced features do they struggle -- but then you 're likely to see the same distress when they try Office 's advanced features .
What happens when they face a problem ?
Most know to search the web for an answer .
Windows and Ubuntu solutions often require altering obscure GUI panel settings .
But in Ubuntu you sometimes have to run line commands .
Unless users can cut - and - paste the commands , this is a show - stopper .
A few years ago , Linux was suitable for servers and embedded systems , but was n't user - friendly enough for desktops .
Now that 's changed .
Ubuntu competes head - to - head with Windows .
But the line commands indicate there 's still room for improvement .
Help is Readily Available -- Ubuntu has attained critical mass .
If you " google " a problem you 'll find the answer .
Rarely do you need to post a forum question .
( This compares favorably with less popular Linux distributions , where answers require time - consuming posts . )
You can find an Ubuntu answer as easy as you can find a Windows answer .
Ubuntu 's popularity means that everyday people use it at work or at home .
Business owners and freelancers feel comfortable because they talk with others like themselves in resolving problems .
One issue for business workers is that they do n't have time for the rudeness and aggression sometimes found online .
This applies to both Linux and Windows , unfortunately .
Forums that tolerate juvenile behavior repell serious people .
Reliable --
For most people , " reliability " means that their computer will allow them to do their work without interruption .
They do n't get side - tracked to figure out computer problems .
They do n't have to worry whether their system is " corrupted . "
Business owners just want their systems to work .
Like a car , it 's ok if you have to schedule occasional maintenance , but your chances of being stranded while driving should be nil .
How does reliability compare for Linux and Windows ?
Most familiar with both give the advantage to Linux for these reasons :
Systems do n't slow down over time
Little risk of malware infection
No vulnerable , complex Registry
Little need for software maintenance
Here 's evidence that verifies this view .
I developed a comprehensive guide for Windows users called " How to Secure Your Windows Computer and Protect Your Privacy . "
In simple , non-technical terms , it tells Windows users about their security and privacy exposures .
It shows how to address them through a combination of " best practices " and free software .
Most -- but not all -- of the risks this e-book addresses are unique to Windows .
They do n't pertain to Linux .
You can download this twenty - page guide here .
Run Office Applications --
Here are Windows office applications and their Linux equivalents .
Ubuntu 's default , bundled applications are underlined :
Application :
Windows :
Linux :
Office suite
Microsoft Office
OpenOffice , GNOME Office , KOffice
Word processor
Microsoft Word
OpenOffice Writer , Abiword , others
Spreadsheet
Microsoft Excel
OpenOffice Calc , Gnumeric , others
Presentation graphics
Microsoft Powerpoint
OpenOffice Impress , others
Email
Microsoft Outlook
Evolution , Thunderbird Browser
Microsoft Internet Explorer
Firefox , Opera , SeaMonkey , Epiphany , others
File manager
Microsoft Explorer
Nautilus , many others
Web sites / HTML editor
MS FrontPage , Dreamweaver , others
Nvu , Composer , Amaya , Bluefish , others
Text editor
Notepad , others
Gedit , Adie , Mousepad , many others
Windows customers assume they must pay for office applications .
As proven by Microsoft 's market share , they assume Microsoft will be the provider .
These costs are major expenses for the freelancer or small business .
Office 2007 costs between $ 149.95 and $ 679.95 .
Windows Vista retails between $ 199.95 for Home Basic and $ 319.95 for Ultimate edition .
Linux users enjoy a great variety of applications .
All are free .
Ubuntu helps anyone download and install them with just a few mouse clicks .
Installing Ubuntu software is as easy as installing Windows programs .
One place where Ubuntu falters is in providing full web access .
You have to install browser plug-ins and multimedia codecs to run web video and audio .
Why ?
Ideology about " open source " and " free " software .
Business customers do n't care about that .
They expect full web access right out of the box .
Linux distributions like Mint and Vector meet this expectation , while Ubuntu offers a band - aid solution in recent releases with " plug - in install wizards . "
Compatible --
Windows dominates the consumer computer market , so all my customers use it .
I can only support them if we can exchange documents .
Start with email .
Everyone relies on it .
Email has long been standardized regardless of operating system and email program .
You can send and receive email between Windows , Linux , and Mac computers .
It does n't matter whether you use Microsoft Outlook on a Windows computer , or Thunderbird or Evolution on a Linux computer .
No problem there .
How about office documents ?
Microsoft
Office file formats are the de facto world standard .
Linux applications must seamlessly interchange and create Word files , Excel files , and Powerpoint files ( *.doc , *.xls , and *.ppt ) .
Among Linux office suites , OpenOffice is most compatible with Microsoft Office .
I use OpenOffice Writer to read
Word files from clients , edit them , and send them back .
I also create new documents in Word format with OO Writer .
I 've never had a problem reading a Word document , no matter how complex .
I have run into minor incompatibilities when creating Word documents from scratch ( eg , web links that show up in incorrect font sizes in Word , or tables of contents that do n't render correctly ) .
It took me a couple months to learn to avoid these incompatibilities .
Now I create documents in Microsoft format with 100 percent accurate rendering in Word .
( See how to set up OO Writer for Word compatibility here and here . )
When your income depends on documents looking professional , you can't afford to take chances .
Initially , I kept an old Windows 98 computer around with Office - 97 to check compatibility .
I do n't anymore .
Others buy Microsoft Office and run it under Wine .
Wine runs Windows applications within Linux .
With spreadsheets and presentation graphics , I encounter the same situation .
Not once have I ever had a problem reading documents sent to me by clients .
But if I create an MS - file - format document from scratch I must be careful to use only compatible product features .
I 'm witnessing movement away from the Microsoft standards .
Many publishers and vendor clients now accept or even prefer HTML files .
Increasingly I create content with HTML tools like Composer .
For data interchange , businesses use the open standard Extensible Markup Language ( XML ) .
Microsoft recently retired their decade - old binary Office file formats .
They introduced new formats called Office Open XML .
Will the new formats result in a greater OpenOffice compatibility , since OOXML is a published standard ?
Or will their influence will be disruptive , due to departure from the long - used formats ?
Those of us who run business Linux absolutely require OpenOffice to support OOXML .
I 've found a several advantages to OpenOffice over Microsoft Office .
OO Writer generates PDF files .
( Only in Office 2007 does Microsoft finally offer an " add - in " to save documents in PDF format . )
OpenOffice generates better HTML than Microsoft Office .
Publishers reject Office - generated HTML as unusable .
OO does n't bloat with every release , so I do n't have to upgrade my hardware just to run a current office suite .
Why do Windows customers accept inflated hardware requirements to run the same office applications they have for years on older computers ?
Run Business Applications --
Whether Linux fits the bill here depends on the applications you need .
Most of my work is database administration , so I 'm glad Linux hosts commercial databases like Oracle and IBM DB2 and open source systems like MySQL and PostgreSQL .
The only major database system that does not run under Linux is Microsoft SQL Server .
I remotely support client databases through the Internet .
Any browser works .
The days when special software or local logins were necessary to administer remote servers are past .
Many knowledge workers now access company applications remotely with browsers .
I also create and maintain web sites .
Ubuntu offers great free tools like Nvu and Amaya .
But I face the same issue with the web sites I support as I do with the published products I create in Word format .
Customers view my web sites using Microsoft 's Internet Explorer .
Sometimes IE renders web pages a little differently than do Ubuntu and Firefox .
For example , spacing and formatting differ .
I used to double - check my web sites by viewing the final product on Windows with Internet Explorer .
These days I just verify my product on different Linux computers with different screen sizes , resolutions , and browsers .
If the result looks good , it will look fine with IE .
What other Windows applications might the sole proprietor need ?
A thread on the Puppy Linux forum suggests video editing , printer and device drivers , and legacy applications .
You can use Wine to run legacy Windows applications within Linux .
It supports 10,000 applications .

Manage Finances --
Linux runs many financial and accounting applications suitable for small businesses .
Sites like Linux Online or EnterpriseITPlanet list business applications .
Use the Linux AppFinder to find them or simply google on " linux accounting applications . "
The problem is n't finding enough software , it is evaluating which best meets your needs .
Inexpensive and Performance -- I 'll discuss the final two criteria together because they 're interrelated -- you can always solve a performance problem if you 're willing to spend more money .
( Ultimately you could just buy a new computer ! )
Low cost is a major Linux benefit .
Not only is the operating system free , but so are its applications .
There is much more to cost equation than the up - front price you pay .
Microsoft has done an outstanding job of hiding the true costs of its software from consumers .
Linux eliminates these hidden costs from Windows :
Fewer security and privacy problems
No loss of support as systems age
No problems running current software on older computers
running current software
No forced software and hardware upgrades every couple years
every couple years
No system slowdown over time ( due to Registry bloat , malware , or other causes )
( due to Registry bloat , malware , or other causes )
No forced upgrade of one product due to artificial coupling with another ( " Installing this product requires IE 8 ! " )
No need to re-install the operating system due to software corruption
No performance costs from built - in digital rights management ( Vista Content Management )
( )
No worry about whether you understand the legalistic license terms
about
No buying multiple licenses for desktop and laptop , or for primary and backup systems

Linux empowers you to run your business on low - cost computers that are deemed worthless within the distorted perspective of " Windows world . "
I 'm writing this article , for example , on a Pentium III .
It runs Ubuntu just fine , and it runs Puppy Linux fast as a scalded greyhound .
This low - end laptop supports all requirements in this article .
It was given to me , free , by an dissatisfied Windows user because it was " too slow . "
Apparently it was sold to him as an Windows XP computer , but no one told him he had to eliminate unnecessary Windows Services and craplets and double its 256 meg of memory to get it running acceptably .
Or , install Ubuntu .
The Verdict
From a sole proprietor 's perspective , here 's how I 'd rate Ubuntu Linux :

Linux lags in one key area -- compatibility with Microsoft file formats .
This requirement is critical because businesses must work with Windows - based customers .
I hope the Linux community uses the new OOXML standards to improve compatibility .
For all other requirements , Ubuntu is competitive .
It even excels in reliability and price / performance .
Why has Linux not achieved greater market share ?
The reason is that Windows is bundled with over 90 percent of all new computers sold in the U.S.
While the courts focus on whether Microsoft engages in monopolistic behavior when they add an anti-spyware or browser program into Windows , they miss the real issue -- Microsoft wields monopoly power in negotiations with personal computer vendors :
Why should Microsoft be allowed to force vendors to sell an operating system with every computer ?
to with every computer ?
Why are n't vendors allowed to install another operating system along with Windows ?
?
How can Microsoft limit vendors to shipping hobbled " restore CDs " instead of the full operating system ?
instead of the full operating system ?
Why is there such a huge price difference between retail Windows and bundled Windows ?
( And why do the courts tolerate such an obvious monopolist tactic ? )
To restore competition , we need to fix the unequal relationship between Microsoft and the hardware vendors .
But where the courts fail , technology may succeed .
The One Laptop Per Child project has ignited an explosion in demand for low - cost Linux laptops .
Very low - end computer systems are now proliferating and transforming the marketplace .
At only a few hundred dollars per laptop , these computers wo n't support Microsoft 's seventy percent profit margins .
( Remember the old pre-profiteering days when Windows 98 cost $ 89 ? ) .
Linux 's cost advantages and flexibility are compelling .
I 've saved over two thousand dollars in expenses over three years with Linux .
This slashes my overhead .
Small businesses can extend these savings across their employees for competitive advantage .

The beneficiaries have been the joint ventures of multinationals that sell cars here that are designed overseas , like the Buick Excelle , Volkswagen Jetta and Toyota Camry .
Practically every auto expert had expected the multinationals to lose market share rapidly to low - cost domestic automakers .
Instead , Chinese car buyers , including first - time buyers , have become more discriminating about the comfort , styling and reliability of the cars they buy .
As a result , instead of planning to conquer overseas markets , local manufacturers are having to redouble their efforts in this market .
“ Customers are moving up , they want the bigger , more established brands , ” said Michael Dunne , the managing director for China at J. D. Power .
“ They ’d rather wait , save and buy higher on the ladder instead of buying a smaller car . ”
Back in the fall of 2006 , the Li family did not want to wait , especially Mr. Li .
When the Li family bought their car , they agreed to extensive interviews with each family member in Shuang Miao , a rural village in east - central China ’s Zhejiang Province .
They later agreed to follow - up telephone interviews over the last year and a half and then a long family dinner in Shuang Miao last week to review their experience as first - time car owners .
What emerges is a portrait of the rapidly expanding role of cars in the fast - changing ways in which China ’s people socialize , marry , raise families and , possibly , die .
Li Rifu was so excited on the day that he bought his first car in September 2006 that he woke before dawn .
He fixed breakfast for his wife and two grown sons , then climbed on his white motorcycle for a short trip he had been anticipating for many years .
Mr. Li had spent most of his life here in his ancestral farm village , nestled at the base of a steep hill .
The embodiment of China ’s version of the American dream , he is largely self - taught .
He learned to fix watches , and got a job as a foreman in a coal mine in nearby Anhui Province by fixing the mine owner ’s watch .
After saving some money , he came home to start a successful business that now employs five peasants raising flowers for landscapers .
I 've been getting a number of reports from voters in Georgia that the electronic pollbooks the state used during last week 's Super Tuesday primary crashed in a number of counties , resulting in the long lines that I reported about last week and in voters leaving without casting ballots .
Numerous voters in at least five Georgia counties have complained that there were n't enough e-pollbooks and that the machines crashed or were otherwise inoperable .
But an election official in Fulton County , Georgia , where many of the crashes were reported , denied that any machine crashed , and said voters were mistaken .
( I 've posted some .mp3 files below that come from a voter hotline in which voters discuss crashes and inoperable machines . )
The ExpressPoll e-pollbooks , made by Diebold Election Systems , are used to verify that a voter is registered .
( Georgia uses an older model of the ExpressPoll pictured above . )
Ralph Presley , who voted at a church in Fulton County , said there were about 200 people waiting in line at his precinct and although the church had fourteen voting machines , only two of them were being used at any one time due to a backup caused by problems with the e-pollbooks .
“ They were crashing , and then they ’d call the technician and wait for the technician to come out , ” he told me by phone .
There were only two items on Presley 's ballot – the presidential primary and a bond referendum – and while it took only 30 seconds to cast a ballot , it took 90 minutes to reach the poll booth .
Presley said voters had to wait until a technician arrived to re-boot one of the e-pollbooks that was down .
It took the machine about five minutes to re-boot , he said .
Maureen Goodman reported that when she arrived at 8:30 am to vote at Inman Middle School in Fulton County , the line was already running the length and a half of the school 's gym .
Although there were eight voting machines at the gym , only two were being used at any one time .
There were only two e-pollbooks in her polling location and she said one of them kept crashing and would take 5 - 10 minutes to reboot .
Poll workers also had trouble finding voters ' names in the e-pollbook databases .
“ The general feeling in the line was that it was an atrocity , ” she said .
“ In the state where Jimmy Carter is from and is known for election monitoring around the world , we ca n’t seem to get it right .
I found that kind of ironic . "
Voters who called a hotline run by InfoVoter Technologies on the day of the primary were also certain that the machines were crashing .
( I 've included more .mp3 files after the jump to give you a sense of the prevalence of this problem . )
A story in the Atlanta Journal - Constitution quoted state election officials acknowledging that they received " isolated " reports about the machines crashing and dispatched technicians in some cases to look into the matter .
But I spoke with Mark Henderson , voter education and public information coordinator for Fulton County , the site of many of the reported crashes , who told me voters were mistaken .
Henderson said his county 's election office received 72,000 calls on Super Tuesday ( slightly higher than previous election days , he said ) and not one of them involved a crashed e-pollbook .
He also disputed reports that technicians were dispatched to precincts to reboot the devices .
Although he acknowledged that several poll workers called during the primary to report that e-pollbooks were freezing , he said the poll workers were confused and the devices were simply running slow due to the size of the registration database on them .
He said that during poll worker training , the devices were loaded with only a small list of about 350 voter names for demonstration purposes so they performed name searches quickly .
But on election day , the entire state voter registration list of four and a half million active voters was stored on each device , increasing the time it took the device to find a voter 's name , leading poll workers to erroneously conclude that the devices were freezing up .
" But they did n’t crash or shut down completely as reported by pollworkers , " he said , adding that during this slowdown " voting never stopped . "
When I pointed out that to voters who stood in line for 1 to 3 hours voting did appear to stop , he reiterated , " Voting may have been delayed in some instances but it did not stop . "
Henderson acknowledged that there were too few e-pollbooks at precincts and this contributed to the long waits .
He said it was the result of poor planning due to lack of experience with the devices .
Georgia purchased the e-pollbooks from Diebold in July 2006 and used them for the first time during the mid-term elections that year .
That experience did n't prepare the county for Super Tuesday since voter turnout in Fulton County for the 2006 election was only 23 percent , whereas the turnout for the primary this year was 46 percent .
Fulton has 640 ExpressPoll devices and 360 precincts spread out in 251 polling locations ( some locations house more than one precinct ) .
Each precinct was given an average of two e-pollbooks .
Henderson said his office did n't anticipate the large turnout or the effect that searching through the statewide database would have on the speed of the e-pollbooks .
The day after the primary , the election office submitted a request to county commissioners to obtain more e-pollbooks before the county 's next election in July .
Below are some additional voter calls complaining about e-pollbooks not working , as well as a videotape of the long line at the Welcome All Community Center in Fulton County .
The video was taken by John Fortuin , a volunteer with Video the Vote .

Introduced into war - ravaged El Salvador , the gang spread quickly among demobilized soldiers and a younger generation accustomed to violence .
Many deportees who had been only loosely affiliated with MS - 13 in the U.S. became hard - core members after being stranded in a country they did not know , with only other gang members to rely on .
As the gang proliferated and El Salvador tried to crack down on it , some deportees began finding their way back into the U.S. — in many cases bringing other , newly recruited gangsters with them .
Deportation , incubation , and return : it ’s a cycle we ’ve been caught in ever since .
Today , MS - 13 has perhaps 6,000 to 10,000 members in the United States .
It has grown moderately in recent years and now has a presence in 43 states ( up from 32 in 2003 and 15 in 1996 ) .
Most members of the gang are foreign - born .
Since 2005 , ICE has arrested about 2,000 of them ; 13 percent have been deported before .
Salvadoran police report that 90 percent of deported gang members return to the U.S.
After several spins through the deportation - and - return cycle , MS - 13 members now control many of the “ coyote ” services that bring aliens up from Central America .
Deportation — a free trip south — can be quite profitable for those gang members who bring others back with them upon their return .
The surge in arrests and deportations in the past three years coincides with a serious U.S. effort to improve coordination with Central American governments — the better to track gang members wherever they go .
But states like El Salvador have a lot to keep track of these days .
MS - 13 and other gangs born in the United States now have 70,000 to 100,000 members in Central America , concentrated mostly in El Salvador , Honduras , and Guatemala .
The murder rate in each of these countries is now higher than that of Colombia , long the murder capital of Latin America .
Meanwhile , the U.S. continues to repeat the mistakes it made in the ’90s .
Most ICE arrests have been for immigration - related offenses , not criminal offenses .
Suspected “ associates ” are lumped in with gang members , which only reinforces gang ties ; with dabblers and minor offenders , experts agree that anti-gang intervention programs are better at preventing gangs ’ growth .
For hard - core gang members , quickie deportations on immigration charges are often no more than short - term fixes ; lengthy American prison sentences would be more effective .
Only the U.S. has the law - enforcement personnel , the criminal - justice system , and the money to deal with the problem .
Although the idea is poison in the current political climate , the way to get rid of these gangs , paradoxically , may involve keeping them here .
なんかmajor crunkしたライブラリ をmark as obsoleteしてしまったみたいだね 。

先ほど作成したtest_fooを再コンパイルなしで実行してみましょう

後方互換は壊れていませんので、何のトラブルも無く実行可能です。
では、先ほどマイナーバージョンを変更した時に追加した

ではシンボリックリンクであるlibfoo.so.0の実体を
新しいlibfoo.so.0.1から古いlibfoo.so.0.0に巻き戻すとどうなるでしょうか？

これが 「前方互換性がない」状態という訳です。
他にも、構造体の最後に新規にメンバが追加された場合なんかも
後方互換はOKでも前方互換は失われます、例えば このエントリの

前方互換性が壊れた場合 -> マイナーを変更
です、ライブラリ開発者の皆様におかれましては
その日の機嫌や語呂合わせなんかで適当に変えたり変えなかったり
しないように切にお願いする次第です。
後方互換性が壊れた場合には、新旧のメジャーを持つライブラリは残しておく必要があります

Benazir Bhutto ’s assassination on December 27 , 2007 in Rawalpindi , Pakistan represents a tragic continuation of assassination politics in feudal Pakistan , a country whose wealthy political families accumulated vast land holdings , wealth , or political power serving the British Raj ( British colonial reign of the Indian Subcontinent from 1858 – 1947 ) .
The major American mass media have been generating stories filled with lies or misrepresentations .
These stories omit important facts critical for understanding the true story of Benazir Bhutto .
The following are examples of some of the topics future researchers and historians can further explore , to provide an honest and thorough treatment of my Harvard University classmate ’s attempts to reconcile Islamic , democratic , and Western values .
On December 28 , 2007 , “ Democracy Now ! ” provided some honest analyses .
Tariq Ali , a British - Pakistani historian and an editor of the New Left Review , noted :
Now , when the United States decided they wanted to put her back in there , they told her , we are going to whitewash you so clean no one will even know .
And this is what the global media and networks have been doing .
Look , I knew her well .
I ’m very upset that she ’s dead .
But the piety being displayed on the global media networks is beyond belief .
You know , it ’s as if there ’s no past , no history in this country or its politicians .
The Charlie Wilson Connection
On December 21 , 2007 , a film about Afghanistan , Pakistan , and the Soviet Union , Charlie Wilson ’s War appeared in theaters ( and is reviewed here ) .
This film is based upon a book by a “ 60 Minutes ” television program producer , George Crile : Charlie Wilson 's War : The Extraordinary Story of the Largest Covert Operation in History .
On December 22 , 2007 , the History Channel then televised a documentary “ The True Story of Charlie Wilson ” .
Prior to the airing of the History Channel ’s documentary , Nancy deWolf Smith reviewed the documentary in “ The Real Charlie Wilson ” ( The Wall Street Journal , December 21 , 2007 , page W10 ) .
Some of her major points were :
( a) Even a two - hour documentary on such a complex subject will have many holes in the story ( b ) There will be unintended consequences .
For example , the Afghans did not want Arabs coming to Afghanistan to join in the fight .
Americans and others insisted upon sending Arabs to Afghanistan to leave the impression of a Muslim jihad against Soviet communism .
Others have been writing their own details not covered in the book , the film , or in the documentary .
This is as it should be .
We need to know all relevant details to understand history .
The following is a partial list of the characters and countries involved in true story of Charlie Wilson and the successful campaign to drive the Soviet Union out of Afghanistan :
1. “ Good Time ” Charles Wilson , an anti-communist Texas Democrat who was passionate about whiskey and women .
In June 1980 , while sitting in a hot tub in Las Vegas with several women , Wilson watched Dan Rather on “ 60 Minutes ” in Afghanistan explaining the plight of the Afghans .
2. Joanne Herring , anti-communist Texas socialite who encouraged Wilson to end the Cold War by causing the collapse of the Soviet Union .
3. General Muhammad Zia-ul - Haq .
In 1977 , General Zia-ul - Haq overthrew Benazir Bhutto ’s father , Prime Minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto .
Zia jailed and executed Benazir Bhutto ’s father .
In 1988 , Zia , some of his generals , and the American ambassador died in a suspicious airplane crash .
4. Carol Shannon , a Texas belly dancer who performed in Egypt for Field Marshal Mohammed Abu Ghazala .
Afterwards , Egypt provided Soviet weapons to be used against the Soviet Union in Afghanistan .
5. Israeli -modified Chinese weapons were smuggled into Afghanistan via Pakistan .

HOUSTON  From his front porch , John Milkovisch was able to see the beer truck heading for the local grocery , spurring him into action .
“ He ’d run over there and clean them out , ” recalled his son Ronald .
“ He never had less than 8 to 10 cases stacked up in the garage . ”
From 1968 until his death 20 years later , Mr. Milkovisch , an upholsterer for the Southern Pacific Railroad , not only emptied 50,000 cans or more of his favorite beverage but also put the containers to good use , cladding his house and workshop with thousands of maintenance - free flattened beer cans ( Falstaff was a favorite ) and shading the sun with garlands of tinkling beer can tops and tabs .

Known to generations of sidewalk gawkers as the Beer Can House , the folk art monument was dedicated Thursday and will open to the public on Saturday for the first time since its purchase from the Milkovisch family and a seven - year restoration project totaling $ 400,000 .

OK , so this is n’t really rocket science , but there are a couple of neat uses for this technique :
Ajax powered tab sets
Tabs can ; broadly - speaking , be loaded in three different ways :
Immediately loaded – i.e. when the webpage has loaded , it is the default selected tab .
Later ( deferred loading ) – i.e. after the user clicks a tab , go off to the server and retrieve the contents of a tab , or
Lazy loading – e.g. load in the background before the user clicks a tab .
This enhances the user experience as the contents of a tab are immediately shown , but on the flip side means requires more traffic and the user may never click the tab anyway , effectively wasting bandwidth .
Content panes , portal layouts etc
As with tabs , content panes on a page can be loaded in several ways , although lazy loading is probably not very useful .
Solution
Here ’s a javascript ( using jQuery ) implementation of the above which supports loading now , loading on page load and lazy loading ( which takes place after the on page loads ) :
ajaxLoader : { /**
A queue of embeds to load on document ready */ loadQueue : {} , /** A queue of embeds to load on after the load queue */ lazyQueue : {} , /** * Called on Document Ready to load all the queued embeds */ init : function ( ) { jQuery.each(this.loadQueue , function ( id , url ) { wbHtmlWidgets.embed._load( id , url ) ; } ) ; jQuery.each(this.lazyQueue , function ( id , url ) { wbHtmlWidgets.embed._load( id , url ) ; } ) ; } , _load : function ( id , url ) { $ ( " # " + id ) .load( url ) ; } , /** * Loads a url into a dom id immediately - ensure that the page has * completely loaded before using this method , as manipulating the DOM * before it has been created does nasty things in browsers such as IE .
*
If you want to embed content after the page has loaded , use embed.afterLoad ( ) * @param { string} id
The div id to load the embed into * @param {string} url
The url to load into the specified div id */ now : function ( id , url ) { this .
_load ( id , url ) ; } , /** * Loads a url into a dom id after the onLoad queue has been processed .
* @param { string} id
The div id to load the embed into * @param {string} url
The url to load into the specified div id */ lazy : function ( id , url ) { this.lazyQueue[id ] = url ; } , /** * Loads a url into a dom id after the page has loaded .
*
If you want to embed content now , use embed.now ( ) * @param { string} id
The div id to load the embed into * @param {string} url
The url to load into the specified div id */ afterLoad : function ( id , url ) { if ( $ ( " # " +id ) .html ( ) == '' ) { $ ( " # " +id ) .html ( '< image src= " /images/spinner.gif " />' ) ; } this.loadQueue[id ] = url ; } }
To get this to work , ensure that you have an onLoad ( document ready ) event on your page …
$ ( document ) .ready ( function ( ) { ajaxLoader.init( ) ; } ) ;
Then to make the magic work , in your HTML you may want to do something like :
< span id = " tab-0 " ></ span > < script type=" text / javascript " >
//<![ CDATA [ ajaxLoader.afterLoad( " tab -0 " , " http://your/tab/address " ) ; //] ] > </ script >
Acas has struggled to resolve its own workplace dispute
Members of the Public and Commercial Services union ( PCS ) voted by almost two to one for a rolling programme of one - hour strikes .
Union members say the service failed to make a pay offer last year .
Publicly - funded Acas works to resolve workplace disputes .
Unions warn that failure to resolve its own workplace dispute could embarrass the government .
" The failure of any pay offer and the lack of substantive negotiations have forced the very people who resolve industrial disputes into voting for strike action themselves , " said general secretary Mark Serwotka .
" The government can avoid embarrassing and damaging strike action in Acas and elsewhere in the civil service by addressing low pay and paying a fair wage . "
On its website , Acas says it " aims to improve organisations and working life through better employment relations " .

Thirty minutes later , when the carousel stops going around , she looks at you with deep pity and asks if she can give you a ride somewhere .
That 's the moment to go straight back to the ticket counter .
Mr. Jealousy
At first , he 'll get a little short with a waiter who flirts with you .
Then he 'll be exasperated by how long you and the postmaster discuss the rising price of stamps .
When he points out that you and your brother hug too long to be appropriate or that your gynecologist is a lesbian and obviously has the hots for you , it 's time to give him his walking papers .
However flattering his jealousies may seem in the first five minutes of your relationship , they 'll get old and confining more quickly than you can imagine , and when you do finally break up with him , he will hang the scarves you left behind on your trees like nooses and follow you and the next man you date all over town .
The Bully
This is the man who sits you down , grabs your arm , pulls your hair , or pokes your chest .
While most of us know better than to let ourselves get socked in the mouth the way Ralph Kramden was always threatening to do to Alice ( but even then never following through ) , there 's a whole universe of more " minor " infractions in the violence department that should disqualify your new beau instantaneously ( but all too often does not ) .
The Two - Timer
For the first time since you 've been dating , he 's too sick to make a date .
You try to ignore the fact that it happens to be your birthday , and you assemble the ingredients for your famous chicken soup .
You drop it off inside his door .
Two days later , he 's still sick , but you 've been invited over .
You ask if you can heat up some soup for him , and he says , in a small , congested voice , " That would be wonderful . "
You pour the soup from the Tupperware into the pot , and you see that there are mushrooms in it .
Your famous chicken soup does n't contain mushrooms .
Conclude that this man has another source of soup and will continue to cheat on you for as long as you give him the chance .
The " Liberated " Man
I used to have a friend who said , " I seem to have a very liberating effect on whatever man I 'm dating .
We go on three dates , and the next thing I know he 's moved in with me , he 's quit his job , and his car is up on blocks in my yard . "
Certain men are more prone to this type of liberation than others , I have found : Carpenters , river guides , and flamenco guitarists all fall into the category of men who are perfectly willing to hand themselves over to the care of a good woman , as well as visual artists , stage performers , and racers ( ski , bike , boat ) of all kinds .
The Betrayed
I seem to have dated an inordinate number of men who have just been left by a woman for a woman .
In general , these men are angry beyond all reason , no matter to what lengths they may go to disguise it , and if you date one , be ready to give up all your girlfriends , or you will be accused of being a lesbian , too .
The Narcissist
He does n't like your dog ?
Do we even need to talk about this one ?
Put it at the top of the category that includes he wo n't make eye contact with your kid , he does n't want to meet your sister , and he whines the first time you make plans with your girlfriend .
A man threatened by the love you have for the dog you sleep with is going to be threatened by more things than you can name .
Dating him is inviting the type of conflict into your life that will make you tired before you even get up in the morning .
Mr. Resentment
Pay close attention to how he handles your accomplishments .
If you get a promotion with a raise and he breaks it down to show you how it really only amounts to six dollars a day after taxes , that 's the first strike .
When he uses any expression like " your little project , " count that as two .
Just because men are having a hard time adjusting to the idea that women are capable breadwinners does n't mean you have to martyr yourself into helping them make the transition .
There are men out there who are more than happy to bask in the glow their women cast and to consider your talents a positive reflection on them .
The Virtual Lover
What a relief it is when a man does n't try to force you into bed on the first date .
How charmed you are when , on the third date , he says he wants to wait until " you both ca n't stand it anymore . "
How sympathetic you become when , on the sixth date , he tells you how badly he was hurt by your predecessor .
How confused you are six months later when you 've realized his pager goes off every time you get naked , but he 's still sending you roses and talking teddy bears .
A surprising number of great romancers out there never get around to having sex .
To the date - weary woman , this can seem like not the worst combination , but beware .
Eventually he will blame his problems on the smell of your breath or the size of your thighs .
The Guy Who Had the Happiest Childhood This Side of the Beav
His mother was perfect ; his father never smoked or drank or cheated .
He hates the way his friends blame their parents for everything , when he and his seven brothers and sisters had love pouring down on them from the moment they woke in the morning until they went to bed .
However refreshing this might sound the first time you hear it , listen carefully for a voice that is trying to convince itself , listen for the creak and crack of a personal mythology in the throes of shattering .
When it comes crashing to the ground , it 's going to make a very big noise , and most likely your relationship will come crashing down with it .

Gen William Ward said Africom 's intent had been misunderstood
Most African countries have been wary of plans to base the command , Africom , on the continent .
Africom 's commander , Gen William Ward , said there were no plans to create large US garrisons on the continent .
The military command was created last year to unite responsibilities shared by three other US regional commands .
The US plan had been misunderstood by some African countries , Gen Ward told the BBC .
The key aim of Africom was to build the capacity of African countries for security and peacekeeping , he said , adding there were no plans to move the headquarters for at least a year .
African doubts
Nigerian President Umaru Yar 'Adua announced in November that he would not allow his country to host an Africom base and that he was also opposed to any such bases in West Africa .
South Africa and Libya have also voiced strong reservations .
Only Liberia , which has historic links to the US , has offered to host it .
There has been concern that Africom is really an attempt to protect US oil and mineral interests in Africa , amid growing competition for resources from Asian economies , says the BBC's Alex Last in the Nigerian capital Abuja .
Then there are fears about the continent being drawn into the US war on terror , our correspondent adds .
Gen Ward said Africom was not about militarisation but consolidating existing operations under one single command , while helping Africans with military training and supporting peacekeeping and aid operations .

9/11 was one of the most pivotal days in world history .
Its impact will be felt for years to come .
You owe it to yourself to go beyond the sound bites and the simplified official story .
This is an extremely complicated story with many players and motives .
Not everything makes sense or fits neatly together .
It 's a story full of espionage , deceit , and lies .
But if there are forces out there tricking us , they can only succeed if we , the general public , remain ignorant and passive .
We are limiting our sources in this 9/11 research to those one might call " mainstream . "
It 's not that one can only trust the mainstream media .
In fact , much of the best reporting today is coming from alternative media .
But many people are initially very skeptical .
Some of the 9/11 research below may seem very hard to believe .
Yet remember that each entry below is reported by respected major media sources and can easily be verified by clicking on the links provided to the original source .
A number of foreign media sources are used in this 9/11 research summary , especially since these stories have often received much more attention in Europe than in the US .
But we 've tried to use common sense .
For instance , a story in a Pakistani newspaper that reflects poorly on Pakistan would be much less likely to be propaganda than the same story coming from an Indian newspaper .
In a few cases we 've used partisan sources to add more detail .
Information or comments from partisan sources ( including our own comments ) is either italicized , or noted as such .
After seeing the importance of what 's being hidden , you will very likely want to join in working together to build a brighter future .

1982 -1991 : Afghan opium production skyrockets from 250 tons in 1982 to 2,000 tons in 1991 , coinciding with CIA support and funding of the mujaheddin .
[ Star Tribune , 9/30/01 ]
1984 : Bin Laden moves to Peshawar , a Pakistani town bordering Afghanistan , and is running a front organization for the mujaheddin known as MAK , which funnels money , arms and fighters from the outside world into the Afghan war .
[ New Yorker , 1/24/00 ]
" MAK was nurtured by Pakistan 's state security services , the Inter - Services Intelligence agency , or ISI , the CIA 's primary conduit for conducting the covert war against Moscow 's occupation . "
[ MSNBC , 8/24/98 ]
He becomes closely tied to the warlord Gulbuddin Hekmatyar , and greatly strengthens Hekmatyar 's opium smuggling operations .
[ Le Monde , 9/14/01 ]
Hekmatyar had ties with bin Laden , the CIA and drug running , and has also been called " an ISI stooge and creation " by the Wall Street Journal .
[ Atlantic , 5/96 , Asia Times , 11/15/01 ]
Mid-1980's :
The ISI starts a special cell of agents who use profits from heroin production for covert actions " at the insistence of the CIA . "
This cell promotes the cultivation of opium and extraction of heroin in Pakistani territory as well as in the Afghan territory under mujaheddin control for being smuggled into Soviet controlled areas , in order to turn the Soviet troops into heroin addicts .
After the withdrawal of Soviet troops , the ISI 's heroin cell started using its network of refineries and smugglers for smuggling heroin to Western countries and using the money as a supplement to its legitimate economy .
[ Financial Times , Asian edition , 8/10/01 ]
The ISI grows so powerful on this money , that Time magazine later states , " Even by the shadowy standards of spy agencies , the ISI is notorious .
It is commonly branded ' a state within the state , ' or Pakistan 's ' invisible government . ' "
[ Time , 5/6/02 ]
March 1985 : The US decides to escalate the war in Afghanistan .
The CIA , British MI6 and the ISI agree to launch guerrilla attacks from Afghanistan into then Soviet - controlled Tajikistan and Uzbekistan , attacking military installations , factories and storage depots within Soviet territory until the end of the war .
The CIA also begins supporting the ISI in recruiting radical Muslims from around the world to come to Pakistan and fight with the Afghan mujaheddin .
The CIA gives subversive literature and Korans to the ISI , who carry them into the Soviet Union .
Eventually , around 35,000 Muslim radicals from 43 Islamic countries will fight with the Afghan mujaheddin .
Tens of thousands more will study in the hundreds of new radical Islamic schools funded by the ISI and CIA in Pakistan .

In the late 1980's , Pakistan 's Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto , feeling the mujaheddin network has grown too strong , tells President George Bush Sr. , " You are creating a Frankenstein . "
But the warning goes unheeded .

March 1991 : Although the Gulf War against Iraq just ended , the US does not withdraw all of its soldiers from Saudi Arabia , but stations some 15,000 - 20,000 there permanently .
[ Nation , 2/15/99 ]
In 1991 , President Bush Sr. falsely claims that all US troops have withdrawn .
[ Guardian , 12/21/01 ]
Their presence is n't admitted until 1995 , and there has never been an official explanation as to why they are there .
The Nation postulates that they are there to prevent a coup .
Saudi Arabia has an incredible array of high - tech weaponry , but may lack the expertise to use it and local soldiers may have conflicting loyalties .
In 1998 , bin Laden will release a statement : " For more than seven years the United States has been occupying the lands of Islam in the holiest of places , the Arabian peninsula , plundering its riches , dictating to its rulers , humiliating its people , terrorizing its neighbors , and turning its bases in the peninsula into a spearhead through which to fight the neighboring Muslim peoples . "
[ Nation , 2/15/99 ]
July 5 , 1991 : The Bank of England shuts down the Bank of Credit and Commerce International ( BCCI ) , the largest Muslim bank in the world .
This bank based in Pakistan financed numerous Muslim terrorist organizations and laundered money generated by illicit drug trafficking and other illegal activities , including arms trafficking .
Bin Laden and many other terrorists had accounts there .
American and British governments knew about all this yet kept the bank open for years .
The ISI had major connections to the bank .
But , as later State Department reports indicate , Pakistan remains a major drug trafficking and money laundering center despite the bank 's closing .
[ Detroit News , 9/30/01 ]
The Washington Post claims , " The CIA used BCCI to funnel millions of dollars to the fighters battling the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan . "
A French intelligence report in 2001 will state , " The financial network of bin Laden , as well as his network of investments , is similar to the network put in place in the 1980s by BCCI for its fraudulent operations , often with the same people ( former directors and cadres of the bank and its affiliates , arms merchants oil merchants , Saudi investors ) . "
A senior US investigator will say US agencies were looking into these ties because " they just make so much sense , and so few people from BCCI ever went to jail . "

1993 ( A ) : Canadian police arrest Ali Mohamed , a high - ranking al - Qaeda figure .
However , they release him when the FBI says he is a US agent .
[ Globe and Mail , 11/22/01 ]
Mohamed , a former US Army sergeant , then will continue to work for al - Qaeda for a number of years .
He trains bin Laden 's personal bodyguards and trains a terrorist cell in Kenya that later blows up the US embassy there .
Meanwhile , at least between 1993 and 1997 he tells secrets to the FBI about al - Qaeda 's operations .
He is arrested in late 1998 and subsequently convicted of his role in the 1998 US embassy bombing in Kenya .
[ CNN , 10/30/98 , Independent , 11/1/98 ]
Says a former Egyptian intelligence officer : " For five years he was moving back and forth between the US and Afghanistan .
It 's impossible the CIA thought he was going there as a tourist .
If the CIA had n't caught on to him , it should be dissolved and its budget used for something worthwhile . "
[ Wall Street Journal , 11/26/01 ]
1993 ( B ) : One of bin Laden 's men buys a jet from the US military –and it was the Pentagon which unwittingly gave permission for the aircraft to leave the base .
This aircraft is later used to transport missiles from Pakistan that kill US special forces in Somalia .
Bin Laden also has some of his followers begin training as pilots in US flight schools .
[ Sunday Herald , 9/16/01 ]
1993 ( C ) :
An expert panel commissioned by the Pentagon postulates that an airplane could be used as a missile to bomb national landmarks .
But the panel decides not to publish this idea in their report , Terror 2000 , partly in fear of inspiring terrorists .
However , in 1994 one of the panel 's experts will write in Futurist magazine : " Targets such as the World Trade Center not only provide the requisite casualties but , because of their symbolic nature , provide more bang for the buck .
In order to maximize their odds for success , terrorist groups will likely consider mounting multiple , simultaneous operations with the aim of overtaxing a government 's ability to respond . "
[ Washington Post , 10/2/01 ]
February 26 , 1993 : An attempt to blow up the WTC fails .
Six people are killed in the misfired blast .
Analysts later determine that had the terrorists not made a minor error in the placement of the bomb , both towers could have fallen and up to 50,000 people could have been killed .
The attempt is organized by Ramzi Yousef , who has close ties to bin Laden .
[ Congressional Hearings , 2/24/98 ]
The New York Times later reports on Emad Salem , an undercover agent who ends up being the key government witness in the trial against the bomber .
Salem testifies that the FBI knew about the attack beforehand and told him they would thwart it by substituting a harmless powder for the explosives .
However , this plan was called off by an FBI supervisor , and the bombing was not stopped .
[ New York Times , 10/28/93 ]
Why did the FBI seemingly let the terrorists go ahead with the bombing ?
Several of the bombers were trained by the CIA to fight in the Afghan war - the CIA later concludes in internal documents that it was " partly culpable " for this bombing attempt .
[ Independent , 11/1/98 ]
One of the attackers left a message found by investigators stating , " Next time , it will be very precise . "
9/11 can be seen as a completion of this failed attack .

He meets with two FBI agents and an Assistant US Attorney .
" We gave them a sampling of the documents and put them on the table , " says his lawyer , " but the agents refused to accept them . "

A lone pilot crashes a small plane onto the White House grounds , just missing the President 's bedroom .
An Air France flight is hijacked by a terrorist group linked to al - Qaeda , with the aim of crashing it into the Eiffel Tower , but French Special Forces storm the plane before it takes off .
[ New York Times , 10/3/01 ]
September 1994 : Starting as Afghani exiles in Pakistan religious schools , the Taliban begin their conquest of Afghanistan .
[ MSNBC , 10/2/01 ]
" The Taliban are widely alleged to be the creation of Pakistan 's military intelligence [ the ISI ] .
Experts say that explains the Taliban 's swift military successes . "
[ CNN , 10/5/96 ]
Less often reported is that the CIA worked with the ISI to create the Taliban .
A long - time regional expert with extensive CIA ties says : " I warned them that we were creating a monster . "
He adds that even years later , " The Taliban are not just recruits from ' madrassas ' ( Muslim theological schools ) but are on the payroll of the ISI . "
[ Times of India , 3/7/01 ]
The same claim is made on CNN in February 2002 .
[ CNN , 2/27/02 ]
The Wall Street Journal will state in November 2001 : " Despite their clean chins and pressed uniforms , the ISI men are as deeply fundamentalist as any bearded fanatic ; the ISI created the Taliban as their own instrument and still supports it . "
[ Asia Times , 11/15/01 ]
1995 : For the first time , though not the last , the government of Sudan offers the US all of its files on bin Laden and al - Qaeda .
The US turns down the offer .
Bin Laden had been living in Sudan since 1991 , because there were no visa requirements to live there .
Sudan was surveilling him , collecting a " vast intelligence database on Osama bin Laden and more than 200 leading members of his al - Qaeda terrorist network ... [ The US was ] offered thick files , with photographs and detailed biographies of many of his principal cadres , and vital information about al - Qaeda 's financial interests in many parts of the globe . "

[ Washington Post , 10/5/98 ]
1996 ( A ) : FBI investigators are prevented from carrying out an investigation into two relatives of bin Laden .
The FBI wanted to learn more about Abdullah bin Laden , " because of his relationship with the World Assembly of Muslim Youth [ WAMY ] - a suspected terrorist organization . "
Abdullah was the US director of WAMY and lived with his brother Omar in Falls Church , Virginia , a town just outside Washington .
WAMY has its offices at 5613 Leesburg Pike .
Remarkably , it is later determined that four of the 9/11 hijackers lived at 5913 Leesburg Pike at the same time the two bin Laden brothers were there .
A high - placed intelligence official tells the Guardian : " there were always constraints on investigating the Saudis .
There were particular investigations that were effectively killed . "
An unnamed US source says to the BBC , " There is a hidden agenda at the very highest levels of our government . "
[ BBC Newsnight , 11/6/01 , Guardian , 11/7/01 ]
1996 ( B ) : An Israeli think tank publishes a paper entitled " A Clean Break : A New Strategy for Securing the Realm . "
The paper is n't much different from other Israeli right - wing papers at the time , except the authors : the lead writer is Richard Perle , now chairman of the Defense Policy Board in the US , and very influential with President Bush .
Several of the other authors now hold key positions in Washington .
The paper advises the new , right - wing Israeli leader Binyamin Netanyahu to make a complete break with the past by adopting a strategy " to engage every possible energy on rebuilding Zionism ... "
The first step would be the removal of Saddam Hussein in Iraq .
A war with Iraq would destabilize the entire Middle East , allowing governments in Syria , Iran , Lebanon and other countries to be replaced .
" Israel will not only contain its foes ; it will transcend them , " the paper concludes .
[ Guardian , 9/3/02 , see the original paper here ]
1996 ( C ) : The Saudi Arabian government starts paying huge amounts of money to al - Qaeda , becoming its largest financial backer .
They also give money to other extremist groups throughout Asia .
This money vastly increases the capability of al - Qaeda .

A legal team involved in a 9/11 lawsuit later claims they have a transcript made by French intelligence of a meeting of Saudi princes and business leaders in Paris this year in which the Saudis agree to continue sponsoring bin Laden 's network .
There is a similar follow up meeting two years later .
[ Minneapolis Star Tribune , 8/16/02 ]
Says one US official , " '96 is the key year ...
Bin Laden hooked up to all the bad guys - it's like the Grand Alliance - and had a capability for conducting large - scale operations . "
The Saudi regime , he says , had " gone to the dark side . "
Electronic intercepts by the NSA " depict a regime increasingly corrupt , alienated from the country 's religious rank and file , and so weakened and frightened that it has brokered its future by channeling hundreds of millions of dollars in what amounts to protection money to fundamentalist groups that wish to overthrow it . "
US officials later privately complain " that the Bush Administration , like the Clinton Administration , is refusing to confront this reality , even in the aftermath of the September 11th terrorist attacks . "
[ New Yorker , 10/22/01 ]
1996 ( D ) : The CIA 's Counter - Terrorism Center creates a special unit to focus specifically on bin Laden .
About 10 - 15 individuals are assigned to the unit initially .

1996 -2000 : The CIA officer in charge of running operations against Al Qaeda from Washington writes , " I speak with firsthand experience ( and for several score of CIA officers ) when I state categorically that during this time senior White House officials repeatedly refused to act on sound intelligence that provided multiple chances to eliminate Osama bin Laden . "
[ Los Angeles Times , 12/5/04 ]
In late 1998 , President Clinton signs a directive authorizing the CIA to plan an assassination of bin Laden .
The CIA draws up detailed profiles of bin Laden 's daily routines , where he sleeps , and his travel arrangements .
The assassination never happens , supposedly because of inadequate intelligence .
An officer who helped draw up the plans says , " We were ready to move " but " we were not allowed to do it because of this stubborn policy of risk avoidance ...
It is a disgrace . "
[ Philadelphia Inquirer , 9/16/01 ]
From 1998 to 2000 , the US permanently stations two submarines in the Indian Ocean to hit al - Qaeda with cruise missiles on short notice .
Six to ten hours advance warning is needed to review the decision , program the cruise missiles and have them reach their target .
On at least three occasions , spies in Afghanistan report bin Laden 's location with information suggesting he would remain there for some time .
Each time , Clinton approves the strike .
Each time , CIA Director
Tenet says the information is not reliable enough , and the attack can not go forward .
[ New York Times , 12/30/01 ]
1996 - 2001 : Federal authorities are aware for years before 9/11 that suspected terrorists with ties to Osama bin Laden are receiving flight training at schools in the US and abroad .
In 1996 , FBI agents visit two flight school operators to obtain information about several Arab pilots who are eventually convicted of plotting to bomb U.S. airliners .
In 1998 , FBI agents question officials from Airman Flight School in Norman , Okla . , about a graduate later identified in court testimony as a pilot for bin Laden .
One convicted terrorist even confesses that his planned role in a terror attack was to crash a plane into CIA headquarters .
Three days after 9/11 , FBI Director Mueller describes reports that several of the hijackers had received flight training in the US as news .
A senior government official later acknowledges that law enforcement officials were aware that up to a dozen people with links to bin Laden had attended U.S. flight schools .

Sudan 's Minister of Defense engages in secret negotiations with the CIA in Washington .
Sudan offers to extradite bin Laden to anywhere he might stand trial .
US officials turn down the offer , but insist that bin Laden leave the country for anywhere but Somalia .

April 1996 : In continuing negotiations between the US and Sudan , the US again rejects Sudan 's offer to turn over voluminous files about bin Laden and al - Qaeda ( See also 1995 and May 2000 ) .
Another American involved in the secret negotiations later says that the US could have used Sudan 's offer to keep an eye on bin Laden , but that the efforts were blocked by another arm of the federal government .
" I 've never seen a brick wall like that before .
Somebody let this slip up , " he says .
" We could have dismantled his operations and put a cage on top .
That 's the story , and that 's what could have prevented September 11 .
I knew it would come back to haunt us . "

According to Senator Hart , Congress was taking the commission 's suggestions seriously , but then , " Frankly , the White House shut it down . "
Interestingly , both this commission and the Bush Administration were already assuming a new cabinet level National Homeland Security Agency would be enacted eventually even as the general public remained unaware of the term and the concept .

Late July 2001 ( B ) : David Schippers , noted conservative Chicago lawyer and the House Judiciary Committee 's chief investigator in the Clinton impeachment trial , later claims that FBI agents in Chicago and Minnesota contact him around this time and tell him that a terrorist attack is going to occur in lower Manhattan .
According to Schippers , the agents had been developing extensive information on the planned attack for many months .
However , the FBI soon pulls them off the terrorist investigation and threatens them with prosecution under the National Security Act if they go public with the information .
As a result , they contact Schippers hoping he can persuade the government to take action .
Schippers tries to pass the information on to high government officials , but apparently his efforts are ignored .
Partly in conjunction with Judicial Watch , the public interest law firm , Schippers is now representing at least ten FBI agents in a suit against the US government in an attempt to have their testimony subpoenaed , which would enable them to legally tell what they know without going to jail .

To make doubly sure the message gets through it is passed through an Arab intermediary to a German intelligence agent .
The message states that a major attack , code named " The Big Wedding , " is planned inside the US , and that aircraft will be used .
" When it became clear that the information was embarrassing to Bush Administration officials and congressmen , who at first denied that there had been any such warnings before September 11 , senior Jordanian officials backed away from their earlier confirmations . "
Christian Science Monitor calls the story " confidently authenticated " even though Jordan has backed away from it .
[ International Herald Tribune , 5/21/02 , Christian Science Monitor , 5/23/02 ]
August 2001 ( A ) : The German newspaper Der Spiegel later reports that this month the US company Raytheon landed a 727 six times in a military base in New Mexico without any pilots on board .
This was done to test equipment making future hijackings more difficult , by allowing ground control to take over the flying of a hijacked plane .
[ Der Spiegel , 10/28/01 ]
Even though Der Spiegel got their information directly from Raytheon , most media reports after 9/11 suggest such technology is currently impossible .
For instance , the Observer quotes an expert who says " the technology is pretty much there " but still untried .
[ Observer , 9/16/01 ]
The New York Times reports on a Bush speech in which he mentioned that the government would give grants to research " new technology , probably far in the future , allowing air traffic controllers to land distressed planes by remote control . "
[ New York Times , 9/28/01 ]
August 2001 ( B ) :
At least six 9/11 hijackers , including all of those that boarded Flight 77 , live in Laurel , Maryland from about this time .
NSA expert James Bamford later states , " the terrorist cell that eventually took over the airliner that crashed into the Pentagon ended up living , working , planning and developing all their activities in Laurel , Maryland , which happens to be the home of the NSA .
So they were actually living alongside NSA employees as they were plotting all these things . "
[ Washington Post , 9/19/01 , BBC , 6/21/02 ]
August 2001 ( C ) : The French magazine Maximale and the Moroccan newspaper al - Ittihad al - Ichtiraki later simultaneously report that a Moroccan agent named Hassan Dabou had penetrated al - Qaeda to the point of getting close to bin Laden by this time .
Dabou claims he learns that bin Laden is " very disappointed " that the 1993 bombing had not toppled the WTC , and plans " large scale operations in New York in the summer or fall of 2001 . "
Dabou is called to the US to report this information directly , and in so doing blows his cover , losing his ability to gather more intelligence .

August 2001 ( D ) : Russian President Putin later states that suicide pilots are training for attacks on US targets .
[ Fox News , 5/17/02 ]
The head of Russian intelligence also states , " We had clearly warned them " on several occasions , but they " did not pay the necessary attention . "
[ Agence France - Presse , 9/16/01 ]
A Russian newspaper on September 12 , 2001 claims that " Russian Intelligence agents know the organizers and executors of these terrorist attacks .
More than that , Moscow warned Washington about preparation to these actions a couple of weeks before they happened . "
Interestingly , the article claims that at least two of the terrorists were Muslim radicals from Uzbekistan .

August 2001 ( E ) : Former CIA agent Robert Baer is advising a prince in a Persian Gulf royal family , when a military associate of this prince passes information to him about a " spectacular terrorist operation " that will take place shortly .
He is also given a computer record of around 600 secret al - Qaeda operatives in Saudi Arabia and Yemen .
The list includes 10 names that will be placed on the FBI 's most wanted terrorists list after 9/11 .
He is also given evidence that a Saudi merchant family had funded the USS Cole bombing , and that the Yemeni government is covering up information related to that bombing .
At the military officer 's request , he offers all this information to the Saudi Arabian government .
But an aide to the Saudi defense minister , Prince Sultan , refuses to look at the list or to pass the names on ( Sultan is later sued for his complicity in the 9/11 plot ) .
Baer also passes the information on to a senior CIA official and the CIA 's Counter - Terrorism Center , but there is no response or action .
Large sections of Baer 's book are blacked out , having been censored by the CIA .

Early August 2001 : Britain gives the US another warning about an al - Qaeda attack .
The previous British warning was vague as to method , but this warning specifies multiple airplane hijackings .
This warning is included in Bush 's briefing on August 6 . [ Sunday Herald , 5/19/02 ]
August 6 , 2001 : President Bush receives a classified intelligence briefing at his Crawford , Texas ranch indicating that bin Laden might be planning to hijack commercial airliners .
Titled " Bin Ladin Determined to Strike in US , " the memo focuses on the possibility of terrorist attacks inside the US , with the WTC specifically mentioned .
Yet Bush later states the briefing " said nothing about an attack on America . "
[ CNN , 4/12/04 , Washington Post , 4/12/04 , White House , 4/11/04 ] National Security Advisor
Rice claims the memo was " fuzzy and thin . "
[ Newsweek , 5/27/02 , New York Times , 5/16/02 , Die Zeit , 10/1/02 ]
A Congressional report later describes this memo mentioning " that members of al - Qaeda , including some US citizens , had resided in or traveled to the US for years and that the group apparently maintained a support structure here .
The report cited uncorroborated information obtained in 1998 that bin Laden wanted to hijack airplanes to gain the release of US - held extremists .
It also described FBI judgments about patterns of activity consistent with preparations for hijackings or other types of attacks , and a number of bin Laden - related investigations underway . "
[ Senate Intelligence Committee , 9/18/02 ]
Incredibly , the New York Times later reports that Bush " broke off from work early and spent most of the day fishing . "
[ New York Times , 5/25/02 ]
The existence of this memo is kept secret until May 2002 .

August 8 - 15 , 2001 : At some point between these dates , Israel warns the US that an al - Qaeda attack is imminent .
[ Fox News , 5/17/02 ]
Two high ranking agents from the Mossad come to Washington and warn the FBI and CIA that from 50 to 200 terrorists have slipped into the US and are planning " a major assault on the United States . "
They say indications point to a " large scale target " , and that Americans would be " very vulnerable . "
They add there could be Iraqi connections to the al - Qaeda attack .
[ Telegraph , 9/16/01 , Los Angeles Times ,
9/20/01 , Ottawa Citizen , 9/17/01 ]
The Los Angeles Times later retracts the story after a CIA spokesman says , " There was no such warning .
Allegations that there was are complete and utter nonsense . "
[ Los Angeles Times , 9/21/01 ]
In light of later revelations of a Mossad spy ring trailing numerous Muslim terrorists in the US , it is easy to see that Mossad could have had this information .
August 13 - 15 , 2001 : Zacarias Moussaoui trains at the Pan Am International Flight School in Minneapolis , Minnesota , where he pays $ 8,300 ( $ 1500 by credit card and the remainder in cash ) to use a Boeing 474 Model 400 aircraft simulator .
After just one day of training , most of the staff is suspicious that he 's a terrorist .
They discuss " how much fuel [ is ] on board a 747-400 , and how much damage that could cause if it hit [s ] anything . "
They call the FBI with their concerns later that day .
[ New York Times , 2/8/02 , Senate Intelligence Committee , 10/17/02 ]
Failing to get much initial interest from the FBI , the flight instructor tells the FBI agents , " Do you realize how serious this is ?
This man wants training on a 747 .
A 747 fully loaded with fuel could be used as a weapon ! "
[ New York Times , 2/8/02 ]
August 15 , 2001 : Based on the concerns of flight school staff , Zacarias Moussaoui is arrested and detained in Minnesota on the excuse of an immigration violation .
[ Time , 5/27/02 , some reports say the 16th because the arrest happened late at night ]
The FBI confiscates his possessions , including a computer laptop , but do n't have a search warrant to search through them .
But when arresting him , they note he possesses two knives , fighting gloves and shin guards , and had prepared " through physical training for violent confrontation . "
An FBI interview of him adds more concerns .
For example , he is supposedly in the US working as a " marketing consultant " for a computer company , but is unable to provide any details of his employment .
Nor can he convincingly explain his $ 32,000 bank balance .
[ MSNBC , 12/11/01 , Senate Intelligence Committee , 10/17/02 ]
An FBI report states that when asked about his trips to Pakistan , the gateway to Afghanistan , " the questioning caused him to become extremely agitated , and he refused to discuss the matter further . "
The report also notes " Moussaoui was extremely evasive in many of his answers . "
[ CNN , 9/28/02 ]
His roommate is interviewed on the same day , and tells agents that Moussaoui believes it is " acceptable to kill civilians who harm Muslims , " that Moussaoui approves of Muslims who die as " martyrs " , and says Moussaoui might be willing to act on his beliefs .
[ Washington Post , 5/24/02 ]
But Minnesota FBI agents quickly become frustrated at the lack of interest in the case from higher ups .
[ New York Times , 2/8/02 ]
For instance , on August 21 , they e-mail FBI headquarters saying it's " imperative " that the Secret Service be warned of the danger a plot involving Moussaoui might pose to the President 's safety .
But no such warning is ever sent .
[ Senate Intelligence Committee , 10/17/02 , New York Times ,
10/18/02 ]
August 22 , 2001 ( A ) : The French give the FBI information requested about Zacarias Moussaoui .
[ Senate Intelligence Committee , 10/17/02 ]
The French say Moussaoui has ties with radical Islamic groups and recruits men to fight in Chechnya .
They believe he spent time in Afghanistan .
He had been on a French watch list for several years , preventing him from entering France .
A French justice official later says the government gave the FBI " everything we had " on Moussaoui , " enough to make you want to check this guy out every way you can .
Anyone paying attention would have seen he was not only operational in the militant Islamist world but had some autonomy and authority as well . "
[ Time , 5/27/02 ]
A senior French investigator later says " Even a neophyte working in some remote corner of Florida would have understood the threat based on what was sent . "
[ Time , 8/4/02 ]
The French Interior Minister also emphasizes , " We did not hold back any information . "
[ ABC News , 9/5/02 ]
But senior officials at FBI headquarters still maintain that the information " was too sketchy to justify a search warrant for his computer . "
[ Time , 8/4/02 ]
August 22 , 2001 ( B ) : Counter - terrorism expert John O'Neill quits the FBI .
He says it 's partly because of a recent power play against him , but also because of repeated obstruction of his investigations into al - Qaeda .
[ New Yorker , 1/14/02 ]
In his last act , he signs papers ordering FBI investigators back to Yemen to resume the USS Cole investigation , now that Barbara Bodine is leaving as ambassador ( they arrive a couple days before 9/11 ) .
He never hears the CIA warning about hijackers Alhazmi and Almihdhar sent out just one day later .
Because he fell out of favor a few months earlier , he also is never told about Ken Williams ' flight school memo , nor about the arrest of Zacarias Moussaoui [ PBS Frontline , 10/3/02 ] , nor is he at a June meeting when the CIA revealed some of what it knew about Alhazmi and Almihdhar .
[ PBS Frontline , 10/3/02 ]
The FBI New York office is eventually told of Walid Arkeh 's warning that the WTC would be attacked , but presumably not in time for O'Neill to hear it .
One can only wonder what the government 's " most committed tracker of Osama bin Laden and his al - Qaeda network of terrorists " [ New Yorker , 1/14/02 ] could have accomplished if he was aware of these things .
August 23 , 2001 ( A ) : According to German newspapers , the Mossad gives the CIA a list of terrorists living in the US , and say that they appear to be planning to carry out an attack in the near future .
It is unknown if these are the 19 9/11 , hijackers or if the number is a coincidence .
However , four names on the list are known and are names of 9/11 hijackers Nawaf Alhazmi , Khalid Almihdhar , Marwan Alshehhi , and Mohamed Atta .
[ Die Zeit , 10/1/02 , Der Spiegel , 10/1/02 , BBC , 10/2/02 , Ha'aretz , 10/3/02 ]
The Mossad appears to have learned about this through its " art student " spy ring .
Yet apparently this warning and list are not treated as particularly urgent by the CIA .
Nor are they passed on to the FBI .
It 's not clear if this warning influenced the adding of Alhazmi and Almihdhar to a terrorism watch list on this same day , and if so , why only those two .
[ Der Spiegel , 10/1/02 ]
Israel has denied that there were any Mossad agents in the US .
[ Ha'aretz , 10/3/02 ]
The US has denied knowing about Atta before 9/11 , despite other media reports to the contrary .
August 23 , 2001 ( B ) : John O'Neill begins his new job as head of security at the WTC .
[ New Yorker , 1/14/02 ]
A friend says to him , " Well , that will be an easy job .
They 're not going to bomb that place again . "
O'Neill replies , " Well actually they 've always wanted to finish that job .
I think they 're going to try again . "
On September 10 , he moves into his new office on the 34th floor of the North Tower .
That night , he tells colleague Jerry Hauer , " We 're due for something big .
I do n't like the way things are lining up in Afghanistan " ( a probable reference to the assassination of Afghan leader General Massoud on September 9 ) .
O'Neill is killed the next day in the 9/11 attack .

ユーザーの要件定義があいまいでシステム開発中も修正に次ぐ修正。プロジェクトは大幅に遅れて、予算が超過。しわ寄せは下請け、孫請けへ。デスマーチ……。新3Kともいわれるこんな日本のIT業界が2009年4月に大きく変わるかもしれない。そのきっかけとなるのが「工事進行基準」の原則義務付けだ。
【関連記事 】
工事進行基準を分かりやすく解説してみよう【基本編】
工事進行基準を分かりやすく解説してみよう【対応編】
工事進行基準（用語解説）とは会計基準の変更によって2009年4月にシステム・インテグレータ（SIer）など受注ソフトウェア開発業に原則として義務付けられる収益の計上方法。開発期間中にその売り上げと原価（費用）を、工事（ソフトウェア開発、システム開発）の進捗度に応じて、分散して計上する仕組みだ。
これま でSIerは、工事進行基準ではなく、開発終了時に売り上げと原価を一括計上できる「工事完成基準」（用語解説）を取るケースが多かった。一般的に日本のシステム開発は要件定義やユーザー企業との契約が明確でなく、開発中の手戻りや期間の超過が多い。開発終了後でないと売り上げや費用が算出できなかった。いわば、正確な見積もりをする前にどんぶり勘定で走り出してしまうプロジェクトが多かったといえる。
2009年4月からの工事進行基準の事実上の義務付けでこの状況がどう変わるのか。工事進行基準で開発の進捗度を表す方法としては、原価比例法（工事原価の見積もり総額に占める実際原価の割合から進捗度を導く方法）が用いられるケースが多くなると見られている。原価比例法を適用するには、当然、プロジェクトを開始する前に、開発の収益総額と原価の見積もりを確定する必要がある。そして、投入したコストによってプロジェクトの進捗を図るためには正確な工数管理、プロジェクトマネジメントが必要だ。IT業界はこれまでの仕事の仕方を大きく変える必要がある。
どんぶり勘定をやめて、開発が始まる前に要件定義を確定、正確なプロジェクトマネジメントを行うことは先進的なSIerにとってはすでに行っていること。しかし、昔ながらのあいまいなビジネスを行っているSIerにとっては痛みが大きいだろう。だが「近代化」へのチャンスだ。定着し、適正に運用されれば現場で働くエンジニアの労働環境の改善につながるかもしれない。

CNN is reporting that the Clinton and Obama campaign are " in formal talks " about ending her campaign .
Here ( h/t TPM ) is the video :
I do n't have a transcript to post , unfortunately .
It 's sourced to " Hillary Clinton 's inner circle " ; the Obama campaign denies that there are talks .
" Clinton 's inner circle " , whoever that might be , is quoted as saying that they are " pushing for some sort of graceful exit strategy " , and see three options .
The first is that Obama chooses someone else to be Vice President ; the second is that Obama publicly offers the VP slot to her and she declines ; the third is that somehow Obama and Clinton get together personally and work something out .
They do n't say much about option three .
Option two seems not to be working : they claim that the Obama people are worried that she might just take the VP slot .
But it 's what they say about the first that 's really striking .
They think that for Obama to choose someone else as his running mate would be " a total dismissal " , and " totally unacceptable to their camp , one of them saying that it could mean open civil war within the party , " and that " it would n't mean that Clinton would n't campaign for Obama -- she would -- but she would do so like Bill Clinton campaigned for Al Gore , quite aloof .
They do not believe that this would be acceptable . "
I have been thinking about Clinton 's conduct ever since she compared her efforts to get the Florida and Michigan votes counted to abolitionists , suffragists , and the current crisis in Zimbabwe .
I agree with Josh Marshall that her attempts to gin up resentment and a sense that the nomination was stolen from her are toxic .
Even Ezra Klein , who has been a lot more open to Clinton than many people , has concluded that she is trying to ensure that Obama loses .
Since then , there have been a lot of stories wondering what on earth she is up to .
And while I have n't heard what the NYPost describes as a " Groundswell Of Calls For O - Hill Union " , there has definitely been a groundswell of stories about that alleged groundswell , much of which seems to be coming from the Clinton campaign itself .
There have also been a lot of stories asking : what does Obama need to do to keep her on board ?
Note what 's missing here : any sense that Clinton herself is a responsible moral agent .
People are writing about her as though she were a bomb that needed to be expertly defused , as opposed to a person who can govern her own life , and is responsible for her own choices .
I am aware that it must be hard to face the fact that you 've lost .
But it became clear that she was not going to win the nomination months ago -- I would say after Wisconsin , but certainly after Texas .
Moreover , this is not unprecedented .
People lose the nomination every four years .
Most of the time , they do not stay on until it is mathematically impossible for them to win ; they leave when it has become clear that they will not win .
They do not complain about disenfranchising all the states with later primaries , they do not threaten to keep their supporters home , and they certainly do not threaten " open civil war " if they do n't get nominated for Vice President .
On those rare occasions when some candidate does this in the absence of some truly monumental issue , we normally think that that candidate is a narcissistic and unprincipled person who has just shown why s/he should never , ever be President .
There is absolutely no reason not to apply these same standards to Hillary Clinton .
Right now , instead of floating demands in the press and comparing herself to abolitionists and suffragists , she could be telling her supporters that she lost fair and square ; that while there was a lot of sexism in the campaign , there was racism as well , and that sexism does not explain why a candidate with literally every institutional advantage over her opponent lost the nomination .
She could be reaching out to the voters who supported her in places where Obama has had trouble , and urging them to vote for him .
She could , in a word , be doing the right thing : trying to earn that respect she seems to want .
Instead , she 's throwing tantrums , making demands that she has no right to make , and threatening civil war .
I can't imagine a better demonstration of why she should not be President or Vice President .
Nor can I imagine a better demonstration of why some of us who are committed feminists are not happy with her as our standard - bearer .
She lost .
It happens .
If she were an adult or a professional , she would deal with it .
Apparently , she is neither .
SAN FRANCISCO ( Reuters ) - Powerset on Sunday unveiled tools for searching Wikipedia that use conversational phrasing instead of keywords , marking the first step of its challenge to established Web search services such as Google .
The Powerset homepage is seen in this handout photo .
REUTERS / Handout / Powerset
Powerset ’s technology breaks down the meaning of words and sentences into related concepts , freeing users from always needing to type the exact words they want to find .
The closely watched Silicon Valley start - up is offering a way of searching millions of entries in Wikipedia ’s online encyclopedia , helping users find detailed answers to questions rather than isolated links that require further research .
For example , a user who wants to know how many wives King Henry VIII had ( six , or two , depending on your definition of marriage ) can find an answer via Powerset 's service at tinyurl.com /5qpcr9 /.
San Francisco - based Powerset is looking to leapfrog the current generation of services that rely on keyword searches such as Google Inc , Yahoo Inc , Microsoft Corp and IAC InterActiveCorp ’s Ask.com .
“ The Wikipedia is becoming a microcosm of the most useful parts of the Web , ” said Greg Sterling , an Internet analyst with Sterling Market Intelligence .
“ This offers a powerful way to find what you are looking for against this subset of the Web . ”
While still a far cry from letting users search the World Wide Web , Powerset is using Wikipedia as a trial showcase for how its technology can be used to search a vast number of other websites using natural language phrases or questions .
Over time , it aims to partner with other high - quality data sites where information can be organized in a question and answer form that lends itself to Powerset search techniques .
Examples might include financial or patent filings , the CIA Factbook or Wikipedia - inspired clones , company officials said .
Powerset , which can be found at www.powerset.com/, looks beyond words to try to understand conceptual relationships that get closer to what a user may be searching for .
It analyzes each sentence and whole documents to do so .
Powerset plans eventually to make money selling advertising alongside its search services .
But for now , the 60 - employee company consists almost entirely of computer scientists and linguists .
It has no advertising staff and only a handful of marketing and support staff .
Sterling said it is likely to take years for Powerset to be able to search the Web on the scale Google now does using statistical ranking techniques to find relevant Web links .
“ What I do n’t know is how Powerset will perform on the wide open Web .
In a sense , this is a massive prototype using the relatively structured information of Wikipedia .
It is difficult to compare to what Google has built , ” Sterling said .
Sterling said a bigger danger to Google would be if rival Microsoft were to acquire Powerset and incorporate it into other search technologies it has .
Recently , Microsoft backed off a $ 44 billion bid for Yahoo to create a formidable rival to Google in Web search and online advertising .
“ This could become the basis of a Google - killer , ” Sterling said .
“ Someone like Microsoft might want to buy Powerset . ”
Spokesmen for Microsoft and Powerset declined to comment on rumors of a potential tie - up between the two companies .
FUN WITH “ FACT Z ”
Powerset offers richly annotated ways for searching inside Wikipedia entries to find related concepts .
Called “ Factz ” , these related ideas generate outlines , summaries and automated answers to users ’ questions .
“ Our system is a little more forgiving , ” Scott Prevost , general manager of Powerset , said in an interview on Sunday .
“ It is not looking for hard - word matches .
We are not searching for exact words , but concepts , ” he said .
The 2 - 1/2 - year - old start - up licensed natural language processing technology and related machine processing methods developed over three decades at the Xerox PARC research centre in Silicon Valley to create new consumer Web search services .
With tacit approval of the non-profit Wikimedia Foundation , the organization behind the Wikipedia , Powerset officials said they are hosting a copy of Wikipedia ’s 2.5 million English - language entries on its own computers .
This lets Powerset make links across the breadth of Wikipedia data .
“ What Powerset is doing is offering readers a natural - language search interface , and we think that is an interesting experiment , ” Mike Godwin , Wikimedia Foundation ’s general counsel , said in response to an emailed question about how the two organizations would work together .
In addition to Wikipedia , Powerset ’s new service also searches a related database called Freebase created by MetaWeb , another Web search start - up .
After decades of research and debate , natural language processing is finally poised to go mainstream , predicted Barney Pell , co-founder and chief technology officer .
“ 2008 is the year that semantic and linguistic technologies cross over into widespread consumer use , ” he said .
The Mars rover Spirit has hobbled along with a broken wheel for more than two years , dragging a groove through the sand as it investigates the Red Planet .
Scientists say it was this failed front wheel that led to an important discovery being announced today : Spirit has uncovered signs that ancient hot springs once bubbled or steamed on Mars .
They said those hot springs would have been similar to those found at Yellowstone National Park .
The finding is significant because it means the planet contained water and potentially was once habitable .
" If you go to places like that on our planet , like Yellowstone National Park , you find those places are literally teeming with life , " said Jack Farmer , an ASU Professor and a co-author of the paper .
Farmer and Steve Ruff , an ASU faculty research associate , are part of a 13 - person team that spent the past year analyzing the data that is being published in Friday 's Science journal .
Scientists became interested after they noticed a bright white substance in the trench created by Spirit 's bum wheel .
An ASU instrument aboard the rover confirmed the white material was nearly pure silica , a mineral that forms when abundant hot water reacts with rocks .
Spirit 's instruments are n't sophisticated enough to detect life , but the finding of a potentially habitable environment could guide a planned 2009 Mars rover mission .
Spirit is one of two golf cart - size rovers that landed on Mars more than four years ago and are exploring near the planet 's equator .
Their main goals are to investigate the planet 's geological history and understand what role water played in its development .
Scientists are interested in water because it's a basic requirement for life .
The rovers are the only missions operating on the Mars surface , although on Sunday they are scheduled to be joined by the University of Arizona - led Phoenix mission .
Phoenix targets an area far to the north .
UA scientists have identified the polar plains as having a good chance of revealing a habitat suitable for life because the icy terrain preserves the geologic history .
Phoenix is a stationary spacecraft so it cannot roam like the rovers .
It will use a nearly 8 - foot robotic arm to dig into the ice , scoop up samples and transfer them to an on - board chemistry lab .
ASU 's Farmer said the latest finding by Spirit is the rover 's most important to date .
In the past , Spirit has found meteorites and hints of water but nothing as dramatic as the nearly pure silica deposits uncovered by the broken wheel .
The research relied on an ASU infrared instrument aboard the rover called the Mini-Thermal Emission Spectrometer , known as Mini- TES , to detect the silica deposits .
ASU 's Ruff oversees daily operations of Mini-TES , and ASU Professor Phil Christensen designed the instrument .

Does this sound familiar ?
Muslim men are stripped in front of female guards and sexually humiliated .
A prisoner is made to wear a dog ’s collar and leash , another is hooded with women ’s underwear .
Others are shackled in stress positions for hours , held in isolation for months , and threatened with attack dogs .
You might think we are talking about that one cell block in Abu Ghraib , where President Bush wants the world to believe a few rogue soldiers dreamed up a sadistic nightmare .
These atrocities were committed in the interrogation centers in American military prisons in Iraq , Afghanistan and Guantánamo Bay , Cuba .
And they were not revealed by Red Cross officials , human rights activists , Democrats in Congress or others the administration writes off as soft - on - terror .
They were described in a painful report by the Justice Department ’s inspector general , based on the accounts of hundreds of F.B.I. agents who saw American interrogators repeatedly mistreat prisoners in ways that the agents considered violations of American law and the Geneva Conventions .
According to the report , some of the agents began keeping a “ war crimes file ”  until they were ordered to stop .
These were not random acts .
It is clear from the inspector general ’s report that this was organized behavior by both civilian and military interrogators following the specific orders of top officials .
The report shows what happens when an American president , his secretary of defense , his Justice Department and other top officials corrupt American law to rationalize and authorize the abuse , humiliation and torture of prisoners :
 Four F.B.I. agents saw an interrogator cuff two detainees and force water down their throats .
 Prisoners at Guantánamo were shackled hand - to - foot for prolonged periods and subjected to extreme heat and cold .
Deal or No Deal presents a bit of a conundrum .
Yes , it 's a fairly accurate PC - game rendition of the uberpopular NBC game show starring Mr. St. Elsewhere himself , Howie Mandel , and yes , it is a budget - priced game .
Fans of the game show are likely to squeal with delight at the prospect of being able to play their favorite game at home -- but before you run out and drop a twin on this one , stop and think .
Think to yourself , why ?
Why pay for a Deal or No Deal game , when dozens of free flash games with the same formula exist ( on NBC 's Web site , at that ) ?
Is it for the cheap , lousy minigames included ?
Is it for the promise of multiplayer action ?
Is it because you 're hopelessly in love with Howie Mandel 's soul patch ?
Ponder these questions as we delve deeper into the enigma that is the value of owning Deal or No Deal .
All those failed modeling careers ...
Deal or No Deal offers the exact game you 've probably seen on TV numerous times .
In this , the world 's most skill - free game show , contestants are offered 26 metal briefcases , each containing a dollar amount .
You start the show by picking one , and that one becomes your case .
Through of series of rounds , you then begin selecting the other cases on the board .
The idea is to try to eliminate all the low amounts currently displayed ( though the high amounts tend to disappear as well ) .
At the end of each round , a mysterious " banker , " who sits in a dark room staring at a computer screen , offers you an amount of money ( seemingly based on your play style , and the aggregate average of the amounts still left on the board ) to buy your case .
From there , it 's , " Deal , or no deal ? "
Get it ?
Good .
This PC game offers precisely the same game formula , but without the hope of winning real money .
Perhaps the one advantage is that this game offers the same pacing of the show , as well as many of Mandel 's trademark lines ( though not all of them , and the dialogue tends to start repeating after just a few plays ) , but apart from those bells and whistles , there 's not much on offer here to set the game apart from the many , many freeware versions of Deal or No Deal that exist all over the Internet .
Why buy the cow when the milk is free just about everywhere ?
Hopefully , it is n't for the " bonus features . "
Multiplayer and minigames are also offered in this package , and neither are very good .
Minigames consist of little more than a cheap slider puzzle , a memory game , and a three - card monte variant .
None of them are fun for more than a single play .
The multiplayer is perhaps the most intriguing option , since it futzes with the main game formula a bit and has you and another player trading off turns , trying to make the best deal possible .
There 's also a " family - friendly " version of the game , where players can create custom prizes .
Some of the default options include household chores and tasks for new parents ( changing diapers , feedings , and such ) .
While this might work for the most boring people alive , the rest of you can opt to create your own prizes .
Perhaps those with more active imaginations ( or , at the very least , filthier minds ) can create more - sordid prizes with their significant other (s ) .
Clearly , this is the most useful function the game has to offer .
But is that enough to make Deal or No Deal worth paying for ?
Hardly .
Sure , it 's amusing for the first one or two plays , and maybe there 's a bit of devious amusement to be had with the custom prize mode , but the fact remains that the necessity of owning a Deal or No Deal game just is n't there .
There is n't even that level of trivial skill involved that you tend to get with most game show games , because there 's no trivial knowledge required .
There 's no skill required at all !
You 're just picking random numbers and hoping for the best .
It 's all well and good to watch on TV when there 's real money involved , and there 's nothing wrong with playing something like this for free on the Internet .
But actually going to the trouble of paying for a fake - money version of it ?
That 's a poor deal any way you slice it .

Here ’s the problem :
My broadbandwiki browser application does two things for users : it shows them what broadband access people around them are using and it enables them to add themselves to the map so that their information can be helpful to others .
Clearly the data the users provide needs to be stored .
However , only some of this data is meant to be visible to other users .
Street addresses , for example , are used to generate latitude and longitude but are not meant to be publicly accessible even though they may later be used for engineering studies .
Controlling who has access to what data would be relatively straightforward if there were an application running on a server somewhere between the app running in the browser and the Amazon S3 servers where the data ’s stored – but there is no such server application in this case .
Nevertheless , the needed security CAN be maintained using available S3 tools .
Data on S3 is stored in buckets .
The model is simple ; you put objects ( lumps of data ) in buckets .
Each object has exactly one key by which it can be retrieved from the bucket .
Objects can also have reasonably elaborate headers .
You , the owner of the S3 buckets , get to decide who can read or write ( or change the permissions ) on a bucket by bucket basis .
Each object also has an object control list ( ACL ) associated with it which it does NOT inherit from its bucket ; the ACL is set when the object ’s created and may be changed later by those who have permission to change it .
So I set up a bucket called broadbandwiki for my beta ; anyone can read this bucket but only I can write to it or change its permissions .
Reading the bucket , however , does n’t mean reading the contents of the objects in the bucket ( they have their own permissions ) .
In practice , the right to read the bucket means the right to read the index of objects stored in the bucket which includes keys and creation dates for objects but does NOT include headers or payload .
Offline I used my secret key ( which should never be transmitted ) to generate very specific permissions to write a very specific type of object to this specific bucket .
The permission restricts the access policy of created objects so it ca n’t be used either to create objects which are user accessible or which I ca n’t access .
These encoded permissions signed with my secret key are safe to imbed in a browser page and to transmit .
The keys of the objects created and stored by the browser app include all the data which is supposed to be visible to ordinary users .
The payload of the objects contain the data meant to be protected .
When a user launches the browser , it reads the index of the broadbandwiki bucket ( which anyone can read ) and uses that to put pins on the map representing data supplied by prior users .
A beneficial side effect is that there are usually a thousand index records returned per read of the directory .
Much cheaper to get the data most users need out of the index than read each of a thousand records ( because Amazon charges for GETs ) .
When users put their own pin in the map , the presigned permission is used to make sure this is only the kind of object we want here and that other users will not have access to this data .
Problem pretty much solved .
The protected data – actually all the data – is retrieved by an administrative utility – whose user must know and input the secret key – but which never transmits that key .
The administrative program converts the data to an XML file before downloading so it can be fed into nearly any analysis tool .
Excel works fine .
An invaluable tool for anyone doing S3 development is a free Firefox addin called S3 Firefox Organizer .
I did donate to the tip jar , though .

Blu-ray is a type of high definition video disc taking over from DVDs
Slysoft says the new version of its AnyDVD programme allows users to make " backup security copies " of high definition movies .
The claim is a blow to Sony which developed the Blu-ray format .
The discs are protected by an anti-piracy system called BD +.
When it launched in 2007 , developers boasted it would not be cracked for 10 years .
Sony declined to comment .
SlySoft says it hacked the BD + technology in November .
It decided to wait for the result of the " format war " between Blu-ray and HD DVD before releasing a full product .
BD + is designed to react to attempts on its technology .
Its developers say they can re-lock copied discs , making them unusable in the future .
SlySoft reckons it is prepared for this .
Peer van Heuen from the company said : " The worst - case scenario is our boss locks us up with only bread and water in the company dungeon for three months until we are successful again . "
The Valerie Plame case is , by journalistic standards , ancient history , and naturally any follow - up on a once - important story is considered bad form .
Yet there is an interesting  and rather scary  new twist to the narrative .
It turns out that Scooter Libby and friends were n’t the first to " out " CIA agent Plame , whose alleged employer , a company known as Brewster Jennings , was really a cover for a CIA unit investigating nuclear proliferation issues .
The London Times reveals that a former top U.S. State Department official tipped off Turkish agents about Brewster Jennings ’ CIA connection , according to Sibel Edmonds , a former FBI translator assigned to produce English - language transcripts of intercepted conversations of Turkish targets  in this case recordings of Turkish embassy officials and a top State Department official discussing , among other things , Brewster Jennings ’ relationship to the CIA .
As the Times reports , the recordings were made " between the summer and autumn of 2001 .
At that time , foreign agents were actively attempting to acquire the West ’s nuclear secrets and technology .
Among the buyers were Inter - Services Intelligence ( ISI ) , Pakistan ’s intelligence agency , which was working with Abdul Qadeer Khan , the ‘ father of the Islamic bomb , ’ who in turn was selling nuclear technology to rogue states such as Libya . "
Plame and her unit were onto a black market nuclear network , run as a cooperative effort by the intelligence agencies of Pakistan , Turkey , and Israel .
Accordingly , the Turks were lured into hiring Brewster - Jennings as " consultants , " but when the high U.S. official learned of this , says Edmonds , he " contacted one of the foreign targets and said you need to stay away from Brewster Jennings because they are a cover for the government .
The target immediately followed up by calling several people to warn them about Brewster Jennings .
At least one of them was at the ATC [ American Turkish Council ] .
This person also called an ISI person to warn them . "
The Israeli connection is what ’s interesting about this covert operation , because it involves U.S. citizens , high government officials who have been part of an ongoing investigation that dates back to at least 1999 , the earliest year mentioned in the AIPAC indictment .
As Warren Strobel and Jonathan Landay of McClatchy News Service reported in 2004 :
" Several U.S. officials and law - enforcement sources said yesterday that the scope of the FBI probe of Pentagon intelligence activities appeared to go well beyond the [ Larry ] Franklin matter .
" FBI agents have briefed top White House , Pentagon , and State Department officials on the probe .
Based on those briefings , officials said , the bureau appears to be looking into other controversies that have roiled the Bush administration , some of which also touch [ Douglas ] Feith ’s office .
" They include how the Iraqi National Congress , a former exile group backed by the Pentagon , allegedly received highly classified U.S. intelligence on Iran ; the leaking of the name of CIA officer Valerie Plame to reporters ; and the production of bogus documents suggesting that Iraq tried to buy uranium for nuclear weapons from the African country of Niger .
Bush repeated the Niger claim in making the case for war against Iraq .
" ’ The whole ball of wax ’ was how one U.S. official privy to the briefings described the inquiry . ”
The whole ball of wax is a pretty tall order , but surely a major part of it is this nuclear black market business that Edmonds has clear evidence of .
Edmonds has been subjected to an unprecedented gag order , imposed by a judge in the name of preserving " state secrets "  yet what is being preserved , apparently , are n’t state secrets at all but the knowledge that our nuclear secrets are being stolen and sold to the highest bidder with the active collaboration of high U.S. government officials .
A whole gallery of top figures has been fingered by Edmonds , who has n’t mentioned any names yet has managed to identify the guilty parties by posting their photos on a Web site associated with her case .
The lack of coverage of this amazing  and quite frightening  story in the U.S. media is easily explained : anything having to do with the activities of Israeli intelligence in this country is sure to sink beneath the radar , although the London Times and a good number of international news outlets have picked up the details .
What is n’t so easily explained is the cover - up of criminal activities , including treason , by our very own Federal Bureau of Investigation .
The Times , seeking corroboration of Edmonds ’ story , filed a Freedom of Information Act request with the FBI , asking for a particular document :
" One of the documents relating to the case was marked 203A - WF - 210023 .
Last week , however , the FBI responded to a freedom of information request for a file of exactly the same number by claiming that it did not exist .
But The Sunday Times has obtained a document signed by an FBI official showing the existence of the file . "
Who is protecting what I called this treasonous camarilla from prosecution  and why have successive investigations into a number of activities by the same cabal of government officials been closed down , repeatedly , over the years ?
As Adrian Levy and Catherine Scott - Clark point out in their new book , Deception : Pakistan , the United States , and the Global Nuclear Weapons Conspiracy , the network associated with Pakistani scientist A.Q. Khan continues to operate in Europe , the Gulf , and Southeast Asia through a series of front companies .
They cite a study produced by the BND , Germany ’s intelligence agency , that found Pakistan is procuring nuclear - related materials and technology far in excess of its needs , leading experts to suspect they ’re funneling their nuclear assets into a global black market operation .
The chilling conclusion of the authors ought to send shivers down your spine :
" Most alarming was the finding that hundreds of thousands of components amassed by Khan had vanished since he had been put out of operation .
In other words , Pakistan has continued to sell nuclear weapons technology ( to clients known and unknown ) even as Musharraf denies it  which means either that the sales are being carried out with his secret blessing or that he is no more in control of Pakistan ’s nuclear program than he is of the bands of jihadis in his country . "
The Pakistanis think they are above reproach , at least publicly , by the U.S. authorities , and this strange immunity may have lethal consequences for us all :
" In 2001 , Inter - Services Intelligence ( ISI ) , Pakistan ’s powerful intelligence agency , had proof that Osama bin Laden had received in person two retired Pakistani nuclear scientists at his secret HQ in Afghanistan .
Both had become Islamist radicals in retirement .
" According to the son of one of them , bin Laden told them he had succeeded in acquiring highly enriched uranium from the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan and he wanted their help to turn it into a bomb .
Amazed , they explained that while they could help with the science of fissile materials , they were not weapons designers .
" Soon afterwards , a secret army audit discovered evidence that 40 canisters of highly enriched uranium ( HEU ) , the feedstuff for a nuclear bomb , were missing from the Kahuta enrichment labs outside Islamabad after A.Q. Khan retired .
Dr. Muhammad Shafiq ur - Rehman , an insider who is the son of one of Khan ’s former key aides , revealed : ‘ They could only account for 80 out of a supposed 120 canisters . ’ "
Okay , so let ’s see where this brings us : an underground network of spies and corrupt public officials is selling nuclear secrets worldwide , and al - Qaeda may very well have gotten its hands on enough lethal materials to make roughly 1,000 " dirty " bombs .
Not only that , but the public officials and Washington insiders connected to this network are being protected from prosecution .
The case files that document their treason have been withheld , and possibly destroyed .
Our brain - dead media , our kept pundits , and the " mainstream " outlets that determine if and when a news story is " legitimate " have systematically ignored the allegations of Sibel Edmonds , in spite of numerous endorsements of her credibility from two respected U.S. senators , the FBI ’s Office of the Inspector General , and numerous current and former FBI agents who share her frustration with the shameless cover - up of this important case .
It is absolutely outrageous that not a single major news organization in the U.S. has bothered to examine the charges made by Edmonds  especially when it is known that Islamist groups are still planning attacks on Western targets .
None Dare Call
It Treason was the title of a ubiquitous right - wing screed of the 1960s , remembered more for its high camp value than for anything the author had to say , but I ’ve always wanted to use it as the title of a column .
Now that I ’ve managed to do it , it does n’t seem half as funny anymore .
Is it really time to consider moving to , say , a Pacific atoll and waiting out the catastrophe looming just down the road a bit ?
I never thought I ’d say that , being temperamentally and ideologically opposed to " dropping out , " but one wonders , in the face of such a massive cover - up of this appalling danger to our immediate safety , if that is n’t the only alternative .

Who Is Being Reckless , Obama or McCain ?
by Eric Margolis by Eric Margolis
DIGG THIS
The Republican blitz unleashed against Democratic frontrunner Barack Obama last week showed just how bitter , dirty and ugly the 2008 presidential campaign is likely to be .
After Obama said he favored direct negotiations with Iran , Venezuela , and Cuba , and dismissed any potential danger from Iran as " tiny , " Republican candidate John McCain accused him of being " reckless " and " inexperienced . "
" The threat the government of Iran poses is anything but tiny , " thundered McCain — the very same supposedly experienced McCain who mistakenly claimed Iran was supporting Sunni fighters in Iraq .
During his recent speech to Israel ’s Knesset , President George W. Bush also singled out Iran and insinuated that Obama resembled the British and French " appeasers " of Nazi Germany at the 1938 Munch Pact for daring to suggest talking to Iran .
The president ’s speech was so filled with fulsome praise for Israel , and so lacking in reference to Palestinian suffering , one had the impression he was campaigning for one of Israel ’s right - wing parties .
Bush ’s turgid , simplistic oration that was worthy of a Baptist Sunday school talk on the Mideast left many worldly Israeli legislators rolling their eyes and looking embarrassed or bored .
Back in the US , neoconservatives blasted Obama as unpatriotic for not wearing an American flag on his lapel .
The Israel lobby accused him of being insufficiently pro-Israel .
Evangelical Christian groups flooded the Internet with claims Obama was a closet Muslim .
Obama was so thrown off balance by these violent attacks , he foolishly flip - flopped on Iran and agreed that it was indeed a grave threat .
All this came as the danger of a US / Israeli attack on Iran to preserve Israel ’s Mideast nuclear monopoly was growing .
Israel ’s PM Ehud Olmert just called for a US naval blockade of Iran , an open act of war .
An Egyptian naval blockade of Israel ’s access to the Red Sea served as a casus belli in 1967 Arab - Israeli War .
Republicans just can’t seem to stop invoking both facts and myths of World War II to promote their foreign policy .
If World War II must be dredged up , a more appropriate reference would be Nazi leader Hermann Goering ’s famous formula for fascism :
" All you have to do is to tell them ( the people ) they are being attacked , and denounce the pacifists for lack of patriotism and exposing the country to danger .
It works the same in any country . "
That is what happened to Obama last week .
In spite of the fact that most Americans want out of Iraq and are against attacking Iran , the Republican attack media is still able to tar anyone who opposes warmongering as traitorous and cowardly .
McCain is an able , savvy domestic politician , but his absurd claims about Iran bring into question his understanding of foreign policy .
Iran has no long - ranged missiles , nuclear weapons , or bombers .
Its decrepit air force barely flies .
Iran ’s so - called navy is a lightly - armed coast guard .
Its ground forces are immobile and lack all forms of modern weapons .
Tehran ’s defense budget is the size of Poland ’s or Norway ’s , and 100 times smaller than US military spending .
It ’s the Great Iraq scare all over .
Republicans are again playing to the least - educated Americans by frightening them with fairy tales and outright lies .
Iranian mad mullahs determined to shower A - bombs on Memphis and Des Moines have replaced Saddam and his Drones of Death .
Should the US talk to enemies ?
Of course .
Diplomacy is one of three primary tools of statecraft long with military and economic power .
Only arrant fools do not make use of it .
Just because the Bush administration largely relied on military power in foreign policy does not mean this Soviet - style approach need continue .
To whom does one negotiate if not with ones enemies and rivals ?
Refusing to talk to one ’s foes is stupid , childish and counterproductive .
World War I was sparked by the breakdown of diplomacy .
It could have ended with a fair peace in 1917 , and spared the world Stalin and Hitler , if the US had not foolishly entered the war , thus allowing Britain and France to reject negotiations with Germany ,
War is waged to attain diplomatic objectives , not win military victories .
The greatest threat to world peace is not Iran , Cuba or , even more laughably , Venezuela ’s clownish Col. Hugo Chavez .
It is the breakdown of normal diplomatic relations between nations .
As Democrats rightly noted , the US fruitfully negotiated with the Soviet Union and China when both powers threatened America with nuclear destruction .
The Bush administration has been making progress in nuclear talks with " pariah " North Korea , to which it refused to talk for years .
All sensible nations talk , either through normal or backdoor channels .
Even Israel and old foe Syria just announced talks .
Israel has maintained secret contacts with Iran for decades , even selling it $ 5 billion worth of US arms and spare parts in the 1980’s .
When McCain and his new neoconservative Praetorian Guard scream " no negotiation ’s , " what they really mean is no talks between Washington and Israel ’s principal foes , Iran and Syria .
McCain should be reminded that hysteria is not a viable foreign policy , even if it is election silly season .
He is wrong to keep promoting the image of America as a spinster atop a chair , screaming in fear of a Muslim mouse called Iran .
This is unworthy of the great United States .
If anyone is being reckless and inexperienced in foreign affairs , so far , it seems to be John McCain .
His fear - mongering over Iran and publicly singing " bomb , bomb , bomb Iran , " and his plans to directly confront Russia and China at the same time while the US is bogged down in Iraq and Afghanistan , should make Americans pause for a lot of thought .

The number of New Yorkers losing their homes to foreclosure jumped by a third compared with a year ago , a study has found – and experts are warning that the worst is yet to come .
New York - area foreclosures are up 34 percent for the first quarter of this year , which is far lower than the national rate that roughly doubled over last year , according to a report released yesterday by Realty Trac , an online real - estate service .
Analysts once predicted that New York ’s real - estate market would be largely insulated from the wave of home - loan defaults affecting much of the country .
But lawmakers and local organizations are now working overtime to keep up with the volume of requests for help from homeowners in crisis .
New York ’s foreclosure process is unusually long , taking more than a year for defaulting homeowners to lose their homes , so experts say the data probably does not reflect the level of foreclosures that will hit the area .
“ We are still waiting for the other shoe to drop , ” said Realty Trac spokesman Daren Blomquist about the foreclosure rate in the city .
Rep. Nydia Velazquez ( D - Brooklyn / Manhattan ) said she has heard from many of her constituents in Brooklyn who are desperate to keep their homes .
But she said she is anticipating an even larger spike in foreclosures later this year as interest rates on adjustable - rate loans soar .
“ They call because they do n’t know what to do , ” she said of homeowners who have contacted her office for help .
In Brooklyn , one in every 241 homeowners is now in the foreclosure process .
That is more than double the number of Brooklyn households in that situation a year ago .
Even in Manhattan , with relatively strong property values , foreclosures have increased 66 percent since the first quarter of 2007 , and Queens ’ numbers are up 41 percent .
Staten Island may be the hardest hit among the boroughs , with 737 foreclosures representing a 101 percent increase in the first three months of this year over the first quarter of 2007 .
New York ’s suburbs have not been spared .
In Westchester County , foreclosures are up 138 percent this year , the report found .
Overall , the metropolitan area rates 80th among the top 100 regions most affected by the foreclosure crisis .
Nationally , the foreclosure crisis is hitting the West hard .
Stockton , Calif. , is first on the list of metropolitan areas with the most foreclosures per household , with one in every 30 homeowners receiving a foreclosure notice .
The state with the most foreclosures is Nevada , where one in 54 households is in foreclosure .
A Census Bureau report released yesterday found that the number of homes sitting vacant nationwide hit an all - time high of 18.6 million in March , which was attributed to the rise in foreclosures .
The bureau ’s regional data , however , showed that the vacancy rate remained virtually unchanged in the Northeast .

Whether there is a national shortage of primary care providers is a matter of considerable debate .
Some researchers contend the United States has too many doctors , driving overutilization of the system .
Image Massachusetts primary care practices like this one in Amherst have been trying to manage an influx of new patients .

But there is little dispute that the general practice of medicine is under strain at a time when there is bipartisan consensus that better prevention and chronic disease management would not only improve health but also help control costs .
With its population aging , the country will need 40 percent more primary care doctors by 2020 , according to the American College of Physicians , which represents 125,000 internists , and the 94,000 - member American Academy of Family Physicians .
Community health centers , bolstered by increases in federal financing during the Bush years , are having particular difficulty finding doctors .
“ I think it ’s pretty serious , ” said Dr. David C. Dale , president of the American College of Physicians and former dean of the University of Washington ’s medical school .
“ Maybe we ’re at the front of the wave , but there are several factors making it harder for the average American , particularly older Americans , to have a good personal physician . ”
Studies show that the number of medical school graduates in the United States entering family medicine training programs , or residencies , has dropped by 50 percent since 1997 .
A decadelong decline gave way this year to a slight increase in numbers , perhaps because demand is driving up salaries .
There have been slight increases in the number of doctors training in internal medicine , which focuses on the nonsurgical treatment of adults .
But the share of those residents who then establish a general practice has plummeted , to 24 percent in 2006 from 54 percent in 1998 , according to the American College of Physicians .
The Government Accountability Office reported to Congress in February that the per capita supply of primary care physicians actually grew by 12 percent from 1995 to 2005 , at more than double the rate for specialists .
But the report also revealed deep shifts in the composition of primary care providers .
While fewer American - trained doctors are pursuing primary care , they are being replaced in droves by foreign medical school graduates and osteopathic doctors .
There also has been rapid growth in the ranks of physician assistants and nurse practitioners .
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - Excited astronomers said on Wednesday they had for the first time caught a supernova on camera just as it was exploding , and they may now learn how to spot others .
Light from supernovas in the NGC 2770 galaxy as imaged by the Gemini Multi-Object Spectrograph at Gemini North on Mauna Kea in Hawaii is seen in a handout image .

By luck , they spotted a burst of X - rays while looking at another part of a distant galaxy , and managed to turn a variety of telescopes in the right direction just in time .
“ For years , we have dreamed of seeing a star just as it was exploding , ” said Alicia Soderberg of Princeton University in New Jersey , who led the international team of astronomers .
“ We were in the right place , at the right time , with the right telescope , on January 9th and witnessed history , ” she added in a statement .
A supernova is a dying star , but one much bigger than Earth ’s sun .
It first explodes outwards , then shrinks into itself to form an extremely dense , cold ball .
Sometimes a neutron star results and sometimes a black hole .
Soderberg ’s team looked across space and time to witness the death throes of supernova 2008D , found in one arm of the galaxy NGC 2770 , 88 million light - years from Earth .
In real time , they are seeing events that occurred 88 million years ago -- but in Earth time they are just occurring and the astronomers can watch the supernova as if it really were exploding just now .
“ Using the most powerful radio , optical and X - ray telescopes on the ground and in space we were able to observe the evolution of the explosion right from the start , ” said Edo Berger , who like Soderberg is a Carnegie - Princeton fellow .
“ This eventually confirmed that the big X - ray blast marked the birth of a supernova . ”
Soderberg and her colleagues were taking a scheduled look at NGC 2770 using the X - ray telescope on NASA ’s Swift satellite .
During that observation , a bright burst of X - rays came from one of the galaxy ’s spiral arms , they report in this week ’s issue of the journal Nature .
RUSH TO SEE
The 38 - member international scientific team rushed to have a look with both orbiting and ground - based telescopes including the Chandra X-ray Observatory , Hubble Space Telescope , Keck I telescope in Hawaii , Palomar Observatory in California and National Science Foundation ’s Very Large Array and Very Long Baseline Array radio telescopes .
They hope to gather information that will help astronomers spot other supernovas more quickly .
“ Astronomical instruments planned for the future should then allow us to finally unravel the mystery of how these explosions occur , ” Soderberg said .
Supernovas are usually spotted visually days to weeks after the first catastrophic explosion when a star flares up and then fades .
But the first burst creates a blast of particles known as neutrinos and a shock wave of kinetic energy that superheats the gas in the outer layers of the star .
They in turn send out X - rays that can be the first clue of the fireball to come .
“ This observation is by far the best example of what happens when a star dies and a neutron star is born , ” said Kim Page of the University of Leicester in Britain , who led the X - ray analysis .
Last week astronomers said they saw the X - ray afterglow of a supernova in Earth ’s own Milky Way galaxy that would have exploded 140 years ago , Earth - time .

A third bartender was acquitted while the trial for a fourth bartender , who is facing more serious charges of bodily harm with fatal consequences , has not yet started .

Google Huddle Chat Taken Down
Just two days after the release , Google removed their main sample application for the new Google App Engine .
HuddleChat.com is now showing the following message :
Hi , a couple of our colleagues wrote Huddle Chat in their spare time as a sample application for other developers to demonstrate the power and flexibility of Google App Engine .
We ’ve heard some complaints from the developer community about it and because of that we ’ve decided to take it down .
If you ’d like to see more sample applications written on Google App Engine please check out our documentation and our App Gallery .
Thanks ,
The Google App Engine Team
Someone who identifies himself as Google App Product Manager in a ReadWriteWeb comment adds , “ We ’ve heard some complaints from the developer community ... so rather than divert attention from Google App Engine itself , we thought it better to just take HuddleChat down . ”
Huddle Chat allowed you to create web - based chat rooms on the fly .
It also allowed you to show - case files in that chat room , or dig through transcripts of other chats .
One of those transcript mentioned that apparently , Google developers took 3 - 4 weeks – apparently in their spare time – to create Huddle Chat .
John Gruber of Daring Fireball comments on what might have been wrong with Huddle Chat :
HuddleChat is just a feature - for - feature clone of 37signals ’s Campfire .
The layout is the same , the tabs at the top of the screen are the same , the right - side sidebar listing participants and file uploads is the same .
It even copies Campfire ’s trick of formatting a message as “ code ” if it contains literal newline characters .
Borrowing ideas is fair game , but copying an entire app is wrong .
And it ’s creepy , in a Microsoft - of - the - ’90s way , when it ’s a $ 150 billion company cloning an app from a 10 - person company .
Sarah Hatter at Twitter put it more bluntly than that .
Michael Arrington at TechCrunch on the other hand comments :
Frankly , the reaction is fairly ridiculous .
But this is apparently a fight that Google does n’t want to be involved in . (...)
I wonder if Darren Delaye , Braden Kowitz , and Kyle Consalus , the Google developers who created HuddleChat , had much of a say in the decision .
And while Michael argues that Huddle Chat was n’t even an official Google product to begin with , John argues , “ Under California law , Google owns the rights to any product created by Google employees . ”
Other sample apps of the Google App Engine are still available in the App Gallery .

Working two jobs takes a lot of energy .
You are n't going to enjoy either job if you 're tired all of the time .
It 's imperative that you schedule plenty of breaks into your schedule so you do n't go straight from working one job to another .
Even if it 's a one - hour break where you can just take a nap at home , it 's really going to pay off .
Also , make sure you take at least one full day and at least one full night off every week .
You 'll have a much easier time enjoying your work if you feel well - rested .
LOUISVILLE , Ky. --
Boy , did Eight Belles hang with the boys .
All that heart and her gallant fight , however , ended in the worst of all possible ways : a breakdown , an ambulance on the track .
And , with no other choice , she was euthanized by injection .
The day began with hope and pomp .
Bolstered by the sentimental support from 157,770 fans and endorsed by presidential contender Hillary Clinton and cheered by daughter Chelsea , the filly finished second in the Kentucky Derby on Saturday .
She crossed the wire 4 3/ 4 lengths behind favorite Big Brown .
Then , with the second - largest crowd in Derby history still whooping it up , Eight Belles collapsed with two broken front ankles .
The magnitude of what happened was slow to reach the fans at Churchill Downs .
Not only was a horse down , but it was the filly .
And horse racing -- with the memory of Barbaro still fresh and the death of a horse coming only a day earlier on Kentucky Oaks Day -- had to confront grief one more time .
" There was no way to save her .
She could n't stand , " trainer Larry Jones said .
" She ran an incredible race .
She ran the race of her life . "
Jones ' voice broke and tears glistened in his eyes as he considered his barn without Eight Belles ' head poking out of her stall .
" Losing animals like this is n't fun .
It 's not supposed to happen , " he said .
" We 're heartbroke .
We 're going to miss her , no doubt . "
The field of 19 colts and the dark gray filly were galloping out around the first turn when Eight Belles suddenly went down on both front legs and jockey Gabriel Saez slid off .
" When we passed the wire I stood up , " said a distraught Saez , a first - time Derby rider .
" She started galloping funny .
I tried to pull her up .
That 's when she went down . "
Filly Eight Belles broke both front ankles after the wire in the Kentucky Derby .
She was euthanized on the track while Big Brown 's victory was celebrated .

An equine ambulance reached her near the second turn .
Eight Belles appeared to be galloping out normally around the first turn and was headed into the start of the backstretch when she dropped without warning .
The crowd was busy high - fiving and celebrating and the distance from the grandstand prevented many from realizing what had happened .
" Everyone breathed a big sigh of relief that everyone came around the track cleanly and then all of a sudden it happened , " said Dr. Larry Bramlage , on - call veterinarian .
Quickly , word spread about the horse that was down in the second turn .
Fans focused binoculars on the scene , using Saez 's red helmet to identify the horse .
" That 's one of the saddest things I 've ever seen , " said fan Kathleen Brower of Louisville .
" We went from the high for the winner and something like this happens .
It just takes the wind out of the sails . "
No more so than for Jones and owner Rick Porter .
Eight Belles could have easily been the wagering favorite in Friday 's Kentucky Oaks , an all - girl showcase .
But Jones and Porter decided to run her against the boys despite the fact that she had never done so before .
She had , after all , solid credentials with a four - race winning streak .
Jones won the Oaks with Proud Spell and set himself up to pull off the double .
At first , Jones did n't realize anything was wrong until he began walking back to the stable area and saw Saez aboard another horse .
Reached by cell phone , a somber Porter said simply , " It 's not a good time . "
Afterward , Jones disputed any suggestion that Eight Belles had no business taking on the boys .
" It was n't that , it was n't the distance , it was n't a big bumping match for her , she never got touched , " he said .
" She passed all those questions ... with flying colors .
The race was over , all we had to do was pull up , come back and be happy .
It just did n't happen . "
If Eight Belles had labored to the finish line and been falling farther behind Big Brown in the closing strides , then Jones said he would have " really second - guessed ourselves severely and kicked ourselves in the pants . "
But she hit the wire strongly and galloped around the turn without a hitch , leaving the trainer in the white cowboy hat feeling proud .
Jones also trained last year 's runner - up , Hard Spun .
" We were ecstatic , " he said .
For a time , anyway .
Part of Eight Belles ' appeal was her status as the first filly since 1999 to run in the Derby ; the last to win was Winning Colors in 1988 .
Hillary Clinton did n't attend the race , but she ordered her daughter to bet the filly .
Eight Belles , who went off at 13 - 1 , repaid the fans ' faith by returning $ 10.60 and $ 6.40 .
Winning jockey Kent Desormeaux and Big Brown galloped by Eight Belles in her waning moments .
" This horse showed you his heart and Eight Belles showed you her life for our enjoyment today , " he said .
" I 'm deeply sympathetic to that team for their loss . "
Bramlage said the fracture in Eight Belles ' left front ankle opened the skin , allowing contamination to set in .
At least one of her sesamoid bones was broken , too .
" She did n't have a front leg to stand on to be splinted and hauled off in the ambulance , so she was immediately euthanized , " he said .
" In my years in racing , I have never seen this happen at the end of the race or during the race . "
Bramlage was hard - pressed to make sense of yet another breakdown that reminded fans of Barbaro 's horrific injury two years ago in the Preakness .
" The difficult thing to explain with her is it 's so far after the wire , and she was easing down like you 'd like to see a horse slow down by that point , " he said .
" I do n't have an explanation for it . "
The tasmanian devil has reached a new low in its struggle for survival against the facial tumour disease .
Almost half the state is affected by the cancer - like disease , which has killed as much as 60 percent of the wild devil population .
Tasmania 's Primary Industries Minister , David Llewellyn , says the devils will be upgraded to endangered on Tasmania 's threatened species list in the coming week .
" So as we can apply the appropriate resources and effort into making sure that our recovery plans and we see one today are , you know , affected , " he said .
East Coast Wildlife Park owner Bruce Englefield has just opened a sanctuary where disease free devils can live as in the wild as an insurance population .
" The situation is probably more serious than people are prepared to admit , " he said .
Four other parks have expressed an interest in setting up wild sanctuaries .
Certain viruses slip into E. coli through one of the many kinds of channels in its membrane .
In a colony of genetically identical bacteria , some may be covered with these channels like pincushions .
Others have none at all .
The viruses will kill the vulnerable clones , while the other clones live on .
E. coli ’s quirks can be a matter of life and death for us , as well .
Some strains cause infections in the gut , the bladder , the blood and even the brain .
In many cases , doctors try to kill the bacteria with antibiotics , which jam up the normal workings of their genes and proteins .
In a susceptible colony of E. coli , a strong antibiotic will kill most of the bacteria , but not all of them .
Some will survive .
The survivors escape death because they are trapped in a strange twilight existence called persistence .
They make hardly any new proteins and grow barely , if at all .
Antibiotics can’t kill persisters because there ’s nothing in them to attack .
The difference between normal cells and persisters cannot be found in their DNA .
After persister cells survive an attack of antibiotics , some of their offspring switch back to normal growth and rebuild the colony .
Most of their descendants will be normal E. coli .
But some will be persisters .
The colony remains the same motley crew of clones .
Image Even among simple forms of life , like the common bacterium E. coli , genetics only partly determines what any one organism is like .
E. coli expresses its individuality in many ways .
All the bacilli above are genetically identical , but the shades show differences in the production of proteins that digest lactose .
Credit ... Dr. Michael Elowitz
The key to understanding E. coli ’s fingerprints is to recognize that the bacteria are not simple machines .
Unlike wires and transistors , E. coli ’s molecules are floppy , twitchy and unpredictable .
In an electronic device , like a computer or a radio , electrons stream in a steady flow through the machine ’s circuits , but the molecules in E. coli jostle and wander .
When E. coli begins using a gene to make a protein , it does not produce a smoothly increasing supply .
It spurts out the proteins in fits and starts .
One clone may produce half a dozen copies of a protein in an hour , while a clone right next to it produces none .
Michael Elowitz , a physicist at Caltech , put these bursts on display in an elegant experiment .
He and his colleagues incited E. coli to produce its proteins for feeding on lactose .
Dr. Elowitz and his colleagues added extra genes to the bacteria so that when they made lactose - digesting proteins , they also released light .
The bacteria , Dr. Elowitz found , did not produce a uniform glow .
They flickered , sometimes brightly , sometimes dimly .
And when Dr. Elowitz took a snapshot of the colony , it was not a uniform sea of light .
Some microbes were dark at that moment while others shone at full strength .
Today , the New York Times profiles Gary Stern , the owner of the last pinball - machine manufacturing company in the world .
" To most , " Times profiler Monica Davey says , " the story seems familiar . "
Well , it seemed familiar to us !
Because in March of 2005 , BusinessWeek profiled Gary Stern , the owner of the last pinball - machine manufacturing company in the world .
Let 's see what else these stories have in common !
In both pieces we learn that the last competing pinball company folded in 1999 .
We learn Bert 's history in the pinball business .
We learn that his warehouse is 40,000 square feet .
He makes 10,000 machines a year .
Flippers were invented in 1947 .
Oh , and we talk to this guy .
BW : " For Gary , pinball is absolutely something that 's near and dear to his heart , " says Roger Sharpe , an industry veteran still employed by WMS and author of Pinball ! , which chronicles the game 's history .
" It 's something he believes in wholeheartedly , it 's something he has been around his whole life .
It 's kismet . "
Times : Mr. Stern 's father , Samuel Stern , spent his life in the pinball business , starting out as a game operator in the 1930s — when a simple version of the modern mass - produced pinball machine first appeared .
Dozens of companies were soon producing the machines , said Roger Sharpe , widely considered a foremost historian of the sport after the 1977 publication of his book , " Pinball ! "
The creation of the flipper — popularized by the Humpty Dumpty game in 1947 — transformed the activity , which went on to surges in the 1950s , '70s and early '90s .
" Everybody thinks of it as retro , as nostalgia , " Mr. Sharpe said .
" But it 's not .
These are sophisticated games .
Pinball is timeless . "
Business overseas has picked up a bit !
BW : About 35 % of Stern 's sales now come from overseas — primarily in Western Europe but also in growing markets such as Russia and China . [...]
Stern credits the stable sales of traditional pinball machines to increases in nostalgic home buyers , which now account for roughly 20 % of total sales — and the number keeps growing .
Retailers include Sharper Image ( SHRP ) .
Stern Pinball does n't sell machines directly to consumers , instead relying on a network of 33 distributors throughout North America , Europe , and Asia .
Times :
In the United States , Mr. Stern said , half of his new machines , which cost about $ 5,000 and are bought through distributors , now go directly into people 's homes and not a corner arcade .
He said nearly 40 percent of the machines — some designed to appeal to French , German , Italian and Spanish players — were exported , and he added that he had been working to make inroads in China , India , the Middle East and Russia .
There are a couple more similarities too , though no precise duplication of language or passages that we could find in our cursory examination .
Obviously two stories about the last pinball - machine maker in the world will resemble each other .
But did we even need the second one ?
No .
No we did not .
See y'all at Barcade !
( lol j / k that place is always full of assholes . )
Forget everything you 've heard about airlines and CO2 emissions .
The news is much worse than anyone thought .
A recently disclosed report finds that airlines are spewing 20 percent more carbon dioxide into the environment than previously estimated and the amount could hit 1.5 billion tons a year by 2025 .
That 's far more than even the worst - case predictions laid out by the International Panel on Climate Change .
If you 're looking to put that number in perspective , the European Union currently emits 3.1 billion tons of CO2 annually .
Yup , that 's the entire 27 - nation , 457 million person EU .
The report , " Trends in Global Aviation Noise and Emissions from Commercial Aviation for 2000 to 2025 , " is among the most authoritative estimates of the industry 's growth in emissions .
It was produced by the U.S. Department of Transportation , Eurocontrol , the Manchester Metropolitan University and the technology company QinetiQ .
They used a variety of models to calculate current fuel use , then projected out to 2025 based on these findings and anticipated increases in air travel .
" Growth of CO2 emissions on this scale will comfortably outstrip any gains made by improved technology and ensure aviation is an even larger contributor to global warming by 2025 than previously thought , "
Jeff Gazzard , a spokesman for the Aviation Environment Federation , the group that uncovered the report , told the Independent .
" Governments must take action to put a cap on air transport 's unrestrained growth . "
The report was written for an aviation conference in Barcelona last year , but was turned down by organizers .
It remained out of sight until the Aviation Environment Federation unearthed it and announced somewhat dramatically that the report had been " suppressed . "
Suppressed or not , it has provided fresh ammunition for environmental groups trying to pressure governments into restraining commercial aviation growth .
The response of the airline industry , which is exempt from the Kyoto Protocol for reducing greenhouse gases , is n't surprising .
The International Air Transport Association , a trade group representing 240 airlines , says it is working as hard as possible to produce binding emission - reduction targets and argues skyrocketing fuel prices are pushing airlines to find alternatives to fossil fuels .
" With fuel costs doubling in the last year , airlines already have an incentive to work towards greater efficiency , " a spokesman said .
" There has been a 70 percent improvement in fuel efficiency in the last four decades .
Aviation is a benchmark of environmental
responsibility for others to follow . "
In case you were looking for more good news , the study also found that the number of people forced to deal with serious aircraft noise will rise from 24 million in 2000 to 30.3 million by 2025 – this despite the introduction of quieter next - generation jets .

A thin jet of fluid impinging on a bath of the same fluid can behave in many different ways .
The jet can coil up like a rope .
It can float on the surface or plunge air into the fluid bath .
This research examines a jet which rebounds off a bath of the same fluid .
Figure 1 .
A falling liquid stream rebounds off a deep bath of the same silicone oil .
Normally a liquid stream colliding with a pool of liquid merges immediately upon contact , perhaps also bringing air into the pool with it .
However when the pool is moving as the stream hits , it can slide along the surface being separated from the pool by a thin layer of air .
The air layer supports the jet and lubricates the motion between it and the bath .
The same process happens when sliding a piece of paper across a desk or when a car hydroplanes on a wet road .
But instead of a hard surface like the desk or the road , the jet is on top of a liquid surface , which is flexible like a trampoline .
Because of the weight of the jet and the force required to change directions , the surface is pressed downward and a dent is formed in the shape of a bowl .
The sliding jet then ramps out of this bowl and into the air .
The bouncing jet is a new example of steady noncoalescence and a new example of a fluid flow with multiple stable states at the same conditions .
Motivation
The beginning of the project was motivated by curiosity about this unexpected behavior of commonplace material .
And because the bouncing jet is visually appealing and counterintuitive .
We first observed this phenomena by accident slowly pouring oil from one container to another .
We built an apparatus to allow the jet to bounce for longer times , so that we could record its motion .
Relevance to Industrial Processes
Understanding the bouncing jet could benefit the design and operation of these various fluid applications by combining the understanding of many separate phenomenon such as air entrainment , lubrication layers , jet bending , and force balances between inertia , surface tension , and viscous forces .
While a stream of liquid is bouncing , some surrounding air is entrained into a thin layer that separates the jet from the bath .
If the air layer breaks into bubbles , the jet stops bouncing .
This situation is very common in many industrial processes .
In many types of mold casting , molten material is poured into a mold .
Often air bubbles are not desirable for reasons ranging from structural integrity to aesthetics .
In industrial processes , the plunging jet is used for mixing two liquids or a gas and a liquid .
The swirling motion created by the plunging jet stirs the two liquids together .
Chemical agents are often mixed by plunging a jet of the solution into the solution bath .
This plunging jet can entrain air , which can be crucial or devastating depending on the intended reaction .
Entrained air increase the rate that gas is dissolved into the liquid .
In ponds and swimming pools , aeration and mixing can control the levels of nitrogen and oxygen .
In metallurgical procedures , gases can react with the molten metal , so the method of pouring or mixing can change the final product .
The air between the jet and the bath separates the two bodies of liquid long enough to give the jet time to bounce .
Many fluid bearings are designed to do the same thing : prevent the approach and collision of two bodies using a thin layer of fluid .
On the other hand , sometimes separation is not desired .
If a jet of oil is sprayed on a surface to cool it , any unintentional deflection or bouncing of the jet could cause heat damage or an explosion .
Research on the bouncing jet is in the early stages , so it is difficult to project its uses .
Possibly , the bouncing jet could be the basis for a new technique to control the amount of gas entrained into a liquid bath or to control how a liquid stream interacts with another surface .
Setup
The apparatus allows us to create stable bouncing jets reliably .
The major control parameters are the flow rate , bath viscosity , falling height , and bath velocity .
The purpose of the experiments were two - fold .
First , the experiments were designed to find the range of parameters where a bouncing jet is stable .
Second , the experiments were to allow a close inspection of the geometry and behavior of the bouncing jet to help deduce the force balance and bouncing mechanism .
The fluid was contained on a rotating table in an acrylic tank .
A high speed CCD camera imaged the bouncing jet .
The images were read out to a computer .
The fluid flow rate was controlled with a pump .

The bath of silicone oil sits on a rotating table .
A pump creates the falling stream .
A camera images the jet in the lab frame .
Results
This study showed that a fluid jet can bounce off of a moving fluid surface stably for a wide range of parameters .
We have observed the bouncing jet systematically for silicone oils from 50 to 500 mPa s ( 56 to 560 times more viscous than water ) , a jet velocity of 38 to 170 cm/s , a jet diameter from 0.05 to 0.12 cm , and a horizontal bath velocity from 0.5 to 35 cm /s .
We also have preliminary observations for silicone oils as low as 10 mPa s .
One factor crucial for bouncing is that the very thin air layer cannot become unstable and break into air bubbles .
Also the bath surface must be tense enough to support the jet ’s weight and the force of the jet changing directions .
Figure 3 : We can follow a fluid parcel sequentially through ( 1 ) the jet ’s initial stages of falling , ( 2 ) its separation from the bulk fluid by a thin layer of air , ( 3 ) its bending upwards , and ( 4 ) its bounce and subsequent flight .
Keep in mind that the bath is moving to the right in this picture .
In the course of conducting this work , there were many exciting and intriguing observations that could not be given the close attention they deserve .
Please refer to the Master ’s thesis for a compilation of these ; a PDF is available below .
Movies
The movies are also available on YouTube
A Newtonian liquid jet can bounce off the surface of a moving bath ( see the references below ) .
In the first movie clip , the jet bounces spontaneously as the flow rate decreases rapidly ( playback is slowed 8.3 times ) .
The jet and the bath do not mix while bouncing ; a thin layer of air separates the jet and the bath .
The subsequent sequences show that the jet can bounce twice , that the jet bounces more vertically with smaller bath velocity , and that the bouncing jet can be unsteady but stable .
In the last movie clip , the bath is stationary and the bouncing stream is moving .
This experiment can easily be done at home by pouring mineral oil into a pan of the same oil .
For the sequence of images showing how a stream is made to bounce twice , the conditions are as follows : the liquid viscosity mu = 106 mPa s , the jet flow rate Q = 0.25 cm ^3/s , the jet fall height H = 5.0 cm , and the bath velocity V_{bath} = 18.8 cm /s .
The conditions for the movie of the vertically rebounding , unsteady bouncing jet were mu = 361 mPa s , Q = 0.24 cm3/s , H = 4.2 cm , V_{bath} = 0.74 cm /s , the jet rebounds on average 1.1 cm , and the movie plays at 16.7 times slower than real time .
For the slow motion movie of the jet poured by hand , the viscosity was mu = 361 mPa s.
For the conditions of all other visuals , see the associated Physics of Fluids article below .

How to create the bouncing jet at home
The bouncing jet phenomenon can be observed in many household fluids such as canola oil or heavy mineral oil .
Bouncing was first observed in our laboratory while pouring silicone oil by hand into a dish for storage .
The materials needed for observing a bouncing jet are simple : a dish ( preferably transparent like a glass pie pan , at least 15 cm in diameter and 4 cm tall ) , a cup , and a small rod ( e.g. a cable tie or a chopstick ) .
We measured the viscosity of canola oil and heavy mineral oil ( at 22 degrees C ) at high shear rates and found both oils to be Newtonian to a good approximation : for canola oil , mu = 65 mPa s at low shear and 4 % lower at a shear of 10^4 s^{ - 1} ; for heavy mineral oil , mu = 180 mPa s at low shear and 18 % lower at a shear rate of 10^4 s^{ - 1} .
To observe a bouncing jet , use a dish with liquid about 4 cm deep and pour a thin stream of the liquid ( 0.5 to 1 cm ^ 3 /s ) from a cup 3 to 6 cm above the surface .
While pouring , move the stream in a circular motion around the dish once about every 2 seconds at a distance 3 to 6 cm from the center .
Watch for the jet to bounce while varying the pouring rate , the relative horizontal velocity between the jet and the bath , and the pouring height .
To encourage bouncing , pass the small rod through the jet intermittently .
A rotating platform ( e.g. a record turntable or a Lazy Susan ) can be used to rotate the dish instead of moving the cup .
If the surface is dirty , clean the surface by stirring the bath or scraping the surface .
Blow air on the surface to pop bubbles on the surface .
To achieve a very small pouring height , pour the liquid down the rod .
With practice , a jet poured by hand can bounce stably for tens of seconds at a time .
Bouncing is also easy to observe in non-Newtonian fluids such shampoo , multigrade motor oil , and concentrated mixtures of liquid soap and water , but the mechanism by which they bounce may not be the same as for Newtonian fluids .
Viscous liquids that bounce are common , so the bouncing jet can be used in the classroom or teaching laboratory to demonstrate and explain fluid dynamics , force balances , and other physics principles .
Because it is easy to reproduce and it exhibits many varied behaviors , the bouncing jet can be a playground for the study of fluid jets , their different behaviors , and their stability and instability .
Hobbyists , science teachers , and students can study the phenomenon .
Students can research one of the many open problems as a science fair project , as a undergrad research project , or as a graduate research project .

Former Detainee Describes ' Water Treatment ' Testimony to Congress comes as report is released about abuses FBI witnessed .
May 20 , 2008  -- Murat Kurnaz told members of Congress today he was subjected to " water treatment , " electric shocks and other abuse during the almost five years he spent in U.S. custody , putting a face to the Justice Department 's inspector general report released today , detailing abuses witnessed by FBI agents overseas at detention facilities run by the military and CIA .
Kurnaz , a Turkish citizen , was arrested in Pakistan in late 2001 after the 9/11 attacks while he traveled with a religious tourism group , and was eventually handed over to U.S. forces .
He was held in U.S. facilities in Afghanistan and then at Guantanamo Bay .
Speaking to the House Foreign Affairs Committee via video link from Germany with his lawyer at his side , Kurnaz described how he was abused while he was held at a U.S. base in Kandahar , Afghanistan , and described how he was subjected to " water treatment " while in custody .
" They stuck my head into a bucket of water and punched me in the stomach , " he said .
" I inhaled the water .
...
It was a strong punch . "
Kurnaz testified that , although he had no links to al Qaeda , and German intelligence services told U.S. officials in 2002 that he was not a terrorist , he languished at Guantanamo until August 2006 .
While he was detained in Kandahar , Kurnaz testified , he was chained by his arms to the ceiling with his feet dangling and subjected to electric shocks .
Kurnaz also alleges U.S. interrogators tried to force him to sign papers admitting his guilt .
Kurnaz , 26 , who was born in Germany , also alleged the abuse continued at Guantanamo Bay .
" I did n't think this could happen in the 21st century .
... I could never have imagined that this place was created by the United States , " he said .
While the CIA has admitted to waterboarding three al Qaeda detainees , the Justice Department inspector general 's report , released today , details other instances of detainees having water forced down their throats .
The report noted an instance from a 2004 interrogation of a detainee in Iraq .
" [ An FBI Agent ] recalled that , at some point during the interrogation , the military officer ' put water down ' a seated detainee 's throat , " the report said .
" He said he guessed that the purpose of the water was to give the detainee the sensation that he was drowning , so that he would provide the information that the interrogator wanted .
[ The agent ] stated that the detainee was gagging and spitting out water .
He said that the detainee appeared to be uncomfortable , and assumed that he had trouble breathing . "
The inspector general report notes that this is not " waterboarding , " but " this rough technique was part of an effort to intimidate the detainees and increase their feelings of helplessness . "
The 370 - page report by the Justice Department detailed disagreements at the top levels of the Justice Department and the Pentagon over the effectiveness of using severe interrogation techniques on detainees .
It also included instances of abuse witnessed or documented by FBI agents who were instructed to not participate in the rough interrogations .

by Marshall Brain I went to McDonald 's this weekend with the kids .
We go to McDonald 's to eat about once a week because it is a mile from the house and has an indoor play area .
Our normal routine is to walk in to McDonald 's , stand in line , order , stand around waiting for the order , sit down , eat and play .
On Sunday , this decades - old routine changed forever .
When we walked in to McDonald 's , an attractive woman in a suit greeted us and said , " Are you planning to visit the play area tonight ? "
The kids screamed , " Yeah ! " " McDonald 's has a new system that you can use to order your food right in the play area .
Would you like to try it ? "
The kids screamed , " Yeah ! "
The woman walks us over to a pair of kiosks in the play area .
She starts to show me how the kiosks work and the kids scream , " We want to do it ! "
So I pull up a chair and the kids stand on it while the ( extremely patient ) woman in a suit walks the kids through the screens .
David ordered his food , Irena ordered her food , I ordered my food .
It 's a simple system .
Then it was time to pay .
Interestingly , the kiosk only took cash in the form of bills .
So I fed my bills into the machine .
Then you take a little plastic number to set on your table and type the number in .
The transaction is complete .
We sat down at a table .
We put our number in the center of the table and waited .
In about 10 seconds the kids screamed , " When is our food going to get here ? ? ? "
I said , " Let 's count . "
In less than two minutes a woman in an apron put a tray with our food on the table , handed us our change , took the plastic number and left .
You know what ?
It is a nice system .
It works .
It is much nicer than standing in line .
The only improvement I would request is the ability to use a credit card .
As nice as this system is , however , I think that it represents the tip of an iceberg that we do not understand .
This iceberg is going to change the American economy in ways that are very hard to imagine .
The Iceberg The iceberg looks like this .
On that same day , I interacted with five different automated systems like the kiosks in McDonald's : I got money in the morning from the ATM .
I bought gas from an automated pump .
I bought groceries at BJ's ( a warehouse club ) using an extremely well - designed self - service check out line .
I bought some stuff for the house at Home Depot using their not - as - well - designed - as - BJ 's self - service check out line .
I bought my food at McDonald 's at the kiosk , as described above .
Prefer the Kindle ? " Robotic Nation " is now available on the Kindle !
Join the discussion on Reddit All of these systems are very easy - to - use from a customer standpoint , they are fast , and they lower the cost of doing business and should therefore lead to lower prices .
All of that is good , so these automated systems will proliferate rapidly .
The problem is that these systems will also eliminate jobs in massive numbers .
In fact , we are about to see a seismic shift in the American workforce .
As a nation , we have no way to understand or handle the level of unemployment that we will see in our economy over the next several decades .
These kiosks and self - service systems are the beginning of the robotic revolution .
When most people think about robots , they think about independent , autonomous , talking robots like the ones we see in science fiction films .
C - 3PO and R2 - D2 are powerful robotic images that have been around for decades .
Robots like these will come into our lives much more quickly than we imagine -- self - service checkout systems are the first primitive signs of the trend .
Here is one view from the future to show you where we are headed : Automated retail systems like ATMs , kiosks and self - service checkout lines marked the beginning of the robotic revolution .
Over the course of fifteen years starting in 2001 , these systems proliferated and evolved until nearly every retail transaction could be handled in an automated way .
Five million jobs in the retail sector were lost as a result of these systems .
The next step was autonomous , humanoid robots .
The mechanics of walking were not simple , but Honda had proven that those problems could be solved with the creation of its ASIMO robot at the turn of the century .
Sony and other manufacturers followed Honda 's lead .
Over the course of two decades , engineers refined this hardware and the software controlling it to the point where they could create humanoid bodyforms with the grace and precision of a ballerina or the mass and sheer strength of the Incredible Hulk .
Decades of research and development work on autonomous robotic intelligence finally started to pay off .
By 2025 , the first machines that could see , hear , move and manipulate objects at a level roughly equivalent to human beings were making their way from research labs into the marketplace .
These robots could not " think " creatively like human beings , but that did not matter .
Massive AI systems evolved rapidly and allowed machines to perform in ways that seemed very human .
Humanoid robots soon cost less than the average car , and prices kept falling .
A typical model had two arms , two legs and the normal human - type sensors like vision , hearing and touch .
Power came from small , easily recharged fuel cells .
The humanoid form was preferred , as opposed to something odd like R2 - D2 , because a humanoid shape fit easily into an environment designed around the human body .
A humanoid robot could ride an escalator , climb stairs , drive a car , and so on without any trouble .
Once the humanoid robot became a commodity item , robots began to move in and replace humans in the workplace in a significant way .
The first wave of replacement began around 2030 , starting with jobs in the fast food industry .
Robots also filled janitorial and housekeeping positions in hotels , motels , malls , airports , amusement parks and so on .
The economics of one of these humanoid robots made the decision to buy them almost automatic .
In 2030 you could buy a humanoid robot for about $ 10,000 .
That robot could clean bathrooms , take out trash , wipe down tables , mop floors , sweep parking lots , mow grass and so on .
One robot replaced three six - hour - a - day employees .
The owner fired the three employees and in just four months the owner recovered the cost of the robot .
The robot would last for many years and would happily work 24 hours a day .
The robot also did a far better job -- for example , the bathrooms were absolutely spotless .
It was impossible to pass up a deal like that , so corporations began buying armies of humanoid robots to replace human employees .
The first completely robotic fast food restaurant opened in 2031 .
It had some rough edges , but by 2035 the rough edges were gone and by 2040 most restaurants were completely robotic .
By 2055 the robots were everywhere .
The changeover was that fast .
It was a startling , amazing transformation and the whole thing happened in only 25 years or so starting in 2030 .
In 2055 the nation hit a big milestone -- over half of the American workforce was unemployed , and the number was still rising .
Nearly every " normal " job that had been filled by a human being in 2001 was filled by a robot instead .
At restaurants , robots did all the cooking , cleaning and order taking .
At construction sites , robots did everything -- Robots poured the concrete , laid brick , built the home 's frame , put in the windows and doors , sided the house , roofed it , plumbed it , wired it , hung the drywall , painted it , etc .
At the airport , robots flew the planes , sold the tickets , moved the luggage , handled security , kept the building clean and managed air traffic control .
At the hospital robots cared for the patients , cooked and delivered the food , cleaned everything and handled many of the administrative tasks .
At the mall , stores were stocked , cleaned and clerked by robots .
At the amusement park , hundreds of robots ran the rides , cleaned the park and sold the concessions .
On the roads , robots drove all the cars and trucks .
Companies like Fedex , UPS and the post office had huge numbers of robots instead of people sorting packages , driving trucks and making deliveries .
By 2055 robots had taken over the workplace and there was no turning back .
The Jobless Recovery The " Jobless Recovery " that we are currently experiencing in the U.S. is big news .
See for example The Mystery of the ' jobless recovery ' : " Consider these facts : Employment growth at the moment is the lowest for any recovery since the government started keeping such statistics in 1939 .
The labor force shrank in July as discouraged workers stopped seeking employment .
The number of people employed has fallen by more than 1 million since the " recovery " began in the fall of 2001 . " [ ref ]
The Washington Post notes that we are now witnessing , " the longest hiring downturn since the Depression " .
[ ref ]
The article also notes , " The vast majority of the 2.7 million job losses since the 2001 recession began were the result of permanent changes in the U.S. economy and are not coming back . "
There is no mystery -- the jobless recovery is exactly what you would expect in a robotic nation .
When automation and robots eliminate jobs , they are gone for good .
The economy then has to invent new jobs .
But it is much harder to do that now because robots can quickly fill the new jobs that get invented .
See the FAQ for additional information .
I know what you are thinking .
You are thinking , " This is impossible -- there will not be humanoid robots in 2055 .
It is a ridiculous suggestion . "
But they will be here .
Humanoid robots are as inevitable as airplanes .
Imagine this .
Imagine that you could travel back in time to the year 1900 .
Imagine that you stand on a soap box on a city street corner in 1900 and you say to the gathering crowd , " By 1955 , people will be flying at supersonic speeds in sleek aircraft and traveling coast to coast in just a few hours . "
In 1900 , it would have been insane to suggest that .
In 1900 , airplanes did not even exist .
Orville and Wilbur did not make the first flight until 1903 .
The Model T Ford did not appear until 1909 .
Yet , by 1947 , Chuck Yeager flew the X1 at supersonic speeds .
In 1954 , the B - 52 bomber made its maiden flight .
It took only 51 years to go from a rickety wooden airplane flying at 10 MPH , to a gigantic aluminum jet - powered Stratofortress carrying 70,000 pounds of bombs halfway around the world at 550 MPH .
In 1958 , Pan Am started non-stop jet flights between New York and Paris in the Boeing 707 .
In 1969 , Americans set foot on the moon .
It is unbelievable what engineers and corporations can accomplish in 50 or 60 short years .
There were millions of people in 1900 who believed that humans would never fly .
They were completely wrong .
However , I do n't think anyone in 1900 could imagine the B - 52 happening in 54 years .
Over the next 55 years , the same thing will happen to us with robots .
In the process , the entire employment landscape in America will change .
Here is why that will happen .
Moore 's Law The Vision Thing
One of the key capabilities limiting robotic expansion at the moment is image processing -- the ability of robots to look at a scene like a human does and detect all the objects in the scene .
Without general , flexible vision algorthms , it is hard for a robot to do much .
For example , it is hard for a blind robot to clean a bathroom or drive a car .
Part of the problem is raw CPU power , but that problem will be solved over the next 20 to 30 years because of Moore 's law .
The other part is a software problem .
We do n't have really good algorithms yet .
My prediction is that we will see significant progress in the image processing field over the next 20 years .
Think about the changes that will take place once basic research in image processing yields the algorithms we need .
Suddenly it will be easy for robots to walk around and manipulate objects in any human environment .
Robotic cars and trucks are one obvious application for vision systems .
There are more than 40,000 deaths in the U.S. every year because of car accidents .
Human negligence causes most of these accidents .
With robots doing all the driving , the number of accidents will go way down and we will eliminate one of the leading causes of death in the U.S.
Unfortunately , robotic vehicles will also leave every taxi driver , bus driver , truck driver , etc. out of work .
Robots with vision systems will be able to do all the cleaning in every hotel , store , airport and restaurant .
Things will be spotless , but that will unemploy perhaps five million people .
Robots with vision can stack brick , lay tile , paint and put on roofs all day and all night .
Five million more people will be out of work .
Robots with vision can easily stock shelves in stores .
Think of all the workers stocking shelves , restocking merchandise , taking inventory , directing customers and manning cash resisters in places like Wal - Mart , K - Mart , Target , Home Depot , Lowes , BJ's , Sam's Club , Toys R Us , Sears , J.C. Penny's , Barnes and Noble , Borders , Best Buy , Circuit City , Office Max , Staples , Office Depot , Kroger 's , Winn - Dixie , Pet Depot and on and on and on .
More than 10 million employees will be on the street .
Armies of robots with built - in night vision will be able to provide security and policing unlike anything we can imagine today .
And so on .
A single research area -- computer vision -- will have a tremendous impact once it reaches its goal of general , flexible image processing algorithms .
This is analogous to the development of airplanes .
Nothing happened in the field of aviation until the Wright Brothers made the breakthrough that got the first airplane off the ground .
44 short years after the breakthrough , supersonic flight was possible .
Once robots have flexible , accurate vision systems , the pace of change will be unbelievably rapid and unstoppable .
Tens of millions of people will become unemployed over the course of just two to three decades .
If you think about it , robots are a very good thing .
Human beings should not be driving trucks , flipping burgers or scrubbing toilets .
These activites represent a massive waste of human potential .
The question is : what will these tens of millions of people do to make a living when their tens of millions of jobs evaporate ?
What will happen to the economy when the unemployment rate reaches 30 % or 40 % ?
You have probably heard about Moore 's Law .
It says that CPU power doubles every 18 to 24 months or so .
History shows Moore 's law very clearly .
You can see it , for example , by charting the course of Intel microprocessor chips starting with Intel 's first single - chip microprocessor in 1971 : In 1971 , Intel released the 4004 microprocessor .
It was a 4 - bit chip running at 108 kilohertz .
It had about 2,300 transistors .
By today 's standards it was extremely simple , but it was powerful enough to make one of the first electronic calculators possible .
In 1981 , IBM released the first IBM PC .
The original PC was based on the Intel 8088 processor .
The 8088 ran at 4.7 megahertz ( 43 times faster clock speed than the 4004 ) and had nearly 30,000 transistors ( 10 times more ) .
In 1993 , Intel released the first Pentium processor .
This chip ran at 60 megahertz ( 13 times faster clock speed than the 8088 ) and had over three million transistors ( 10 times more ) .
In 2000 the Pentium 4 appeared .
It had a clock speed of 1.5 gigahertz ( 25 times faster clock speed than the Pentium ) and it had 42 million transistors ( 13 times more ) . [ ref ]
You can see that there are two trends that combine to make computer chips more and more powerful .
First there is the increasing clock speed .
If you take any chip and double its clock speed , then it can perform twice as many operations per second .
Then there is the increasing number of transistors per chip .
More transistors let you get more done per clock cycle .
For example , with the 8088 processor it took approximately 80 clock cycles to multiply two 16 - bit integers together .
Today you can multiply two 32 - bit floating point numbers every clock cycle .
Some chips today even allow you to get more than one floating point operation done per clock cycle .
Taking Moore 's law literally , you would expect processor power to increase by a factor of 1,000 every 15 or 20 years .
Between 1981 and 2001 , that was definitely the case .
Clock speed improved by a factor of over 300 during that time , and the number of transistors per chip increased by a factor of 1,400 .
A processor in 2002 is 10,000 times faster than a processor in 1982 was .
This trend has been in place for decades , and there is nothing to indicate that it will slow down any time soon .
Scientists and engineers always get around the limitations that threaten Moore 's law by developing new technologies .
[ ref ]
The same thing happens with RAM chips and hard disk space .
A 10 megabyte hard disk cost about $ 1,000 in 1982 .
Today you can buy a 250 gigabyte drive that is twice as fast for $ 350 .
Today 's drive is 25,000 times bigger and costs one - third the price of the 1982 model because of Moore 's law .
In the same time period -- 1982 to 2002 -- standard RAM ( Random Access Memory ) available in a home machine has gone from 64 kilobytes to 128 megabytes -- it improved by of factor of 2,000 .
What if we simply extrapolate out , taking the idea that every 20 years things improve by a factor of 1,000 or 10,000 ?
What we get is a machine in 2020 that has a processor running at something like 10 trillion operations per second .
It has a terabyte of RAM and one or two petabytes of storage space ( a petabyte is one quadrillion bytes ) .
A machine with this kind of power is nearly incomprehensible -- there are only two or three machines on the planet with this kind of power today ( the monstrous NEC Earth Simulator , with 5,000 separate processor chips working together , is one example ) .
In 2020 , every kid will be running their video games on a $ 500 machine that has that kind of power .
What if we extrapolate another 20 years after that , to 2040 ?
A typical home machine at that point will be 1,000 times faster than the 2020 machine .
Human brains are thought to be able to process at a rate of approximately one quadrillion operations per second .
A CPU in the 2040 time frame could have the processing power of a human brain , and it will cost $ 1,000 .
It will have a petabyte ( one quadrillion bytes ) of RAM .
It will have one exabyte of storage space .
An exabyte is 1,000 quadrillion bytes .
That 's what Moore 's law predicts .
Between 1981 and 2002 , the processing power , hard disk space and RAM in a typical desktop computer increased dramatically because of Moore 's Law .
Extrapolating out to the years 2021 and 2041 shows a startling increase in computer power .
The point where small , inexpensive computers have power approaching that of the human brain is just a few decades away .
The computer power we will have in a home machine around 2050 will be utterly amazing .
A typical home computer will have processing power and memory capacity that exceeds that of a human brain .
What we will have in 2100 is anyone 's guess .
The power of a million human brains on the desktop ?
It is impossible to imagine , but not unlikely .
We need to start thinking about that future today .
People are talking optimistically about fielding a team of humanoid robotic soccer players able to beat the best human players in 2050 .
Imagine a team of C - 3POs running and kicking as well as or better than the best human soccer stars , but never getting tired or injured .
Imagine that same sort of robot taking 50 % of America 's jobs .
This Honda ad for ASIMO , and the fact that Honda is running it , are telling :
Honda ad from the back cover of Smithsonian magazine , January 2003
As the ad says , " ASIMO could be quite useful in some very important tasks . "
One of those very important tasks will be to take your job .
[ For details on ASIMO and a video , Click Here ]
The point is simple .
In the 2050 time frame , you can expect to buy a $ 1,000 home computer that has the computing power and memory of the human brain .
Manufacturers will marry that computer with a humanoid robotic chassis like ASIMO , a fuel cell and advanced AI software to create autonomous humanoid robots with startling capabilities .
It is not really hard to imagine that we will have robots like C - 3PO walking around and filling jobs as early as the 2030 time frame .
What 's missing from robots right now is brainpower , and by 2030 we will start to have more silicon brainpower than we know what to do with .
The New Employment Landscape Who Will Be First ?
Who will be the first large group of employees to be completely automated out of their jobs by robots ?
Chances are that it will be pilots .
There are already robots in the cockpit : auto - pilots .
We are rapidly coming to the point where airplanes can autonomously take off , fly to their destinations and land without human intervention .
Airplanes use radar for their vision systems , and radar has been around for more than half a century .
Pilots are prone to human error and they are incredibly expensive for the airlines .
The elimination of pilots could happen as early as 2015 .
We have no way to understand what is coming or how it will affect us .
Keep this fact in mind : the workplace of today is not really that much different from the workplace of 100 years ago .
Humans do almost all of the work today , just like they did in 1900 .
A restaurant today is nearly identical to a restaurant in 1900 .
An airport , hotel or amusement park today is nearly identical to any airport , hotel or amusement park seen decades ago .
Humans do nearly everything today in the workplace , just like they always have .
That 's because humans , unlike robots , can see , hear and understand language .
Robots have never really competed with humans for real jobs because computers have never had the vision systems needed to drive cars , work in restaurants or deliver packages .
All that will change very quickly by the middle of the 21st century .
As CPU chips and memory systems finally reach parity with the human brain , and then surpass it , robots will be able to perform nearly any normal job that a human performs today .
The self - service checkout lines that are springing up everywhere are the first sign of the trend .
See Robots in 2015 for details .
The problem , of course , is that all of these robots will eliminate a huge portion of the jobs currently held by human beings .
For example , there are 3.5 million jobs in the fast food industry alone .
Many of those will be lost to kiosks .
Many more will be lost to robots that can flip burgers and clean bathrooms .
Eventually they will all be lost .
The only people who will still have jobs in the fast food industry will be the senior management team at corporate headquarters .
The same sort of thing will happen in retail stores , hotels , airports , factories , construction sites , delivery companies and so on .
All of these jobs will evaporate at approximately the same time , leaving all of those workers unemployed .
The Post Office , FedEx and UPS together employed over a million workers in 2002 .
Once robots can drive the trucks and deliver the packages at a much lower cost than human workers can , those 1,000,000 or so employees will be out on the street .
If you look at the 2000 census figures , you can see the magnitude of the problem .
According to the census , there were 114 million employees working for 7 million companies in 2000 .
The employees brought home almost $ 4 trillion in wages that year .
Here 's the breakdown by industry :
U.S. jobs by industry according to the 2000 Census .
When you look at this chart , it is easy to understand that there will be huge job losses by 2040 or 2050 as robots move into the workplace .
For example : Nearly every construction job will go to a robot .
That 's about 6 million jobs lost .
Nearly every manufacturing job will go to a robot .
That 's 16 million jobs lost .
Nearly every transportation job will go to a robot .
That 's 3 million jobs lost .
Many wholesale and retail jobs will go to robots .
That 's at least 15 million lost jobs .
Nearly every hotel and restaurant job will go to a robot .
That 's 10 million jobs lost .
If you add that all up , it 's over 50 million jobs lost to robots .
That is a conservative estimate .
By 2050 or so , it is very likely that over half the jobs in the United States will be held by robots .
All the people who are holding jobs like those today will be unemployed .
American society has no way to deal with a situation where half of the workers are unemployed .
During the Great Depression at its very worst , 25 % of the population was unemployed .
In the robotic future , where 50 million jobs are lost , there is the potential for 50 % unemployment .
The conventional wisdom says that the economy will create 50 million new jobs to absorb all the unemployed people , but that raises two important questions :
What will those new jobs be ?
They wo n't be in manufacturing -- robots will hold all the manufacturing jobs .
They wo n't be in the service sector ( where most new jobs are now ) -- robots will work in all the restaurants and retail stores .
They wo n't be in transportation -- robots will be driving everything .
They wo n't be in security ( robotic police , robotic firefighters ) , the military ( robotic soldiers ) , entertainment ( robotic actors ) , medicine ( robotic doctors , nurses , pharmacists , counselors ) , construction ( robotic construction workers ) , aviation ( robotic pilots , robotic air traffic controllers ) , office work ( robotic receptionists , call centers and managers ) , research ( robotic scientists ) , education ( robotic teachers and computer - based training ) , programming or engineering ( outsourced to India at one - tenth the cost ) , farming ( robotic agricultural machinery ) , etc .
We are assuming that the economy is going to invent an entirely new category of employment that will absorb half of the working population .
Why is n't the economy creating those new jobs now ?
Today there are millions of unemployed people .
There are also tens of millions of people who would gladly abandon their minimum wage jobs scrubbing toilets , flipping burgers , driving trucks and shelving inventory for something better .
This imaginary new category of employment does not hinge on technology -- it is going to employ people , after all , in massive numbers -- it is going to employ half of today 's working population .
Why do n't we see any evidence of this new category of jobs today ?
Labor = Money
Right now , a majority of people in America trade their labor for money , and then they use the money to participate in the economy .
Our entire society is built around a simple equation : labor = money .
This equation explains why any new labor - saving technology is disruptive -- it threatens a group of people with joblessness and welfare .
Prefer the Kindle ? " Robotic Nation " is now available on the Kindle !
Join the discussion on Reddit Autonomous humanoid robots will take disruption to a whole new level .
Once fully - autonomous , general - purpose humanoid robots are as easy to buy as an automobile , most people in the economy will not be able to make the labor = money trade anymore .
They will have no way to earn money , and that means they end up homeless and on welfare .
With that many people on welfare , cost control becomes a big issue .
We are already seeing the first signs of it today .
The January 20 , 2003 issue of Time magazine notes the trend : " Cities have lost patience , concentrating on getting the homeless out of sight .
In New York City , where shelter space can't be created fast enough , Mayor Mike Bloomberg has proposed using old cruise ships for housing . "
This is not science fiction -- this is today 's news .
What we are talking about here are massive , government - controlled welfare dormitories keeping everyone who is unemployed " out of sight " .
Homelessness is increasing because millions of people are living on the edge .
Millions of working adults and families are trying to make a living from millions of low - paying jobs at places like Wal - Mart and McDonald's .
Most of those low - paying jobs are about to evaporate .
This article from the NYTimes sums up our current situation with this quote : Jobs have not followed growth , the committee wrote , because of increases in workers ' productivity .
In fact , Ms. Reaser said , the unemployment rate is unlikely to fall until the economy expands at an annual rate of 3.5 percent or 4 percent , the sort of pace attained in only two quarters since the recovery supposedly began .
With productivity growing at more than 2 percent a year , and the labor force growing about 1 percent a year , she said , the " hurdle rate " of growth for increasing the share of Americans with jobs cannot be less than 3 percent .
The term " worker productivity " in this quote means " robots " .
We are seeing the tip of the iceberg right now , because robotic replacement of human workers in every employment sector is about to accelerate rapidly .
Combine that with a powerful trend pushing high - paying IT jobs to India .
Combine it with the rapid loss of call - center jobs to India .
When the first wave of robots and offshore production cut in to the factory workforce in the 20th century , the slack was picked up by service sector jobs .
Now we are about to see the combined loss of massive numbers of service - sector jobs , most of the remaining jobs in factories , and many white collar jobs , all at the same time .
When a significant portion of the normal American population is permanently living in government welfare dormitories because of unemployment , what we will have is a third - world nation .
These citizens will be imprisoned by unemployment in their own society .
If you are an adult in America and you do not have a job , you are flat out of luck .
That is how our economy is structured today -- you cannot live your life unless you have a job .
Many people -- perhaps a majority of Americans -- will find themselves out of luck in the coming decades .
The arrival of humanoid robots should be a cause for celebration .
With the robots doing most of the work , it should be possible for everyone to go on perpetual vacation .
Instead , robots will displace millions of employees , leaving them unable to find work and therefore destitute .
I believe that it is time to start rethinking our economy and understanding how we will allow people to live their lives in a robotic nation .
