A senior adviser to the US presidential hopeful John McCain has apologised after saying a terrorist attack on American soil would be a " big advantage " to the Republican candidate 's election campaign .
Charlie Black later expressed regret over his " inappropriate " comments , and McCain said he disagreed with the claim .
McCain 's presidential rival Barack Obama called the remark a " complete disgrace " .
Discussing national security in an interview with Fortune magazine , Black was asked about the impact that another terrorist attack on US soil might have on McCain 's campaign .
" Certainly it would be a big advantage to him , " said Black .
He said the assassination of the former Pakistani prime minister Benazir Bhutto in December was an " unfortunate event " but had helped McCain to win the New Hampshire primary , a state he had to win to save his candidacy .
" His knowledge and ability to talk about it reemphasised that this is the guy who 's ready to be commander in chief .
And it helped us , " said Black .
Asked about Black 's comments at a press conference in California , McCain said : " I can not imagine why he would say it .
It 's not true .
I 've worked tirelessly since 9/11 to prevent another attack on the United States of America .
My record is very clear . "
Black , who was travelling with McCain , said : " I deeply regret the comments .
They were inappropriate .
I recognise that John McCain has devoted his entire adult life to protecting his country and placing its security before every other consideration . "
Bill Burton , Obama 's spokesman , said : " The fact that John McCain 's top adviser says that a terrorist attack on American soil would be a ' big advantage ' for their political campaign is a complete disgrace , and is exactly the kind of politics that needs to change . "
National security is seen as an issue on which McCain , who was held as a prisoner of war in Vietnam , has an advantage over Obama in the election .
Republicans have sought to emphasise Obama 's lack of experience and criticised the presumptive Democratic nominee when he suggested he would meet the Iranian president , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad .
He later backtracked .
Black was an aide to the former presidents Ronald Reagan and George Bush Snr , and has advised the incumbent in the White House .
Democrats have criticised Black 's role in McCain 's campaign as inconsistent with the Vietnam veteran 's no-lobbyist policy .
Black has represented a number of foreign governments in the US , including regimes with poor human rights records .
Suppose we want to generate the running sum series r formed by sums of n consecutive elements taken from a series s .
For example , to sum consecutive pairs taken from the first 6 integers :
>>> n = 2 >>> s = 0 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 >>> running_sum(s , 2 ) [ 1 , 3 , 5 , 7 , 9 ]
One approach would be to combine the sum built - in function with list slices and comprehensions .
>>> def running_sum(s , n ) : ... return [ sum( s[ lo:lo + n ] ) for lo in range ( len ( s ) - n + 1 ) ] ... >>> running_sum ( [ 0 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 ] , 2 ) [ 1 , 3 , 5 , 7 , 9 ]
This is fine if :
s is finite s supports slice access ( i.e. s[lo : hi ] does n’t raise a TypeError ) n is n’t too big
With just a little extra thought we can address all these issues .
To deal with the first two points we return to the specification .
What exactly do we require of s in order to generate r ?
Well , all that ’s really needed is for s to be iterable — which is to say we can advance along it — then our running sum function can arrange to buffer n items from s and yield their sums .
For maximum flexibility the result series r should also be iterable , allowing clients to choose how to consume it [ 1 ] .
In Python an object , o , becomes iterable by implementing the iterator protocol : o.__iter__ ( ) should return an iterator , i , over the container , which i.next ( ) advances , raising a StopIteration exception when done .
>>> r = [ 1 , 2 , 3 ] >>> i = r.__iter__( ) >>> i.next () 1 >>> i.next () 2 >>> i.next ( ) 3 >>> i.next ()
Traceback ( most recent call last ) : File " < stdin > " , line 1 , in < module > StopIteration
Python programs typically do n’t expose this protocol directly since we can build more convenient looping constructs on top of it .
By using the yield statement our running sum filter need n’t implement the iterator protocol directly either .
Here ’s a generator function which uses itertools .
islice in place of the original list slices .
Running sum for infinite series import itertools def running_sum(s , n ) : while True : r , s = itertools .
tee(s ) yield sum( itertools.islice(r , n ) ) s.next ( )
As you can see , objects returned by this function implement the iterator protocol .
# Running sum of pairs from 0 , 1 , 2 , 3 , ... >>> rs = running_sum( itertools.count ( ) , 2 ) >>> i = rs.__iter__( ) >>> i.next () 1 >>> i.next ( ) 3 >>> for s in rs : print s ... 5 7 9 11 13 .... Traceback ( most recent call last ) : File " < stdin > " , line 1 , in < module > KeyboardInterrupt
We have to kill the for loop by interrupting it since rs , being infinite ( in this particular case ) , never raises a StopIteration .
In fact , this particular version of running_sum ( ) fails badly on finite inputs for reasons we ’ll touch on later .
I wo n’t dwell on this flawed variant of running_sum ( ) , except to note in passing that the built - in sum function does n’t buffer n items from its input stream — it ’s a lazy function which accumulates these items one at a time .
There ’s no magic here , though : behind the scenes , as the teed iterators r and s diverge , the in - between values must be stored somewhere !
Each slice of items from s overlaps the one before : if we visualise the sliced range sliding along the series , at each stage an element gets pushed in at the top and an element gets popped out from the bottom .
Rather than repeatedly summing all the elements of these slices , we can calculate a single sum at the start of the series then adjust it as we progress [ 2 ] .
def running_sum(s , n ) : lo , hi = itertools . tee(s ) rs = sum(itertools.islice ( hi , n ) ) while True : yield rs rs += hi.next ( ) - lo.next ( )
Before we sign this function off , there ’s a bug to fix .
What if n is larger than the length of the input series ?
We ’d expect the output series to be empty , but :
>>> list ( running_sum ( [ 1 , 2 , 3 ] , 4 ) ) [ 6 ]
Oops !
The problem here is in passing an itertools.islice series to sum ( ) , which happily swallows the StopIteration exception without knowing if the sliced stream reached its end or if we reached the end of the slice , or indeed both .
>>> i = itertools.islice ( [ 1 , 2 , 3 ] , 4 ) >>> i.next ( ) , i.next ( ) , i.next ( ) ( 1 , 2 , 3 ) >>> i.next ()
Traceback ( most recent call last ) : File " < stdin > " , line 1 , in < module > StopIteration
A fix is to pass sum a list comprehension .
If n is too big a StopIteration exception gets raised before sum ever sees this list .
def running_sum(s , n ) : lo , hi = itertools . tee(s ) rs = sum ( [ hi.next ( ) for _ in range ( n ) ] ) while True : yield rs rs += hi.next ( ) - lo.next ( )
As a final tweak , we can make lo and hi iterator .
next functions rather than iterators , which saves a few attribute access calls .
def running_sum(s , n ) : ''' Generate the series of running sums of n elements of s. >>> list ( running_sum ( [ 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 ] , 2 ) ) [ 3 , 5 , 7 ] >>> rs = running_sum( itertools.count ( ) , 3 ) >>> rs.next ( ) , rs.next ( ) , rs.next ( ) ( 3 , 6 , 9 ) >>> list ( running_sum ( [ 1 , 2 ] , 3 ) ) [ ] ''' lo , hi = [ i.next for i in itertools .
tee(s ) ] rs = sum ( [ hi ( ) for _ in range ( n ) ] ) while True : yield rs rs += hi ( ) - lo ()

In a recent post on his blog , Jake clears up some misconceptions about Haskell .
In doing so he analyses the difference between lazy and strict types with clarity and insight .
Recommended reading !
This parallel indicates pretty clearly that recursively operating on each element of a stream is an infinite loop .
Stream is a control structure .
It does n’t exist to persist data across many parts of a program .
It exists to feed data into a function one element at a time .
In contrast , a Vector exists to persist an intermediate or final result of some 3 - dimensional computation .
In short , Stream is for controlling computation , and Vector is for storing data .
This generalizes to lazy and strict types , respectively .
The food shortage that has hit Japan is announced by the glaring gap on supermarket shelves next to the margarine and the sour cream and just above the cheese .
The butter shelf is empty .
The rich yellow stuff has all but vanished from grocery stores across Japan , with the world ’s second - biggest economy , where fine foods are prized and aisles otherwise groan with abundance .
Some stores have tried to ration the few bricks that occasionally arrive by limiting customers to a pack or two , but in most places merchants have been reduced to posting signs apologizing for having none .
Nor does anyone know when butter will be back .
Japanese milk production has dropped over the last two years , leaving less available to be churned into butter .

Even bakeries that buy in bulk are finding it hard to get enough , which crimps their ability to turn out the croissants , cakes and quiches that have shouldered their way into the Japanese diet .
“ We ’re in trouble , ” says Seiko Nakano , 27 , who runs Levain , a small but well - known French bakery in a residential neighborhood of Tokyo , who has been told she will not receive any more butter until Tuesday , a month later than expected .
In an attempt to stretch its stock , the bakery has cut down on the number of pies it produces and cut out the extra croissants it usually bakes for the weekend rush .
“ We ’ve had to come up with some new items that use less butter , like cookies , ” Nakano says , standing in front of cleaned - out shelves on a weekday afternoon .
“ But you ’re talking about flavor .
How can you replace butter ? ”

As global food shortages and ballooning prices are rocking the desperately poor from Africa to Southeast Asia , Japan ’s pastry problems qualify as barely more than an inconvenience .
No one expects the famously controlled Japanese to riot in the refrigerated sections of supermarkets .
But the case of the disappearing butter has unnerved people here , delivering a psychological blow to shoppers utterly unaccustomed to dealing with shortages .
The butter deficit arises from a convergence of market factors that has chased hundreds of domestic dairy farmers out of business in the last two years .
The sequence began when Japanese consumers began to drink less milk , a decline that coincided with a deluge of media coverage airing claims that milk is bad for your health .
Experts say consumption also has been affected by a low birthrate , which means fewer elementary school students getting a free daily carton .

The shrinking demand left the country so awash in milk two years ago that producers on the northern island of Hokkaido were dumping it down sewers .
A Hokkaido beer company tried to use some of the excess by brewing a low - malt beer that was one - third milk .
Called “ bilk ” and described as having a sweet taste , the concoction did n’t catch on .
But though popularity has declined for milk as a beverage , its use in the production of cheese is expected to jump 15 % this year , and demand for the less profitable butter holds steady .
The result , the Japanese dairy association explains , is that there is not much milk left to make butter .
“ We have plenty of milk ; just no butter , ” dairy deliveryman Kazunari Shimakura says as he unloads cartons of milk outside Levain .
Shimakura had never seen a shortage in his 20 years of delivering supplies .
When he parks his truck these days , people come up to ask whether he can sell them a pack or two of butter on the side .
Last month , the government stepped in to urge the country ’s four largest dairy product companies to churn out more butter .
And the agriculture board is moving up its scheduled purchases of butter imported from Australia and elsewhere by six months in an attempt to get some back on the shelves .
Japan imports about 10 % of its butter , but usually does not go to international markets until fall .

This year ’s butter imports are expected to hit an all - time high and are almost certain to send prices sharply higher .

Jason Beghe Boosts Morale of Peaceful San Francisco Activists
End
-- SAN FRANCISCO , CA - Actor Jason
Beghe made an appearance at the monthly Anonymous Cult of Scientology protest on Saturday , May 10 , 2008 at the base of the Transamerica Building on the corner of Montgomery and Washington Streets in San Francisco , CA .
He was greeted with cheers and handshakes from about 120 masked Anonymous activists .
Jason
Beghe created a media storm in April by publicly " blowing " or quitting from the cult of Scientology after being in for 14 years .
The " teaser " video Jason Beghe made was viewed on YouTube over 800,000 times within 48 hours .
The video and the account hosting it , owned by critic and webmaster of XenuTV.com Mark Bunker , was removed a few days later due to allegations of Bunker 's YouTube terms of services violations .
A few days later , internet users noticed cult of Scientology ads appearing on YouTube , Google , Encyclopedia Dramatica , UrbanDictionary.com , and other popular websites .
The complete Jason Beghe interview has since been moved and hosted by XenuTV.com using Vimeo.com 's video sharing service .
Actor Jason
Beghe is a veteran television and movie actor appearing in shows such as " Numb3rs " , " CSI : NY " , " Cane " , and " Melrose Place " .
His movie credits include G.I Jane , Monkey Shines , and many others .
He has been working in Hollywood for over 25 years and is friends with " The X - Files " actor David Duchovny .
Anonymous is a loose , leaderless collective of individuals from all walks of life who use the internet and are united by the power of ideas .
First known as internet pranksters , Anonymous projects have resulted in the closing of the white - supremacist radio show produced by Hal Turner , and the criminal prosecution of Canadian pedophile Chris Forcand .
Anonymous has been called a " Cyber Vigilante Group " by The Toronto Sun and Global News .
The next Anonymous protest in San Francisco will be on Saturday , June 14 , 2008 at 11:00 AM and will focus on the abuses of the cult of Scientology 's " navy " called The Sea Org.
Anonymous protesters are encouraged to wear pirate costumes to participate in the Anonymous " navy " called The Sea Arrrgh .
Earthquake Hit Students Find Light in the Dark
Four days ago , China was hit by a massive 7.8 magnitude earthquake that killed over 22,000 people , and left over 15,000 people buried under the ruins waiting to be found .
Many schools , which were poorly built , where the first ones to collapse when the earthquake hit .
Hundreds if not thousands of children were killed .
19 year old Meng and Gong were neighbors , they are two of the lucky ones to be alive .
Despite losing their homes and classrooms , and without enough clean water or food , they were still studying hard in the ruins for their tests .
â€ œGetting into the college is my only goal , so I can help my parents not be poor anymore .
â€ 
Meng says .
Yi , a college student was able to dig up a few wet and wrinkled books from her collapsed home , which she will dry out and begin studying for her test to become a paralegal .
June 7th is an important day for students who want to get in the college .
This earthquake occured in the central part of China , which is the poorest area among the nation .
Having a college education is the only way for most kids to escape poverty and even in this disastrous situition , these kids were still working hard for their future .
If you ask these Chinese kids what they have to say about the disaster , their answer will be â€ œ
The earthquake can ruin our homes , but it ca n’t ruin our future !â€ 

注意：ここでは正規表現とワイルドカード自体については説明しません。ここで紹介するような間違いに注意して、もう一度検索してください。
「 ・・・がわかっていない人は、情報関係の本なんて書くべきではない」なんてことを言うと自分に跳ね返ってきそうで怖いのですが、正規表現とワイルドカードの違いがわかっていない人は、お願いですから情報関係の教科書は書かないでください。
計算機概論の講義のネタを集めているときに、「正規表現とワイルドカードをごっちゃにする」というとんでもない間違いが世に蔓延っているのを知りました。影響力の小さいブログとかなら別にいいのですが、情報処理技術者試験の教科書や、IT用語辞典が間違っているのはまずいでしょう。
たとえば、手元にあった『ソフトウェア開発技術者完全教本』には、次のような記述がありました。
正規表現は、特定の文字列ではなく文字列の一部を一般化して表現するための手法。プログラム言語理論の分野において、字句（変数名や予約語、その他の識別子）を一般化して定義するために考案された表現である。 たとえば、文字列検索において、 ” * ” を任意の文字列（空文字も含む）、 ” ? ” を任意の1文字として指定できるとすると、検索文字列に”abc*”と指定すると、次のような文字列が検索の対象となる。 abc , abcd , abcded , abcdefghijklmnなど などが検索の対象となる。また、 ” a?c”と指定した場合は、次のような文字列が検索の対象となる。 abc , aac , axcな ど
最初の説明は変ですし、後の例は正規表現ではなくワイルドカードのものです。開いた口がふさがらないというやつです。
も う1冊、『情報処理技術者試験学習書 情報処理技術者』には次のような記述がありました。
文字列に対して、特定の文字（ ” $ ” 、 ” *” など）を組み合わせて表現することを正規表現という。この特定の文字を、メタキャラクタという。メタキャラクタは特別な意味を持っている。UnixやWindowsなどでファイルを検索するとき、”*.jpg”と指定すると、拡張子が”jpg”であるファイルが検索される。このときの ” *” がメタキャラクタである。
メタメタですね。ちょっとした誤解というわけではなさそうです。
辞典も信用なりません 。SL900Xに収録されている情報処理技術者用語辞典によれば、
字句をパターンの集合で表す式で定義する表現方式。（中略）「*」はワイルドカードとして利用される。
されません。正規表現とワイルドカードは違います。なんか、やばいことになってませんか？
ASCII のデジタル用語辞 典( Glossary Help ) には、先の『ソフトウェア開発技術者完全教本』とほとんど同じ説明が載ってますね。やれやれ（著作権とかは大丈夫なんでしょうか。ウソを護ってもしょうがないかもしれませんが）。
同じ くASCIIのデジタル用語辞 典( PC EXPLORER ) によれば 、
文字列の一部をパターン化して記述する方法。正規表現を用いた検索では、特定の単語そのものだけではなく条件に一致する複数の単語を検索できる。UNIXなどで一般的な文字列検索プログラム「grep」では、キーワード中の「*」を任意の文字列、「？」を任意の1文字として検索できる。
できません。それはワイルドカードです。
教科書も辞典もダメだとすると、学生は何に頼ったらいいんでしょう。
学問の場では批判的に見られることが多いようですが、Wikipediaの説明はけっこういいと思いますよ（同じような話は拙著にも書きましたが）。「 Wikipediaは信頼性が・・・」なんて乱暴な言い方はできなくなりますね。
拡張された正規表現には正規言語ではない文字列も表せるものも多く、ゆえに正規表現という名前は実態に即していない面もあるが、伝統的に正規表現と呼ばれ続けている。
正規表現の解説書は 、Friedl『詳説 正規表現』（第3版）が定番です（最近、新しい翻訳が出ました）。
言語理論の教科書は 、Hopcroft , Ullman , Motwani『オートマトン言語理論 計算論』が定番です が 、Sipser『計算理論の基礎』（原著第2版）という新しい教科書もお薦めです（学生だったときに、これの第1版を読みました。1冊のほうが扱いやすくていいのですが）。
ちゃんと勉強したい学生の皆さんは、定評のある教科書を選ぶと良いでしょう。
追記：だから、正規表現とワイルドカードは違うんだって
お約束ですが、実際にコードを書きながら正規表現を学びたいという方には、拙著『Webアプリケーション構築入門 実践！Webページ制作からマッシュアップまで 』（森北出版 , 2011 ）がおすすめです。

THE trouble with marriage , some evolutionary psychologists believe , is not immorality but life expectancy .
Human beings were indeed designed to be monogamous , runs the argument , but they were supposed to live only to 30 : ten years of fidelity is in the genes , but golden anniversaries are not .
A similar rule applies to political unions .
Voters ' devotion to governments , however passionate at first blush , cannot last forever ; eventually the couple become rancorous and recriminatory .
Gordon Brown and Labour seem to be entering this supernumerary phase — the phase of having stayed too long .
Until April 23rd the government faced a humiliating parliamentary defeat over its abolition of the 10 p income - tax band , a change that will leave several million poor people worse off — a botched reform that , say MPs of all parties , voters bitterly resent .
Then Mr Brown and Alistair Darling , the chancellor , promised only slightly less humiliatingly to make good some of the losses .
As he did so , Mr Brown extolled the poverty - reducing virtues of the minimum wage , introduced in 1999 .
But the minimum wage , along with the fiddly but generously redistributive tax - credit system he devised , is now just part of the economic furniture .
Likewise , when Mr Brown harks back to the early 1990s , lots of voters can scarcely remember the darkness he tries to conjure , and a few were barely born .
Mr Brown 's approach to redistribution helps to explain the shortage of credit he gets for it : his neo -Victorian concept of the deserving poor ( essentially working parents and pensioners ) ; his gloomy conviction that the sharing had to be surreptitious .
But just as , in a long marriage , partners forget how lonesome they were before it , so voters have forgotten or “ banked ” most of Labour 's achievements .
Lots of people , for example , tell pollsters that the National Health Service is worse than in 1997 , even though on any sensible measure it is n't .
Expectations rise and cynicism abounds , but memory fades and patience wears out .
Conversely , if governments have the mixed fortune to survive long enough , their mistakes and myopic compromises catch up with them .
The controversial tax reform itself epitomises the fiscal tricksiness with which , as chancellor , Mr Brown raised money through subtle but cumulatively burdensome tax ruses .
He also borrowed copiously to finance his spending plans — a technique whose political consequences he might have escaped had Labour left office before the current downturn .
Another thing that ultimately catches up with long - lived governments is the economic cycle .
As with voters , so with Mr Brown 's cooling romance with his own MPs .
Part of the explanation is that parliamentary rebellion , rather like adultery , is habit - forming : at first it feels impossible , then transgressive and finally mundane .
There is also , inevitably , a swelling cadre of alienated MPs — has - been ex-ministers and never - going - to - be - and - know - it backbenchers — for whom infidelity seems costless .
As Mr Brown 's poll ratings wane , self - interest ( ie , keeping their seats ) actively motivates some MPs to distance themselves from him .
Meanwhile Labour 's majority has declined from the landslide proportions of its first two terms to the merely healthy .
So whereas Tony Blair comfortably survived early left - wing revolts , over a miserly increase to the basic state pension and cuts to single parents ' benefit , the 10 p guerrillas rapidly extracted their concessions .
So , maybe , will another impending rebellion over bizarrely stubborn plans to increase to 42 days the time those suspected of terrorism can be held without charge .
That makes the government look even weaker and more exhausted .
The spiral of indiscipline has also exacerbated another habit that took hold during Mr Brown 's resentful decade as chancellor , and is proving its own revenge : regicide .
Internecine briefing seems to have become almost a socially acceptable pastime among some ministers , just as it eventually did under the Tories .
As the “ assassins ” who brought down Margaret Thatcher begat the “ bastards ” who almost did for John Major , so the Brownite - Blairite struggle has been elided , almost uninterruptedly , with intra-Brownite strife .
Blood , it turns out , will indeed have blood .
Yet , in this case , the blood is likely to flow in small quantities rather than a great murderous gush .
Despite heady speculation about a coup , Mr Brown is probably safe in his job , for now .
Labour has already copied the Tory manoeuvre of changing the front man ; to do so again would look undemocratic as well as absurd .
But another reason Mr Brown is safe is that he has deprived himself of what ought to be one of the few advantages of long incumbency .
Almost all the Labour politicians who have developed reputations to match those of , say , the Tories ' Ken Clarke or Michael Heseltine have left government , voluntarily or otherwise .
There is , for the moment , no obvious alternative to Mr Brown .
There is also no one to share his Methuselan burden .
Himself , alone
Because they tend to be built on ideas , which can run out , Labour governments have generally found it especially tough to stay in office .
The longevity of this one , after the long Tory imperium , suggests that the life expectancy of British governments , like that of humans , has lengthened .
But the basic physics of politics will not change .
Eventually the equilibrium between hope and trust on the one hand , and disappointment on the other , must shift against the incumbent .
That is Mr Brown 's big problem .
It is not that he lacks a “ vision ” ( his egalitarian meritocracy is perfectly serviceable ) , or that he is indecisive and uncharismatic ( though he is ) .
It is not 10 p or 42 days .
It is that Labour has been in office for 11 years .
It will very likely be 13 by the time of the general election — two more years in which Mr Brown must bear the gathering weight of grievance and ingratitude , more or less alone .
This week on Musical Geek Friday - God Wrote in Lisp ( also known as The Eternal Flame ) song !
This song is written by Bob Kanefsky and is performed by Julia Ecklar .
It 's a parody of another song of hers - " God Lives on Terra " .
The song is about a question which programming language God could have used to create us ?
God had a tight 6 day deadline to create the world , so he had to make a smart decision which language to use .
Some folks say that it could have been C++ or C , but these languages are out as God would not have been able to even count grains of sand with 32 - bit integers !
Others say it could have been Fortran , Java , COBOL or even APL .
But we all know the truth ...
God wrote the world in Lisp !
Here it is !

If you liked this song , it 's included in a music CD " Roundworm " which contains parodies about Star Trek , dead cats , Lisp programming ( this song ) , and everything in between !
Here are the lyrics of The Eternal Flame ( God Wrote in Lisp ) song :
I was taught assembler in my second year of school .
It 's kinda like construction work — with a toothpick for a tool .
So when I made my senior year , I threw my code away , And learned the way to program that I still prefer today .
Now , some folks on the Internet put their faith in C ++.
They swear that it 's so powerful , it 's what God used for us .
And maybe it lets mortals dredge their objects from the C .
But I think that explains why only God can make a tree .
For God wrote in Lisp code
When he filled the leaves with green .
The fractal flowers and recursive roots :
The most lovely hack I 've seen .
And when I ponder snowflakes , never finding two the same , I know God likes a language with its own four - letter name .
Now , I 've used a SUN under Unix , so I 've seen what C can hold .
I 've surfed for Perls , found what Fortran 's for , Got that Java stuff down cold .
Though the chance that I 'd write COBOL code is a SNOBOL 's chance in Hell .
And I basically hate hieroglyphs , so I wo n't use APL .
Now , God must know all these languages , and a few I have n't named .
But the Lord made sure , when each sparrow falls , that its flesh will be reclaimed .
And the Lord could not count grains of sand with a 32 - bit word .
Who knows where we would go to if Lisp were n't what he preferred ?
And God wrote in Lisp code Every creature great and small .
Do n't search the disk drive for man.c ,
When the listing 's on the wall .
And when I watch the lightning Burn unbelievers to a crisp , I know God had six days to work , So he wrote it all in Lisp .
Yes , God had a deadline .
So he wrote it all in Lisp .

Marc Anthony Says J- Lo Expects Him To Help Out
thinks his wifeis " such a gem to watch . "
He did n't say what kind of gem , I mean what - cubic zirconium , ruby , emerald , sapphire , oh , likely he meant a 50 karat diamond .
In an interview on The Billy Bush Show yesterday , Anthony gushed about his bride and her great mothering abilities with their twins Max and Emme , who were born on Feb .
22 :
It 's just us , man .
We 're figuring it out and are having a great time .
She expects me to help and she makes no bones about it .
I get the late shift .
I get literally from 10 p.m. on because we do n't have a nanny .
It 's just me and Jennifer figuring it out .
From 10 p.m. to 8 a.m. , that 's my shift . "
We wonder how long the couple will be able to go without hiring a nanny .
Anthony is currently touring the country in a campaign to fight childhood obesity while Jennifer has three movies lined up .
Hey - if Mark is touring the country ... who has the 10 p.m. to 8 a .m. shift ?
I smell something fishy here !
Maybe the cook and household staff are good with kids .
Check out the babies below .
As cars become smarter than the people driving them and do more of the things humans should be doing for themselves — checking blind spots , watching for lane departures , anticipating collisions — it was only a matter of time before a car started reading road signs .
The " Traffic Sign Recognition and Lane Departure Warning " system available early next year on General Motors ' new Euro - only Opel / Vauxhall Insignia scans the road ahead at 30 frames per second to read road signs and tell you when you 're wandering from your lane .
The most innovative aspect of the system is the road - sign recognition processor , which can read signs as far as 100 meters away .
The system uses two processors and a camera – called , appropriately , the Front Camera System – mounted near the rear - view mirror .
One processor identifies familiar shapes , symbols and digits on common road signs and conveys the information to the driver via a digital display in the gauge cluster .
The other alerts the driver when he or she strays from the lane .
" These new features follow Opel 's philosophy of enhancing driving excitement by assisting drivers without reducing their level of control , " says Hans Demant , managing director of GM Europe Engineering .
" That means the system gives the drivers information , but it does n't intervene . "
We 're not entirely sure why GM thinks it 's easier to read a speed - limit sign on a tiny display between your speedometer and tachometer than on a big road sign .
Dement says " a car that can see and warn the driver well in advance of potential hazards is another important step in our long - term accident prevention strategy . ”

WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
A majority of Democrats think Barack Obama should select Hillary Clinton as his running mate , according to a new national poll .
Fifty - four percent of registered Democrats questioned in a CNN / Opinion Research Corporation poll released Friday think Obama should name his rival as his running mate ; 43 percent disagreed .
The poll is the first national survey conducted since Obama claimed the Democratic presidential nomination Tuesday night , at the end of the primary season .
Clinton is expected to announce Saturday that she 's suspending her campaign and backing her Senate colleague .
Men and women do n't see eye - to - eye on the question .
Sixty percent of Democratic women said Clinton should be Obama 's running mate , but only 46 percent of male Democrats agreed , while 51 percent of them said no .
" ' What do women want ? '
Sigmund Freud famously asked , " said Bill Schneider , CNN senior political analyst .
" The answer appears to be Clinton on the ticket .
It 's pretty clear that many Democratic women are miffed and that Obama has to be very careful how he deals with Sen. Clinton . "

Twenty - four percent of those polled said that even if Obama names someone else as his running mate , Clinton should try to override that decision at the Democratic convention in Denver in August .
But 75 percent said that would not be a good idea .
" Democrats would like Barack Obama to choose Hillary Clinton as his running mate , but they seem to recognize that it is his choice to make , " said Keating Holland CNN polling director .
" Some will be disappointed if Obama does not pick Clinton , but not disappointed enough to want a floor fight at the convention . "

The survey also found that the economy remains the top issue in the minds of a plurality of Americans .
Forty - two percent of those polled said the economy will be the most important issue in their decision on the presidency .
Iraq remains in second place , selected by 24 percent as the most important issue for them , while health care was selected as most important by 12 percent .
The CNN / Opinion Research Corporation poll was conducted Wednesday and Thursday , with 921 registered voters , including 435 registered voters who describe themselves as Democrats or independents who lean Democratic .
The sampling error for most results is plus or minus 4.5 percentage points .

TEHRAN ( Reuters ) - Iran has started to install 6,000 new centrifuges at its uranium enrichment facility , President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad said on Tuesday , an expansion of nuclear work the West fears is aimed at building bombs .

Diplomats in Vienna told Reuters last week that Tehran was installing advanced enrichment centrifuges at the underground Natanz facility , accelerating activity that could give Iran the means to make atom bombs in the future if it chose to .
Iran , the world ’s fourth largest oil exporter , says it wants nuclear technology to generate electricity .
“ President Ahmadinejad has announced the start of the installation of 6,000 new centrifuges at Natanz , ” state radio said .
State television carried a similar report .
“ Today we have started the installation of 6,000 new centrifuges ...
I will announce more achievements tonight , ” the official IRNA news agency quoted Ahmadinejad as saying at Natanz in central Iran , surrounded by anti-aircraft guns .
The president will give a speech later on Tuesday in a ceremony in Tehran to celebrate Iran ’s National Day of Nuclear Technology .
Ahmadinejad ’s announcement is a new snub to the U.N. Security Council which since late 2006 has imposed three rounds of sanctions on Tehran for refusing to halt enrichment work .
A senior nuclear official told Reuters Ahmadinejad had also inspected a “ new generation ” of centrifuges built by Iranian scientists at a research facility at Natanz .
Washington has not ruled out military action to stop Iran ’s nuclear work and Israel , Tehran ’s arch - foe , has urged the international community to stop “ the aggressive nuclear program of Iran ” .
“ The leadership ( in Tehran ) must understand that the international community sees the Iranian nuclear program as completely unacceptable , ” said Israeli government spokesman Mark Regev in reaction to Ahmadinejad ’s announcement .
Enriched uranium can be used as fuel in nuclear power plants or , if refined much more , provide material for weapons .
“ FURTHER ACHIEVMENTS ”
Centrifuges are machines that can spin compounds of uranium at supersonic speed to separate out and concentrate the most radioactive isotope of the element .
Analysts say they believe Iran aims to gradually replace its start - up “ P - 1 ” centrifuge with a new generation it has adapted from a “ P - 2 ” design , obtained via black markets from the West and able to enrich uranium two - three times faster than its older counterpart .
Nuclear analysts say around 1,500 centrifuges would be needed for Iran to manufacture the minimum 20 kg ( 45 kg ) of highly enriched uranium needed for one crude warhead .
The five permanent members of the U.N. Security Council and Germany plan to meet in April to discuss whether to sweeten a 2006 offer of incentives to persuade Iran to curb its nuclear program , U.S. officials said on Monday .
A senior U.S. official made clear on Monday the Bush administration ’s skepticism about improving on the offer but said it would hear out what other world powers wished to say .
Tehran has so far rejected any suggestion that it halt or limit its nuclear work in exchange for trade and other incentives , and says it will only negotiate with the U.N. nuclear watchdog .
“ We have obtained our achievements under sanctions ...
These may delay our work but ... will encourage our scientists to continue making progress , ” Ahmadinejad said .
Tehran says it believes the Western - backed push to control its nuclear program will eventually fade because of international dependence on Iranian oil and gas exports .

Total Data Protection
If there ’s one thing any business is dependent on , it ’s data .
There is n’t a business that can run without data .
Every bit of company data is important .
Hence , it ’s vital to protect all your business data .
You ’re on the right track if you ’re already protecting all your business data .
But the question is , are you protecting them the right way ?
Simply backing up all your business files to USBs , CDs , and external hard drives is not enough these days .
If you can lose your laptop , you can lose your USB as well .
If your computer can crash and delete all your business files , your external hard drive can fail as well .
All these hardware have their life expectancy .
You ca n’t totally rely on them , most especially for all your business files .
The best thing about it is that Carbonite automatically and continuously backs up all your files .
This puts you in a better position to solely concentrate on the operations of your business .
Online backup like Carbonite is the best data protection for all your business files .
Yes , all your business files are backed up to the cloud by Carbonite .
The best thing about it is that Carbonite automatically and continuously backs up all your files .
This puts you in a better position to solely concentrate on the operations of your business .
But as a prudent small business owner , your main concern is online data protection .
That is a very valid concern and Carbonite addresses this issue very well .
First and foremost , all your business files are encrypted .
Carbonite uses the 128 - bit encryption technology to secure all your business files online .
Considered as one of the most secure methods to encrypt and to decrypt data , most of the large banking and financial institutions rely on the same technology to protect their files .
According to technopedia.com , this particular encryption algorithm and technology is hard to crack .
It would take “ massive computations ” to crack the key .
So with the 128 - bit encryption , all your business files are safe online .
Second of all , your business files are transferred to the cloud using a technology called Secure Socket Layer or SSL .
This is the standard technology online that ensures security of file transfer between a client and a server .
Carbonite makes use of this technology to ensure all your files remain safe , private , and protected as they are all transferred online .

Did you find the Carbonite promo code featured above useful ?
Let us know .
In one of his ( very informative ) video lectures , Douglas Crockford remarks that writing JavaScript for the web is ' programming in a hostile environment ' .
I had done my fair share of weird workarounds , and even occasonally gave up an on idea entirely because browsers just would n't support it , but before this project I never really realized just how powerless a programmer can be in the face of buggy , incompatible , and poorly designed platforms .
The plan was not ridiculously ambitious .
I wanted to ' enhance ' a textarea to the point where writing code in it is pleasant .
This meant automatic indentation and , if possible at all , syntax highlighting .
In this document I describe the story of implementing this , for your education and amusement .
A demonstration of the resulting program , along with the source code , can be found at the project website .
Note : some of the details given here no longer apply to the current CodeMirror codebase , which has evolved quite a bit in the meantime .
Take one : Only indentation
The very first attempt merely added auto-indentation to a textarea element .
It would scan backwards through the content of the area , starting from the cursor , until it had enough information to decide how to indent the current line .
It took me a while to figure out a decent model for indenting JavaScript code , but in the end this seems to work :
Code that sits inside a block is indented one unit ( generally two spaces ) more than the statement or brace that opened the block .
A statement that is continued to the next line is indented one unit more than the line that starts the statement .
When dealing with lists of arguments or the content of array and object literals there are two possible models .
If there is any text directly after the opening brace , bracket , or parenthesis , subsequent lines are aligned with this opening character .
If the opening character is followed by a newline ( optionally with whitespace or comments before it ) , the next line is indented one unit further than the line that started the list .
And , obviously , if a statement follows another statement it is indented the same amount as the one before it .
When scanning backwards through code one has to take string values , comments , and regular expressions ( which are delimited by slashes ) into account , because braces and semicolons and such are not significant when they appear inside them .
Single - line ( '//') comments turned out to be rather inefficient to check for when doing a backwards scan , since every time you encounter a newline you have to go on to the next newline to determine whether this line ends in a comment or not .
Regular expressions are even worse ― without contextual information they are impossible to distinguish from the division operator , and I did n't get them working in this first version .
To find out which line to indent , and to make sure that adding or removing whitespace does n't cause the cursor to jump in strange ways , it is necessary to determine which text the user has selected .
Even though I was working with just a simple textarea at this point , this was already a bit of a headache .
On W3C - standards - respecting browsers , textarea nodes have selectionStart and selectionEnd properties which nicely give you the amount of characters before the start and end of the selection .
Great !
Then , there is Internet Explorer .
Internet Explorer also has an API for looking at and manipulating selections .
It gives you information such as a detailed map of the space the selected lines take up on the screen , in pixels , and of course the text inside the selection .
It does , however , not give you much of a clue on where the selection is located in the document .
After some experimentation I managed to work out an elaborate method for getting something similar to the selectionStart and selectionEnd values in other browsers .
It worked like this :
Get the TextRange object corresponding to the selection .
object corresponding to the selection .
Record the length of the text inside it .
Make another TextRange that covers the whole textarea element .
that covers the whole textarea element .
Set the start of the first TextRange to the start of the second one .
to the start of the second one .
Again get the length of the text in the first object .
Now selectionEnd is the second length , and selectionStart is the second minus the first one .
That seemed to work , but when resetting the selection after modifying the content of the textarea I ran into another interesting feature of these TextRange s :
You can move their endpoints by a given number of characters , which is useful when trying to set a cursor at the Nth character of a textarea , but in this context , newlines are not considered to be characters , so you 'll always end up one character too far for every newline you passed .
Of course , you can count newlines and compensate for this ( though it is still not possible to position the cursor right in front of a newline ) .
Sheesh .
After ragging on Internet Explorer for a while , let us move on and rag on Firefox a bit .
It turns out that , in Firefox , getting and setting the text content of a DOM element is unexplainably expensive , especially when there is a lot of text involved .
As soon as I tried to use my indentation code to indent itself ( some 400 lines ) , I found myself waiting for over four seconds every time I pressed enter .
That seemed a little slow .
designMode it is
The solution was obvious :
Since the text inside a textarea can only be manipulated as one single big string , I had to spread it out over multiple nodes .
How do you spread editable content over multiple nodes ?
Right !
designMode or contentEditable .
Now I was n't entirely naive about designMode , I had been looking into writing a non-messy WYSIWYG editor before , and at that time I had concluded two things :
It is impossible to prevent the user from inserting whichever HTML junk he wants into the document .
In Internet Explorer , it is extemely hard to get a good view on what nodes the user has selected .
Basically , the good folks at Microsoft designed a really bad interface for putting editable documents in pages , and the other browsers , not wanting to be left behind , more or less copied that .
And there is n't much hope for a better way to do this appearing anytime soon .
Wise people probably use a Flash movie or ( God forbid ) a Java applet for these kind of things , though those are not without drawbacks either .
Anyway , seeing how using an editable document would also make syntax highlighting possible , I foolishly went ahead .
There is something perversely fascinating about trying to build a complicated system on a lousy , unsuitable platform .
A parser
How does one do decent syntax highlighting ?
A very simple scanning can tell the difference between strings , comments , keywords , and other code .
But this time I wanted to actually be able to recognize regular expressions , so that I did n't have any blatant incorrect behaviour anymore .
That brought me to the idea of doing a serious parse on the code .
This would not only make detecting regular expressions much easier , it would also give me detailed information about the code , which can be used to determine proper indentation levels , and to make subtle distinctions in colouring , for example the difference between variable names and property names .
And hey , when we 're parsing the whole thing , it would even be possible to make a distinction between local and global variables , and colour them differently .
If you 've ever programmed JavaScript you can probably imagine how useful this would be ― it is ridiculously easy to accidentally create global instead of local variables .
I do n't consider myself a JavaScript rookie anymore , but it was ( embarrasingly enough ) only this week that I realized that my habit of typing for ( name in object ) ... was creating a global variable name , and that I should be typing for ( var name in object ) ... instead .
Re-parsing all the code the user has typed in every time he hits a key is obviously not feasible .
So how does one combine on - the - fly highlighting with a serious parser ?
One option would be to split the code into top - level statements ( functions , variable definitions , etc. ) and parse these separately .
This is horribly clunky though , especially considering the fact that modern JavaScripters often put all the code in a file in a single big object or function to prevent namespace pollution .
I have always liked continuation - passing style and generators .
So the idea I came up with is this :
An interruptable , resumable parser .
This is a parser that does not run through a whole document at once , but parses on - demand , a little bit at a time .
At any moment you can create a copy of its current state , which can be resumed later .
You start parsing at the top of the code , and keep going as long as you like , but throughout the document , for example at every end of line , you store a copy of the current parser state .
Later on , when line 106 changes , you grab the interrupted parser that was stored at the end of line 105 , and use it to re-parse line 106 .
It still knows exactly what the context was at that point , which local variables were defined , which unfinished statements were encountered , and so on .
But that , unfortunately , turned out to be not quite as easy as it sounds .
The DOM nodes underfoot
Of course , when working inside an editable frame we do n't just have to deal with text .
The code will be represented by some kind of DOM tree .
My first idea was to set the white - space : pre style for the frame and try to work with mostly text , with the occasional coloured span element .
It turned out that support for white - space : pre in browsers , especially in editable frames , is so hopelessly glitchy that this was unworkable .
Next I tried a series of div elements , one per line , with span elements inside them .
This seemed to nicely reflect the structure of the code in a shallowly hierarchical way .
I soon realized , however , that my code would be much more straightfoward when using no hierarchy whatsoever ― a series of span s , with br tags at the end of every line .
This way , the DOM nodes form a flat sequence that corresponds to the sequence of the text ― just extract text from span nodes and substitute newlines for br nodes .
It would be a shame if the editor would fall apart as soon as someone pastes some complicated HTML into it .
I wanted it to be able to deal with whatever mess it finds .
This means using some kind of HTML - normalizer that takes arbitrary HTML and flattens it into a series of br s and span elements that contain a single text node .
Just like the parsing process , it would be best if this did not have to done to the entire buffer every time something changes .
It took some banging my head against my keyboard , but I found a very nice way to model this .
It makes heavy use of generators , for which I used MochiKit 's iterator framework .
Bob Ippolito explains the concepts in this library very well in his blog post about it .
( Also notice some of the dismissive comments at the bottom of that post .
They say " I do n't think I really want to learn this , so I 'll make up some silly reason to condemn it . " )
The highlighting process consists of the following elements : normalizing the DOM tree , extracting the text from the DOM tree , tokenizing this text , parsing the tokens , and finally adjusting the DOM nodes to reflect the structure of the code .
The first two , I put into a single generator .
It scans the DOM tree , fixing anything that is not a simple top - level span or br , and it produces the text content of the nodes ( or a newline in case of a br ) as its output ― each time it is called , it yields a string .
Continuation passing style was a good way to model this process in an iterator , which has to be processed one step at a time .
Look at this simplified version :
function traverseDOM ( start ) { var cc = function ( ) { return scanNode ( start , stop ) ;} ; function stop ( ) { cc = stop ; throw StopIteration ; } function yield ( value , c ) { cc = c ; return value ; } function scanNode ( node , c ) { if ( node .
nextSibling ) var nextc = function ( ) { return scanNode ( node .
nextSibling , c ) ;} ; else var nextc = c ; if ( ) return yield ( node .
firstChild .
nodeValue , nextc ) ; else if ( ) return yield ( "
" , nextc ) ; else ; } return { next : function ( ) { return cc ( ) ; }} ; }
The variable c stands for ' continuation ' , and cc for ' current continuation ' ― that last variable is used to store the function to continue with , when yielding a value to the outside world .
Every time control leaves this function , it has to make sure that cc is set to a suitable value , which is what yield and stop take care of .
The object that is returned contains a next method , which is MochiKit 's idea of an iterator , and the initial continuation just throws a StopIteration , which is how MochiKit signals that an iterator has reached its end .
The first lines of scanNode extend the continuation with the task of scanning the next node , if there is a next node .
The rest of the function decides what kind of value to yield .
Note that this is a rather trivial example of this technique , since the process of going through these nodes is basically linear ( it was much , much more complex in earlier versions ) , but still the trick with the continuations makes the code shorter and , for those in the know , clearer than the equivalent ' storing the iterator state in variables ' approach .
The next iterator that the input passes through is the tokenizer .
Well , actually , there is another iterator in between that isolates the tokenizer from the fact that the DOM traversal yields a bunch of separate strings , and presents them as a single character stream ( with a convenient peek operation ) , but this is not a very interesting one .
What the tokenizer returns is a stream of token objects , each of which has a value , its textual content , a type , like " variable " , " operator " , or just itself , " { " for example , in the case of significant punctuation or special keywords .
They also have a style , which is used later by the highlighter to give their span elements a class name ( the parser will still adjust this in some cases ) .
At first I assumed the parser would have to talk back to the tokenizer about the current context , in order to be able to distinguish those accursed regular expressions from divisions , but it seems that regular expressions are only allowed if the previous ( non-whitespace , non-comment ) token was either an operator , a keyword like new or throw , or a specific kind of punctuation ( " [ {} ( , ; : " ) that indicates a new expression can be started here .
This made things considerably easier , since the ' regexp or no regexp ' question could stay entirely within the tokenizer .
The next step , then , is the parser .
It does not do a very thorough job because , firstly , it has to be fast , and secondly , it should not go to pieces when fed an incorrect program .
So only superficial constructs are recognized , keywords that resemble each other in syntax , such as while and if , are treated in precisely the same way , as are try and else ― the parser does n't mind if an else appears without an if .
Stuff that binds variables , var , function , and catch to be precise , is treated with more care , because the parser wants to know about local variables .
Inside the parser , three kinds of context are stored .
Firstly , a set of known local variables , which is used to adjust the style of variable tokens .
Every time the parser enters a function , a new set of variables is created .
If there was already such a set ( entering an inner function ) , a pointer to the old one is stored in the new one .
At the end of the function , the current variable set is ' popped ' off and the previous one is restored .
The second kind of context is the lexical context , this keeps track of whether we are inside a statement , block , or list .
Like the variable context , it also forms a stack of contexts , with each one containing a pointer to the previous ones so that they can be popped off again when they are finished .
This information is used for indentation .
Every time the parser encounters a newline token , it attaches the current lexical context and a ' copy ' of itself ( more about that later ) to this token .
The third context is a continuation context .
This parser does not use straight continuation style , instead it uses a stack of actions that have to be performed .
These actions are simple functions , a kind of minilanguage , they act on tokens , and decide what kind of new actions should be pushed onto the stack .
Here are some examples :
function expression ( type ) { if ( type in atomicTypes ) cont ( maybeoperator ) ; else if ( type == " function " ) cont ( functiondef ) ; else if ( type == " ( " ) cont ( pushlex ( " list " ) , expression , expect ( " ) " ) , poplex ) ; else if ( type == " operator " ) cont ( expression ) ; else if ( type == " [ " ) cont ( pushlex ( " list " ) , commasep ( expression ) , expect ( " ] " ) , poplex ) ; else if ( type == " { " ) cont ( pushlex ( " list " ) , commasep ( objprop ) , expect ( " } " ) , poplex ) ; else if ( type == " keyword c " ) cont ( expression ) ; } function block ( type ) { if ( type == " } " ) cont ( ) ; else pass ( statement , block ) ; }
The function cont ( for continue ) , will push the actions it is given onto the stack ( in reverse order , so that the first one will be popped first ) .
Actions such as pushlex and poplex merely adjust the lexical environment , while others , such as expression itself , do actual parsing .
pass , as seen in block , is similar to cont , but it does not ' consume ' the current token , so the next action will again see this same token .
In block , this happens when the function determines that we are not at the end of the block yet , so it pushes the statement function which will interpret the current token as the start of a statement .
These actions are called by a ' driver ' function , which filters out the whitespace and comments , so that the parser actions do not have to think about those , and keeps track of some things like the indentation of the current line and the column at which the current token ends , which are stored in the lexical context and used for indentation .
After calling an action , if the action called cont , this driver function will return the current token , if pass ( or nothing ) was called , it will immediately continue with the next action .
This goes to show that it is viable to write a quite elaborate minilanguage in a macro-less language like JavaScript .
I do n't think it would be possible to do something like this without closures ( or similarly powerful abstraction ) though , I 've certainly never seen anything like it in Java code .
The way a ' copy ' of the parser was produced shows a nice usage of closures .
Like with the DOM transformer shown above , most of the local state of the parser is held in a closure produced by calling parse ( stream ) .
The function copy , which is local to the parser function , produces a new closure , with copies of all the relevant variables :
function copy ( ) { var _context = context , _lexical = lexical , _actions = copyArray ( actions ) ; return function ( _tokens ) { context = _context ; lexical = _lexical ; actions = copyArray ( _actions ) ; tokens = _tokens ; return parser ; } ; }
Where parser is the object that contains the next ( driver ) function , and a reference to this copy function .
When the function that copy produces is called with a token stream as argument , it updates the local variables in the parser closure , and returns the corresponding iterator object .
Moving on , we get to the last stop in this chain of generators , the actual highlighter .
You can view this one as taking two streams as input , on the one hand there is the stream of tokens from the parser , and on the other hand there is the DOM tree as left by the DOM transformer .
If everything went correctly , these two should be synchronized .
The highlighter can look at the current token , see if the span in the DOM tree corresponds to it ( has the same text content , and the correct class ) , and if not it can chop up the DOM nodes to conform to the tokens .
Every time the parser yields a newline token , the highligher encounters a br element in the DOM stream .
It takes the copy of the parser and the lexical context from this token and attaches them to the DOM node .
This way , a new highlighting process can be started from that node by re-starting the copy of the parser with a new token stream , which reads tokens from the DOM nodes starting at that br element , and the indentation code can use the lexical context information to determine the correct indentation at that point .
Selection woes
All the above can be done using the DOM interface that all major browsers have in common , and which is relatively free of weird bugs and abberrations .
However , when the user is typing in new code , this must also be highlighted .
For this to happen , the program must know where the cursor currently is , and because it mucks up the DOM tree , it has to restore this cursor position after doing the highlighting .
Re-highlighting always happens per line , because the copy of the parser is stored only at the end of lines .
Doing this every time the user presses a key is terribly slow and obnoxious , so what I did was keep a list of ' dirty ' nodes , and as soon as the user did n't type anyting for 300 milliseconds the program starts re-highlighting these nodes .
If it finds more than ten lines must be re-parsed , it does only ten and waits another 300 milliseconds before it continues , this way the browser never freezes up entirely .
As mentioned earlier , Internet Explorer 's selection model is not the most practical one .
My attempts to build a wrapper that makes it look like the W3C model all stranded .
In the end I came to the conclusion that I only needed two operations :
Creating a selection ' snapshot ' that can be restored after highlighting , in such a way that it still works if some of the nodes that were selected are replaced by other nodes with the same size but a different structure .
Finding the top - level node around or before the cursor , to mark it dirty or to insert indentation whitespace at the start of that line .
It turns out that the pixel - based selection model that Internet Explorer uses , which always seemed completely ludricrous to me , is perfect for the first case .
Since the DOM transformation ( generally ) does not change the position of things , storing the pixel offsets of the selection makes it possible to restore that same selection , never mind what happened to the underlying DOM structure .
[ Later addition : Note that this , due to the very random design of the TextRange interface , only really works when the whole selection falls within the visible part of the document . ]
Doing the same with the W3C selection model is a lot harder .
What I ended up with was this :
Create an object pointing to the nodes at the start and end of the selection , and the offset within those nodes .
This is basically the information that the Range object gives you .
object gives you .
Make references from these nodes back to that object .
When replacing ( part of ) a node with another one , check for such a reference , and when it is present , check whether this new node will get the selection .
If it does , move the reference from the old to the new node , if it does not , adjust the offset in the selection object to reflect the fact that part of the old node has been replaced .
Now in the second case ( getting the top - level node at the cursor ) the Internet Explorer cheat does not work .
In the W3C model this is rather easy , you have to do some creative parent - and sibling - pointer following to arrive at the correct top - level node , but nothing weird .
In Internet Explorer , all we have to go on is the parentElement method on a TextRange , which gives the first element that completely envelops the selection .
If the cursor is inside a text node , this is good , that text node tells us where we are .
If the cursor is between nodes , for example between two br nodes , you get to top - level node itself back , which is remarkably useless .
In cases like this I stoop to a rather ugly hack ( which fortunately turned out to be acceptably fast ) ―
I create a temporary empty span with an ID inside the selection , get a reference to this span by ID , take its previousSibling , and remove it again .
Unfortunately , Opera 's selection implementation is buggy , and it will give wildly incorrect Range objects when the cursor is between two nodes .
This is a bit of a showstopper , and until I find a workaround for that or it gets fixed , the highlighter does n't work properly in Opera .
Also , when one presses enter in a designMode document in Firefox or Opera , a br tag is inserted .
In Internet Explorer , pressing enter causes some maniacal gnome to come out and start wrapping all the content before and after the cursor in p tags .
I suppose there is something to be said for that , in principle , though if you saw the tag soup of font s and nested paragraphs Internet Explorer generates you would soon enough forget all about principle .
Anyway , getting unwanted p tags slowed the highlighter down terribly ― it had to overhaul the whole DOM tree to remove them again , every time the user pressed enter .
Fortunately I could fix this by capturing the enter presses and manually inserting a br tag at the cursor .
On the subject of Internet Explorer 's tag soup , here is an interesting anecdote :
One time , when testing the effect that modifying the content of a selection had , I inspected the DOM tree and found a " / B " element .
This was not a closing tag , there are no closing tags in the DOM tree , just elements .
The nodeName of this element was actually " / B " .
That was when I gave up any notions of ever understanding the profound mystery that is Internet Explorer .
Closing thoughts
Well , I despaired at times , but I did end up with a working JavaScript editor .
I did not keep track of the amount of time I wasted on this , but I would estimate it to be around fifty hours .
Finding workarounds for browser bugs can be a terribly nonlinear process .
I just spent half a day working on a weird glitch in Firefox that caused the cursor in the editable frame to be displayed 3 / 4 line too high when it was at the very end of the document .
Then I found out that setting the style .
display of the iframe to " block " fixed this ( why not ? ) .
I 'm amazed how often issues that seem hopeless do turn out to be avoidable , even if it takes hours of screwing around and some truly non-obvious ideas .
For a lot of things , JavaScript + DOM elements are a surprisingly powerful platform .
Simple interactive documents and forms can be written in browsers with very little effort , generally less than with most ' traditional ' platforms ( Java , Win32 , things like WxWidgets ) .
Libraries like Dojo ( and a similar monster I once wrote myself ) even make complex , composite widgets workable .
However , when applications go sufficiently beyond the things that browsers were designed for , the available APIs do not give enough control , are nonstandard and buggy , and are often poorly designed .
Because of this , writing such applications , when it is even possible , is painful process .
And who likes pain ?
Sure , when finding that crazy workaround , subdueing the damn browser , and getting everything to work , there is a certain macho thrill .
But one can't help wondering how much easier things like preventing the user from pasting pictures in his source code would be on another platform .
Maybe something like Silverlight or whatever other new browser plugin gizmos people are pushing these days will become the way to solve things like this in the future .
But , personally , I would prefer for those browser companies to put some real effort into things like cleaning up and standardising shady things like designMode , fixing their bugs , and getting serious about ECMAScript 4 .
Which is probably not realistically going to happen anytime soon .

Introduction
Marxists , since Marx and Engels themselves , have always believed that only a socialist revolution could open the way to sexual freedom and equality .
Engels , whatever the limitations of his own nineteenth - century understanding of sexuality , went right to the heart of the matter in The Origins of the Family , Private Property and the State :
What we can conjecture about the way in which sexual relations will be ordered after the impending overthrow of capitalist production is mainly of a negative character , limited for the most part to what will disappear .
But what will there be new ?
That will be answered when a new generation has grown up …
When these people are in the world they will care precious little what anybody today thinks they ought to do ; they will make their own practice and their corresponding public opinion about the sexual practice of each individual – and that will be the end of it .
1
But to argue for the Marxist position we need more than an eloquent and inspiring formula for the future .
In order to show that a free , unalienated future of love and pleasure in personal relations possible , we need to understand the past and present of human sexuality and its relationship to the economic and social foundations of society .
We need to show effectively that all human sexual practice is socially constructed .
Only the human body is a set of given , natural facts ( though even such facts may be altered in quite fundamental ways by human technology such as contraception ) .
Its use and abuse , its feelings and desires , are matters of consciousness .
This is what distinguishes human beings from other species .
As Marx wrote in 1844 :
The animal is immediately one with its vital activity .
It is not distinct from it .
They are identical .
Human beings make their vital activity itself into an object of their will and consciousness …. it is this and this alone that makes humanity a species - being .
2
Nothing shows more than the history of same - sex relations that the most basic human activities , including sexuality , are collectively constructed in human society .
The starting point has to be a recognition that ‘ homosexuality ’ is an idea that did not exist before the late nineteenth century .
The word was first used in 1869 by a Hungarian doctor , Benkert ; its use slowly spread , and it came to be the word most widely used for the ideas also represented from the late 1860s by ‘ contrary sexual feeling ’ , ‘ sexual inversion ’ and ‘ Uranian love ’ .
3
The appearance of not just one but several new words in this period shows that a new attitude was developing towards men and women who were now seen as having a condition , or a certain type of personality .
Previously , there had been words for sexual acts between members of the same sex which were regarded as sinful or criminal , but the idea that these acts are the sign of an underlying condition or type of person emerged clearly only in this period .
We must also recognise that the invention of this concept was a labelling process which imposed a certain role on gay men and women .
People identified by this label are expected to fulfil society ’s definition by acting consistently , dressing in certain ways , frequenting certain places , encountering certain problems all identified with homosexuals .
( The fact that human beings do not fall neatly into the opposing categories of homosexual and heterosexual is then accounted for by new labels such as ‘ pseudohomosexuality ’ and ‘ bisexuality ’ . )
As Mary McIntosh described this process in 1968 :
In the first place , it helps to provide a clear - cut , publicised and recognisable threshold between permissible and impermissible behaviour …
Second , the labelling serves to segregate the deviant from others …
The creation of a specialised , despised and punished role of homosexual keeps the bulk of society pure in rather the same way that the similar treatment of some kinds of criminals helps keep the rest of society law - abiding .
4
Why should such a concept have emerged in the late nineteenth century ?
The causes of the change lie in the new social realities of industrial capitalism , as Jeffrey Weeks has argued :
These developments can only be properly understood as part of the restructuring of the family and sexual relations consequent upon the triumph of urbanisation and industrial capitalism .
The result of these changes was the emergence in a recognisably modern form of concepts and meanings which are now commonplaces of public discussion : for example , the notion of ‘ the housewife ’ , ‘ the prostitute ’ , ‘ the child ’ ; and the concept of ‘ the homosexual ’ …
For it is within the specific context of the capitalist family that modern concepts of homosexuality have developed …
5
But if we recognise that the late nineteenth century was an important moment of transition , that does not mean we can ignore what came before .
On the one hand , some historians have argued that there is plenty of evidence for gay oppression , and even ‘ gay genocide ’ before the late nineteenth century , and that the problem is not related to capitalist society but to a unique western cultural tradition of homophobia , unknown in the rest of the world .
6
This is related to the assertion that there have always been gay people in a constant proportion to the population as a whole , and that there have been – perhaps continuously – gay subcultures hidden from history by the necessity for secrecy .
7
On the other hand , some writers have insisted on a complete break between the recent past and the rest of history , and see no point at all in linking same - sex relations in primitive and non-western societies to the modern question of gay oppression .
They assert that , in effect , homosexuality did not exist until it was invented in the late nineteenth century .
8
This problem cannot be resolved without understanding that the question of same - sex relations has to be seen as linked to the history of the family .
In all class societies , the family has been the principal institution by which sexual conformity has been enforced .
But the form of the family and its relationship to production have changed quite radically from one mode of production to another , and the nineteenth century saw an important transformation in this field .
The coming of industrial capitalist society brought a whole complex of changes – the separation of home from work , the polarisation of gender roles for women and men in these ‘ separate spheres ’ , and a new stress on individuality and personal life – which opened up a new era in attitudes to sexuality .
In order to understand why these changes should include a new definition of same - sex relations , and how this was different from previous attitudes and practices , it is necessary to look at the previous history of sexuality and the family , to combat various myths about the past , and to see how societies construct and reconstruct sexuality according to their material , social and political conditions .
Primitive and non-western societies
It is a central and important fact that same - sex relations have been accepted in most societies other than western , Christian ones .
But it is not enough simply to state and illustrate this fact , since this is often used to argue that western attitudes are uniquely irrational and arbitrary , and must be explained by some peculiar cultural trait having nothing to do with class or capitalism .
It is necessary , therefore , to look briefly at some of these other societies , and especially at ways in which same - sex relations have been fitted in so that they do not threaten established institutions such as the family or the sexual division of labour .
If we think of human societies as lying along a scale , on which same - sex relations are fitted into socially approved roles at one end and cast out or punished at the other , then we can see that western society lies at one end of this scale , but it is not different in nature from the others .
All approved sexual practices tend to maintain the existing society with its specific mode of production and its arrangements for reproduction .
This approach should be more revealing than the usual one , which is to approach other societies with a fixed concept of homosexuality and ask whether ‘ it ’ is tolerated .
The first human societies were gathering and hunting societies , and we can see from a few which have still practised this way of life in modern times that in such societies there are few controls of any kind on sexual activity ( other than incest ) .
But even in these societies , all sexual relations take place within a framework of customs and roles developed in order to secure co-operation and survival .
There is usually some division of labour between women and men , though it is often overlapping and far from rigid.9
We can also see that with the appearance of primitive cultivation and the keeping of flocks and herds , family and kinship institutions became more elaborate and complex .
Warfare developed as communities competed for territory or stock , and gender roles became more distinct .
Such societies were still for a long time egalitarian societies , with no class divisions , very fluid forms of marriage and parenting , and equality between women and men .
In such societies , two main forms of recognised same - sex relations have been found .
The first form is cross - gender transfer , an arrangement found among the native peoples of North America into modern times and known to western anthropologists by the name of berdache .
Among the western tribes , a young man or woman who showed a preference for the tasks or pursuits of the opposite sex could , with the approval of the elders , be initiated into that gender role and become for all social and economic purposes a ‘ woman ’ or a ‘ man ’ according to their acquired gender rather than their biological sex .
They could take a husband or wife in this role , and have sexual relations without social disapproval .
Further east , among the Plains peoples , cross - gender transfer for women disappeared as the trade in buffalo skins transformed these tribes ’ economy , the nature of marriage and the position of women within them , but the male berdache was still known in the nineteenth century .
10
The second form of widely recognised same - sex relations in such societies is sex between men and boys , seen as a stage in the development of a normal male , who will grow up , marry and have children , and take boy lovers in his turn without incurring any social disapproval .
Among the Azande of southern Sudan in recent times , men married ‘ boy wives ’ during their years in the young men ’s military and labour companies , from their late teens to their late twenties , then left to found families of their own .
Men of the Aranda in central Australia who had been initiated as adults but not yet found a permitted woman to marry took ten - to twelve - year - old boy partners .
Among the Siwan of the Libyan desert , sex between men and boys was regarded as normal , but between males of the same age - group it was not .
There are many more examples of this pattern in pre-class societies .
In class societies , with male domination and the family based on private property , the same basic forms of same - sex relations – crossgender role - playing and sex between men and boys – have been very widespread .
But as the status of women has fallen the meaning of such relationships is often quite different in class societies .
The ‘ effeminate ’ man may be held in much lower esteem where the status of women is low , while relations between men and boys are sometimes seen as superior to heterosexual relations for men because they are more ‘ manly ’ .
In Japan , during the feudal period from the fourteenth to the nineteenth centuries , relations between male samurai warriors were part of the chivalric code of bushido .
12
Sexual relations between women have often been socially approved in class societies , so long as they do not interfere with the established institutions of marriage and the family .
This may be particularly true in societies practising polygamy or something similar .
For example , in a seventeenth - century Chinese novel , Love for the Perfumed Companion , a woman is forced to marry but persuades her husband to take her lover as a concubine , and they all live happily ever after .
13
But because literature has in most societies been virtually a male monopoly , it is rare to find first - hand evidence , or indeed any evidence at all , of sexual relations between women .
This means that any history of same - sex relations is bound to appear unbalanced .
The most important point to remember is that the absence of evidence for something is not evidence for the absence of it , and that what is far more significant is the absence of evidence , almost everywhere , for the punishment of such relations .
Not all societies have provided a place for same - sex relations , however .
Male homosexual acts were punished severely in ancient Babylon under the Assyrians , in Persia ( where the Zoroastrian religion was vehemently opposed to such behaviour ) and in Peru under the Aztecs .
14
These widely separated and very different cultures have something in common , which might repay further investigation : in all of them , alien warrior aristocracies ruled over peasant peoples who may have been , at some stage crucial to the formation of attitudes , reluctant to co-operate by reproducing themselves .
Between the fitting in and casting out of same - sex relations , some societies have had a marked double standard , especially as between the ‘ active ’ and ‘ passive ’ roles in anal intercourse between men .
In ancient Egypt , for example , the passive role seems to have been regarded as so degrading that it was something to be inflicted on a defeated enemy .
The point here is that the ancient Egyptians were not prejudiced against ‘ homosexuality ’ , for in their view there was nothing at all abnormal about a man who desired to perform anal ’ penetration with another man ( and as far as heterosexual relations were concerned , the Egyptians had no prejudice against this form of intercourse ) , only about a man who could desire to have it done to him .
15
This brief survey should confirm the fact that there is nothing unusual , abnormal or unnatural in same - sex relations , but it also suggests that there have been many ways of constructing such relations socially and ideologically , just as there have been many different forms of marriage and other sexual relations between men and women .
The conceptual problems arising out of such surveys may be illustrated by the question of bisexuality .
Many present - day gays and lesbians would say that what has been tolerated in so many societies has not been homosexuality but bisexuality .
Fitting in with established institutions has normally meant that few individuals were able to escape the obligations of marriage and family life , however distasteful or uninteresting they may have found the sexual side of these .
Undoubtedly , in the past much heterosexual behaviour was engaged in for social reasons rather than from reasons of what we call desire or affection .
( This was probably true of large numbers of exclusively heterosexual individuals in the past also , however . )
Under such pressures , many people who practised a bisexual lifestyle must have been ‘ really ’ exclusively gay , they may say .
The other side of the coin is that in societies where same - sex relations are regarded as normal and acceptable as part of a bisexual lifestyle or as a stage in the normal life cycle , it becomes impossible , because it is unnecessary , to distinguish the ‘ straight ’ portion of the population .
The only reasonable conclusion that can be drawn from such dilemmas is that self - definition is a component of society and history just as much as technology or art or politics .
The modern concept of homosexuality , which includes the idea of exclusive sexual preference , has to be a point we have in view in this discussion , but it can not be the starting point .
Ancient Greece and Rome
In classical Greece ( c. 500 -300 BC ) , the sexual desire of adult men for boys was considered totally natural and quite compatible with marriage and having children .
Some writers heaped the highest praise on such relationships , claiming that the ‘ heavenly love ’ between members of the male sex was far superior to the ‘ common love ’ between men and women .
All were agreed that no stigma was attached to a grown man who fell in love with , courted and sought the sexual favours of a beautiful boy .
The erotic vase paintings of the sixth and fifth centuries BC depict relations between men and boys in which ‘ every point on a scale of intimacy is fully represented ’ .
Many famous literary and political figures , as well as gods and heroes in mythology , were lovers of boys , and a pair of male lovers were credited with the final overthrow of tyranny in Athens .
In Plato ’s Symposium , a philosophical dialogue in the form of a dinner - party conversation about love , one character explains that
the reason why such love , together with love of intellectual and physical achievement , is condemned by the Persians is to be found in the absolute nature of their empire ; it does not suit the interest of the government that a generous spirit and strong friendships and attachments should spring up among their subjects .
17
Yet the classical Greek attitude , especially at Athens ( the politically and culturally dominant state ) was fundamentally ambiguous and apparently contradictory .
As the same character went on to say , after describing the high esteem in which lovers of boys were held at Athens :
But when we reflect that the boys who inspire this passion are placed by their fathers in the charge of tutors , with the injunction not to allow them to have any communication with their lovers , and that a boy who is involved in such communication is teased by his contemporaries and friends .. . we are led to the opposite conclusion , and infer that such love is reckoned among us to be highly disgraceful .18
Another puzzling piece of evidence is the speech of Aiskhines , a politician who in about 346 BC prosecuted his enemy Timarkhos in an attempt to have him disqualified from citizenship for the affairs he had had with men when he was a boy .
It has been , argued that this shows that the Greeks really disapproved of relations between men and boys , at least outside the intellectually and socially elitist circle of Socrates , Plato and their friends .
19
It seems clear , however , that what the Greeks disapproved of was the alleged willingness of a free - born boy like Timarkhos to submit to a man in return for money or presents .
Willing submission was regarded as dishonourable for a future citizen , and the behaviour of loose ’ boys , who invited lovers by speaking seductively , making eyes and crossing their legs was complained of in comedy .
It is notable in this connection that Timarkhos ’s later promiscuity in sexual relations with women was brought in as evidence of his bad character , whereas nowadays such evidence would be more likely to be taken as proving he was not ‘ homosexual ’.20
A double standard was at work here , in which the active , adult lover was approved , but the position of a boy as sex - object was regarded as at best ambiguous and at worst disgraceful .
Several explanations of this have been offered .
To take these from the sex act outwards , as it were , we can begin with the question of child abuse : was this what the Greeks were really practising ?
Historians are usually vague about this , as the Greeks themselves were seldom explicit about the age at which a boy became a legitimate sex partner for an adult male , though most agreed that the first beard marked the beginning of the end of this phase .
Athens had a law prohibiting men from hanging around the gymnasium where well - off citizen boys had their education , and the speaker in the Symposium already quoted says that men should be prohibited by law from forming connections with young boys , and that honourable lovers ‘ do not fall in love with mere boys , but wait until the age at which they begin to show some intelligence , that is to say , until they are near growing a beard .
’21 There were strict laws against forced sex with boys or women of any age , whether they were slave or free , and against procuring free boys or women for sexual use by men .22
All this would suggest that the Greeks were very anxious to distinguish between permitted relationships and abusive ones , and were not unaware of the dangers .
The whole relationship was a formal game of courtship with its inbuilt considerations of propriety and reputation , involving older teenage boys and adult men .
Both visual art and literature suggest that a ‘ good ’ boy was not sexually aroused by his male lover , but granted his favours out of respect and friendship , while a courteous lover did not press for more than the boy was willing to give .
Kenneth Dover has shown that anal intercourse was probably seen as one of the problems : it is never depicted between men and boys in the vase paintings , and the adult lover ’s desire for it was seen as problematic for the boy .
This was not because of any generalised disgust : women are frequently depicted having anal intercourse with men , and it seems to have been practised as a contraceptive precaution by courtesans and their lovers .
23
An explanation frequently offered for the practice of sexual relations between men and boys is the low position of women , who had no political rights even in the most democratic states and were kept more or less in purdah at Athens .
Sexual submission , in a male , was seen as lowering him to the status of a woman : Aiskhines accused Timarkhos of being unworthy of citizenship because he had ‘ committed a woman ’s transgressions ’ .
24
But this leaves unanswered the question of why women ’s status was so low in the first place .
Some explanations attempt to go further by pointing to ancient Greek militarism as an explanation both for the low position of women and for the practice of sex between men and boys .
War was a constant feature of relations between states , and the development of constitutional states began with the military classification of citizens .
Such explanations also associate these relations especially with the remnants of tribal institutions to be found in Sparta , where the men of fighting age led a largely separate life in their own mess - houses .
In fact , we know very little about Spartan institutions and customs , since most of our information comes from Athens and its allies .
Xenophon , writing in the fourth century BC , said that men courted boys and women also openly courted girls in Sparta , but he insisted that the sexual consummation of relations between men and boys was forbidden .
Five hundred years later , a Roman writer of paradoxes claimed that sexual relations between men and boys had been compulsory at Sparta , and this remains a popular myth though it seems unlikely , on this evidence , to be true .
The legend of the Thebans ’ crack regiment of pairs of male lovers is also hard to confirm , but at least it was widely believed in classical Athens.25
I believe that the explanation of classical Greek sexuality lies elsewhere , in the part that slavery played in production and exploitation in that society .
The crucial attitude to be explained is the dissociation of sexuality from procreation .
In a famous speech distinguishing between the status of a citizen ’s wife and that of other women , the orator Demosthenes said , ‘ We keep mistresses for the sake of pleasure , concubines for the daily care of our persons , but wives to bear us legitimate children and to be faithful guardians of our households .
’26 More remarkably , when Xenophon came to describe the functions of a wife for the instruction of husbands , he dealt in detail with everything from whether a wife should wear makeup , through how to manage slaves and why pots and pans are best arranged in rational order , except childbearing and rearing , which are taken for granted as matters of no interest .
27
The material foundations for this attitude were twofold .
First , by far the greatest part of the exploitable labour force , from which all rich and even moderately prosperous citizens derived their wealth , was not born in Greece but purchased from outside in the form of slaves .
Slave breeding was rare in the classical period , being regarded as a privilege granted by masters to only a few carefully selected couples rather than as part of the cycle of production and reproduction .
28 Secondly , the free , slave - owning family did not aim to produce many children : abortion , infanticide and contraception were all freely discussed and often recommended , perhaps because this was a poor society with a very low technical level and the amount of surplus available to a slave owning household would be very slight if subdivided between too many heirs .
The dissociation of sexuality from reproduction was one feature of Greek society allowing sex between males to be especially approved of .
The low status of women – surely also a result of the low priority placed on childbearing – was a reason for hedging these relations round with qualifications and prohibitions .
It was important that free males , even in their youth , should not overstep the boundaries between such widely separated gender roles and so ‘ lower ’ themselves to the position of women as Timarkhos was alleged to have done .
The political disparity between citizens and non-citizens , maintained by every Greek state in the classical period , opened the way to other , more oppressive versions of the relationship between men and boys , which were present but rarely referred to .
Aiskhines hinted at them when he appealed to the citizen jury in the case of Timarkhos :
Tell those who are hunters of such young men as are easily caught to turn to foreign visitors or resident foreigners , so that they may not be denied the pursuit of their inclinations and you may come to no harm .
30
The choice of boys as sex objects by the adult male ‘ hunters ’ is not condemned , so long as they choose the kind they are looking for from outside the free citizen community .
There may have been male brothels , staffed by slaves , run by the state in Athens ; it was later said that one of Socrates ’ friends , Phaedo , was purchased for him out of such a ‘ public house ’ .31
In Rome , the double standard in male sexual relations was reinforced as conquest increased the number of slaves and the wealth and luxury of the ruling class .
32 The Romans had a very strong bias against a free adult male playing a sexually and socially passive role , but no prejudice against the active role , or against using male slaves as passive sex objects .
Both male and female slaves were completely at their masters ’ disposal , both for their own use and for hiring out to others .
Artemidorus explained that to have sex with a wife , a mistress or a male or female slave was normal , but
to let oneself be buggered by one ’s own slave is not right .
It is an assault on one ’s person and leads to one being despised by one ’s slave ;
while a lawyer of the early imperial period gave the expert opinion that
sexual service is an offence for the freeborn , a necessity for the slave , and a duty for the freedman .
This situation allowed rich Roman men a very wide choice of sex objects , of which they enthusiastically availed themselves .
Sexual preferences were seen as part of the rich variety of life : as a frequently quoted anonymous poet put it : ‘ one person likes one , another likes the other ; I like both . ’
Yet this was a situation of the most gross and callous inequality in sexual relations , a society in which rape of a male or female slave did not count as rape at all because the slave ’s consent was legally irrelevant .
Most of the Roman laws which have been thought at times to have penalised homosexuality were in fact concerned with protecting free persons of both sexes , and drawing the line between slave and free .33
The Romans did have sexual prohibitions in some ways almost as strong as ours .
There was one kind of sex which they thought absolutely revolting and the people who indulged in it quite scandalously decadent .
This was – most surprisingly to modern liberated lovers !
– oral sex , which they seem to have thought of as submissive on the part of both partners .
34
We have no direct evidence for sexual relations between women later than the poems of Sappho , who lived around 600 BC on the island of Lesbos and whose writings survive only in fragments .
Many of these poems were quite clearly addressed to other women in the language of love , such as men would use to boys , and it is clear that love between women was publicly acceptable in her time and on the island of Lesbos where she lived .
But the details of Sappho ’s life and loves – the young women ’s academy and the heterosexual relationships which she is also said to have had – are mostly later fancies invented to fill the gaps .
35
For male Greek writers sex between women seems to have been an unmentionable subject , and after Sappho we know of no Greek women who wrote on the subject .
Roman male writers were less restrained , and there are a few prurient descriptions of aggressively masculine and sexual women , usually prostitutes ; but it would be naïve to take such writings at face value .
It has sometimes been suggested that the prevalence of male homosexual behaviour at Rome was due to the ‘ emancipation ’ of Roman women compared with Greek women .
Not only is this inaccurate as to the facts about Roman women – for they still had no political rights and were far from liberated , though they were not confined to the home like Greek women – it is also inconsistent with explaining the prevalence of such relations in ancient Greece by the extreme subordination of women !
In both Greece and Rome , attitudes to sexuality were shaped by the importance of slavery as the main source of ruling class wealth , and also , especially in Rome , by the availability of slaves as a form of luxury consumption .
It was only when slavery as a mode of production was permanently superseded by serfdom in the late Roman empire that a new outlook on sexuality came to prominence .
The part played by Christianity
The rise of new attitudes to sexuality in late antiquity coincided with the rise of Christianity , which spread slowly at first , was for a long time unpopular and occasionally persecuted , but was patronised by a number of fourth - century emperors and became the official religion of the Roman Empire in 394 AD
It is a common assumption that Christianity caused the changes in sexual attitudes , but it would be more accurate to say that it was changes in circumstances and attitudes in the late Roman Empire that shaped Christianity and enabled it to become dominant .
Before examining the real causes of these changes , we must ask what messages the texts of ancient Judaism and Christianity actually carried on the subject of same - sex relations .
The survival of both religions for so many centuries into modern times has meant that they are believed to be fixed , unchanging systems of thought , and statements from one period of their history are taken to be applicable to the whole .
Christianity especially , since it has been the official religion in Western society for such a long period of time , has adapted its ideas to the needs of the ruling class in each epoch of its history ; if it had been inflexible it would not still be with us today .
Since at least the 1950s , a number of gay Christians and others who have supported law reform or opposed homophobia have tried to defend Christianity against the charge that it has been the chief agency of gay oppression .
‘ Blame society , not religion , ’ has been their theme .
36
In re-examining ancient Judaism and early Christianity , they have shown that some texts have been misread for hundreds of years .
But they have perhaps succeeded in throwing up a protective fog of scholarly discussion around the whole subject , obscuring the very real and effective role that religious ideology has played in sexual repression .
Christianity as a system of ideas and a set of institutions was fully implicated in sexual repression from ancient times onwards .
What we must ask is , what kind of sexual repression and why ?
Even when the distortions introduced by modern translations are discarded from the Old Testament ( a collection of Jewish texts accepted by Christians as the word of god ) , it becomes clear that ancient Judaism did forbid sexual relations between men , at least from the sixth century BC when the book of Leviticus ( c.20 , v.13 ) prescribed the death penalty .
But this ‘ Holiness Code ’ of Leviticus threatened the death penalty for a number of other sexual offences , including adultery , sex with animals , and intercourse between adults who are related by marriage ( e.g. father - in - law and daughter - in - law ) , and no one seems to know how frequently any of these threats were carried out .
The biblical story of Sodom and Gomorrah , around which much later homophobia has centred , does not refer to same - sex relations , and was never interpreted as referring to them until about the beginning of the Christian era .
Several Jewish as well as Christian writers around that time show a special hostility to relations between men and boys .
This may be explained partly by the hostility of Jewish nationalists to Greek imperialist attempts to Hellenise Israel ( which were supported by many of the native aristocracy ) in the two previous centuries .
The attempts of some of the aristocracy to abandon the custom of circumcision in order to participate in Greek - style athletics had incurred the bitter hostility of the fanatical Hasidim , and the Jewish victory in winning independence from the Greeks in 164 BC had reinforced this backlash against the physical and sexual characteristics of Greek culture .
37
The subject of same - sex relations is never mentioned in the Gospels , which purport to be the sayings of Jesus , but the condemnation is clear in the writings of Paul of Tarsus , a leader of the Christians after the death of Jesus who had a fairly negative view of sexual relations of any kind .
Paul condemned both the active and the passive role in male relations , and probably condemned sex between women also ( though theologians have argued about this for at least 1500 years ) .
38 As with Judaism , the prohibition was there from ancient times , but it received no particular stress , and as several commentators have pointed out , many other things were also prohibited , including defrauding the poor of their wages , to which Christians have paid little or no attention in history .
From the third century of the Christian era , however , Christians became more vociferous in their condemnation of other people ’s sexual habits .
Clement of Alexandria , John Chrysostom and Augustine of Hippo all contributed to the pool of virulent abuse from which later Christian homophobes have drawn their raw material .39
But it is important to realise that this was not at all the same thing as modern homophobia .
Specific acts of sinful indulgence were condemned , not a particular type of person , and the target of Christian abuse was much broader , since it consisted of all non-procreative sex , not just same - sex relations .
All the major Christian philosophers of this period argued that ‘ to have sex for any purpose other than to produce children is to violate nature ’ ( Clement of Alexandria ) .
Anal and oral sex between men and women , contraception and abortion were all condemned in this doctrine of ‘ natural ’ sex as an ideal pattern or order decreed by god.40
As an idea , this notion of ‘ natural sex ’ goes back to the ancient Greek philosophers , and it is true that Christianity owes as much to this tradition as to its Jewish origins .
41
But there is a world of difference between the counsels of perfection offered to the Greek ruling elite and the determination of Christians to impose exclusively procreative sex on the whole population of the Roman Empire .
Christian ideas borrowed from previous traditions , but essentially they developed along the lines they did because they appeared to offer an explanation and a solution for the problems of the late Roman Empire – a solution that helped to bring about its transformation rather than its salvation .
In the third century AD the Roman Empire encountered its first wave of disasters .
Military defeat , plague and famine rocked the state , producing political instability and population decline .
In an attempt to remedy this situation , the morality laws of the Emperor Augustus , originally designed to force the old Roman city aristocracy to marry and have legitimate children , were revived and extended to penalise sex between men , which is by definition a relationship outside procreative marriage .
42
The new policies adopted by the Emperor Diocletian ( 284-305 ) included the fixing of peasants , artisans and officials in hereditary posts with the obligation to reproduce themselves ; but because of the heavy taxation and compulsory contributions involved , these laws only led to the flight of more peasants from the land and artisans from the towns .
Slave breeding , which had become increasingly common as the period of conquest came to an end , was incapable of providing the labour force needed to keep the ruling class going because it was too costly in relation to the amount of surplus it could generate at existing levels of technology .
43
By the early fifth century the Empire was approaching collapse , crumbling from within and assailed by barbarians from without ; and it was in these circumstances that Christianity finally triumphed as the official and exclusive religion .
The Roman cities crumbled and their way of life disappeared , as the economic and political focus shifted to the great rural estates and the men who owned them , and the barbarian invasions set the seal on these changes .
But this was not a collapse of ‘ civilisation ’ in the broader sense : it was not a regression to a more primitive state of society .
It was absolutely necessary for further material progress that the countryside should be relieved of the crushing burden of supporting cities in the ancient style on the basis of a very poor technology and extremely heavy taxation .
In the countryside of the later Roman Empire a new mode of production had been in the process of formation .
This was based on serfdom , a set of social and economic relations whose basic principle was that the agricultural producers were bound to the soil of the landlords and obliged to reproduce themselves .
In return for significantly reduced economic burdens ( compared with the former free peasantry crushed by taxation ) and the right to marry and have children ( compared with slaves in the early period of the Empire ) , the cultivators became serfs , and landlord - serf relations became the basis of the successor states which followed the collapse of the western Roman empire in the late fifth century , and of the feudal regimes which followed in the middle ages .44
Christianity did not , of course , offer itself as a programme of economic and social reform .
It appeared as a spiritual , theological and magical explanation in which the Roman gods had failed to save the state but the Christian god would save the individual who supported the Christian clergy , took regular part in their rituals , and observed the rules of Christian sexual morality .
The masses as well as the rulers turned to it as the ‘ heart in a heartless world ’ , and a way of making sense of the world they lived in .
Many historians have described Christianity as having a totally negative attitude to sex and even to procreation .
The fathers of the church regarded celibacy as a state superior to marriage , as Paul of Tarsus had done .
Some , like Augustine , thought that the time was approaching when Heaven would be full up with the souls of the dead and there was not much need for further human procreation .
But for the mass of the people , as opposed to the clerical elite , the Christian message clearly stressed the importance of marriage and the duty of husband and wife to fulfil their sexual obligations and produce children .
Compared with other sects around at the time , such as the Manicheans who were against procreative sex more than any other kind ( because it trapped the pure good of spirit in the pure evil of flesh ) , Christianity developed an ideology of sexuality which fitted the rise of serfdom and the landlord class .
45
No other society seems to have gone through such a dramatic transition from a system that relied so crucially on non-native labour to one that needed to restore the native population so much .
Thus Christian attitudes to non-procreative sex are not an irrational factor , no wild card in the historical pack , but the product of specific material conditions in the epoch that brought it to power .
These attitudes were not homophobic in the modern sense , and those who have looked for condemnations of same - sex relations in the civil and ecclesiastical legislation of the late Roman Empire and early middle ages have often assumed that such vague phrases as ‘ those who copulate against reason ’ in the Canon of Ancyra ( 314 ) are evasive terms for homosexuality .
46
In reality , the blanket condemnation of all non-procreative sex was serious and deliberate , and it was not until modern times that any western Christian society had laws distinguishing same - sex relations from other transgressions under this heading .
Medieval relaxation and backlash
The Germanic and other invasions which brought down the Roman Empire in the fifth century AD threw Europe into social and political turmoil , and at the same time reinforced the advance towards a feudal society .
The Catholic Church continued to wield great political and economic power , providing an international organisation and a common culture in a Europe now split into a number of kingdoms and principalities .
With the exception of the Visigoths in Spain , the new ‘ barbarian ’ rulers were not hostile to same - sex relations .
In some of their warrior cultures relations between boys and men had been approved of , though there is also some evidence that the accusation of sexual passivity was considered highly insulting to a man .
When they adopted Christianity , these peoples formally accepted the Christian prohibition of same - sex relations along with other kinds of ‘ unnatural ’ sex , but they do not seem to have taken it too seriously in practice .
47 During the period known to history as the ‘ dark ages ’ in western Europe ( c. 500 - 800 AD ) , there was violence and cruelty in plenty , but no persecution of same - sex relations that we know of , and this relaxation lasted for several centuries more .
From about the eighth century to the twelfth in western Europe , there was no particular hostility to same - sex relations .
The word ‘ sodomy ’ was used to describe a variety of sexual sins : the ninth - century missionary Boniface defined ‘ sodomitical lust ’ as including incest , promiscuity , adultery , and sex with nuns because these were all examples of inappropriate vessels for the deposit of semen .
Sex between men , and often between women , was mentioned in most of the penitentials which prescribed penances to be imposed on the contrite sinner in confession , but these penances were not heavy compared with those for other sins .
The penitentials dealt with hundreds of detailed sins , giving sliding scales of penance according to seriousness and frequency , and John Boswell points to some in which anal intercourse was penalised less heavily than heterosexual adultery .
In one penitential , sex acts other than anal intercourse between men seem to be ‘ about as serious as challenging a friend to a drinking bout or having intercourse with one ’s own spouse within two weeks of receiving communion . ’48
Throughout these centuries , warm and even passionate relations between persons of the same sex flourished in monasteries and nunneries , where a small educated elite familiar with ancient literature took up and imitated its homoerotic forms in letters and poems addressed to one another .
Modern Catholic historians have argued that such expressions of passion were purely spiritual .
49
The point here is not just that much of the literature is too explicitly physical for this to be credible , but that no society which had a clear idea and a horror of homosexuality , as these have developed in modern society , would have tolerated such goings - on .
For example , Abbot Ailred of Rievaulx ’s love for his monks , especially the young and beautiful ones , was famous in his own time , the twelfth century .
Unlike many other abbots , Ailred allowed and encouraged his monks to hold hands , since he believed that earthly love was a step on the road to love of god .
He admitted that in his youth he had sometimes failed to distinguish between ‘ the sweetness of love and the impurity of lust ’ , and when his favourite monk died he wrote , ‘ Some may judge by my tears that my love was too carnal .
Let them think what they wish … ’
When old and dying , he had a special large bed constructed so that all his favourites could lie down with him together .
A modern psychologist would undoubtedly warn young monks to steer well clear of such a dangerous , dirty old man !
Yet Ailred , far from being condemned , was admired and praised by the most austere of twelfth - century saints , Bernard of Clairvaux , to whom he dedicated his writings on love .50
Although the twelfth century also saw Peter Damian and others beginning to write furious diatribes against sexual relations between men ( and it should be noted that Damian was as vehemently against the use of reason by Christians as he was against sodomy ) , they were ignored or played down by the Church authorities , who were preoccupied at the time with their campaign against the marriage of priests rather than the homoerotic relationships of monks and nuns .51
John Boswell has argued that by the twelfth century sex between men and boys was common and a ‘ gay subculture ’ had emerged in many European cities .
He points to homoerotic literature , to references to male prostitution , and to the use of certain words as a kind of code : ‘ Ganymede ’ for a youth , ludus ( the game ) for the pursuit of boys .
52
He has found new versions of the classical literary form in which the merits of loving boys and of loving women are debated .
At least one of these , The Contest of Ganymede and Helen , which is a twelfth - century poem found in many copies all over western Europe , is not a copy of classical models , because in ancient times the characters in such pieces were always two male lovers , rather than a boy and a woman .
53
By this time the Church ’s control over sexual behaviour had become quite weak in practice , and its formal prohibitions were widely ignored .
Before the late eleventh century , the papacy was incapable of enforcing monogamy on the Christian nobility , celibacy on its own priesthood , or ( until much later ) pre-marital chastity in peasant society .
By 1200 , economic expansion and social change had broken down many of the material restrictions of early medieval society .
The growth of population , the expansion of cultivation , the colonisation of new lands in eastern Europe , and the growth of towns and trade had broken the bonds of control by the lord of the manor and bishop of the town .
The expansion of informal education within the Church threw up a layer of intellectuals who openly debated such questions as the relationship between faith and reason and whether the existence of god could be proved .
54 Though capitalism had only appeared in its earliest and most basic form , the merchant capitalism common to all feudal societies , increased commodity production by peasants and artisans was already creating pressures for individual freedom and threatening to break down the feudal structures of social control .55
In the thirteenth century , the Church and the new monarchical states launched a massive backlash to keep the new developments in society under control .
As the Crusades in the Middle East drew to an unsuccessful close , violence was turned inwards in western Europe – against Jews and heretics at first , but culminating in the witch hunts of the fifteenth to seventeenth centuries .
All these can be seen as part of one long repressive reaction by the feudal ruling class and its priestly servants against the threat of social and intellectual change .
The reaction was not precipitated by economic crisis ; it began in the full flush of medieval expansion .
But the economic crises and plagues of the fourteenth century intensified it and gave its sexual aspects additional implications .
Procreative sex was once again in the forefront of the programme for social control , and the family quite central to the enforcement of the traditional order .
Although as an instrument of political and ideological control the family in feudal society was subordinate to other institutions such as the manor , the Church and the guild , it was to become increasingly important as these other institutions weakened in the late middle ages .
But the major importance of the family from the decline of ancient slave society until the industrial revolution was as the basic unit of production and property ownership .
Peasant and artisan households were still the basic economic units of society , while the property - owning family was central to both the feudal nobility and the rising bourgeoisie .
The late medieval backlash shows a determination to keep the laity firmly within this framework , while subjecting the clergy to much stricter control by the Church itself .
Intellectually , a new synthesis of ancient philosophy and Christian doctrine was produced in the universities set up under Church and state control in the thirteenth century .
This re-established the importance of nature as an ideal pattern and the idea of the ‘ unnatural ’ offence as central to Christian views of sexuality , and defined these matters as orthodox religious doctrine .
Unnatural sex now fell under the suspicion of heresy , and from this time onwards the word ‘ bugger ’ ( a term of abuse originally applied to Manichaean heretics whose views were supposed to have come from somewhere as outlandish as Bulgaria ) was applied to all anal intercourse .
Church councils tightened up the penalties for ‘ unnatural ’ sex , and the new secular states co-operated .
The death penalty for sodomy or buggery was mentioned in all the major law codes of thirteenth century Europe .
In England , a standard common - law text of the late thirteenth century mentions the death penalty for sex with Jews , animals or one ’s own gender – along with arson , sorcery , apostasy and adultery with one ’s lord ’s wife .
56
In the Italian city - states the new orders of friars , whose mission was to preach repentance in the towns , clamoured for laws against heretics , Jews and sexual offenders from the time of their ‘ Great Alleluia ’ revival campaign in the 1220s .
When these fell into disuse or were repealed they clamoured for more .
There was a new surge of legislation against sexual offences in the sixteenth century when conflicts between Church and state , or between central and local authorities , led to the assertion of state control , for example in the 1533 buggery statute in England and the constitutions of the Emperor Charles V for Germany in 1532 .
In the late medieval and early modern periods , legislation against ‘ sodomy ’ always implicitly , and sometimes explicitly , included a variety of sexual transgressions , such as bestiality and heterosexual anal intercourse , along with homosexual acts between men and between women .
In Florence , for example , women and under -age boys submitting to anal intercourse were subject to the same penalty ( whipping naked through the streets ) , and scales of penalties were provided for a variety of offences , according to frequency of transgression , and whether one partner was married .
Most historians have questioned whether these laws were ever regularly implemented : there seems to be little doubt , for example , that the common law death penalty for sodomy in England was completely inoperative , and even under the 1533 statute cases were very rare until the late seventeenth century .
Others have laboriously mined the voluminous judicial records of medieval and early modern Europe and found that at certain times and places there were regular executions .
Louis Crompton has come up with a figure of 400 executions in eight countries over five centuries – far from the ‘ gay genocide ’ he has claimed , but not by any means a negligible figure .
It is no myth that men ( and occasionally women ) were burned to death for same - sex relations in the middle ages and early modern times , though the outbreaks of persecution were very irregular , and often seem to have happened because of religious or political tensions which were the occasion for attacks on sexual practices normally ignored .
57
Other myths have arisen around the great witch hunt which swept western Europe from the fifteenth century to the seventeenth , and in which about 100,000 people , 80 percent of them women , were put to death .
One of the most vicious pieces of witch - hunting propaganda , the Malleus Maleficarum ( Hammer of Witches ) by the German Dominicans Kramer and Sprenger ( 1484 ) , showed a distrust and fear of female sexuality which became central to witch - hunting .
They gave several reasons why more witches should be women than men : women ’s feebler intellect and will - power , their proneness to jealousy and vengeance ; but also because a woman ‘ is more carnal than a man …
All witchcraft comes from carnal lust , which is in women insatiable .
’58
Witch hunters were obsessed with sexual perversion , especially on the Continent , where torture was regularly used , obtaining , for example , confessions from very old women that they had kissed the devil ’s arse or been buggered by him .
But the focus of the obsession was not relations between women or between men : the persistent fantasy was that women ’s sexuality betrayed the human race by intercourse with devils , not with one another .
There may have been sexual overtones in the accusation that older witches procured younger ones for the devil , as there were in attitudes to procuresses in general .
But historians who contrive to suggest that homosexuality was an issue in the witch hunt are stretching the evidence unbelievably far .
59
The late medieval drive for social control by the church and state had many faces , and those who see it as principally an exercise in homophobia are in a way underestimating it .
A very wide range of sexual fears and anxieties were brought into play , together with a view of the natural world as violent and dangerous , constantly threatening to drag humanity under – very different from what some modern people think being ‘ close to nature ’ meant in the middle ages .
Unnatural acts , satanic and sexual , were seen as inviting nature to respond with disasters such as plagues , storms and famines , as well as incurring individual punishment from god.60
The issue was still non-procreative sex in general rather than homosexual acts in particular : prosecutions for bestiality were common at some times in rural areas , and the animals involved were tried and almost always executed along with their human partners .
61
In urban areas , however , there is no doubt that when they were implemented , men who had sex with one another bore the brunt of the sodomy laws by early modern times .
62
From the Renaissance to the Industrial Revolution
There is more controversy about homosexuality in the Renaissance period than about almost any other part of this subject .
According to some historians , sex between men was regarded with the utmost horror and western European society showed ‘ a very strong fear or aversion to “ abnormal ” sexuality ’ .
According to others , it was widely tolerated and made a major contribution to the artistic and literary achievements of the age .
There is no doubt nowadays that some major figures such as Michelangelo and Leonardo da Vinci had a distinct preference for their own sex and the former was probably exclusively homosexual ; yet a glance at any of the major Italian cities will show that there were heavy penalties for sodomy and that these were frequently imposed .
King James
I of England could both condemn sodomy as a crime no king should ever pardon , and openly flaunt his own love affairs with male courtiers .
63
Alan Bray has suggested that these contradictions can be explained by the quite different place that male homosexual behaviour had in the ideology and in the social structure of Renaissance England compared with our own times .
On the one hand , ‘ sodomy ’ was broadly defined , to include bestiality and heterosexual intercourse , and it was regarded as a sin of excess and disorder , a sign of wickedness in general rather than the sexual preference of some individuals .
The same man could be accused of sodomy , incest and adultery ; and the young rake with his mistress on one arm and his boy catamite ’ on the other was a recurring image of general debauchery .
As a symbol of evil , sodomy , like heresy and witchcraft , was denounced as an insult to god and nature , inviting terrible retribution on the whole society in which it took place .
On the other hand , when sex between men did take place it was integrated into the existing structure of sexual behaviour .
This was based on the family household of master , mistress , children and servants , and the double standard as between men and women .
Relations between gentlemen and their boy pages or kept favourites , between masters and servants , older and younger servants , or men- about - town and boy prostitutes , all had their parallels in relations between men and women .
The prevalence of late marriage among the lower classes and arranged marriages among the aristocracy meant that homosexual relations were rarely exclusive ; they were something to be practised before marriage or on the side , like extra-marital relations with women .
Relationships which fitted this pattern were hardly ever prosecuted , unless attention was drawn to them by features such as a parental complaint , individual malice or a breach of the peace .
By the end of the seventeenth century in England , Bray argues , the social context had changed .
In the ‘ molly houses ’ of late seventeenth and early eighteenth - century London , a gay male subculture was being created , with regular meeting places , pubs and back - room clubs in which men drank and danced together , flirted with one another , held drag balls and imitated feminine mannerisms , and indulged in ‘ hugging , kissing and tickling each other as if they were a mixture of wanton males and females , ’ as a contemporary put it .65 > From the 1690s on there were periodic attacks on the molly houses , organised by societies for the ‘ reform of manners ’ , whipped up by newspapers and pamphlets and resulting in raids , trials and executions .
The evidence shows that the men involved were members of the working population of London : masters , journeymen and apprentices representing most of the city ’s manufacturing and service trades .
From one trial , we have perhaps the first voice raised in defence of sexual freedom in English history : ‘ I think there is no crime in making what use I please of my own body , ’ were the words of William Brown , a young labourer trapped into arrest by a man he thought he knew .66
Clearly , as Bray argues , something had changed .
But while he sees the answer in a ‘ revolution in mentalities ’ taking place in the late seventeenth century along with the revolution in science , and Randolph Trumbach explains it by ‘ the reorganisation of gender identity that was occurring as part of the emergence of a modern western culture ’ , both evade the question of political and social revolution in seventeenth - century England .
67
The bourgeois revolutions of 1649 and 1688 had raised the question of individual liberty , especially in religious and economic matters , and had brought about a marked reduction of state interference in these areas of life .
Some of the radicals in the 1640s had also laid much wider claims to personal and sexual freedom .
‘ Everyone as he is himselfe , so he hath a self - propriety , else could he not be himselfe , ’ Richard Overton the Leveller had written , claiming the right of property in one ’s own person .
‘ What act soever is done by thee in light and love , is light and lovely …
No matter what Scripture , saints and churches say , if that within thee do not condemn thee , thou shalt not be condemned , ’ said Lawrence Clarkson the Ranter .
Such views were even more widely condemned from pulpits than spread by radical pamphlets and word of mouth .
However narrow and male - oriented the Levellers ’ conception of self - property turned out to be , and however exclusively heterosexual the Ranters ’ claim to sexual freedom , we are surely hearing their echo in the words of William Brown .68
Equally relevant is the growth , in parts of late seventeenth - century England including London , of pockets of workshop manufacture in which production was no longer organised on a household basis and journeymen began to form their own organisations and even to take strike action .
For an increasing number of workers there was a separation of work from home before the industrial revolution ; yet the household economy still remained overwhelmingly important in agriculture and in those manufactures organised on the domestic rather than the workshop system .
In this period , personal life outside of working hours was beginning to break loose from the old patriarchal household , and a man like William Brown could think that what he did outside of his workplace was his own affair .
At the same time , the authorities clearly did not think so , and the state was stepping in to regulate what had previously been the domain of fathers and masters .
69
The molly houses and their enemies gave a focus to discussions of male homosexual behaviour in eighteenth - century England , and certain new themes begin to appear .
One is the effeminacy of the mollies , which comes to be regularly associated with their sexual practices .
This may seem to foreshadow later ideas of sexual inversion , but it is still invariably depicted as an artificial and not an innate characteristic .
In 1709 , one pamphleteer argued that these men imitated feminine mannerisms ‘ in order to disguise their natural feelings ( as men ) towards the fair sex , and to encourage unnatural lusts . ’
In 1736 a legal writer claimed that ‘ it is seldom known that a person who has been guilty of abusing his generative faculty so unnaturally has afterwards a proper regard for women . ’
Neither of these expresses a modern concept of homosexuality , and the second actually claims that the lack of interest in women is the result , and not the cause , of unnatural behaviour .70
In 1813 , a pamphlet on the Vere Street affair ( a raid on a London pub which was followed by several executions ) argued that although ‘ it is very widely and naturally supposed that those possessed by such passions were usually very effeminate persons , ’ the fact that a six - foot grenadier could be the ‘ bride ’ of a man half his size , and that ‘ athletic sailor , a herculean porter and a deaf smith ’ had taken the names of famous whores , showed that such assumptions were false .
He added a story that the men in the Vere Street club had taken pleasure in ritually mocking their absent wives .
71
These are not modern concepts of homosexuality – though there is a suggestion in the last that popular ideas were closer to the modern ones than intellectual theories .
But there is at least one eighteenth - century example of something very close to homophobia in its most literal sense : horror of same - gender contact .
The author of a 1749 pamphlet admits that
I feel revolted and scandalised when I see two ladies falling in each other ’s arms and kissing each other in a lascivious manner .
Still , the sight of two repulsive lads , holding and caressing each other ’s hands and exchanging tender kisses , is even more disgusting .
It was probably some time before respectable Englishmen stopped greeting one another with hugs and kisses ( and very much longer before women did ) , but several German writers recorded a marked difference between English and Continental customs in this respect by the late eighteenth or early nineteenth century .
72
Although capital punishment for sodomy had been rare in the seventeenth century , its incidence increased in late eighteenth century England .
Executions reached their peak in the years 1806 - 1836 , when there were two a year on average ; and this was a time when capital punishment for other offences was becoming less frequent .
There was also an increase in charges of attempted sodomy , for which proof of intercourse was unnecessary : frequenting a certain place , or responding to a decoy from a reform society was enough .
Meeting ‘ for the purpose of inciting each other to commit a detestable offence ’ , and ‘ unlawfully laying their hands on each other with intent to commit the crime of buggery ’ are charges found in this period .
The punishment for this offence was the pillory , and public hostility was so great that many men feared it more than the prison sentences and fines which were also imposed .
In 1780 a plasterer pilloried in London with his coachman partner died during the onslaught of the crowd , and Edmund Burke was moved to protest in Parliament .73
In western Europe as a whole , the eighteenth century was a time of conflicting currents of thought about sodomy .
In the Dutch Republic , a particularly vicious persecution took place in 1730 and 1731 , when at least fifty - nine men were executed , twenty - one of them in one small village .
Two men were burned to death for sodomy in Paris as late as 1750 .
In Pennsylvania , where the death penalty for this offence had been abolished in a flash of Quaker enlightenment in 1682 , it was reimposed ( for blacks in 1700 , for all men in 1718 ) under English pressure .
74
But in reaction to these barbarities there was now widespread criticism .
The philosophers of the French Enlightenment considered the punishment of consenting adults to be a superstitious survival on a par with heresy and witchcraft trials .
These included Voltaire , although he thought same - sex relations an outrage against nature , and Diderot , who was much more sympathetic to the bisexual aestheticism of ‘ Socratic love ’ .
Beccaria and Bentham both argued that sodomy was a crime without victims ; in private , Bentham wrote several essays on the subject between 1774 and 1824 , arguing for decriminalisation and commenting on the irrational nature of homophobia .75
The death penalty for sodomy was abolished as part of the programme of enlightened despotism in Russia , Austria , Prussia and Tuscany , and in the aftermath of the American Revolution in most of the then existing United States .
In France , all penalties for consenting adults were abolished as part of the reform of the criminal law by the Constituent Assembly in 1791 , at the height of the constitutional phase of the French Revolution .
This was a period of revolutionary optimism among the bourgeoisie , in which Liberty was their watchword , and the revolution became for a time a ‘ festival of the oppressed ’ as outdated laws and practices were swept away .
‘ Frenchmen ! ’ proclaimed the Marquis de Sade , ‘ You are too enlightened not to know that a new government will necessitate a new way of living . ’
There were contradictions in the bourgeois liberalism of this revolutionary epoch , for the family remained extremely important to the bourgeoisie , but the decriminalisation of same - sex relations was retained in the Napoleonic Code after the revolution was over , and was imitated in several European countries influenced by the French Revolution and the Napoleonic conquests .
76
Why then was punishment for sodomy stepped up in England when other countries were relaxing it ’?
Arthur Gilbert has shown how the peak of prosecutions and public hostility was reached during the Napoleonic Wars , when Britain was isolated and threatened with military defeat .
He argues that sodomites were singled out as a traditional target for fears of disaster , and because in the western Christian tradition the anus was a symbol of evil .
The threat of defeat by the French was seen as a threat of ‘ a revolution in the ethical , moral and religious spheres ’ .
He also points out the high level of executions for sodomy in the navy during the war , suggesting that the sodomite was singled out as ‘ a kind of moral mutineer ’ .
It was no accident that these naval executions began in 1797 , the year of the great mutinies , rather than in 1793 when the war began.77
It is true that old fears were still alive in the eighteenth century .
Sexual intercourse with animals was still regarded with horror , and natural disasters such as the Lisbon earthquake and the lesser London tremors of 1750 were attributed to the prevalence of ‘ unnatural vice ’ .
Sodomy was no more clearly defined than before : there were long legal wrangles over whether proof of penetration or emission or both were required , over whether a man who buggered a twelve - year - old girl could be hanged for it ( he was hanged ) , and over another who had forced a boy to have oral sex ( he was pardoned ) .
78
But something more was involved at the end of the eighteenth century and beginning of the nineteenth than a traditional fear that rose and fell with the general level of threats to national security .
The point is that the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars , during which prosecutions and executions for sodomy were stepped up , coincided with a crucial phase in the development of the industrial revolution in Britain .
The wars accelerated developments in the textile , mining and metal industries which produced concentrations of industrial capital and a proletarian labour force working long hours , many of them crammed into overcrowded slums , deprived of the most basic facilities for privacy and decency .
It is no accident that the years of frequent executions for sodomy , 1792 - 1836 , coincide almost exactly with the period described by E.P. Thompson as The Making of the English Working Class .
The disorder and revolution that were feared came from inside English society as much as from the ‘ atheistical French ’ .
Catherine Hall has stated that as far as the Evangelical ‘ Clapham Sect ’ were concerned , ‘ the debate on women , the family and the sexual division of labour was an integral part of the 1790s discussion about the organisation of society .
’79
No other ruling class in Europe was so ready to listen to sermons on the dangers of sexual anarchy as the British because no other had such good reason to fear social breakdown and revolution .
Whipping up popular hostility to sodomites was also a diversion for the masses : better they should mob sodomites than riot for reforms or against corrupt government .
The men who went to the gallows and the pillory were indeed a symbolic sacrifice , but the dangers they symbolised were new ones .
The old triad of heresy , witchcraft and sodomy had been replaced by the new one of sodomy , mutiny and anarchy .
Sexuality and industrialisation
From the 1790s to the 1840s , people of all classes in England were conscious of the disruption of working - class family life brought by the spread of factories and other large enterprises , the technical innovations which repeatedly transformed the age and sex structure of the workforce in particular industries , and the cycle of boom and slump which periodically threw large numbers into destitution .
80
Some feared that the workforce might fail to reproduce itself in the areas where women worked in the factories and mines .
Many more feared the disorder , the ungovernability of a working class no longer controlled by parental power or tied by family responsibilities , unconfined by traditional age and gender roles .
Unlike the old productive family households of the peasants , artisans and cottage workers , the specifically capitalist form of family is based on the separation of work from home : commodities are produced and wages earned in a workplace belonging to the capitalist , and ‘ home life ’ becomes a separate sphere .
This change had been foreshadowed by the growth of large workshops and the increasing numbers of journeymen since the late seventeenth century , as mentioned above .
But industrialisation in the early nineteenth century raised a trend to the level of a revolution , central and public enough to be seen and discussed .
Industrial capitalism does not require the family household as the place of production , and it would appear at first sight that it requires workers simply as individual labour units without sex , age or personality .
This is how it seemed to many observers in the early nineteenth century ( not just Marx and Engels ) , because capitalism by its nature ( especially when contrasted with domestic industry ) invites such an analysis .
It became evident quite early on in the industrial revolution , however , that there are many reasons why capitalism does require the labour force to be men , women and children organised in family units .
These range from the reproduction of the labour force itself to discipline and hierarchy within the factory , and from the taming of rebellious workers through ‘ family responsibilities ’ to the perpetuation of capitalist ideas of self - sufficiency and individualism .
The new industrial employers also benefited from the fact that women ’s and children ’s wages were lower than men’s .
Industrial capitalism needs the family , but it is a form of family detached from the productive roots that had defined it since the age of serfdom in western Europe .
In the mid-nineteenth century , sexuality was intimately linked to ruling and middle - class fears of social anarchy and revolution .
There was a pronounced sexual emphasis in many of the sensational stories of the appalling conditions in factories , mines and slums , the speeches and pamphlets that demanded reform , and the illustrations and fictional representations that reinforced them .
This was not , as is often suggested , a ‘ displaced ’ anxiety ; it was a response to real changes in the world of early industrial society .
Factory Commissioners regularly asked questions about the ‘ unchastity ’ of factory girls .
Descriptions of slum conditions never failed to mention the overcrowded lodging houses where men and women shared rooms , and the ‘ known prostitutes ’ lurking on every corner .
The idea of sex in the deep , dark mine in the areas where women worked underground before 1842 continued to fascinate liberal historians into the twentieth century , when Halevy could refer without apology to the ‘ bestial and filthy desires ’ of male for female miners .
Teenage sexuality outraged reformers such as Shaftesbury , who revealed to Parliament that in Birmingham ‘ sexual connection ’ began at fourteen or fifteen .
81
How did all this lead to the development of a new concept of homosexuality ?
I shall try to show how three related reactions to the changes in the family brought by industrialisation led in this direction .
These were the association of male and female gender roles with the ‘ separate spheres ’ of work and home , the emergence of a new concept of ‘ personal life ’ and a science of sexuality , and ( last but not least ) repressive measures of control .
The idea that work was an ‘ outside world ’ to which men were particularly suited , while the home was a haven for women and children , had developed first among the bourgeoisie and professional classes of the eighteenth century .
The wealth of these classes was no longer created in their own family households , and they had the resources to create a private world of domestic comfort where work was done by servants and the consumption of stylish luxuries became a way of life .
Many of the ideas about gender later deployed in industrialisation , such as the notion that a woman is more ‘ natural ’ and a man more ‘ civilised ’ , were already familiar among the philosophers of eighteenth - century France .
82
Once again , this was a trend that became a general transformation only when industrialisation brought the separation of work from home to the masses as well as the elite .
From the late eighteenth century in England , the bourgeois ideology of the family was concerned with much wider issues .
The Evangelicals consciously saw their campaign for the reform of family life as a bulwark against Jacobinism and social revolt .
Their efforts were not confined to preaching to the aristocracy and the bourgeoisie : through cheap tracts , charity visiting and their own role as employers of servants , they sought to influence the family lives of the working class .
83
In France , the biggest capitalist firms were making direct efforts to promote family life , orthodox sexuality and correct gender roles by the 1840s :
Paternalism involved extensive efforts to moralise the company ’s labour force .
Many firms published and distributed pamphlets that explained for workers the benefits of cleanliness , sobriety and family life .
Many extended shop rules to prohibit indecent dress and habits , dirty talk , and dirty hooks .
Some fired workers who married too early or had illegitimate children …
Sedan employers sent women home before men to discourage dalliance and give wives more chance to care for their families .
84
The new pattern of working - class family life was not imposed without opposition .
The Utopian Socialists presented a challenge to the family as an institution , from Saint - Simonian ‘ free love ’ to Fourier ’s vision of large , communal phalansteries replacing family life .
With the Communist Manifesto and the revolutions of 1848 , the challenge was directly political , as Marx and Engels proclaimed their belief in the abolition of the family as part of a socialist revolution , women played a notable part in the two revolutions in Paris , and a notoriously transvestite woman novelist held a post in the new French government .
85
In Britain , the Owenites gained a significant following in the 1830s and 1840s .
Debates on the abolition of marriage and illegitimacy , proposals for the replacement of family life by collective housekeeping , and arguments about women ’s right to work and to be trade union members all flourished among Owenite workers .
The Owenite style of meetings and social events set out deliberately to break down the barriers between women and men , and the movement produced a number of able women speakers and organisers .
86
But alongside these beginnings of a socialist alternative , there was another response among the working class , which is very visible especially in the Chartist movement ( of which many Owenites became part , but they were only a part ) : the defence of the working class family explicitly in terms of the gender roles of the man as breadwinner and the woman as housekeeper .
Unlike the Owenites , the Chartists had separate organisations for women , and most of these Female Charter Associations spoke in the name of ‘ wives , daughters , mothers and lovers ’ and stressed women ’s domestic role .
They protested that the ‘ order of nature ’ was upset by the employment of women in factories and the unemployment among male handloom weavers in Lancashire , or threatened by the break - up of destitute families under the New Poor Law .
Within the Chartist movement these ideas competed with the older view of working - class women as active economic partners and members of the labouring community as well as with Owenite ideas .
87
With the decline of Owenism in the trade unions and the defeat of Chartism in the 1850s , the new pattern of family life and gender roles became firmly established among the ‘ respectable ’ working class .
For the majority in modern industrial society the family is a necessity in the absence of a full - scale socialist transformation .
The nineteenth century capitalist state provided no alternative for the working class , other than the hated ‘ Poor Law Bastilles ’ , as the workhouses were called .
Yet the idea of the male breadwinner and the dependent housewife often went against the facts of working - class life , for the number of women in paid work went on increasing throughout the nineteenth century and only a minority of working - class men ever earned enough to keep a family above subsistence level .
But until the coming of the modern welfare state , the family was the only way in which working - class people who could not work – the old , the sick , the very young and the unemployed – could be supported by those who were earning .
88
The very real material importance of the family in nineteenth - century capitalist society helped to marginalise and make things more difficult for those individuals who did not fit into the model roles required .
The ideology of that society reinforced this by fixing the idea that the family was also the best way of satisfying the needs of ‘ personal life ’ , in which sexuality came to feature more and more prominently .
The idea of personal life as an important part of an individual ’s existence , separated from working life and public life , spread from the domestic ideology of the eighteenth - century bourgeoisie to society as a whole in the nineteenth century for the reasons already outlined .
As Eli Zaretsky has put it :
So long as the family was a productive unit based on private property , its members understood their domestic life and personal relations to be rooted in their mutual labour .
Since the rise of industry , however , proletarianisation separated most people ( or families ) from the ownership of productive property .
As a result , work and life were separated ; proletarianisation split off the outer world of alienated labour from an inner world of personal feeling .
Just as capitalist development gave rise to the idea of the family as a separate realm from the economy , soil created a separate sphere of personal life , seemingly divorced from the mode of production .
Zaretsky goes on to argue that this was in some ways a gain for the masses , since ‘ personal relations and self - cultivation ’ had always previously been reserved for the leisure classes .
But it was also a great distortion , for personal life became a vast new area of life whose connection to the rest of society was hidden and obscure , in which the dominant note was subjectivity , ‘ the sense of an individual alone , outside society with no firm sense of his or her own place in a rationally ordered scheme . ’89
This is the other side of the coin from the alienation of which Marx wrote , the alienation of workers from the products of their own labour .
Personal life is alienated from the equally human and vital activity of production , and seems to be autonomous when it is in reality subordinated to the needs of capitalist society , including the family and distinct gender roles .
The consequence of this is that sexuality in capitalist society requires a new discourse , one which is ( as Michel Foucault argued very effectively despite his very different theories as to why it should be ) both an incitement to sexual activity and a means of control .
It is essential that individuals should ‘ feel free ’ to get personal satisfaction from sex , but it is also necessary that this should be contained within the recognised norms of family and gender structure .
So medical ideas of sex in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries began to stress the importance of sexuality , but also its complications and dangers : the differences between male and female sexuality , the dangers of masturbation and ‘ waste ’ of sexual energy , and the existence of a whole cluster of previously unknown complaints such as nymphomania , satyriasis , sexual phthisis , and so on .
The old habit of referring to forbidden sexuality as ‘ sins not to be named among Christians ’ was almost comically reversed in a torrent of strange new words .
89 Homosexuality was one of these .
The hostile model of homosexuality was developed by medical men concerned with the problem they defined as sexual ‘ degeneracy ’ .
Many in this field believed that homosexuality was either a kind of insanity or a congenital defect indicating hereditary weaknesses .
They regarded it as pathological , and terms of disapproval such as ‘ moral degeneracy ’ kept creeping into the works even of those who claimed to describe it neutrally and scientifically .
Most managed to regard it as both congenital and infectious by referring to the ‘ latent ’ condition , an inborn defect which could be triggered by bad company or unfortunate experiences .
It is this kind of medical view that one gay writer has described as being ‘ chiefly concerned with whether the disgusting breed of perverts could be physically identified for courts , and whether they should be held legally responsible for their acts .
’90
There were , however , two models of homosexuality developing in the late nineteenth century .
The first in point of time was the idea of the ‘ Uranian ’ , or person born with mixed biological sex characteristics .
developed by Karl Heinrich Ulrichs from the early 1860s and adopted by many people who recognised themselves in it .
This biological model was for the next hundred years or so an important source of self - identification .
It was adopted by writers sympathetic to the reform of legal and social attitudes such as Havelock Ellis and the German socialists Bernstein and Herzen , though they adopted the other new words ‘ invert ’ and ‘ homosexual ’ to describe it .
Most present - day gays and lesbians reject this model , understandably since it makes them seem like freaks ; but it played a large part in the homosexual rights movement and cannot historically be regarded simply as a form of self - oppression .
91
Part of the new discourse of sexuality was to be a great extension of the concept itself , culminating in Freud ’s assertion that the ‘ sex drive ’ is much wider and influences many more aspects of human behaviour than had been thought before , including art and literature as well as love and friendship .
While Freud himself saw this as a liberating kind of knowledge , it was also capable of being used , and it has been widely used , to widen the definition of sexual behaviour between people of the same sex and stigmatise behaviour which had formerly been regarded as innocent or admirable .
While this was most far - reaching in the case of women ( as discussed below ) , it was also true of male ‘ comradeship ’ , and by the early twentieth century considerable confusion could be found about the limits of acceptable behaviour by normal ’ men.92
Although the legal repression of gays will be examined separately in the next section , it is important to realise that they were not the only target for legal control , and that in Britain one of the most important developments , the Labouchere Amendment of 1885 , happened almost incidentally in the course of a much broader campaign to control sexuality .
Both the Contagious Diseases Acts ( from 1864 ) and the opposition to them had a place in this movement .
Ostensibly a series of measures against venereal disease , the Acts attempted to redefine working class women ’s sexuality by labelling individual women as prostitutes and subjecting them to compulsory examination and treatment , while taking no action whatever against their male partners .
They aroused widespread opposition among the working class because the law drew in women who cohabited temporarily with men , or who went on the streets casually to supplement the meagre wages a working - class woman could earn , and in operation could pull almost any working - class woman in for examination on one policeman ’s word .93 Middle - class feminists also campaigned vigorously against the Acts , in alliance with working - class women and men .
But the sexual attitudes of the leading campaigners were far from radical .
Their objection to the double standard for men and women was that it allowed men freedom to exercise unrestrained ‘ lust ’ , and they demanded that men should be subjected to the same standards as women , not that women should be as free as men then were .
Many of them continued after the repeal of the Acts in 1886 to agitate in ‘ Social Purity ’ campaigns for the control of male lust , which they associated with violence and oppression .
94
Meanwhile , the stunts and publicity campaigns of the newspaper editor W.T. Stead , who had written a series of articles on the ‘ Maiden Tribute of Modern Babylon ’ about the procurement of young girls , resulted in the Criminal Law Amendment
Act of 1885 , whose main provisions were to raise the age of consent for girls to sixteen and to penalise procurement ( the so - called ‘ white slave trade ’ ) .
Labouchere , a radical Member of Parliament , inserted into this act the famous and disastrous clause which made acts of ‘ gross indecency ’ between men a crime , though he claimed that what he intended was merely to penalise the procurement of boys in the same way as that of girls .
95
Though campaigns such as Stead ’s and reforms such as the 1885 Act claimed to be ‘ rescuing ’ working - class women and young people , in effect they also introduced new restrictions on those they were claiming to protect ; Labouchere ’s Amendment is only the most startling example of this .
To say this is not to deny that prostitution in Victorian society was often degrading and exploitative , or that violence against women and the sexual abuse of children were problems .
But the campaigns and publicity stunts of the late nineteenth century , and the legislation to which they gave rise , attempted to define out of existence such people as the unrepentant prostitute or single mother , the woman who had cohabited with more than one man , the consenting fourteen - and fifteen - year - old couples whose existence had horrified Shaftesbury , and the youth whose preferred sexual practice was picking up toffs in London ’s West End .
It is not only wrong to suppose that the problems of sexual oppression can be eliminated by legislative action and state intervention in a capitalist society .
It can also put other groups of people at risk from oppressive and injurious state action in ways that are considered unimportant , or have not even been envisaged , by the reformers who clamour for legislation .
Legal repression and homosexual rights
Without the criminalisation of homosexuality , modern gay consciousness would probably not have emerged in the way it has done .
Germany and Britain are particularly important because in both these countries controversial new laws were introduced in the late nineteenth century .
Yet a comparison with the USA shows that legal harassment could increase without any particular legislative landmark , old laws simply being used in new ways .
The effect of new medical and legal attitudes in the late nineteenth century may have been , in practice , that gay people came to be punished for their inclinations rather than their behaviour .
But the new laws in Germany and Britain marked less of a break with the past than is often supposed .
Paragraph 175 of the Imperial German code specified ‘ unnatural coupling between persons of the male sex , and between people and animals ’ , and the Nazis in fact held it to be too narrow since it implied coition .
The 1885 Criminal Law Amendment
Act in Britain referred to ‘ any act of gross indecency with another male person ’ , but this could hardly be much broader than the range of offences included in practice in the definition of ‘ attempted sodomy ’ since the eighteenth century .
97
But these and other laws were increasingly interpreted as applying to the new category of ‘ homosexuals ’ , and it seems that all the major capitalist countries have used some form of legal harassment against gay men in the twentieth century .
Even Japan , which had traditionally approved of sexual relations between male samurai , introduced restrictive legislation as part of its modernisation programme under the Meiji Restoration after 1868.98
In Germany , controversy was precipitated by the unification of the country under Prussian domination in 1869 - 71 , when the Prussian legal code was imposed on several states which had previously decriminalised sodomy .
A number of individuals , including Karl Heinrich Ulrichs and the socialist J.B. Schweitzer , had begun to protest at legal harassment in the early 1860s , but their cause gained a wider audience with the unification of Germany .
Medical writers – among them Benkert and Von Westphal , who first used the terms ‘ homosexuality ’ and ‘ sexual inversion ’ respectively – protested that the problem involved was a matter for their profession rather than the law .
Even medical writers who took a hostile view of homosexuality – for example Krafft - Ebbing , who thought ‘ they should be put away for life , but not branded as criminals ’ – argued against Paragraph 175 .
In 1897 Magnus Hirschfeld founded the Scientific Humanitarian Committee in Germany , which linked the defence of homosexuality by gay people themselves to the scientific investigation of medical theories and to the political campaign ( supported throughout by the German Social Democratic Party ) for the repeal of the law .
About 1000 books and pamphlets on the subject appeared between 1898 and 1908 .
In 1919 Hirschfeld went on to set up the Institute for Sexual Science , and the Institute organised a number of international conferences until it was destroyed by the Nazis in 1933 .
The German movement for homosexual emancipation between the two World Wars came as near to being a mass movement as anything before the 1960s .
But it was politically confused .
Hirschfeld and the right - wing Social Democratic leadership of the movement rejected Bolshevism and revolution , although in practice the Russian revolutionary regime decriminalised homosexuality while they achieved only minor reforms in Germany .
The fact that many of those interested in homosexual rights in interwar Germany were extremely right wing ( three - quarters were said to be monarchists in 1918 ) was the excuse for political caution and moderation , while the alternative lifestyle of gay bars and clubs in the ‘ Golden Twenties ’ proved far more attractive than any kind of political agitation .
As James Steakley has written :
A contradiction between personal and collective liberation emerged , for it was far easier to luxuriate in the concrete utopia of the urban sub-culture than to struggle for an emancipation which was apparently only formal and legalistic .
100
If many German gays and lesbians did feel this in the 1920s , they were under the most tragic of illusions .
The Nazi Party , despite the presence of known homosexuals in its early leadership and the attraction it held for a certain layer of right - wing gay men , was implacably opposed to same - sex relations and within months of coming to power in 1933 it had destroyed the movement and driven many of its activists into exile .
In 1934 , after the purge of Roehm ( who was homosexual ) and his allies from the Nazi Party , the German fascist regime launched a massive attack on gay people which led to 10,000 convictions a year and to a total of at least 10,000 and possibly several times that number ( including lesbians though there was no law against them ) being sent to concentration camps , where a high proportion of them died .
101
The December 1934 guidelines on the law from the Nazi Ministry of Justice stated that no sexual act was necessary for conviction – the intention was enough .
A pamphlet on the new law against homosexuals which was issued in 1935 described ‘ simple contemplation of the desired object ’ as a felony ; this clearly presents a problem of proof , but the courts later decided that ‘ a lewd glance ’ was sufficient .
But the logical consequence , which did in fact follow from 1936 onwards , was that the rules of factual evidence were abandoned , and psychological evidence of an individual ’s inclinations became sufficient to secure conviction .
102
In England , the death penalty for ‘ buggery with man or beast ’ had been abolished in 1861 , but it was still punishable by penal servitude for life , while attempted sodomy and ‘ indecent assault upon any male person ’ were liable to up to ten years of the same .
103
But more public attention was attracted by Labouchere ’s amendment to the Criminal Law Amendment Act of 1885 .
It did not include any new concept of homosexuality ; indeed the word did not appear in print in English until twelve years later .
The phrase used for sexual acts between men , ‘ gross indecency ’ , was vague , but it was its very vagueness , coupled with the phrase ‘ in public or in private ’ , that enabled the amendment to become such a scourge once the widening concept of homosexuality came to be seen as the justification for it after the event .
The years following the passage of the amendment saw a number of prosecutions which hit the headlines and invited public comment , especially the Cleveland Street male brothel case in 1889 and the Oscar Wilde trials of 1895 .
In the Cleveland Street case , there was still rather more preoccupation with the vice and decadence of fashionable society than with the homosexual as a type of person .
104
Yet by the time of the trials of Oscar Wilde in 1895 , a shift seems to have occurred .
In the late 1880s ( after marrying and having two children )
Wilde had become involved in a series of love affairs with younger men and in the gay male subculture of his day .
This was a lifestyle which linked aristocratic and university circles , committed to the ‘ Cause ’ of defending gay male sexuality , with the world of working - class pickups and male prostitutes .
In private diaries and correspondence , both Wilde ’s friends and his enemies were using a range of concepts still absent from printed literature and respectable discourse in England , including the adjective ‘ homosexual ’ and the abusive term ‘ queers ’ .
105
Wilde himself , at his trial , defended the ‘ love that dare not speak its name ’ ( a phrase which had appeared in a poem by Lord Alfred Douglas , his lover ) as a ‘ deep spiritual affection that is as pure as it is perfect ’ and asserted that ‘ there is nothing unnatural about it ’ .
Understandably in the circumstances , this famous and much admired speech was ambiguous , because it could be taken as denying any sexual element in his relationships with younger men .
At his lowest point in prison , when Wilde was broken by hard labour and embittered by Douglas ’s bad behaviour , he pleaded in a petition to the Home Secretary that
such offences are forms of sexual madness and are recognised as such not merely by modern pathological science but by much modern legislation , notably in France , Austria and Italy , where the laws affecting these misdemeanours have been repealed , on the ground that they are diseases to be cured by a physician , rather than crimes to be punished by a judge .
But from his release in 1897 until his death in 1900 , Wilde wrote habitually of ‘ Uranian love ’ , adopting Ulrichs ’s term .
106
The new ideas spread among the medical and legal professions , and by 1918 Lord Sumner could assert that sodomites were stamped with ‘ the hall - mark of a specialised and extraordinary class as much as if they had carried on their bodies some physical peculiarities .
107
By the early twentieth century there was in Britain a network of individuals , especially but not exclusively men , dedicated to homosexual emancipation .
These included the socialist Edward Carpenter and the writer Havelock Ellis .
During the interwar years , many of them were associated with the movement for sexual reform which linked up with Hirschfeld ’s German organisation and the World League for Sexual Reform .108 it was only after the Second World War that a coherent movement for the reform of the law developed .
The stimulus to the development of a reform movement seems to have been a fivefold increase in prosecutions between 1938 and 1952 .
The continued use of the sodomy laws alongside the wider gross indecency charge is shown by some figures for the 1950s : 1043 cases of sodomy and

In a dramatic reversal of decades of public opinion , California voters agree by a slim majority that same - sex couples should be allowed to marry , according to a Field Poll released today .
By 51 - 42 percent , registered voters said they believed same - sex marriage should be legal in California .
Only 28 percent favored gay marriage in 1977 , when the Field Poll first asked that question , said Mark DiCamillo , the poll 's director .
" This is a milestone in California , " he said .
" You can't downplay the importance of a change in an issue we 've been tracking for 30 years . "
While opposition to same - sex marriage has been weakening for years in California , supporters have remained a minority .
In March 2000 , for example , voters overwhelmingly backed Proposition 22 , a statute that said the state would recognize only the marriage of a man and a woman .
A 2006 Field Poll showed that half the state 's voters still disapproved of same - sex marriage .
But the state Supreme Court 's decision this month to overturn Prop. 22 might have turned the tide , DiCamillo said .
" There 's a certain validation when the state Supreme Court makes a ruling that you can't discriminate when it comes to marriage , " he said .
" That may have been enough to move some people who were on the fence about same - sex marriage . "
Younger voters and those living in the Bay Area , Los Angeles and other Democratic urban strongholds were the most supportive of same - sex marriage , the poll found , while older voters and those living in the more conservative inland areas were more opposed .
The poll also provided a boost for groups planning to battle a measure to ban same - sex marriage that is expected to go on the ballot in November as a constitutional amendment .
By 51 - 43 percent , registered voters oppose changing the state Constitution to ban same - sex marriage , according to the poll .
Results differ from other poll
A statewide Los Angeles Times / KTLA
Poll released last week showed different results : 54 percent of registered voters said they would support the initiative that would change the state Constitution to ban same - sex marriage .
" When we get results that we think are surprising , we double - and triple - check our numbers , and that 's what we did here , " said DiCamillo .
" Everything in this poll is consistent internally . "
It 's not unusual for two polls to have conflicting numbers , said Steve Kinney , a veteran GOP pollster .
" It 's all in the methodology , who you actually talked to and whether they accurately represented that state as a whole , " he said .
" But even if you have confidence in your numbers , you 're always scared if you come up with something totally different .
Are you wrong , or is the other guy ? "
Support for same - sex marriage has been growing steadily in California , and the youngest voters are pushing the hardest .
Among voters 18 to 29 years old , 68 percent back gay marriage , compared with only 36 percent of those 65 and older , the Field Poll found .
It 's a " generational replacement , with older folks being replaced by younger voters very much in favor of same - sex marriage , " DiCamillo said .
Those younger voters " have grown up with people who are out in their lives , whether it 's politicians in the news or people they know , " said Geoff Kors , executive director of Equality California , one of the groups opposed to the proposed initiative to ban same - sex marriage .
But the dramatic movement on the issue over the past few years has n't been by accident , Kors said .
San Francisco Mayor Gavin Newsom 's dramatic - and later overturned - decision to issue marriage licenses to gay couples in 2004 , the Legislature 's passage of two bills to authorize same - sex marriage and other efforts have helped educate people about the issue and bring same - sex marriage into the California mainstream , he said .
" Legislators voted for same - sex marriage , and none of them were voted out of office , " Kors said .
" This ( poll result ) is what we'd expect , but it's also the first time we 've seen a majority for same - sex marriage , and the Field Poll is as credible as it comes . "
Supporters of the new initiative shrugged off the poll results , saying that it is a long time until the November election .
" The Supreme Court ruling only just happened , " said Karen England , spokeswoman for the Capitol Resource Institute , one of the groups backing a ban on same - sex marriage , which is expected to be approved for the ballot in mid-June .
" Once we have the measure on the ballot , the campaign can change everything . "
England said plenty of voters calling her group are outraged that the Supreme Court overturned Prop. 22 after it passed with 61 percent of the vote .
She also questioned the accuracy of pre-election polls , noting that support for Prop. 22 on election day was much stronger than was shown in polls taken days before the vote .
" People might say one thing to a pollster , but they make their own decision in the voting booth , " she said .
How state splits on issue
The new Field Poll highlights the battleground for the fall campaign , showing the state splitting dramatically along regional , ideological and religious grounds .
The heavily Democratic urban areas strongly support same - sex marriage ; 55 percent of Los Angeles County and an overwhelming 68 percent of the Bay Area are in favor .
By contrast , only 38 percent of the Central Valley and 41 percent of Southern California outside of Los Angeles are in favor .
Same - sex marriage also digs a chasm between California 's heavily populated coast and its inland areas ; 55 percent of coastal voters back same - sex marriage compared with 40 percent in support inland .
The issue divides along liberal - conservative lines ; 85 percent of strong liberals are in favor , and 85 percent of strong conservatives are opposed .
Protestants , who make up a third of the state 's voters , oppose same - sex marriage 34 percent to 57 percent , while Catholics are split almost equally , 45 percent in favor to 48 percent opposed .
Those with no religious preference back same - sex marriage 81 percent to 12 percent .
America will be watching the fall campaign over same - sex marriage , which will have national implications , said Kors of Equality California .
" It 's going to be an intense and enormous undertaking , but we 're confident we 'll win , " he said .
" But we also know that the other side is out there working just as hard and feeling just as confident . "
The poll is based on a telephone survey of 1,052 registered voters taken May 17 - 26 .
The margin of error is plus or minus 3.2 percentage points .
The New York City health department plans to announce on Thursday an ambitious three - year effort to give an H.I.V. test to every adult living in the Bronx , which has a far higher death rate from AIDS than any other borough .
The campaign will begin with a push to make the voluntary testing routine in emergency rooms and storefront clinics , where city officials say that cumbersome consent procedures required by state law have deterred doctors from offering the tests .
“ Routine would mean if you came into the emergency room for asthma or a broken leg , we test everyone for H.I.V. , if they ’re willing , ” the health commissioner , Dr. Thomas R. Frieden , said in an interview on Wednesday .
While Manhattan has long been the epicenter of the AIDS epidemic in New York , with the highest incidence of both AIDS and H.I.V. , the virus that causes it , the Bronx , with its poorer population , has far more deaths from the disease .
Public health officials attribute this to people not getting tested until it is too late to treat the virus effectively , thus turning a disease that can now be managed with medication into a death sentence .
Several AIDS experts said on Wednesday that the Bronx campaign was the most aggressive testing effort they could recall in the nation .
Two years ago , Washington , D.C. , made a high - profile push to test 450,000 residents , enlisting celebrity endorsements and distributing 80,000 free testing kits , but the campaign resulted in only about 45,000 people being tested .
Within an hour after the first passenger jet hit the World Trade Center , Vice President Dick Cheney told President Bush to stay away from Washington , ordered the Congressional leadership evacuated , dispersed cabinet members to emergency shelters and urged Mr. Bush to direct fighter jets to shoot down any rogue airliner that threatened the Capitol or White House .
As he recounted on television today how he was in constant contact with Mr. Bush on Air Force One , Mr. Cheney , who was in the White House when the attacks occurred , said he also marshaled top administration aides in a secure underground bunker linked to the Central Intelligence Agency and the Defense , State and Justice Departments , and effectively ran the government in Mr. Bush 's absence .
The president was in Florida on Tuesday and returned to the White House that evening .
' ' I was in a position to be able to see all the stuff coming in , receive reports and then make decisions in terms of acting with it , '' Mr. Cheney said on NBC 's '' Meet the Press ' ' in his first public remarks since the attacks .
When Secret Service agents urged Mr. Cheney to evacuate the White House bunker , he refused to budge .
'' I did n't want to leave the node we 'd established there , '' Mr. Cheney said .
'' If I 'd have left , gotten on a helicopter and launched out of the White House , all of that would have been broken down . ''
During the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries , the United States pursued an aggressive policy of expansionism , extending its political and economic influence around the globe .
That pivotal era in the history of our nation is the subject of this online history .

Expansion in the Pacific
After temporarily resolving the problems of Reconstruction and Industrialization , Americans began to resume the course of expansion .
The horrors of the Civil War had interrupted the original Manifest Destiny that began in the 1840s .
Now , as pioneers settled the last western frontiers , expansionists looked yet farther to the west — toward Asia and the Pacific .
A leading expansionist , Captain Alfred T. Mahan , cautioned that the Pacific could " be entered and controlled only by a vigorous contest . "
As head of the Naval War College , Mahan believed that America 's survival depended upon a strong navy .
He argued that a strong navy would require island possessions to serve as naval bases .
The time had come , Mahan wrote , for Americans to turn their " eyes outward , instead of inward only , to seek the welfare of the country . "
American ships had long been active in the Pacific .
The New England whaling fleets scoured the ocean in search of their prey .
The China trade had been enriching Yankee merchants since 1784 .
Japan , however , had effectively closed its doors to outsiders , and it restricted foreign ships to a small part of Nagasaki .
Commodore Matthew C. Perry , commander of the United States naval forces in the China seas , was a staunch expansionist .
Back in 1852 he warned President Fillmore that the British , who had already taken control of Hong Kong and Singapore , would soon control all trade in the area .
Perry recommended that the United States take " active measures to secure a number of ports of refuge " in Japan .
President Fillmore agreed with Perry .
In 1853 he ordered the Commodore to open negotiations with the Emperor of Japan .

A Letter to an Emperor
Kayama Yezaimon , daimyo of Uraga , raced to the battlement , the clash of the warning gong still ringing in his ears .
Stopping beside the brass cannon that guarded the entrance of Edo Bay , he scanned the horizon .
The summer sun flashed high above the blue Pacific , and beneath it four ships approached with the tide .
As the ships sailed closer , the daimyo , his samurai , and their retainers watched in silent awe .
Two huge steam frigates spouted thick black clouds as they maneuvered against the wind .
With their paddle - wheels churning the water , the frigates came about , bringing their gun-decks to bear upon the shore defenses .
Two sailing ships waited downwind in support .
Bright signal flags fluttered from halyards .
Kayama scowled .
Through a telescope he studied the ships , which were well beyond the range of his small shore batteries .
The ships bristled with cannon much more formidable than his own .
Identical flags flapped at the stern of each vessel—red and white stripes , with white stars on a patch of blue .
Kayama barked out an order .
A samurai ran forward and dropped to one knee .
The daimyo instructed the samurai to ride to the castle of Abe Masahiro , and to inform the shogun that a barbarian fleet blocked the mouth of Edo Bay .
From the fo'c'sle of the sloop of war Saratoga , Lieutenant John Goldsborough watched as dozens of Japanese galleys approached the American fleet .
They were all fantastically decorated with flags and banners .
They were propelled by from ten to twenty oars each with generally two or three men at each oar .
None of the boats were permitted to come alongside any ship in the Squadron , though they all appeared quite anxious to go alongside the Flagship .
Still none were permitted until we were fully convinced that a high officer was in one of the boats .
Then he alone , with an interpreter who spoke Dutch , was allowed to come over the Susquehanna 's side .
On board the Susquehanna , Commodore Perry 's aide , Lieutenant Contee , informed the official that the Commodore carried a letter from the President of the United States to the Emperor of Japan .
The Commodore intended to deliver the letter personally to an official representative .
Since the Commodore was of the highest rank in the United States Navy , Contee said , he would meet only with a Japanese official of equal status .
Two days later , Kayama Yezaimon visited the Susquehanna .
He informed Captain Adams that the Americans must take their message to Nagasaki .
Perry refused to meet with Kayama , but he wrote a message .
" The Commodore will not go to Nagasaki , " Adams read .
" If this friendly letter of the President to the Emperor is not received and duly replied to , he will consider his country insulted , and will not hold himself accountable for the consequences . "
After several more days of haggling , a suitable representative , " Prince " Toda , arrived in Uraga .
With cannon salutes and a marching band , Perry led a parade of marines to meet the Japanese delegation .
He presented Toda with the president 's letter , enclosed in a rosewood box trimmed with gold , and announced that he would return for the emperor 's answer in the spring .
Perry impressed the Japanese officials with his diplomacy and with the technological superiority of his ships and weapons .
The Japanese shogunate decided to grant the minor trade concessions that President Fillmore asked for in his letter .
Forming a treaty with the Americans , they reasoned , would prevent another European power from imposing even greater concessions .
In February 1854 , Perry returned to Edo with eight ships .
He accepted the favorable reply to Fillmore 's letter and visited several Japanese ports before beginning the long voyage home .
His diplomatic mission had officially established the United States ' presence in Asia .
Still , the Americans never realized that they had been negotiating with a mere shogun .
For the emperor to consult with barbarians was unthinkable .

Footholds in the Pacific
As ships crossed the vast ocean to trade in Asia , islands in the Pacific became important stops for coal , provisions , and repairs .
In the South Pacific , the American navy negotiated for the right to build a base on the Samoan island of Tutuila .
The Hawaiian Islands , which lie closest to the American mainland , had long been an important stop for the Pacific fleet .
Pearl Harbor , on the island of Oahu , offered one of the most attractive natural bases in the Pacific .
In the early 1800s , missionaries from New England made the arduous voyage to Hawaii and settled there .
They sent back news of fantastic economic possibilities in the islands .
Soon other Americans followed to become sugar planters and to establish profitable businesses .
To the native Hawaiians , or Kanaka Maoli , their island was a paradise .
The sea , the abundant fruit trees , and the rich , fertile soil provided the Kanaka Maoli with all their necessities .
Because of the perfect year - round climate , their simple shelters were adequate and comfortable .
To the Americans , however , the Kanaka Maoli behaved like foolish children , as one early visitor described :
The ease with which the Hawaiians on their own land can secure their food supply has undoubtably interfered with their social and industrial advancement .
. . . [ It ] relieves the native from any struggle and unfits him for sustained competition with men from other lands .
The fact that food is supplied by nature takes from the native all desire for the acquisition of more land .
Today 's food can be had for the picking , and tomorrow 's as well .
Instead of grasping all he can get , he divides with his neighbor , and confidently expects his neighbor to divide with him .
While the Kanaka Maoli were content to live in their traditional , idyllic ways , Americans were busy building huge plantations , warehouses , railroads , drydocks , banks , hotels , and stores .
They soon dominated the island 's economy , and they were able to influence its government as well .
Americans created and controlled Hawaii 's legislature and cabinet , and they limited the power of the native king .
As the nineteenth century drew to a close , disputes arose between the Kanaka Maoli and those of foreign descent .
" Hawaii for Hawaiians " became the slogan of people who sought to restore the traditional ways of the kingdom .
Others called for the annexation of Hawaii by the United States .
Annexation would eliminate the recent trade restrictions on sugar and revive the island 's faltering economy .
Secret organizations , such as the Annexation Club , plotted revolution .
In the midst of this unrest , Queen Liliuokalani assumed the throne upon the death of her brother , King Kalakaua .
At age fifty - two , Liliuokalani had already governed the islands as regent during her brother 's long absences .
She was well qualified to take control of the government .
An American newspaper reporter who interviewed the new queen described her as " strong and resolute .
Her manner was dignified , and she had the ease and authoritative air of one accustomed to rule . "
Educated in American schools , Liliuokalani 's voice " was musical and well modulated , and she spoke remarkably pure and graceful English . "
Islanders who favored annexation hoped that the new queen would support their interests .
Liliuokalani , however , was determined to eliminate American influence in the government .
She tried to create a new constitution that would strengthen the traditional monarchy , but her cabinet refused to cooperate .
The American residents were outraged .
They organized the Committee of Safety and appointed members of the Annexation Club as its leaders .
On the morning of January 17 , 1893 , armed members of the committee attacked .
They took over the government office building .
From its steps they read a proclamation abolishing the monarchy and establishing a provisional government .
The provisional government " would exist until terms of union with the United States of America have been negotiated and agreed upon . "
Sanford B. Dole , an elderly judge with a flowing , white beard , became its president .
Hawaiians who were loyal to their queen tried to come to her defense and stop the revolution .
When they arrived in Honolulu , however , American troops confronted them .
The United States minister , John L. Stevens , had sent for a battalion of marines and an artillery company from the cruiser Boston .
They were ordered to protect the provisional government .
For the Hawaiians , resistance was hopeless .
Queen Liliuokalani sadly surrendered her throne .
She wrote a document in which she " yielded to the superior forces of the United States . "
She pleaded with the U.S. government to " undo the actions of its representatives and reinstate me in the authority I claim as the Constitutional Sovereign of the Hawaiian Islands . "
Meanwhile , the Provisional Government sent five representatives to Washington to apply for annexation .
They quickly drew up a treaty , and President Harrison signed it and submitted it to Congress .
Before the Senate could approve the treaty , however , a new president took office .
This president , Grover Cleveland , had reservations about taking over an independent country .
He withdrew the treaty and sent a special commissioner to Hawaii to investigate the revolution .
The commissioner reported that Minister Stevens had conspired with a small group of revolutionaries to overthrow the government .
Cleveland replaced Stevens with a new minister and tried to restore Liliuokalani to the throne .
President Dole flatly refused to give the government back to the Hawaiians .
He told President Cleveland that the United States had no right to meddle in Hawaii 's internal affairs .
Congress agreed , and it adopted a " hands off " policy toward the island .
Dole 's new government then created an army and held a constitutional convention .
On July 4th , 1894 , the government unveiled the completed constitution and declared an independent Republic of Hawaii .
Despite Liliuokalani's pleas for help , other governments quickly recognized the new republic .
In desperation , supporters of the queen began to collect weapons and to make secret plans to overthrow the republic and restore the monarchy .
They planned to strike on the morning of January 7 , 1895 , but informers told the government about their plot .
At dawn , as the queen 's supporters slipped silently ashore on Waikiki , government soldiers opened fire .
A few of the rebels fell dead or wounded ; others surrendered .
The government declared martial law .
During the next few days , government troops defeated the disorganized rebels in a series of brief but deadly skirmishes .
Within two weeks , they completely suppressed the uprising and captured its followers , including Queen Liliuokalani .
The prisoners were tried for treason .
Liliuokalani was forced to sign a document in which she finally renounced all claims to the throne .
Now secure in its power , the republican government turned its attention to international relations and trade .
In 1896 , however , the election of a Republican , William McKinley , as president of the United States , rekindled Hawaiian hopes for annexation .
President McKinley , like many Republicans , favored expansionism , and he welcomed the new annexation treaty .
A joint resolution of Congress annexing Hawaii passed both houses , and the islands became American possessions .
While Congress was considering the annexation treaty , an American fleet was steaming across the Pacific to attack the Philippine Islands .
The United States had gone to war .

The Spanish - American War
Remember the Maine
The battleship Maine drifted lazily at its mooring .
Although the Havana night was moonless , the Maine 's gleaming white hull — longer than a football field — contrasted against the blackness of the sea and sky .
Smoke wisped from its two mustard - colored funnels .
Random lights sparkled from its portholes and its bridge .
In the captain 's cabin , Charles Sigsbee sat at a table writing a letter to his wife .
The trouble in Cuba , he wrote , would soon be over .
The new Spanish governor of the island seemed to have the situation under control .
During the three weeks that the Maine had been in Havana , Captain Sigsbee had seen no sign of Cuban rebels .
He 'd entertained the Spanish officers in his mess , and he and his staff had been entertained lavishly by the local officials .
Although Sigsbee found the bullfights to which he'd been invited somewhat barbaric , the Spanish officers behaved as perfect gentlemen .
Even Fitzhugh Lee , the American consul , seemed optimistic .
A month earlier the old general ( Lee had commanded a cavalry division under his uncle Robert E. in the Civil War ) had summoned a battleship to " protect American interests . "
Although the Maine was only a second - class battleship , it was the largest ship ever to enter Havana harbor .
To the Cubans , it was a floating American fortress right in their capital city .
Aboard the Maine , " taps " sounded at ten minutes past nine .
Captain Sigsbee describes what happened next .
I laid down my pen and listened to the notes of the bugle , which were singularly beautiful in the oppressive stillness of the night .
. . .
I was enclosing my letter in its envelope when the explosion came .
It was a bursting , rending , and crashing roar of immense volume , largely metallic in character .
It was followed by heavy , ominous metallic sounds .
There was a trembling and lurching motion of the vessel , a list to port .
The electric lights went out .
Then there was intense blackness and smoke .
The situation could not be mistaken .
The Maine was blown up and sinking .
For a moment the instinct of self - preservation took charge of me , but this was immediately dominated by the habit of command .
Captain Sigsbee managed to reach the deck , now slanted down sharply toward the submerged bow .
He climbed aft toward the only part of the ship that was not awash .
Fires had broken out all over the vessel , and they lit the harbor in an eerie red glow .
In Havana lights began to shine from windows that had just been smashed by the blast .
Most of the crew had been asleep in their berths at the forward part of the ship , which was already at the bottom of the harbor .
The stern sunk more slowly .
Crews from nearby ships manned lifeboats to rescue the surviving crewmen of the Maine .
" Chief among them , " Sigsbee wrote , " were the boats from the Alfonso XII .
The Spanish officers and crews did all that humanity and gallantry could compass . "
Reluctantly , Captain Sigsbee abandoned the Maine , which continued to burn and explode throughout the night .
The twisted , burnt wreckage of the Maine 's stern and bridge was still above water in the morning .
It remained there for years .
Two hundred fifty - four seamen were dead , and fifty - nine sailors were wounded .
Eight of the wounded later died .
The navy conducted an investigation into the cause of the disaster , but it never discovered who was responsible for the explosion .
[ Return to Top ]
Yellow Journalism
The American press , however , had no doubts about who was responsible for sinking the Maine .
It was the cowardly Spanish , they cried .
William Randolph Hearst 's New York Journal even published pictures .
They showed how Spanish saboteurs had fastened an underwater mine to the Maine and had detonated it from shore .
As one of the few sources of public information , newspapers had reached unprecedented influence and importance .
Journalistic giants , such as Hearst and Joseph Pulitzer of the World , viciously competed for the reader 's attention .
They were determined to reach a daily circulation of a million people , and they did n't mind fabricating stories in order to reach their goal .
They competed in other ways as well .
The World was the first newspaper to introduce colored comics , and the Journal immediately copied it .
The two papers often printed the same comics under different titles .
One of these involved the adventures of " The Yellow Kid , " a little boy who always wore a yellow gown .
Since color presses were new in the 1890s , the finished product was not always perfect .
The colors , especially the Yellow Kid 's costume , often smeared .
Soon people were calling the World , the Journal , and other papers like them " the yellow press . "
" They colored the funnies , " some said , " but they colored the news as well . "
A minor revolt in Cuba against the Spanish colonial government provided a colorful topic .
For months now the papers had been painting in lurid detail the horrors of Cuban life under oppressive Spanish rule .
The Spanish had confined many Cubans to concentration camps .
The press called them " death camps . "
Wild stories with screaming headlines — Spanish Cannibalism , Inhuman Torture , Amazon Warriors Fight For Rebels — flooded the newsstands .
Newspapers sent hundreds of reporters , artists , and photographers south to recount Spanish atrocities .
The correspondents , including such notables as author Stephen Crane and artist Frederick Remington , found little to report on when they arrived .
" There is no war , " Remington wrote to his boss .
" Request to be recalled . "
Remington 's boss , William Randolph Hearst , sent a cable in reply : " Please remain .
You furnish the pictures , I 'll furnish the war . "
Hearst was true to his word .
For weeks after the Maine disaster , the Journal devoted more than eight pages a day to the story .
Not to be outdone , other papers followed Hearst 's lead .
Hundreds of editorials demanded that the Maine and American honor be avenged .
Many Americans agreed .
Soon a rallying cry could be heard everywhere — in the papers , on the streets , and in the halls of Congress : " Remember the Maine !
To hell with Spain . "

A Splendid Little War
In the wake of the Maine incident , Congress hurriedly appropriated $ 50 million to prepare the nation for war .
" Big navy " supporters , including the Assistant Secretary of the Navy , Theodore Roosevelt , appropriated the lion 's share of the money .
Next , President McKinley insisted that Spain agree to a cease - fire with the Cuban rebels and negotiate a permanent settlement with them .
After a slight delay , Spain agreed to the American demands .
Two days later , McKinley asked Congress for authority to use military force to end the Cuban conflict .
Essentially , this was a declaration of war .
The United States Army was not prepared for war .
After the Civil War , the country had drastically reduced its army .
Most army units had been scattered throughout the west , where they had fought and confined Native Americans .
Volunteer and National Guard units quickly assembled in Tennessee .
Regular - army divisions , filled with new recruits , rushed to Florida to await the invasion of Cuba .
Back to the Pacific
The navy , however , needed little preparation .
The Pacific fleet was visiting Hong Kong when the news of war arrived .
Commodore George Dewey quickly provisioned his ships and set off to attack the Spanish colony in the Philippine Islands .
Once at sea , Commodore Dewey had his men paint all the ships .
Once a bright white , the ships were soon covered with a dull gray to make them less visible to the enemy .
Next ,
Dewey ordered that everything made of wood , including the piano on his flagship Olympia , be tossed over the side .
Splintered wood presented a greater danger to his crews than enemy shells .
Then with chests , chairs , and tables bobbing in the water behind them , the ships went after the Spanish fleet .
After searching throughout an oppressive tropical night , Dewey found the Spaniards in the shallows of Manila Bay .
At dawn on the first of May , the Olympia led the fleet in single file toward its enemy .
The Spanish opened fire long before the Americans were within range .
The Olympia moved still closer .
When it reached effective range , it turned sharply to the west , bringing all its guns to bear upon the Spanish fleet .
" You may fire when ready , Gridley , " Dewey told his executive officer .
With a deafening roar , the huge cruiser 's guns erupted .
The flagship swung around in a wide circle , and each ship followed , guns blasting as it passed .
" We made five trips past the fleet , " a gunner on the Boston wrote .
Just two hours after the beginning of the battle we hauled out and , withdrawing a few miles , the order was given for breakfast .
I was exhausted from the heat , loss of sleep , and lack of proper food .
I went up on deck .
Below the thermometer was at 116° , and the fresh air was a great relief .
From this vantage point , I could see the destruction we had wrought .
When the thick , black smoke that had obscured the battle cleared , he saw the Spanish fleet , battered and afire .
The battle had been won .
Eight seamen suffered wounds aboard the Boston ( the same ship that had helped " liberate " Hawaii ) .
One man died from the heat before the battle began .
They represented the total casualties for the fleet .
When the news of the stunning victory reached home , Americans cheered ecstatically .
Dewey , " the conqueror of the Philippines , " became an instant national hero .
Stores soon filled with merchandise bearing his image .
Few Americans knew what and where the Philippines were , but the press assured them that the islands were a welcome possession .
Rough Riders Despite Dewey 's early victory , the war in the Caribbean was getting off to a slow start .
More than 250,000 soldiers rushed enthusiastically into the service .
The army 's quartermaster corps , however , had only fifty - seven men to supply the army with equipment .
Soldiers gathered in Florida and waited impatiently for supplies and transportation .
Some individuals organized and outfitted their own regiments .
One such individual , the Assistant Secretary of the Navy , resigned his post and formed a volunteer regiment of cavalry .
Teddy Roosevelt did not intend to miss his chance at glory .
Roosevelt had been born forty years earlier to a wealthy New York family .
He described himself as " a sickly , delicate boy " who " suffered much from asthma , and frequently had to be taken away on trips to find a place where [ he ] could breathe . "
Determined to overcome his physical limitations , Roosevelt embarked on a grueling program of body building .
He practiced boxing , hunting , and riding , and after college he spent three years as a working cowboy in the wild Badlands of Dakota .
" It was still the Wild West in those days , " he wrote .
" The West of the Indian and the buffalo hunter , the soldier and the cow - puncher . "
There he " led a free and hardy life with horse and rifle . "
Roosevelt 's political career began in the New York legislature .
Next , after running unsuccessfully for mayor of New York , he served as that city 's police commissioner .
A loyal Republican , he campaigned tirelessly for McKinley in the 1896 election , and the president rewarded him with an appointment to the Department of the Navy .
Now , seeking again the " hardy life with horse and rifle , " Roosevelt waited in Tampa with his men .
His regiment , which called itself the Rocky Mountain Riders , consisted mostly of cowboys from the West , although it contained a few Indians and wealthy polo players from the East as well .
The papers called the regiment " Teddy 's Terrors , " but its commander was Leonard Wood , a physician who was also a colonel in the regular army .
Roosevelt served as lieutenant colonel .
" Tampa was a scene of the wildest confusion , " Teddy remembered .
" There was no semblance of order . "
Thousands of men , horses , mules , and supply wagons were scattered about haphazardly in the tropical heat .
Somehow the expedition reached Cuba .
Still , " different parts of different outfits were jumbled together .
. . .
For instance , one transport had guns , and another had the locks for the guns .
Soldiers went here , provisions went there , and who got ashore depended upon individual activity . "
Roosevelt , always active , got his regiment ashore quickly .
" We disembarked with our rifles , our ammunition belts , and not much else , " he remembered .
" I carried some food in my pocket , and a light coat which was my sole camp equipment for the next three days . "
With the July temperature climbing above 100° , the soldiers plodded off through the thick jungle toward the city of Santiago .
Wearing uniforms made of wool , the men struggled against the heat .
Those who managed to obtain rations often discovered that their food had spoiled .
Soon the ranks were riddled with malaria , fever , and dysentery .
( Before the war ended , 5,200 Americans would perish from disease . )
General Shafter , the army 's commander , realized that if he did n't capture Santiago soon , he might not have an army left .
After a few brief skirmishes , the armies confronted each other .
The Spanish defended the San Juan hills , a long ridge east of Santiago .
The Americans , arrayed in the valley below , sent up an observation balloon to study the city 's defenses .
Roosevelt , who had managed to obtain a horse , rode up and down the lines anxiously .
" I had come to the conclusion , " he said , " that it was silly to stay in the valley firing up at the hills .
. . .
The thing to do was to try to rush the entrenchments . "
Never a man to stand on ceremony , Teddy took it upon himself to order the charge .
With a pistol in one hand an a saber in the other , Teddy spurred his mount forward .
His face grew flushed ; his glasses clouded with steam ; a wide grin covered his face .
The rough riders followed on foot , and the Ninth Cavalry , an African American regiment , rushed forth beside them .
As he reached the crest of Kettle Hill , Teddy saw its defenders fleeing before him .
He fired at one of them , and later remarked that the man fell " as neatly as a jackrabbit . "
Atop Kettle Hill , the soldiers dined on captured Spanish provisions .
Later
Teddy left his men and rode to the top of San Juan Hill , but the Tenth Cavalry , another African American regiment , had already stormed and captured it .
That night the Americans repelled a Spanish counterattack .
In the morning , General Shafter demanded that the Spanish commander surrender .
A Big Turkey Shoot Ramon Blanco y Erenas , governor general of Cuba , received Shafter 's demand .
He responded by ordering his fleet to attack the American ships blockading Santiago harbor .
If the Spanish could destroy the Americans ' supply line , he thought , they could force the enemy to withdraw .
His fleet commander , Admiral Cervera , disagreed .
Attacking a force four times the size of his own seemed like suicide .
Nevertheless , Cervera obeyed his orders , and in the hazy dawn the Spanish , led by the magnificent Maria Teresa , bravely steamed into battle .
The Americans were ready .
Four first - class battleships ( any one of them might have been a match for the whole Spanish fleet ) , two cruisers , and several smaller ships enclosed the mouth of the harbor in a half - circle .
Tugboats filled with reporters scurried in their wake .
The Oregon fired the first shot of the battle , and soon black smoke blurred the bay .
" It was a big turkey shoot , " Seaman Cross of the Oregon said .
" The Fleet came out and went to Davy Jones ' locker . "
By one o'clock the battle was over .
The Spanish fleet was destroyed , and with it sank all hope of victory in Cuba .
General Nelson Miles , the old Indian fighter , led a force to Puerto Rico .
He conquered the island and its few Spanish defenders easily .
In effect , the war was over .
Spain agreed to an armistice .
In the four months of fighting , Americans had lost a total of 460 soldiers in battle .
Compared to the Civil War , in which tens of thousands were often killed in a single day , these casualties seemed insignificant .
" It 's been a splendid little war , " the ambassador to England wrote to his friend , Teddy Roosevelt .
Roosevelt returned , the hero of the war .
Because of his heroism on Kettle Hill , he 'd been nominated for the Congressional Medal of Honor .
His popularity swept him to the governorship of New York .
Like Dewey before him , Roosevelt memorabilia filled shop windows .
One of the more popular items was a cuddly stuffed animal wearing a bandana and glasses .
People called it the " Teddy Bear . "

In the months following the Spanish - American War , the winds of expansionism blew strongly across the United States .
There was a lot of talk about " Manifest Destiny , " and many people suggested that America should assume its role as a world power .
In Congress , legislators called for the annexation of all Spanish territories .
Some newspapers even suggested the annexation of Spain itself .
Expansionists such as Roosevelt , former President Harrison , and Captain Mahan argued for creating an American empire .
Others , including Grover Cleveland , Andrew Carnegie , and Mark Twain , opposed these ideas .
In October , representatives from Spain and the United States sat down in Paris to work out a treaty .
President McKinley appointed a " peace commission " to represent the United States .
A majority of the commission 's members believed in expansionism .
No representatives from the colonies whose fates were being decided attended the Paris conference .
The Spanish delegates assumed that the United States would annex Cuba .
They suggested that the United States also take over Cuba 's $ 400 million debt .
The Americans declined .
After all , the war had been fought in support of Cuban independence .
However , they were glad to accept Puerto Rico , Guam , and the Philippines .
The American army already controlled the city of Manila , but it had not ventured into any other areas of the Philippine Islands .
After signing the treaty , President McKinley ordered the War Department to bring all the islands under military control .
The people of the Philippines , he decided , were too " uncivilized " to govern themselves .
The Filipinos were shocked .
For two years they 'd been fighting for their independence from Spain .
Since the United States had supported rebels in Cuba and Hawaii , they expected support for their independence as well .
Commodore Dewey wrote to his superiors and pointed out that the Filipinos seemed better prepared for self - government than the Cubans did .
The War Department responded by sending more men and equipment to Manila .
Emilio Aguinaldo , the wiry leader of the Filipino independence movement , felt betrayed .
Aguinaldo admired the United States .
He liked to be called " the George Washington of the Philippines . "
He had helped the Americans fight the Spanish .
Now the Americans and the Spanish residents of the islands were fighting him .
Aguinaldo led his bitter troops into the jungles , and for three years they fought a brutal war against the military government .
In the end the overwhelming power of the American forces defeated them .
The Americans confined many Filipinos in concentration camps like the ones the Spanish had used in Cuba .
William Howard
Taft was appointed head of the Philippine Commission , charged with replacing the military government with a civilian legislature .
Despite the plan to prepare the Philippines for independence , however , Americans continued to rule the islands until after World War II .
The war in the Philippines claimed four times as many American lives as the war with Spain did .
Few Americans , however , rejoiced at the victory .
There were no heroes .
No parades greeted the returning troops .
For many , this war seemed to contradict some basic American values .
" I have been criticized a good deal about the Philippines , " McKinley said , " but I do n't deserve it .
The truth is . . . they came to us as a gift from the gods . "
" Congratulations , " Andrew Carnegie wrote to a leading expansionist .
" You seem to have about finished your work of civilizing the Filipinos .
It is thought that about eight thousand of them have been completely civilized and sent to heaven .
I hope you like it . "

The Boxer Rebellion
Spheres of Influence
Throughout the nineteenth century , China 's emperors had watched as foreigners encroached further and further upon their land .
Time and again , foreigners forced China to make humiliating concessions .
Foreign regiments , armed with modern weapons , consistently defeated entire imperial armies .
Now , as a new century was about to begin , Cixi , empress dowager of the Qing Dynasty , searched for a way to rid her empire of foreign parasites .
Austria , France , Germany , Great Britain , Italy , Japan , and Russia all claimed exclusive trading rights to certain parts of China .
They were dividing China into " spheres of influence . "
Some even claimed to own the territory within their spheres .
By acquiring the Philippines , the United States became an Asian power too .
Now , with a strong base of operations just 400 miles from China , American businesses hoped to take advantage of China 's vast resources .
The foreign spheres of influence , however , threatened their ambitions .
So while the empress was hoping to close China to foreigners , Americans were looking for a way in .
John Hay , now Secretary of State , had an idea .
Since public opinion , strained by the Philippines war , would never support the use of force , he decided to negotiate .
He sent letters to all the foreign powers and suggested an " Open Door " policy in China .
This policy would guarantee equal trading rights for all and prevent one nation from discriminating against another within its sphere .
The nations replied that they liked the concept of the Open Door , but that they could not support or enforce it .
Hay 's plan had been politely rejected .
Nevertheless
Hay announced that since all of the powers had accepted the Open Door in principle , the United States considered their agreement " final and definitive . "

Fists of Righteous Harmony
While the outside powers bickered over who would control China , Cixi issued an imperial message to all the Chinese provinces .
The present situation is becoming daily more difficult .
The various Powers cast upon us looks of tiger - like voracity , hustling each other to be first to seize our innermost territories .
. . .
Should the strong enemies become aggressive and press us to consent to things we can never accept , we have no alternative but to rely upon the justice of our cause .
. . .
If our . . . hundreds of millions of inhabitants . . . would prove their loyalty to their emperor and love of their country , what is there to fear from any invader ?
Let us not think about making peace .
In northern Shandong province , a devastating drought was pushing people to the edge of starvation .
Few people there were thinking about making peace .
A secret society , known as the Fists of Righteous Harmony , attracted thousands of followers .
Foreigners called members of this society " Boxers " because they practiced martial arts .
The Boxers also believed that they had a magical power , and that foreign bullets could not harm them .
Millions of " spirit soldiers , " they said , would soon rise from the dead and join their cause .
Their cause , at first , was to overthrow the imperial Qing government and expel all " foreign devils " from China .
The crafty empress , however , saw a way to use the Boxers .
Through her ministers , she began to encourage the Boxers .
Soon a new slogan — " Support the Qing , destroy the foreigners ! ” — appeared upon the Boxers ' banner .
In the early months of 1900 , thousands of Boxers roamed the countryside .
They attacked Christian missions , slaughtering foreign missionaries and Chinese converts .
Then they moved toward the cities , attracting more and more followers as they came .
Nervous foreign ministers insisted that the Chinese government stop the Boxers .
From inside the Forbidden City , the empress told the diplomats that her troops would soon crush the " rebellion . "
Meanwhile , she did nothing as the Boxers entered the capital .
Foreign diplomats , their families , and staff lived in a compound just outside the Forbidden City 's walls in the heart of Beijing .
Working together , they threw up hasty defenses , and with a small force of military personnel , they faced the Boxer onslaught .
One American described the scene as 20,000 Boxers
advanced in a solid mass and carried standards of red and white cloth .
Their yells were deafening , while the roar of gongs , drums and horns sounded like thunder .
. . .
They waved their swords and stamped on the ground with their feet .
They wore red turbans , sashes , and garters over blue cloth .
[ When ] they were only twenty yards from our gate , . . . three volleys from the rifles of our sailors left more than fifty dead upon the ground .
The Boxers fell back but soon returned .
Surrounded , the foreigners could neither escape nor send for help .
For almost two months , they withstood fierce attacks and bombardment .
Things began to look hopeless .
Seventy - six defenders lay dead , and many more were wounded .
Ammunition , food , and medical supplies were almost gone .
Then , shortly before dawn , loud explosions rocked the city .
Weary defenders staggered to the barricades , expecting a final , overpowering Boxer attack .
But as a column of armed men approached them , they began to cheer .
Help had arrived at last .
After a month of no news from their diplomats , the foreign powers had grown worried .
They assembled an international relief force of soldiers and sailors from eight countries .
The United States , eager to rescue its ministers and to assert its presence in China , sent a contingent of 2,500 sailors and marines .
After rescuing another besieged delegation in Tientsin , the international force marched to Beijing , fighting Boxers and imperial soldiers along the way .
The international troops looted the capital and even ransacked the Forbidden City .
Disguised as a peasant , the empress dowager escaped the city in a cart .
She returned to the Forbidden City a year later , but the power of the Qing dynasty was destroyed forever .
Because it had participated in the campaign , the United States participated in the settlement that followed .
Hay called for an expanded " Open Door , " not only within the spheres of influence , but in all parts of China .
He also recommended that the powers preserve China 's territory and its government .
Other powers agreed , and the Open Door policy allowed foreign access to China 's market until World War II closed it once again .

The Panama Canal
President Roosevelt
The popular acclaim that carried Teddy Roosevelt to the governorship of New York did n't stop there .
In 1900 , Republicans nominated Teddy as President McKinley 's running mate .
McKinley won a second term , and Teddy was sworn in as vice - president .
Six months later , an assassin 's bullet killed McKinley .
At age 42 , Theodore Roosevelt became the nation 's youngest president .
Roosevelt assumed the office with the same vigor with which he charged up Kettle Hill .
A long believer in Captain Mahan 's theory of sea power , Roosevelt began to revitalize the navy .
Now that America 's empire stretched from the Caribbean across the Pacific , the old idea of a canal between the two oceans took on new urgency .
Mahan had predicted that " the canal will become a strategic center of the most vital importance , " and Teddy agreed .
" The canal , " Roosevelt said , " was by far the most important action I took in foreign affairs during the time I was President .
When nobody could or would exercise efficient authority , I exercised it . "

Joining the Waters
In 1878 Ferdinand de Lesseps , the French engineer who built the Suez Canal , began to dig a canal across the Isthmus of Panama , which was then part of Colombia .
Tropical disease and engineering problems halted construction on the canal , but a French business ( the New Panama Canal Company ) still held the rights to the project .
Roosevelt agreed to pay $ 40 million for the rights , and he began to negotiate with Colombia for control of the land .
He offered $ 10 million for a fifty - mile strip across the isthmus .
Colombia refused .
" We were dealing with a government of irresponsible bandits , " Roosevelt stormed .
" I was prepared to . . . at once occupy the Isthmus anyhow , and proceed to dig the canal .
But I deemed it likely that there would be a revolution in Panama soon . "
Teddy was right .
The chief engineer of the New Panama Canal Company organized a local revolt .
Roosevelt immediately sent the battleship Nashville and a detachment of marines to Panama to support the new government .
The rebels gladly accepted Roosevelt 's $ 10 million offer , and they gave the United States complete control of a ten - mile wide canal zone .
Roosevelt ordered army engineers to start digging .
Thousands of workers sweated in the malarial heat .
They tore up jungles and cut down mountains .
Insects thrived in muddy , stagnant pools .
" Mosquitoes get so thick you get a mouthful with every breath , " a worker complained .
The mosquitoes also carried yellow fever , and many fell victim to the deadly disease before Dr. William Gorgas found a way to stop it .
Some Americans did not approve of Roosevelt 's behavior .
" There was much accusation about my having acted in an ' unconstitutional ' manner , " Teddy shrugged .
" I took the isthmus , started the canal , and then left Congress — not to debate the canal , but to debate me .
. . .
While the debate goes on , the canal does too ; and they are welcome to debate me as long as they wish , provided that we can go on with the canal . "
Work did go on .
Despite lethal landslides , workers with dynamite and clumsy steam shovels cut their way across a continent .
They built a railroad , three sets of concrete locks , and a huge artificial lake .
Nine years later the freighter Ancon entered the new channel .
Hundreds of construction workers hopped aboard for the historic ride .
A shiny towing locomotive pulled the Ancon into the first lock .
Bands played and crowds cheered as the ship slipped into the Pacific .
Roosevelt liked to repeat an old African saying : " Speak softly , and carry a big stick .
You will go far . "
In Panama , Teddy proved to the world that he was willing to use his big navy as a stick to further American interests .

U.S. Intervention in Latin America
Teddy 's Legacy
Between the end of the Spanish - American War and the dawn of the Great Depression , the United States sent troops to Latin American countries thirty - two times .
It used the Roosevelt Corollary , or addition , to the Monroe Doctrine to justify intervention .
In the corollary , Teddy Roosevelt proclaimed that the United States , because it was a " civilized nation , " had the right to stop " chronic wrongdoing " throughout the Western Hemisphere .
" Any country whose people conduct themselves well can count upon our hearty friendship , " he said .
" Chronic wrongdoing , however , . . . may force the United States to exercise an international police power . "
Teddy did n't hesitate to use this " police power " to strengthen his country , but he was always careful not to upset the balance of world power .
William Howard Taft , former governor of the Philippines , followed Roosevelt into the White House .
Taft believed in economic expansion , and he introduced a policy called " dollar diplomacy . "
This policy used diplomacy to advance and protect American businesses in other countries .
Taft employed Roosevelt 's corollary in Nicaragua and other Latin American countries to protect American investments .
American businesses had been active in Nicaragua since the 1850s .
The lush country attracted American fruit growers and mining companies .
Others believed that Nicaragua offered the best site for a canal , and they invested in land .
Cornelius Vanderbilt started a company that transported passengers between New York and San Francisco via the Nicaraguan jungle .
Shortly after Commodore Perry opened Japan , Vanderbilt plotted to take control of Nicaragua .
With Vanderbilt 's help , a young adventurer named William Walker set out with fifty - seven followers to conquer Nicaragua .
A short , freckled man with sharp green eyes , Walker formed an alliance with a group of local rebels and defeated the Nicaraguan forces .
He proclaimed himself " commander in chief , " and soon thousands of Americans rushed into the country .
Many Americans wanted the United States to assume direct control of Nicaragua .
The government , however , was afraid to upset the fragile balance between " free " and " slave " territories .
Walker eventually quarreled with Vanderbilt about the transit company , and soon another revolution drove him from power .
In 1860 Walker died before a firing squad .
American economic involvement in Nicaragua lived on .
Nicaraguans confidently expected the canal , and they gladly accepted loans and payments based on its eventual construction .
By 1909 the United States - Nicaraguan Concession was largest American company in Nicaragua .
That year the Concession 's chief legal counsel , Philander C. Knox , resigned to become Taft 's Secretary of State .
When Nicaragua 's ruler cancelled an agreement with one American business and threatened the Concession , the company organized another revolution .
Adolfo Diaz , a Concession employee , became the new president .
Taft quickly recognized the Diaz government .
When still another revolt threatened Diaz , Taft invoked the corollary and ordered American marines to suppress the rebellion .
Then he and Knox worked out a plan to collect the money that Nicaragua owed to foreign investors .
Under the plan , American banks took control of Nicaragua 's customs collection .
They applied the money they collected directly to the country 's debt .
The marines remained in Nicaragua 's capital to serve as " international police " and prevent any further revolts .
Except for a short period in 1925 , they stayed for 21 years .

The End of an Era
The two decades that sandwiched the turning of the century enclosed a turning point in American history .
Despite George Washington 's advice to the contrary , the years saw American interests scatter across the globe .
America had flexed its muscles , and the world had cowered .
But the ease with which America gained its new possessions obscured the responsibilities that came with them .
Dollar diplomacy would soon drag a reluctant America into the muddy trenches of the Western Front .
The " Open Door " welcomed a series of squabbles that later erupted in a mushroom cloud .
But few in that innocent era could foresee such extraordinary events .
Most believed that America was simply following its natural order , its destiny .
NEW YORK ( CNN / Money ) - Crude oil prices rose above $ 30 a barrel Tuesday , hitting a 18 - month high , amid worries that a war in Iraq will disrupt the supply .
At the New York Mercantile Exchange , crude oil for September delivery rose as high as $ 30.32 , the highest price since February 2001 , before closing at $ 30.11 , up 27 cents on the day .
The Bush administration has been considering an attack on the Middle Eastern nation , which is thought to be harboring weapons of mass destruction .
" Without the threat of war priced into oil , crude would be trading in the low $ 20s , " said Jack Aydin , oil analyst with McDonald Investments .
The gain in oil prices comes despite a comment by Kuwait 's oil minister that the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries was ready to increase crude supplies to world markets if the United States decided to go ahead with a military strike on Iraq .
Most oil stocks fell , including Exxon - Mobil ( XOM : Research , Estimates ) , the No 1 producer .
" Oil seems to be disappearing from the marketplace and my theory is that the U.S. is adding to its strategic oil reserves with the intention of releasing it during an attack on Iraq , " Phil Flynn , energy analyst with Alaron.com , told CNNfn 's MoneyMorning .
The White House denied Monday that it is stockpiling oil for action against Iraq .
" The reserves are meant for times of emergency , " White House press secretary Ari Fleischer said , adding that President Bush had no plans to tap into the nation 's emergency reserves .
Adding to the tensions in the Middle East , U.S. and British fighter jets bombed an air defense command and control facility about 120 miles southeast of Baghdad early Tuesday morning , according to the U.S. Central Command .
It was the third Western raid against Iraqi targets within a week , following a strike against a mobile radar unit Saturday and strikes by U.S. and British planes against targets in southern Iraq last Wednesday .

Congress Switchboard : 202-224-3121
" Kall 's Bottom - up explores refreshing yet timeless ways of seeing and ways of thinking about economics , knowledge and wisdom .
He presents his message , that decentralized , local and small are both good and healthy in business and economics , in a model that makes sense and offers practical solutions . "
Amar Bhide , professor of Economics , Tufts University , former editor , Capitalism and Society , author , The Venturesome Economy : How Innovation Sustains Prosperity in a More Connected World
Seventy - seven thousand years ago , a craftsman sat in a cave in a limestone cliff overlooking the rocky coast of what is now the Indian Ocean .
It was a beautiful spot , a workshop with a glorious natural picture window , cooled by a sea breeze in summer , warmed by a small fire in winter .
The sandy cliff top above was covered with a white - flowering shrub that one distant day would be known as blombos and give this place the name Blombos Cave .
The man picked up a piece of reddish brown stone about three inches long that he — or she , no one knows — had polished .
With a stone point , he etched a geometric design in the flat surface — simple crosshatchings framed by two parallel lines with a third line down the middle .
Today the stone offers no clue to its original purpose .
It could have been a religious object , an ornament or just an ancient doodle .
But to see it is to immediately recognize it as something only a person could have made .
Carving the stone was a very human thing to do .
The scratchings on this piece of red ocher mudstone are the oldest known example of an intricate design made by a human being .
The ability to create and communicate using such symbols , says Christopher Henshilwood , leader of the team that discovered the stone , is " an unambiguous marker " of modern humans , one of the characteristics that separate us from any other species , living or extinct .
Henshilwood , an archaeologist at Norway 's University of Bergen and the University of the Witwatersrand , in South Africa , found the carving on land owned by his grandfather , near the southern tip of the African continent .
Over the years , he had identified and excavated nine sites on the property , none more than 6,500 years old , and was not at first interested in this cliffside cave a few miles from the South African town of Still Bay .
What he would find there , however , would change the way scientists think about the evolution of modern humans and the factors that triggered perhaps the most important event in human prehistory , when Homo sapiens left their African homeland to colonize the world .
This great migration brought our species to a position of world dominance that it has never relinquished and signaled the extinction of whatever competitors remained —
Neanderthals in Europe and Asia , some scattered pockets of Homo erectus in the Far East and , if scholars ultimately decide they are in fact a separate species , some diminutive people from the Indonesian island of Flores ( see " Were ' Hobbits ' Human ? " ) .
When the migration was complete , Homo sapiens was the last — and only — man standing .
Even today researchers argue about what separates modern humans from other , extinct hominids .
Generally speaking , moderns tend to be a slimmer , taller breed : " gracile , " in scientific parlance , rather than " robust , " like the heavy - boned Neanderthals , their contemporaries for perhaps 15,000 years in ice age Eurasia .
The modern and Neanderthal brains were about the same size , but their skulls were shaped differently : the newcomers ' skulls were flatter in back than the Neanderthals ' , and they had prominent jaws and a straight forehead without heavy brow ridges .
Lighter bodies may have meant that modern humans needed less food , giving them a competitive advantage during hard times .
The moderns ' behaviors were also different .
Neanderthals made tools , but they worked with chunky flakes struck from large stones .
Modern humans ' stone tools and weapons usually featured elongated , standardized , finely crafted blades .
Both species hunted and killed the same large mammals , including deer , horses , bison and wild cattle .
But moderns ' sophisticated weaponry , such as throwing spears with a variety of carefully wrought stone , bone and antler tips , made them more successful .
And the tools may have kept them relatively safe ; fossil evidence shows Neanderthals suffered grievous injuries , such as gorings and bone breaks , probably from hunting at close quarters with short , stone - tipped pikes and stabbing spears .
Both species had rituals — Neanderthals buried their dead — and both made ornaments and jewelry .
But the moderns produced their artifacts with a frequency and expertise that Neanderthals never matched .
And Neanderthals , as far as we know , had nothing like the etching at Blombos Cave , let alone the bone carvings , ivory flutes and , ultimately , the mesmerizing cave paintings and rock art that modern humans left as snapshots of their world .
When the study of human origins intensified in the 20th century , two main theories emerged to explain the archaeological and fossil record : one , known as the multi-regional hypothesis , suggested that a species of human ancestor dispersed throughout the globe , and modern humans evolved from this predecessor in several different locations .
The other , out - of - Africa theory , held that modern humans evolved in Africa for many thousands of years before they spread throughout the rest of the world .
In the 1980s , new tools completely changed the kinds of questions that scientists could answer about the past .
By analyzing DNA in living human populations , geneticists could trace lineages backward in time .
These analyses have provided key support for the out - of - Africa theory .
Homo sapiens , this new evidence has repeatedly shown , evolved in Africa , probably around 200,000 years ago .
The first DNA studies of human evolution did n't use the DNA in a cell 's nucleus — chromosomes inherited from both father and mother — but a shorter strand of DNA contained in the mitochondria , which are energy - producing structures inside most cells .
Mitochondrial DNA is inherited only from the mother .
Conveniently for scientists , mitochondrial DNA has a relatively high mutation rate , and mutations are carried along in subsequent generations .
By comparing mutations in mitochondrial DNA among today 's populations , and making assumptions about how frequently they occurred , scientists can walk the genetic code backward through generations , combining lineages in ever larger , earlier branches until they reach the evolutionary trunk .
At that point in human history , which scientists have calculated to be about 200,000 years ago , a woman existed whose mitochondrial DNA was the source of the mitochondrial DNA in every person alive today .
That is , all of us are her descendants .
Scientists call her " Eve . "
This is something of a misnomer , for Eve was neither the first modern human nor the only woman alive 200,000 years ago .
But she did live at a time when the modern human population was small — about 10,000 people , according to one estimate .
She is the only woman from that time to have an unbroken lineage of daughters , though she is neither our only ancestor nor our oldest ancestor .
She is , instead , simply our " most recent common ancestor , " at least when it comes to mitochondria .
And Eve , mitochondrial DNA backtracking showed , lived in Africa .
Subsequent , more sophisticated analyses using DNA from the nucleus of cells have confirmed these findings , most recently in a study this year comparing nuclear DNA from 938 people from 51 parts of the world .
This research , the most comprehensive to date , traced our common ancestor to Africa and clarified the ancestries of several populations in Europe and the Middle East .
While DNA studies have revolutionized the field of paleoanthropology , the story " is not as straightforward as people think , " says University of Pennsylvania geneticist Sarah A. Tishkoff .
If the rates of mutation , which are largely inferred , are not accurate , the migration timetable could be off by thousands of years .
To piece together humankind 's great migration , scientists blend DNA analysis with archaeological and fossil evidence to try to create a coherent whole — no easy task .
A disproportionate number of artifacts and fossils are from Europe — where researchers have been finding sites for well over 100 years — but there are huge gaps elsewhere .
" Outside the Near East there is almost nothing from Asia , maybe ten dots you could put on a map , " says Texas A&M University anthropologist Ted Goebel .
As the gaps are filled , the story is likely to change , but in broad outline , today 's scientists believe that from their beginnings in Africa , the modern humans went first to Asia between 80,000 and 60,000 years ago .
By 45,000 years ago , or possibly earlier , they had settled Indonesia , Papua New Guinea and Australia .
The moderns entered Europe around 40,000 years ago , probably via two routes : from Turkey along the Danube corridor into eastern Europe , and along the Mediterranean coast .
By 35,000 years ago , they were firmly established in most of the Old World .
The Neanderthals , forced into mountain strongholds in Croatia , the Iberian Peninsula , the Crimea and elsewhere , would become extinct 25,000 years ago .
Finally , around 15,000 years ago , humans crossed from Asia to North America and from there to South America .
Africa is relatively rich in the fossils of human ancestors who lived millions of years ago ( see timeline , opposite ) .
Lush , tropical lake country at the dawn of human evolution provided one congenial living habitat for such hominids as Australopithecus afarensis .
Many such places are dry today , which makes for a congenial exploration habitat for paleontologists .
Wind erosion exposes old bones that were covered in muck millions of years ago .
Remains of early Homo sapiens , by contrast , are rare , not only in Africa , but also in Europe .
One suspicion is that the early moderns on both continents did not — in contrast to Neanderthals — bury their dead , but either cremated them or left them to decompose in the open .
In 2003 , a team of anthropologists reported the discovery of three unusual skulls — two adults and a child — at Herto , near the site of an ancient freshwater lake in northeast Ethiopia .
The skulls were between 154,000 and 160,000 years old and had modern characteristics , but with some archaic features .
" Even now I 'm a little hesitant to call them anatomically modern , " says team leader Tim White , from the University of California at Berkeley .
" These are big , robust people , who have n't quite evolved into modern humans .
Yet they are so close you would n't want to give them a different species name . "
The Herto skulls fit with the DNA analysis suggesting that modern humans evolved some 200,000 years ago .
But they also raised questions .
There were no other skeletal remains at the site ( although there was evidence of butchered hippopotamuses ) , and all three skulls , which were nearly complete except for jawbones , showed cut marks — signs of scraping with stone tools .
It appeared that the skulls had been deliberately detached from their skeletons and defleshed .
In fact , part of the child 's skull was highly polished .
" It is hard to argue that this is not some kind of mortuary ritual , " White says .
Even more provocative were discoveries reported last year .
In a cave at Pinnacle Point in South Africa , a team led by Arizona State University paleoanthropologist Curtis Marean found evidence that humans 164,000 years ago were eating shellfish , making complex tools and using red ocher pigment — all modern human behaviors .
The shellfish remains — of mussels , periwinkles , barnacles and other mollusks — indicated that humans were exploiting the sea as a food source at least 40,000 years earlier than previously thought .
The first archaeological evidence of a human migration out of Africa was found in the caves of Qafzeh and Skhul , in present - day Israel .
These sites , initially discovered in the 1930s , contained the remains of at least 11 modern humans .
Most appeared to have been ritually buried .
Artifacts at the site , however , were simple : hand axes and other Neanderthal - style tools .
At first , the skeletons were thought to be 50,000 years old — modern humans who had settled in the Levant on their way to Europe .
But in 1989 , new dating techniques showed them to be 90,000 to 100,000 years old , the oldest modern human remains ever found outside Africa .
But this excursion appears to be a dead end : there is no evidence that these moderns survived for long , much less went on to colonize any other parts of the globe .
They are therefore not considered to be a part of the migration that followed 10,000 or 20,000 years later .
Intriguingly , 70,000 - year - old Neanderthal remains have been found in the same region .
The moderns , it would appear , arrived first , only to move on , die off because of disease or natural catastrophe or — possibly — get wiped out .
If they shared territory with Neanderthals , the more " robust " species may have outcompeted them here .
" You may be anatomically modern and display modern behaviors , " says paleoanthropologist Nicholas J. Conard of Germany 's University of Tübingen , " but apparently it was n't enough .
At that point the two species are on pretty equal footing . "
It was also at this point in history , scientists concluded , that the Africans ceded Asia to the Neanderthals .
Then , about 80,000 years ago , says Blombos archaeologist Henshilwood , modern humans entered a " dynamic period " of innovation .
The evidence comes from such South African cave sites as Blombos , Klasies River , Diepkloof and Sibudu .
In addition to the ocher carving , the Blombos Cave yielded perforated ornamental shell beads — among the world 's first known jewelry .
Pieces of inscribed ostrich eggshell turned up at Diepkloof .
Hafted points at Sibudu and elsewhere hint that the moderns of southern Africa used throwing spears and arrows .
Fine - grained stone needed for careful workmanship had been transported from up to 18 miles away , which suggests they had some sort of trade .
Bones at several South African sites showed that humans were killing eland , springbok and even seals .
At Klasies River , traces of burned vegetation suggest that the ancient hunter - gatherers may have figured out that by clearing land , they could encourage quicker growth of edible roots and tubers .
The sophisticated bone tool and stoneworking technologies at these sites were all from roughly the same time period — between 75,000 and 55,000 years ago .
Virtually all of these sites had piles of seashells .
Together with the much older evidence from the cave at Pinnacle Point , the shells suggest that seafood may have served as a nutritional trigger at a crucial point in human history , providing the fatty acids that modern humans needed to fuel their outsize brains :
" This is the evolutionary driving force , " says University of Cape Town archaeologist John Parkington .
" It is sucking people into being more cognitively aware , faster - wired , faster - brained , smarter . "
Stanford University paleoanthropologist Richard Klein has long argued that a genetic mutation at roughly this point in human history provoked a sudden increase in brainpower , perhaps linked to the onset of speech .
Did new technology , improved nutrition or some genetic mutation allow modern humans to explore the world ?
Possibly , but other scholars point to more mundane factors that may have contributed to the exodus from Africa .
A recent DNA study suggests that massive droughts before the great migration split Africa 's modern human population into small , isolated groups and may have even threatened their extinction .
Only after the weather improved were the survivors able to reunite , multiply and , in the end , emigrate .
Improvements in technology may have helped some of them set out for new territory .
Or cold snaps may have lowered sea level and opened new land bridges .
Whatever the reason , the ancient Africans reached a watershed .
They were ready to leave , and they did .
DNA evidence suggests the original exodus involved anywhere from 1,000 to 50,000 people .
Scientists do not agree on the time of the departure — sometime more recently than 80,000 years ago — or the departure point , but most now appear to be leaning away from the Sinai , once the favored location , and toward a land bridge crossing what today is the Bab el Mandeb Strait separating Djibouti from the Arabian Peninsula at the southern end of the Red Sea .
From there , the thinking goes , migrants could have followed a southern route eastward along the coast of the Indian Ocean .
" It could have been almost accidental , " Henshilwood says , a path of least resistance that did not require adaptations to different climates , topographies or diet .
The migrants ' path never veered far from the sea , departed from warm weather or failed to provide familiar food , such as shellfish and tropical fruit .
Tools found at Jwalapuram , a 74,000 - year - old site in southern India , match those used in Africa from the same period .
Anthropologist Michael Petraglia of the University of Cambridge , who led the dig , says that although no human fossils have been found to confirm the presence of modern humans at Jwalapuram , the tools suggest it is the earliest known settlement of modern humans outside of Africa except for the dead enders at Israel 's Qafzeh and Skhul sites .
And that 's about all the physical evidence there is for tracking the migrants ' early progress across Asia .
To the south , the fossil and archaeological record is clearer and shows that modern humans reached Australia and Papua New Guinea — then part of the same landmass — at least 45,000 years ago , and maybe much earlier .
But curiously , the early down under colonists apparently did not make sophisticated tools , relying instead on simple Neanderthal - style flaked stones and scrapers .
They had few ornaments and little long - distance trade , and left scant evidence that they hunted large marsupial mammals in their new homeland .
Of course , they may have used sophisticated wood or bamboo tools that have decayed .
But University of Utah anthropologist James F. O'Connell offers another explanation : the early settlers did not bother with sophisticated technologies because they did not need them .
That these people were " modern " and innovative is clear : getting to New Guinea - Australia from the mainland required at least one sea voyage of more than 45 miles , an astounding achievement .
But once in place , the colonists faced few pressures to innovate or adapt new technologies .
In particular , O'Connell notes , there were few people , no shortage of food and no need to compete with an indigenous population like Europe 's Neanderthals .
Modern humans eventually made their first forays into Europe only about 40,000 years ago , presumably delayed by relatively cold and inhospitable weather and a less than welcoming Neanderthal population .
The conquest of the continent — if that is what it was — is thought to have lasted about 15,000 years , as the last pockets of Neanderthals dwindled to extinction .
The European penetration is widely regarded as the decisive event of the great migration , eliminating as it did our last rivals and enabling the moderns to survive there uncontested .
Did modern humans wipe out the competition , absorb them through interbreeding , outthink them or simply stand by while climate , dwindling resources , an epidemic or some other natural phenomenon did the job ?
Perhaps all of the above .
Archaeologists have found little direct evidence of confrontation between the two peoples .
Skeletal evidence of possible interbreeding is sparse , contentious and inconclusive .
And while interbreeding may well have taken place , recent DNA studies have failed to show any consistent genetic relationship between modern humans and Neanderthals .
" You are always looking for a neat answer , but my feeling is that you should use your imagination , " says Harvard University archaeologist Ofer Bar - Yosef .
" There may have been positive interaction with the diffusion of technology from one group to the other .
Or the modern humans could have killed off the Neanderthals .
Or the Neanderthals could have just died out .
Instead of subscribing to one hypothesis or two , I see a composite . "
Modern humans ' next conquest was the New World , which they reached by the Bering Land Bridge — or possibly by boat — at least 15,000 years ago .
Some of the oldest unambiguous evidence of humans in the New World is human DNA extracted from coprolites — fossilized feces — found in Oregon and recently carbon dated to 14,300 years ago .
For many years paleontologists still had one gap in their story of how humans conquered the world .
They had no human fossils from sub-Saharan Africa from between 15,000 and 70,000 years ago .
Because the epoch of the great migration was a blank slate , they could not say for sure that the modern humans who invaded Europe were functionally identical to those who stayed behind in Africa .
But one day in 1999 , anthropologist Alan Morris of South Africa 's University of Cape Town showed Frederick Grine , a visiting colleague from Stony Brook University , an unusual - looking skull on his bookcase .
Morris told Grine that the skull had been discovered in the 1950s at Hofmeyr , in South Africa .
No other bones had been found near it , and its original resting place had been befouled by river sediment .
Any archaeological evidence from the site had been destroyed — the skull was a seemingly useless artifact .
But Grine noticed that the braincase was filled with a carbonate sand matrix .
Using a technique unavailable in the 1950s , Grine , Morris and an Oxford University - led team of analysts measured radioactive particles in the matrix .
The skull , they learned , was 36,000 years old .
Comparing it with skulls from Neanderthals , early modern Europeans and contemporary humans , they discovered it had nothing in common with Neanderthal skulls and only peripheral similarities with any of today 's populations .
But it matched the early Europeans elegantly .
The evidence was clear .
Thirty - six thousand years ago , says Morris , before the world 's human population differentiated into the mishmash of races and ethnicities that exist today , " We were all Africans . "

( CNN ) -- Sen. Barack Obama said Saturday that he has resigned from the church where controversial sermons by his former pastor and other ministers created political headaches for his campaign .
" We do n't want to have to answer for everything that 's stated in the church , " the Democratic front - runner said .
" We also do n't want the church subjected to the scrutiny that a presidential campaign legitimately undergoes . "
Obama said he was resigning " with some sadness . "
" This is not a decision I come to lightly , " he said .
Watch Obama discuss departure »
The resignation comes days after the Rev. Michael Pfleger , a visiting Catholic priest , mocked Obama 's Democratic rival during a sermon at Trinity United Church of Christ in Chicago , Illinois .
In the sermon , Pfleger wipes his eyes with a handkerchief and suggests that Sen.
Hillary Clinton wept because she thought that as a white person and the wife of a former president , she was entitled to the presidency .
Pfleger is a Catholic priest at St. Sabina Roman Catholic Church on Chicago 's southwest side .
He is also a friend of Trinity 's former pastor , the Rev. Jeremiah Wright , from whom Obama distanced himself in April .
Watch Pfleger mock Clinton »
Obama said the Pfleger controversy made it clear that , as long as he remained a member of the Trinity congregation , remarks from the pulpit would be " imputed " to him , even if they conflicted with his personal views .
Do n't Miss Priest apologizes for mocking Clinton
Obama said he and his wife , Michelle , began discussing a departure from the church after Wright spoke at the National Press Club on April 28 .
During the appearance , Wright said that Obama had " distanced " himself the fiery pastor for political reasons .
Wright , Obama 's minister for about 20 years , drew unwanted attention for the campaign when videos of his fiery sermons surfaced .
In the speeches , Wright suggested that the U.S. government may be responsible for the spread of AIDS in the black community and equated some American wartime activities to terrorism .
Obama has said he was not present for the controversial sermons by Wright or Pfleger .
His campaign condemned Pfleger 's comments .
" That is why I am deeply disappointed in Father Pfleger 's divisive , backward - looking rhetoric , which does n't reflect the country I see or the desire of people across America to come together in common cause , " he said in a statement Thursday .
Obama said he and his wife had discussed and prayed on the issue with Trinity 's senior pastor , the Rev. Otis Moss , and hoped that the decision would withdraw Trinity from the spotlight .
" Though we are saddened by the news , we understand that it is a personal decision , " Moss said in a statement Saturday .
" We will continue to lift them in prayer and wish them the best as former members of our Trinity community , "
Some Obama supporters , including U.S. Rep. Robert Wexler of Florida , said that disconnecting from the church signaled a chance for the campaign to move on .
" I think it bodes well for us in the general election that we can put whatever issues there were behind us in respect to the church , " Wexler said .

A DOZEN years have passed since David Isenberg , then a distinguished engineer at AT&T Labs , wrote his seminal essay “ The Rise of the Stupid Network ” .
In it , he outlined how a new philosophy and architecture were changing the communications business , and pointed to some of the cataclysms ahead .
Far from being a scarce resource used intermittently , Dr Isenberg argued that future networks would be “ always on ” , with their intelligence located in the end - user 's equipment rather than within the network itself .
They would make no fancy routing or traffic - management decisions ; they would just “ deliver the bits ” .
Unlike the telephone circuits of the day , which used their built - in smarts to determine where messages were to be delivered , the data would tell the network where they wanted to go .
In short , the data would be boss .

Uncloggable artery ?
The stupid network Dr Isenberg had in mind was , of course , the internet we know today .
Central to his vision was the radical notion that end - users — or customers — would be free to do as they pleased , and the network would make no assumptions about the kind or content of data being transmitted .
The engineering community applauded the idea .
The phone companies ( AT&T especially ) thought it stank .
And Dr Isenberg wound up working for himself .
Dr Isenberg will likely be watching this week 's deliberations by the Federal Communications Commission ( FCC ) with interest .
As your correspondent was scribbling away , the FCC was preparing for its second hearing on network - management practices .
The meeting , held at Stanford University on April 17th , concerns whether internet service providers ( ISPs ) should be allowed to shape , filter or even block content travelling over their networks .
The hearing stems from a complaint filed last autumn alleging that Comcast , America 's largest cable - TV company and one of its biggest ISPs , was blocking a perfectly legal file - sharing program called BitTorrent .
Ever since , Comcast has been scrambling to prevent the FCC from rewriting its rules about peer - to - peer ( P2P ) software like BitTorrent , which is widely used to download video and other large multimedia files .
Comcast argues that throttling P2P traffic is justified because it 's swamping its network .
Unlike conventional networks , where central servers dish out files to peripheral client computers , a P2P network is an ad hoc collection of individual computers all acting as servers and clients simultaneously , sharing bits of a large file between themselves until each has a complete copy and leaves the party .
All very friendly and helpful , save for one thing .
By definition , the peers are all on the periphery of the network — in users ' homes and offices at the end of the so - called “ last mile ” .
That 's where bandwidth is hugely asymmetric — being designed almost exclusively for downloading files , not uploading them as well .
For instance , the maximum upload - speed of AT&T 's premium 6 mbps ( megabit per second ) service dawdles at 768 kbps ( kilobits per second ) .
P2P presented no problem before the web , when it was used for sharing articles on Usenet .
Then Napster , Kazaa and Gnutella came along and changed everything .
And not just because of the popularity of such file - sharing programs with music fans .
The sizes of the files they handled increased dramatically .
Music tracks and podcasts used to be offered for streaming at 128 kbps ; versions at 256 kbps or even 320 kbps are now common .
Video has an impact , too .
Though online video - rental and distribution has only recently begun in earnest , all those HDTV sets sold over the past few years will shortly make high - definition downloads the norm .
Meanwhile , waiting in the wings is “ 4k video ” , which promises four times the resolution of today 's HDTV , and needs a whopping 6gbps ( gigabits per second ) to fill the screen .
Once again , alarmists are issuing dire warnings about the internet collapsing under the weight of its traffic .
But that 's nothing new : they 've been doing so since the 1990s .
Bob Metcalfe , who invented the Ethernet protocol for local area networks , once claimed that the internet was about to be overwhelmed by e-mail traffic .
That was in 1996 .
A year later , Dr Metcalfe not only admitted the error of his doomsday prediction , but literally ate his own words — grinding his speech from a year before with liquid in a blender and quaffing the lot to cheers from his audience .
The latest panic started with a scare - mongering story in the Wall Street Journal last year , which concerned the rise of internet video and the inability of the network to handle it , especially at network edges where the internet enters the home .
The author talked of the “ coming exaflood ” , referring to the exabytes ( ie , billions of gigabytes ) of HD video users would soon be downloading .
Others in the industry have continued to fan the flames , with cable companies like Comcast wafting the hardest .
Unlike the individual DSL lines that telephone companies use to deliver broadband , cable operators provide services using a single loop shared by up to 450 households at once .
Comcast claims it takes only about a dozen people simultaneously using a bandwidth - hogging program like BitTorrent for others on the loop to find their web activities grinding to a halt .
While neither the DSL nor the cable companies have beefed up their local connections as fast as the internet backbone operators have boosted their capacity , there 's still enough bandwidth over the last mile for current traffic .
And soon there will be a whole lot more — at least for Verizon , Sprint and even Comcast .
Verizon is spending $ 18 billion pushing its FiOS fibre network out into neighbourhoods .
Despite its woes , Sprint is pressing ahead with WiMAX , the faster , longer - range version of WiFi .
And Comcast is making good progress with the latest cable protocol , DOCSIS 3.0 , which should allow it to offer 100 mbps within a year or two .
Comcast has also made its peace with BitTorrent .
The two companies are to collaborate on addressing some of the issues caused by P2P .
It has also teamed up with an outfit called Pando Networks which has a nifty traffic - management technology known as P4P .
The technology helps P2P file - sharers find each other more selectively , thus boosting their download speeds .
Comcast and others hope Pando's P4P can persuade the FCC to back away from implementing stronger net - neutrality rules .
That could well forestall any further legislation on Capitol Hill that might force them to keep their networks open to all comers in the way Dr Isenberg intended .
Following a number of aborted bills over the past few years , the Internet Freedom Preservation
Act that 's currently working its way through committee has the express backing of Senators Barack Obama , Hillary Clinton and other congressional bigwigs .
The bill specifically bans blocking or degrading lawful content , and forbids ISPs from charging more for downloading things like video .
The present political climate gives it the best chance yet of making it on to the statute book .
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) -- Sen. John McCain became the likely Republican nominee after Mitt Romney decided to suspend his campaign Thursday .
Now , the Democrats are debating who would do better against the Arizona Republican .
Democrats are debating who would do better against Sen. John McCain , the GOP front - runner .
Two polls this month have asked registered voters nationwide how they would vote if the choice were between McCain and Democratic Sen. Hillary Clinton .
A CNN poll , conducted by the Opinion Research Corporation February 1 - 3 , shows Clinton three points ahead of McCain , 50 percent to 47 percent .
That 's within the poll 's margin of error of 3 percentage points , meaning that the race is statistically tied ..
A Time magazine poll , conducted February 1 - 4 , also shows a dead heat between Clinton and McCain .
Each was backed by 46 percent of those polled .
Sen .
Barack Obama believes he can do better , arguing " I 've got appeal that goes beyond our party . "
In the CNN poll , Obama leads McCain by 8 points , 52 percent to 44 percent .
That 's outside the margin of error , meaning that Obama has the lead .
And in the Time poll , Obama leads McCain by 7 points , 48 percent to 41 percent -- a lead also outside of the poll 's margin of error of 3 percentage points .
In both polls , Obama looks stronger than Clinton .
Why ?
Obama 's explanation : " I think there is no doubt that she has higher negatives than any of the remaining Democratic candidates .
That 's just a fact , and there are some who will not vote for her . "
That was three weeks ago .
Now , only two Democratic candidates remain .
Clinton does have higher negatives than Obama -- and McCain .
Forty - four percent of the public say they do n't like Clinton , compared with 36 percent who do n't like McCain and 31 percent who do n't like Obama , according to the CNN poll conducted February 1 - 3 .
Why does Obama do better against McCain than Clinton ?
Obama does do a little better than Clinton with independents and Republicans .
But the big difference is men : Men give McCain an 18 - point lead over Clinton , 57 percent to 39 percent , according to the CNN poll .
The margin of error for that question was plus or minus 5 percentage points .
But if McCain and Obama went head to head , McCain 's lead among men shrinks to three , 49 percent to 46 percent -- statistically a tie .
Women , on the other hand , vote for either Clinton or Obama by similar margins .
Some Democrats may be worried about how Obama will fare with white voters .
Whites give McCain a 15 - point lead over Clinton , ( 56 percent for McCain , 41 percent for Clinton ) .
But Obama actually fares better than Clinton with white voters .
McCain still leads , but by a smaller margin , ( 52 to 43 percent ) .
Obama argues that he can reach across party lines .
And he does do a little better than Clinton with Independents and Republicans , at least in these polls .
But the big difference is that Clinton does n't draw very well with men .
Obama does .

All About John McCain • Hillary Clinton • Barack Obama
This is a story about the kind of life you can have living off what other people throw away .
A story of living free .
Free in the sense of no money being spent , but also free in the sense of freedom from a certain kind of system of living .
Aside from the regular Monday confessionals I do n’t use this blog much as a personal diary .
Forgive me for this slight indulgence , but I feel that other people might be interested in learning a bit about this life and they tell you to write about what you know .
So lets start the story at the beginning .
I graduated college with a computer science degree .
Frankly I had no desire to get a job working in a cubicle , I was n’t sure what to do with my life , and I was living in a situation that seemed at the time to be an endless spiral .
I was spinning my wheels but going nowhere .
I had no money , in fact what I had was a mountain of debt from school .
I was what many people are at some point in their life , stuck .
With my apartment lease soon to be up , I started to look for a way out .
I looked for jobs , first in the for - profit industry .
I did n’t find anything I really wanted , so I moved to the non-profit industry .
Through some magical stroke of luck I stumbled upon the AmeriCorps website .
Never has one Google search so changed my life .
This was it !
My ticket out of the corn field .
I had the skills and the desire , they provided the job and the chance to see someplace new .
I had been reading a lot of books , and I was starting to get very worried about the environment ( this was pre-al gore , pre-Katrina , pre-live earth , pre-all that ) .
I wanted to do something good for the world , and for myself .
I signed up for every single program I could find that involved the environment , and a chance to be outside .
I was eventually accepted into a program in the Louisiana bayou that would involve restoring the wetlands environment .
I was told by the man running the program in a very thick Cajun accent that I would “ be seein an aligato bout every day , yu huh . ”
I was going to be living in the swamp , way way out in the swamp , I was stoked .
My mother was terrified .
That is until president Bush de-funded AmeriCorps ( or tried to , even after promising to support it ) and I got a call informing me that the swamp restoration project had been put on hold .
Stuck again .
My phone rang again .
The good people in Austin Texas wanted me to come build trails with them .
I was guarded , but happy .
Lucky for me this time it stuck .
My mother was still terrified .
I had no car and very little money .
I gave away everything , recycled or threw out the rest , and slimmed down my entire belongings to two duffel bags , and a box .
The bags would go with me on the greyhound bus ( from Toledo Ohio to Austin Texas , a 24 hour + bus ride ) .
The box would be shipped to my new home once I found one .
You will meet the strangest people on a greyhound bus .
I slept through most of Ohio and Missouri , but somewhere we picked up this old woman , maybe in Arkansas .
She “ loved men folk ” and was “ keen ” on “ rubbing my shoulders ” .
I was flattered but this woman had to be in her 80’s .
After what seemed like a million mile journey I arrived in Austin Texas with no place to live , no car , and a bit of money in my pocket .
( I would later make the same journey home for the holidays with a horrible cold , the drugs and fever made me hallucinate slightly and I was unsure when to get off the bus , it was a nightmare journey filled with crazy memories and jumbled recollections of peoples faces and endless highways )
The program did n’t start for a couple of weeks , and I wanted to give myself a chance to get an apartment .
I had a place picked out over the internet before I got there but when I arrived and called them they said that the room was not going to be ready for a week or two .
I spent most of my cash on the cab ride to the youth hostel and then on the room at the hostel .
I met some very cool travelers from Europe and we enjoyed a night of authentic Austin Texas Live music .
The guy from Belgium seemed to be really into country music and knew “ all the great places . ”
I had a great time talking and laughing with them .
They took me out for breakfast the next morning , and we discussed the fact that Americans seem to be much more hung up about sex than Europeans .
It was fascinating conversation , but I was really interested in the free food , I had n’t eaten in a ten hours and was starving .
I did however have a problem .
I was not going to be able to afford to stay in the hostel for two weeks , and pay my first months rent at the new apartment ( I was going to have to find enough money to pay for the second months rent , during the first month living there ) .
So after running the number I realized that if I worked it out just right , there would be a two day window in which I was neither staying at the hostel , or staying in the apartment .
I asked the people at the hostel if I could leave my bags there , they were nice enough to let me and I slept in the park for two days .
It was strange .
I have never been “ homeless ” in my life , and I do n’t really count this as being homeless .
I was scared , did n’t sleep well , and would not like to do this again .
This is what I would call my “ rookie ” season at living free .
At this point I was still buying food from the store , mostly M and M’s and peanuts .
I was hungry most of the time , but other than that ok .
I eventually got an apartment , got my stuff into it ( it filled one small corner , as I had no furniture ) and then the news came .
I had no phone , so I was using the pay phone across the street .
When I called my Austin program to check in , they informed me that due to budget problems they would not be starting for a month and a half , but not to worry I was still in and everything was going to be ok .
I had a problem .
I had not budgeted a month and a half of no income into my plans .
( in fact I would not get paid till after the first 4 ! weeks of the program , so really it was 2 and a half months of no income )
This is when I really started to think about giving up and moving back home .
I had enough money for a return ticket , but little more .
I was all alone , and I had no way to pay for next months rent , let alone food .
I was very close to packing it all in , calling my mother and begging for help .
I sat down , and on the back of a junk mail envelope I wrote a list of things I would need .
Food , transportation , and money , the big three .
I have since taken to using junk mail envelopes for list paper , and regularly keep the nice white ones in a stack .
I needed to know the area before I could find any of those things .
I asked the lady who worked at the apartment office , and started walking to all the places around my apartment .
If you are familiar with Austin I was far down South Lamar , not the best place to find work .
There are a lot of goodwill ’s , pawn shops , and restaurants .
With the list before me I somehow found new strength and vowed that I would make this work .
My first mission was to find some food .
I was hungry and broke .
I learned that you could volunteer at this Macrobiotic restaurant on weekend mornings chopping vegetables , and then they would allow you to have an all you can eat breakfast buffet .
Sign me up !
This mostly meant chopping hundreds of onions , I wept , but my belly was full every weekend .
Next I needed some transportation .
The nearest grocery store was about 8 miles away , and I did n’t relish walking that far with grocery bags .
Lucky for me the pawn shop had beater bikes for 50 bucks .
Score !
With no job , I had a lot of free time .
I would get my backpack , and ride around to all the dumpsters behind all the stores within a ten mile radius of my house .
I found an old bike that was so bent up that I could only assume it had been hit by a car , but on the back was a bike shelf thing , like the kind people used to hold their school books on in old movies .
A bit of wrench work later and my bike was tricked out with such a shelf .
A score of an old milk crate , and some reused zip ties from an old sign ( did you know that if you slip a knife gently into the zip tie head , you can get the zip ties back open without ruining them ? )
I now had a trunk for my bike .
I was in business , with that simple find I had tripled my carrying capacity for free stuff retrieval .
I was still hungry , and still needed some money .
The weekend food job was just that , food on the weekend , I do n’t know about you but I like to eat every day .
My rent payment day was looming as well .
Time to get a job .
I made the choice to spend my return ticket money , and fully commit myself to giving this life a try .
I got a 3 dollar phone from good will , and signed up for the 24 dollar a month , bare bones ATT phone plan .
No call waiting , no long distance , no nothing .
It would ring if you dialed the number , and little else .
I started calling every job in the paper that was close enough to my house to ride a bike ( 20 miles or so ) .
As luck would have it I got a job with Texas Campaign For The Environment , going door to door trying to convince the good people of Austin to give me their money so that we could increase the recycling of computer parts .
I was alright at this job , but not good enough to meet quota .
They let me stick it out for a couple of weeks , making enough money to pay that rent , and buy food , but just barely .
I was “ let go ” because frankly I was just not forward enough to get up in peoples faces and make them give me some money .
Anyone who has ever done canvasing knows what I am talking about .
It takes a certain kind of person , and I am not it .
I did have some adventures though .
We were picked up by the cops one time because someone had called them claiming we were bothering the neighborhood .
The cops picked us up and drove us 20 minutes away and dumped us at a corner store .
We told them that we had to meet back up with the van that would take us back to the office , but they did n’t care .
With no phone , and no way to get back to our drop off point , we ended up convincing this very nice couple who had a pick up truck to drive us all back to the van .
It was an interesting night .
So at this point I had learned a couple of lessons .
One was do n’t pay for anything you can get for free .
At this point I had found a recliner in the dumpster down the street ( covered with dog hair , but that came off ) .
In fact my daily dumpster rounds had also turned up a dinning room table , three chairs , pots , pans , forks , spoon , and some cups .
If you lived in my apartment complex you would regularly see me carrying a lazy boy or some other large object on my back up the steps into my apartment .
I left the lights off at night , and went to bed when it was dark , I could n’t afford air conditioning so I would throw myself in the river every day and float around with just my nose sticking out until the heat of the day was a little less ( the heat is never really gone , but it does go down a bit ) .
I found a box fan in the trash that was so dirty I thought it was black , until I got it home and cleaned it up in the tub to find out that it was in fact white .
I was good for another month , but I was really hungry , all the time .
That is when I found two things , the library and Texas French Bread on south congress .
The Austin downtown library is huge , has loads of books , is air conditioned , and free .
A life saver .
I started getting books to keep me busy ( no tv , no friends , no Internet ) , including books on edible plants .
I found Texas French bread with my nose .
I used to eat dumpster bagels all the time in college , so it was no problem for me to jump into a bakery dumpster and pull out a bag of bread .
TFB however was a whole other ball game .
Fancy ciabatta bread , pastries , dense loaves of German dark wheat , bagels , croissants , chocolate covered cake things , this bakery made and threw away some of the best tasting bread I had ever eaten .
I even got the guy who worked there to save me the day old soup in a giant plastic mayonnaise bottle a couple of times .
I also noticed that many people in Austin ( even the DPW people ) had planted rose merry and other herb plants as decorative bushes in their front yards .
Thanks to the library I was now regularly bringing home rose merry , mint , wild onions and grape leaves to feast on .
My favorite dish was ciabatta bread with rose merry butter and onions cooked in the oven till the top got crunchy .
I was ridding my bike 25 + miles a day , sleeping in an 80 degree apartment and swimming a lot .
I could eat anything I wanted and not gain an ounce .
I ate pastries for breakfast every day , bagels for lunch and dinner ( the best were the ones with fruit and nuts in them ) , and complimenting my diet with rice beans and some other foods from the store .
This sort of living re-aligns your priorities .
I remember once I had a powerful hunger for ice cream .
I knew that any ice cream I got from the store would be melted in the hot Texas sun before I ever got it home , but I did n’t want to spend the money for a single serving at the gas station as I could get more ice cream for the same price at the store .
My solution was to wait till 2 in the morning and then go get the ice cream and wrap it in paper bags to get it home .
That cheap no - brand vanilla ice cream from a box tasted better than any scoop I have ever had .
I enjoyed it slowly savoring every bite .
Later I would have my bike stolen once , and have two more fall apart on me , resulting in a Frankensteins monster of a bike put together from free parts I found , and me keeping my bike inside my apartment from now on .
But for now , my food and transportation problems were mostly solved , I was ready to start my year in AmeriCorps .
After a couple of false starts , and a bit of a change in mission ( I would now be teaching people about technology three weeks a month and building trails one week a month ) , the money started to flow a bit and the worry of constant ruin was relived .
I still could n’t do things like turn the air conditioner on , or take a cab anyplace but that was ok .
I realized that I could actually start to save money , if I ate predominantly off the land and out of dumpsters .
My monthly income was about 900 dollars .
600 of that went to rent , 50 of it to food , and 50 to utilities .
The rest went right into the bank .
I was on constant lookout for the word “ free . ”
Austin is a great place to see free music .
I would often go downtown on my bike and watch some great band for free .
I washed my cloths in the shower , I cooled off in the river , I constantly volunteered at any event that had food so I could take the extra home with me .
It was a simple life , I read many books , and did n’t watch a single hour of TV for the whole year .
I cut my own hair , made my own bed out of an electric blanket I found in a dumpster , even managed to get some shelves to put my cloths on .
During the one month of cold I heated my home with the stove ( free gas ) , and candles I had found behind the grocery store .
They were all half burned and had pictures of Jesus on them , but if I lit ten or so of them they would keep me warm at night ( the apartment was one room , and a bathroom ) .
I would get up early to beat the heat and the morning traffic and ride my bike downtown to the main AmeriCorps Office .
I would sit in the shade under a tree for an hour and a half until they got there and opened the door .
Serve all day , then ride my bike in the 100 degree heat up the big south congress hill to get some bread from the dumpster , then swing around to some good front yards to get some mint and rose merry , then it was home to drop off my booty .
Get back on my bike and ride up south Lamar to Barton springs and throw myself into the river to cool down for a bit .
Then ride dripping wet ( it did n’t take long to dry off in the sun ) back to my house for dinner .
Often during these loops , I would stop at dumpsters to look for anything useful inside .
Dinner was often dumpster bread , wild plants , rice and beans .
I would read until the sun went down , then listen to NPR till about 10 .
Get naked , turn the fan on and try and go to sleep in the sweltering Texas heat .
Over the year I met friends , and had adventures .
One time the drug addict who lived across the hall from me , he made me call him blue , took me downtown to listen to him play harmonica with his old band .
It was by far the best music I have ever heard .
Imagine Stevie Ray Vaughn on the Guitar in a tiny little club , with some of the best blues harmonica you have ever heard , playing to a packed crowd of Texans jumping and screaming to the music .
It was amazing and one of the most memorable nights of my life .
Blue would later lament to me that he had sold his harmonicas to buy drugs .
One night I came home to find the cops swarming over my apartment complex .
Seems two boys were playing with a gun and had shot a bullet through the wall into the apartment next to mine .
Later that year cops would show up at my door and make me prove that I was not the previous resident who apparently had a warrant out for his arrest .
I saw great shows in the park , saw most of Austin by bike , met some very interesting people , and over all learned a lot about myself and my abilities .
By the end of the year I had saved up over 2000 dollars .
I was ready to leave Texas for a new adventure .
I did n’t want to have to start from scratch in my next location , and the money would provide a bit of a cushion .
Even without the money I was convinced I would be alright .
If I learned anything from my year in Texas it was how to make due with what you got .
I packed up my two duffel bags , and sent my one box of stuff UPS to my mother , got on the bus and left .
I left Texas a new man , a different person .
I am pretty sure that most people would not want to live this life .
The lessons I learned that year stick with me .
I still look in dumpsters for stuff , get things free from the dump , never turn down a free meal , and always look for good free entertainment .
If you have the right kind of eyes , you can find all of these things easily .
I grew those eyes in Texas and it has changed my life .
If you have any tales of free living leave a comment and let me know what you learned , and how it has effected your life .
Two cars collided last year on Cinco de Mayo .
Considering the date , you might assume that at least one of the drivers was drunk — and you'd be right .
Laura Varker was 17 years old , and she 'd been tubing down the Salt River all day with her eight best girlfriends .
Their T - shirts all read " Cinco de Drinko . "
Even an hour after the accident , Varker 's blood - alcohol level was 0.09 , over the legal limit for adults .
And , as an underage driver , she was in violation of the law by having any amount of alcohol in her system .
One of Varker 's girlfriends , 15 - year - old Felicia Edwards , did n't drink a drop .
But it was Edwards who died when Varker 's Yukon Denali hit another car and flipped over and over like a tumbleweed before coming to a horrifying stop on the Bush Highway north of Mesa .
Edwards was thrown from the SUV and pronounced dead at the scene .
Info Laura Varker
When sheriff 's deputies called Felicia 's mother that terrible day , her first question was , " Was she wearing a seat belt ? "
She was n't .
Instead , Felicia had been in the back of the SUV holding down the tubes — a decision she paid for with her life .
That 's a tragedy .
But only in its aftermath did the collision become a travesty .
That 's because , even after blood tests showed that Varker was legally drunk , and even after sheriff 's investigators learned that it was she and another girl who'd flashed a fake ID and bought Coors Light and malt liquor for the group , Varker has n't been charged with anything .
Not underage consumption .
Not drunken driving .
And certainly not manslaughter .
Instead of charging the affluent white girl , the sheriff 's officers arrested the other driver , a black man , a guy who was n't even legally drunk .
Bryant Wilkerson was a 28 - year - old postal service clerk with nothing on his record worse than a fender - bender .
That day , he was merely making a U - turn , in a place where U - turns are permitted , when a 17 - year - old party girl in her daddy 's SUV tried to speed around him .
Wilkerson 's life has been upended .
He 's been charged with nine felony counts , including manslaughter and aggravated assault .
He spent three months in jail because he did n't have the money to post bail , and he lost his job because of that .
Now under strict curfew and random alcohol and drug screenings for the past five months , he has to get permission from the court just to attend his daughter 's band concerts in the evening .
He 's facing 21 years in prison .
Meanwhile , Laura Varker is posing on her MySpace page in a bikini .
That day on the Bush Highway , Bryant Wilkerson did one thing wrong .
Admittedly , it was really wrong .
He was making a U - turn — which , again , was legal — when he saw Varker 's Denali come out of nowhere on his left side .
According to the sheriff 's report , witnesses suggest Varker saw his little Hyundai slowing and crossed over the yellow lines into the center lane to pass him .
At least one witness , a friend of Varker 's who was just behind her on the highway , told deputies that the other car was slowing too dramatically for her to stop ; Varker had to lurch into the center lane just to avoid rear - ending him .
( Now , you 'd think Varker would allow plenty of distance between herself and other drivers .
Just seven months earlier , as a 16 - year - old with a brand - new license , Varker had caused another accident .
Police records say she failed to stop in time and slammed into another car on Cactus Road , which then hit the car in front of it . )
But back to Cinco de Mayo .
As he went into the turn , Wilkerson did n't see the SUV veering into the center lane until it was too late .
Amazingly , Wilkerson 's Hyundai was just fine , other than losing its bumper .
It grazed the SUV and hung on to finish the U - turn .
In their rear - view window , though , Wilkerson 's passengers were horrified to see the Denali flipping over and over , according to the sheriff 's report .
And that 's when , Wilkerson admits , he made a really big mistake .
He panicked and took off .
" I freaked out , " he says .
" That 's no excuse ; that 's so not me .
But I had the people in my car yelling , ' Go , go , go ! ' and I just freaked out and panicked . "
Sheriff 's deputies caught up with him just 10 minutes later .
Because he fled the scene , it 's understandable that the sheriff 's deputies assumed that Wilkerson had something to hide .
Their reports note that he smelled heavily of alcohol , that he 'd admitted to smoking pot that morning , that he seemed drunk .
The problem is , all the tests came back well under the legal limit .
Wilkerson blew a 0.049 on the sheriff 's Breathalyzer .
By the time the sheriff 's officers did a blood test , which is widely considered much more accurate , Wilkerson 's blood - alcohol content was only 0.01 .
The presence of marijuana was just as minimal .
Wilkerson had only trace amounts in his bloodstream .
Never mind .
The sheriff 's deputies had made up their minds : Wilkerson was to blame for the crash .
They arrested him , charging him with manslaughter , aggravated assault , leaving the scene of a fatal injury accident , unlawful flight from law enforcement , and five counts of endangerment .
( A sheriff 's spokesman did not respond to a request for comment . )
He would spend the next three months in Maricopa County 's Fourth Avenue Jail — in the maximum - security wing .
His wife tried her best to raise bail , but $ 54,000 is a lot of collateral when you 're a renter .
Wilkerson learned in jail that the SUV driver had been legally drunk .
He 'd initially been so shocked by the accident , he says , that he figured he must be to blame .
But when he heard that , he began to wonder just what was going on .
He had only a public defender and no money for a lawyer .
He questioned whether he was getting a fair shake .
Wilkerson contacted the Reverend Oscar Tillman , president of the NAACP 's Maricopa County branch , who had much the same reaction .
Tillman could n't believe what he was hearing .
They were charging the guy who was below the legal limit with manslaughter , and they were n't charging the drunk with anything ?
" I 've seen numerous cases that have come through here , where people have been charged under very questionable circumstances with DUIs , " Tillman says .
" In this particular case , within a few days , the sheriff 's department had in their hands a report saying she was legally drunk . "
And yet they have n't charged her .
" I have a serious problem with that , " Tillman says .
No one is saying that Wilkerson should face no penalty .
Prosecutors , for example , could have charged him with leaving the scene of an accident , and it's hard to imagine the Reverend Oscar Tillman getting involved .
But manslaughter ?
Twenty - one years in prison ?
Tillman began contacting the Sheriff 's Office in August .
He says he has n't asked them to drop charges against Wilkerson , but he wants to know when they 're going to charge Varker .
In early December , he says , he was finally informed that the Sheriff 's Office had filed a supplemental report suggesting that charges be filed against Varker .
Barnett Lotstein , a top aide to County Attorney Andrew Thomas , promised Tillman he'd see where things stood .
Tillman is still waiting .
( Lotstein did not respond to e-mails seeking comment . )
Tillman 's confident that , ultimately , justice will be done .
" They can't hide this one , " he says .
" I 'm not going to let this man be railroaded when [ Varker ] may have caused the entire accident . "
Varker 's father works at Dial , the German - owned Scottsdale - based soap company , records show .
The family has hired a host of lawyers for their daughter , including a pair at the highly respected firm of Quarles & Brady , to handle any potential criminal charges .
When sheriff 's deputies went back a few months after the accident to press Laura Varker 's friends about whether she'd been the one to purchase the booze , all but one refused to cooperate , including a few girls who 'd initially agreed to interviews .
They 'd given Varker 's parents their word , they said , that they would n't talk .
Varker 's lawyers have also hired a retired Phoenix cop , who surveyed the scene and concluded that Wilkerson erred when he slowed down to make the U - turn .
By doing so , the former police officer wrote , Wilkerson impeded the flow of traffic , forcing Varker into the center lane .
" He could have completely exited the westbound lane into the bus stop cutout and attempted to execute a safer U - turn , " the report suggested .
John Sandweg , one of Laura Varker 's lawyers , said Laura and her family would decline all comment .
" This is a tragedy , this was a horrific accident , but it was not Miss Varker 's fault , " Sandweg says .
Bryant Wilkerson is tormented by what happened to Felicia Edwards .
When deputies first told him that someone died in the accident , he broke down .
" It was a hard pill to swallow , " he says .
Even today , eight months later , his eyes fill with tears .
" Looking back , I know I was n't really at fault .
But it 's still something that 's hard to think about . "
Wilkerson is a soft - spoken guy .
He grew up in California .
His father is black and American Indian , he says , while his mother is white .
He and his wife live in an apartment complex in Fountain Hills , and he's now working at the Chevron station across the street .
" That way I do n't have to drive , " he says .
He still has driving privileges , but he knows what can happen on the road .
It 's safer to walk .
A few years ago , Wilkerson and his wife formally adopted a pair of sisters whose mother had decided she was more interested in drugs than raising children .
The girls are both in middle school now , and so when Wilkerson thinks about Felicia Edwards dying , he thinks about his daughters .
He 's seen Edwards ' mom , Jennifer Bither , in court .
Under the law , he 's not allowed to approach her ; she 's the victim , and he 's officially the suspect .
But he thinks about her , often .
Through her lawyer , Bither declined comment .
She is suing both Wilkerson and Varker for her daughter 's death , court records show .
" She 's the real victim here , " Wilkerson says .
" As hard as it may be for me , it 's nothing ; it 's not even one - tenth the thickness of a hair , compared to what it is for her .
I can't comprehend that .
If I were to lose one of my daughters , it would just tear me up . "
But he still can't understand why he's the only one being held responsible , why he's the one looking at 21 years , while Laura Varker continues on her way .
" I need to get the story out , " he says .
" Because it really seems like they 're trying to railroad me . "
Talk about " elitism . "
Last night while discussing " downscale voters , " salt - of - the - earth FOX News contributor ( and Weekly Standard editor ) Fred Barnes ridiculed and demeaned working class Americans by making the distinction that they are n't " lower income , " but rather " lower class . "

Look at the smug look on his face as he demeans the majority of Americans .
Apparently to Barnes union workers and , indeed , anyone who actually labors for a living , is not as good as him .
Kudos to the panel who , for reasons you can decide yourselves , distances themselves from his insensitive and bone - headed remarks .
Something tells me we 're looking at Duncan 's " Wanker of the day . "
TPM has more and Faiz sums it up nicely :
So you think you are a perfect geek just because you have a talking Homer and a Space Invaders mug at your desk ?
No chance .
Maybe a lava lamp or a not - so - exclusive Google mini-fridge ?
Meh , go away .
To become a respectable geek you should do more than buying used schwags on Ebay for your cubicle .
Not to mention that hanging solar system built using old cds is your one way ticket to nerd city .
To become a real geek , just take a look at this gallery of uber - cool home and office appliances , furniture and other decorative elements built just for this purpose .
Most of them are very expensive , and some others are just prototypes .
But that should n’t be an obstacle in you search for a better geekness .
Just be sure to get them now that you are single and free .
No wife in her right mind will allow any of these at home !
Afterward , Surveyor will be used as a communications satellite to relay data to Earth from landers on the surface of Mars .
This phase of the mission is scheduled to last until 1 January 2003 , or until the spacecraft 's maneuvering propellant runs out , whichever comes first .
More science collection operations may take place during relay operations if the budget permits .
How long does it take to reach Mars ?
Surveyor will take 309 days to reach Mars .
In theory , the ideal transit time is 259 days .
However , the journey can take anywhere between seven to 10 months depending on type of trajectory chosen and the precise locations of Earth and Mars at the time of launch .
How often will Surveyor circle Mars ?
Immediately after entering Mars orbit on 12 September 1997 , Surveyor will take 48 hours to circle Mars .
Over the next four months , the orbit will be gradually trimmed .
Surveyor will take only 118 minutes to circle Mars by the time mapping operations begin in March 1998 .
That 's slightly less than two hours .
Why does it take so long to get data back from Mars ?
The reason is that Mars is far away from the Earth .
Depending on the time of year , Mars can be anywhere between 78 million and 377 million kilometers from the Earth .
Radio signals that carry the data travel at the speed of light which is about 300,000 kilometers per second .
At this speed , the signals can reach Earth in as little as 4 minutes ( 78 million km ) , or can take as long as 21 minutes ( 377 million km ) .
Engineers refer to this length of time as the " one - way light time . "
Will Surveyor ever return to Earth ?
No , Surveyor does not carry enough propellant to return to Earth .
The spacecraft will continue to orbit Mars long after its electronics fail or its maneuvering propellant supply is depleted .
The orbit that will be used for mapping operations was designed to ensure that Surveyor will not fall out of orbit and crash into the surface for at least 50 years after the conclusion of the mission .
VIENNA ( Reuters ) - A man has escaped from his Austrian jail cell by squeezing through a food hatch in the door , police said on Wednesday .
The 19 - year old Kosovan , who weighed less than 121 pounds , was being held at the prison in Linz for entering the country illegally , police spokesman Alexander Niederwimmer told APA news agency .
How he got through two further doors or possibly over the prison wall is being investigated , said Niederwimmer , calling the escapee “ a snake man . ”
WELLINGTON ( Reuters ) - The United Nations urged the world on Thursday to kick the habit of producing carbon dioxide , saying everyone must act to fight climate change .

U.N. Secretary - General Ban Ki-Moon said global warming was becoming the era ’s defining issue and would hurt rich and poor .
“ Our world is in the grip of a dangerous carbon habit , ” Ban said in a statement on World Environment Day , which is being marked by events around the globe and hosted by the New Zealand city of Wellington .
“ Addiction is a terrible thing .
It consumes and controls us , makes us deny important truths and blinds us to the consequences of our actions , ” he said in the speech to reinforce this year ’s World Environment Day theme of “ CO2 Kick the Habit . ”
World Environment Day , conceived in 1972 , is the United Nations ’ principal day to mark global green issues and aims to give a human face to environmental problems and solutions .
New Zealand , which boasts snow - capped mountains , pristine fjords and isolated beaches used as the backdrop for the “ Lord of the Rings ” film trilogy , has pledged to become carbon - neutral .
“ We take pride in our clean , green identity as a nation and we are determined to take action to protect it .
We appreciate that protecting the climate means behavior change by each and every one of us , ” said New Zealand Prime Minister Helen Clark .
New Zealand staged art and street festivals to spread the message on how people can reduce carbon usage .
In Australia , Adelaide Zoo staged a wild breakfast for corporate leaders to focus on how carbon emissions threaten animal habitats .
GLOBAL EVENTS
In Bangladesh ’s capital Dhaka , people plan to clean up Gulshan Baridhara Lake that has become badly polluted , and in Kathmandu the Bagmati River Festival will focus on cleaning up the river there .
Many Asian cities , such as Bangalore and Mumbai , plan tree - planting campaigns , while the Indian town of Pune will open a “ Temple of Environment ” to help spread green awareness .
But in Europe , which claims to be a leader in the climate change battle , Environment Day passed with barely a blip .
Britain urged individuals to take action and the Environment Agency called on people to be prepared for more flooding , to use less water and protect wildlife .

Global carbon emissions from burning fossil fuels are rising quickly and scientists predict rising seas , melting glaciers and more intense storms , droughts and floods as the planet warms .
A summit of G8 nations in Japan next month is due to formalize a goal agreed a year ago that global carbon emissions should be reduced by 50 percent below 1990 levels by 2050 .
But some nations want a reduction of 80 percent of carbon emissions by 2050 to try to stabilize CO2 concentrations in the air to limit global warming .
Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd said climate change was already a reality : “ We have been experiencing the worst drought in living memory and our inland rivers are running dry .
“ We are committed to reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 60 per cent on 2000 levels by 2050 .
We will implement emissions trading as the primary mechanism for achieving this target , ” he said in a statement .
The U.N. Environment Program said greening the world ’s economy would cost as little as a few tenths of global GDP annually over 30 years and would be a driving force for innovation , new businesses and employment .

Walter " John " Williams thinks out of the box .
He makes disquieting reading , but you wo n’t find him in the mainstream .
At least not often .
He runs a " Shadow Government Statistics " site with an electronic by - subscription newsletter .
Anyone can access some of his data and occasional special reports .
They can also assess his reasoning .
In his judgment , government data are manipulated , corrupted and unreliable .
He ’s not alone thinking that .
First , through technical changes over time in how data are collected and / or interpreted .
The intent is to portray a more rosy scenario and ignore real world experiences of ordinary people .
Calculating the CPI is an example :
— in the 1980s , the Bureau of Labor Statistics ( BLS ) switched from using house prices to their rental equivalent ; — then a decade ago , BLS made a spurious assumption for reasons other than it stated ; it was that consumers substitute cheaper products for ones that have risen in price – such as hamburger for steak or chicken for meat ; the idea was n’t to reflect their buying habits ; it was to artificially lower inflation and distort its calculation ; and — BLS has long adjusted prices for quality improvements ; it ’s called " hedonic adjustment " that , in fact , cooks the books ; so if computer speed increases , its cost is lowered proportionally even if its price rises ; the same is true for autos with better brakes or other assorted innovations ; again the result is distortion , and it affects all sorts of products ; as a result , inflation is artificially and fraudulently lowered .
Another example is how federal deficits are calculated .
Beginning with Nixon in 1969 , a " unified budget " was adopted to artificially lower them by offsetting expenditures with " off - budget " Social Security revenues .
The idea was to hide government ’s true cost at a time wartime and Great Society spending was high and would later factor into the 1970s and 1980s inflation .
If deficits were calculated then and now by GAAP methodology ( required of all publicly - traded corporations ) , they ’d be much higher than annually reported – since the 1970s , in multiple trillions of dollars ; fiscal alchemy sweeps them under the rug .
A further example was Nixon ’s " core inflation " idea .
More artificial rigging – to exclude volatile food and energy prices to produce a lower figure .
No matter that these items account for a large portion of consumer spending , especially for lower income households .
Others like this are numerous .
They all amount to manipulative rigging for political or financial market purposes , and the practice goes back decades .
A recent Bush administration one is switching to monthly instead of semi-annual jobs data seasonal adjustments to make the number friendlier .
Later on ( too late for markets to react ) they ’re matched against payroll figures for a once a year adjustment and more accurate jobs created or lost reading .
The Clinton administration was also manipulative .
In calculating employment , it lowered its monthly household sample from 60,000 to 50,000 , reducing it mainly in inner cities .
The effect is to artificially lower jobless numbers among blacks , Latinos and the poor overall .
The calculation is also rigged by keeping out the 2.3 million prison population .
The overall effect is illusion , not reality – to erase " free market " capitalism ’s defects and make it look wondrous and beneficial to mankind .
Williams reverse - engineers the GDP , employment and inflation data for more accurate readings .
He backs out manipulative changes to produce more valid figures .
Take the 5.5 % May unemployment rate for example .
BLS calculates it on persons who looked for work in the last 30 days .
Williams adds those who want to work but gave up in frustration plus people working part - time who want ( but ca n’t find ) full - time jobs .
Result : real unemployment of over 12 % .
The same methodology works for economic growth .
The real value of all goods and services produced is lower than official GDP numbers when adjusted for higher inflation .
More of it means higher prices , not increased output .
It ’s how Williams makes his calculation , and he ’s worried .
He sees inflation rising and a threat of hyperinflation ahead .
He highlighted his concern in a recent April 2008 report called " Hyperinflation Special Report " with three dramatic sub - headings :
— " Inflationary Recession Is in Place ; — Banking Solvency Crisis Has Opened First Phase Monetary Inflation ; " and — " Hyperinflationary Depression Remains Likely As Early as 2010 . "
Time alone will prove him right or wrong .
But given current economic conditions , the financial malpractice that precipitated them , continued mismanagement since then , and resultant dangers they created , it pays to examine his analysis .
It ’s not for the faint - hearted and hopefully wo n’t bear out .
But it ’s happened before at other times in other countries , and when it hits it ruins lives and savings .
Is America now headed for that type future ?
Williams thinks so , and here ’s his argument .
He sees the US economy in an " intensifying inflationary recession " heading for " a hyperinflationary great depression . "
He expects it as soon as 2010 , maybe sooner , and " likely " no later than in a decade .
Blame it on reckless monetary and fiscal policy – creating torrents of money , borrowing outsized amounts , and spending ourselves into bankruptcy by supporting short - term " big- monied special interests . "
Things are so out of hand , Williams sees " no way of avoiding a financial Armageddon . "
We ’re nearly or already bankrupt ; are creating money to cover our obligations ; the more we print , the more we need ; it ’s fiat currency unbacked by gold ; and every new dollar created dilutes the value of all others in circulation .
Double the money supply , and presto – every dollar is worth 50 cents .
Double it again , and you get the point .
We ’ve been doing it for decades , especially since Nixon closed the gold window in 1971 .
At some point , the music stops , the dollar collapses , it becomes worthless paper , and related dollar - demoninated paper assets go down with it .
Williams quotes a law professor who experienced Weimar Germany ’s hyperinflation first hand .
It was the worst by far ever recorded .
" It was horrible .
Horrible !
Like lightening it struck .
No one was prepared . "
Shelves in grocery stores emptied .
" You could buy nothing with your paper money . "
At the trough in 1923 , the mark plunged to an astonishing 4,200,000,000,000 to the dollar .
Can it happen here ?
It might , and rising world inflation is worrisome .
Analyst Bob Chapman ’s International Forecaster reports current US inflation at 12.5 % ; China ’s 8.5 % ; Russia ’s 14 % ; Gulf oil producers on average 12 % ; India 8 % ; Indonesia 12 % ; Brazil 5 % ; Chile 8.3 % ; Venezuela 29.3 % and Argentina 23 % .
This likely plays into the European Central Bank ’s ( ECB ) reluctance to cut rates and the Bank of England ’s holding off on further ones .
It ’s also a factor affecting dollar weakness and rising gold prices that hedge against depreciating currencies and geopolitical uncertainties .
Williams is justifiably concerned as inflationary pressures build .
First some definitions .
Inflation results from a money supply increase that causes prices to rise .
Williams refers only to goods and services , not financial assets like stocks and bonds .
He also leaves out speculation and market manipulation that ’s key to understanding high oil and food prices .
Markets do n’t move randomly .
Big - monied speculators move them , but that ’s a separate topic from what Williams addresses .
He mentions various types of hyperinflation .
They range from the double or triple - digit kind , several - fold that level , to what happened in Weimar Germany when it went to infinity .
Once the genie is unleashed , there ’s no telling how bad things may get .
Williams sees them getting pretty bad .
So much so that dollars get dumped , holders flee to safety , and a downward spiral intensifies with no idea of a bottom .
In his view and others , the culprit is fiat currency , without gold backing .
Its worth depends solely on the full faith and credit of the issuing government .
Absent that and currencies crash .
Print too much of it , and that ’s its future .
Examine Fed policy under Greenspan and Bernanke , and draw your own conclusions .
They ’ve been virtual money - creation machines unmindful of the history they should know .
By issuing too much of a good thing for too many years , they fueled asset bubbles .
When they burst , they made things worse and may now have headed the economy for collapse .
In Williams judgment , America today is no different from other nations in other eras that followed similar policies .
They all met the same fate , and today this country has already " obligated itself to liabilities well beyond its ability ever to pay off . "
Not a cheery assessment , and he ’s not alone believing it .
More definitions :
— Deflation – a decrease in goods and services prices , generally from a money supply contraction ; — Inflation – the reverse of the above ; — Hyperinflation – extreme inflation , as explained above , to a level where money becomes worthless or nearly so ; according to Williams , the coming hyperinflation is because of a " lack of monetary discipline formerly imposed …. by the gold standard , and a ( Fed ) dedicated to preventing a collapse in the money supply ( and preventing ) the implosion of the ( ongoing ) extremely over - leveraged domestic financial system ; " — Recession – officially defined as two or more consecutive ( inflation - adjusted ) GDP contracting quarters ; many economists do n’t agree on this , and some gauge conditions by the relative strength or weakness of industrial production , payroll employment , retail sales , and so forth ; add it up and clearly the US is in recession ; how bad and for how long will only be known in time ; — Depression – a recession " where ( inflation - adjusted ) peak - to - trough contraction exceeds 10 % ; and a — Great depression – one where the peak - to - trough exceeds 25 % .
It happened only once so far in US history in the 1930s .
Williams believes the current US contraction is about halfway to becoming a " depression , " but before it ends it may become " Great Depression II " to distinguish it from the earlier one .
We ’re now in an " inflationary recession , " and available data confirm it – soaring food and oil prices , a weakened dollar , true unemployment over 12 % , real inflation nearly as high , weak industrial production , and more .
In his judgment , expect worse ahead when added " inflationary effects of soaring broad money growth …. start " surfacing later in the year .
In his judgment , by year - end 2008 , " official CPI " figures should begin showing it .
Current computations cook the books , and not just for inflation .
According to Williams , the economy has been in recession since late 2006 when it entered the " second down - leg " of a multiple dip contraction .
It began in 1999 , then showed up officially in 2001 .
His current outlook takes account of " further bounces and dips in economic activity . "
We may now be in an upward swing before reheading down .
It happened during the Great Depression , only to fall to new lows .
Conditions today are hazardous .
A major financial crisis precipitated them .
Reckless policies caused it .
It threatens the solvency of major banks and other financial institutions .
It also hurts the greater economy .
Solutions – massive liquidity injections , interest rate cuts and reckless deficit spending .
Result – financial malpractice for a short - term fix .
Consequences – " financial Armageddon " according to Williams .
M3 ( the broadest money supply measure ) growth is so high that the Fed no longer reports it .
Economists like Williams do because it ’s crucial to know , and the data he reveals are disturbing – record M3 growth at a near 18 % annual pace .
Hyperinflationary seeds are now sown .
Dollar valuation is falling , and at some point may accelerate when investors flee it for safer havens .
The Fed again will respond .
More debt will be monetized .
It will build over time .
Things will get worse and then be exacerbated when the government is less able to meet its obligations .
" Therein lies the ultimate basis for the pending hyperinflation , " in Williams ’ judgment .
He believes it will morph into a hyperinflationary depression , then a " great depression . "
And when it hits , it will be with " surprising speed . "
Already disposable income is falling in a weakened economy in crisis .
As things worsen , politicians get blamed , and Williams raises an interesting possibility .
If conditions get bad enough , voters may respond with their feet , declare a pox on both major parties , and turn to a third alternative around 2010 or 2012 .
It happened before in our history .
The Republican Party is Exhibit A .
It was created in 1854 at a time Democrats and Whigs were the two dominant parties .
Exit Whigs , and enter Republicans with Abraham Lincoln its first elected president in 1860 .
Williams shows US inflation data going back to 1665 .
It was fairly stable up to the Fed ’s 1913 creation .
It then began rising and accelerated post - WW II .
Government calculations mask it .
Alternative ones are more revealing and accurate .
Except for minor price declines in 1944 and 1955 , the US has n’t had a deflationary period since the 1930s .
Abandoning the gold standard is why .
It imposed monetary discipline .
Roosevelt went off it in 1933 .
He had to .
The banking system collapsed , money supply imploded , and economic stimulus was needed .
It released the Fed to create money freely .
Therein lies the problem , and it shows up in the numbers .
Current Fed Chairman Bernanke and Alan Greenspan are students of the Great Depression .
" Helicopter Ben " especially vowed never again , and his actions prove it to a fault .
He knows the risks and stated them in an earlier speech .
He said :
" Like gold , US dollars have value only to the extent that they are strictly limited in supply .
But the US government has a technology called a printing press ( now its electronic equivalent ) , that allows it to produce as many US dollars as it wishes . "
By doing so , it " reduce (s ) the value of a dollar in terms of goods and services " which raises their prices …." under a paper - money system , a determined government can always generate higher spending and hence positive inflation . "
So it has , according to Williams , and it caused a " slow - motion destruction of the US dollar ’s purchasing power " since 1933 .
It shows up in GAAP - based 2007 federal deficit figures – $ 4 trillion for the fiscal year , not the official $ 163 fiction reported .
Williams estimates total outstanding federal obligations at $ 62.6 trillion .
At least one other economist puts it over $ 80 trillion .
There ’s no way to honor this debt level , so the " government effectively is bankrupt . "
At that point , it has three choices – default , declare a moratorium , or repudiate the entire amount .
Sooner or later , markets will react .
Holders of US debt already are balking , but so far modestly and quietly .
Ahead , that may change if dollar valuations plunge .
It will force the Fed ’s hand .
Greater debt monetization will follow .
Dollar valuations will sink further , and so forth in a progressive downward cycle to oblivion if Williams is right .
If conditions get severe enough , the Fed can create huge amounts of currency in a few days or weeks – enough to match the dollar ’s lost purchasing power in the last 75 years .
Combine it with fiscal irresponsibility and imagine the consequences .
Official data alone today are reason for concern – soaring food and oil prices , the dollar near historic lows , money growth at an all - time high , and off - the - charts federal deficits and debt .
The trend continues , and it shows up in gold prices – topping $ 1000 , then retreating , but nearly certain to soar way above previous highs on its way to numbers not discussed in the mainstream – $ 2000 an ounce , $ 3000 ?
Who knows .
Williams sees it " setting new historic highs . "
In 1980 , its price hit $ 850 an ounce .
In CPI inflation - adjusted terms , around $ 2300 an ounce would match it today .
But if the government had n’t cooked the CPI calculation , the number would be about $ 6250 an ounce .
By that standard , gold today is cheap .
It ’s way below its real 1980 top , and if inflation accelerates as Williams predicts , expect much higher prices as dollars keep deflating .
Under this scenario , the " US government cannot cover ( its ) existing obligations . "
Annual federal deficits are " careening wildly out of control , averaging $ 4.6 trillion per year for the six years through 2007 . "
That ’s with all unfunded liabilities included like Social Security , Medicare , Medicaid , other social services , debt service and more .
Williams says things are so out of control that " if the government ( raised taxes ) to seize 100 % of all wages , salaries and corporate profits , it still would ( show ) an annual deficit using GAAP accounting " methods .
At the same time , " given current revenues , if it stopped ( all ) spending ( including defense and homeland security ) other than Social Security and Medicare obligations , the government still would ( show ) an annual deficit . "
The hole is so deep , it ’s impossible to dig out , according to Williams .
But given political realities , officials spend whatever it takes to get elected and keep their jobs .
That ’s besides foreign wars , limitless corporate subsidies and more .
Things , however , wo n’t improve .
They ’ll worsen , and that for Williams spells hyperinflation ahead .
It ’s happening " with the full knowledge of political Washington and the Federal Reserve . "
It it were n’t for the US ’s " special position , " our debt would likely be rated " below investment grade instead of triple - A . "
Longer term bonds are especially risky .
At some point , they ’ll lose their full value .
They also risk default , and that ’s besides their loss in dollar terms .
It ’s just a matter of time before foreign investors get worried enough to act – buying fewer Treasuries down to none , then followed by redemptions .
The Fed will have to compensate .
Print more currency , and the problem deepens .
Its value declines and inflation accelerates .
Trade policies worsen things .
We ’re in a global race to the bottom .
The once bedrock manufacturing base eroded .
It ’s now 10 % of the economy and falling .
Services currently account for around 84 % of it and rising .
Jobs in all categories are being offshored to low - wage countries .
Average inflation - adjusted wages keep declining .
Real earnings are below their early 1970s peak .
Living standards are falling .
Consumer debt is rising to make up the shortfall .
Savings are liquidated .
Before the housing decline , mortgage refinancing helped when valuations rose .
It meant taking on more debt .
Fed policy encouraged it .
Today ’s dilemma " is payback " for unsustainable bubble - creation policies .
Recalling a relevant quote : " Things that ca n’t go on forever wo n’t . "
Bad policy caused enormous structural change , and trade deficits are part of it .
They ’ve " risen to the highest level for any country in history . "
They ’re one more problem for a seriously over - extended economy .
It places " the federal government and Federal Reserve in untenable positions , where they cannot easily or rapidly address the underlying problems , even if standard economic stimuli were available . "
Given the federal deficit and out - of - control spending , fiscal policy limits have been reached .
The Fed ’s in the same bind .
It can neither stimulate the economy or contain inflation .
Rate cuts have done little .
Saving the dollar may require raising them , but that wo n’t " contain non-demand driven inflation . "
It shows up in high food , energy , health care , and companies like Dow Chemical announcing on May 28 that it will raise prices across the board up to 20 % to offset increased costs .
More cause for worry , and Williams anticipates depression .
Hyperinflation will follow , and it will sink " the economy into a great depression . "
It will halt commercial activity .
The greater disparity in income , the more negative its consequences .
" Extremes in income variance usually are followed by financial panics and economic depressions .
US income variance today is higher " than in 1929 and " nearly double that of any other ‘ advanced ’ economy . "
Federal bailouts have worsened things .
Dollar creation exploded .
Crisis has been pushed into the future .
Its enormity will be far greater , and foreign investors will get stuck with a lot of it .
When it arrives in strength , capital outflow will follow , and dollar valuation will plunge with it .
Williams believes that " both central bank and major private investors know that the dollar is going to be a losing proposition .
They either expect and / or hope that they can get of ( it ) in time to lock in their profits ( or for central bankers ) that they can forestall the ultimate global economic crisis " as long as possible .
Dollars are very vulnerable in this environment .
If Treasuries are dumped , the Fed will monetize debt to make up the difference .
Inflation will then accelerate , multi-trillion dollar deficits will worsen things , and a " self - feeding cycle of currency debasement and hyperinflation " will follow .
Cash as we know it will disappear .
A barter system and black market will replace it or possible introduction of a new currency .
Since most money today is electronic , not physical , chances of it adapting " are practically nil . "
With hyperinflation , electronic commerce would completely shut down and economic collapse would follow .
Gold and silver will be invaluable .
Holders could exchange them for goods and services .
Physical goods will also be precious for survival and as a medium of exchange .
Anything with a long shelf life may be stocked in advance , and providers of essential services could barter them for goods and other services .
Forewarned is forearmed .
Safety and liquidity are crucial .
Anything retaining value is essential .
Real estate , other currencies for example .
Foreign equities and debt to a small degree because US financial assets hammering will spill everywhere .
With all that to deal with , consider another dilemma – the likelihood of painful political change , civil unrest , disruptive violence , and utter chaos .
If Williams is right and hyperinflation arrives , Katie bar the door on what may follow .
Revolutions are possible with three notable last century ones to consider – in Russia , Weimer Germany and Nationalist China .
In each case , the old order ended , everything changed , but not for the good .
How does Williams advise ?
Evaluate one ’s own circumstances , use common sense , and forewarned is forearmed .
That will help , but hard times hurt everyone .
Hopefully they wo n’t arrive , at least not full - blown as Williams predicts .
But make no mistake .
Excess has a price .
The more of it the greater .
America has an ocean of it .
Sooner or later comes payback .
" Things that ca n’t go on forever wo n’t . "

Chastity belts , which went out of fashion with knights in shining armor and damsels in distress , are making a comeback in the massage parlors of East Java .
In a bid to prevent any hanky - panky between masseuses and their clients , several massage parlors in the hill resort town of Batu are insisting that the women wear padlocks across the zippers of their work pants .
Franky Setiawan , owner of Doghado Massage Parlor , says he came up with the idea when men “ bombarded ” his staff with demands for sex after local authorities shut down the town ’s brothels .
In recent years , conservative Islamic values have gained influence in a society that has long enjoyed liberal freedoms , such as easy access to alcohol , gambling and the sex trade .
“ We had a hard time rejecting this kind of client because they try over and over and over again , persuading our workers with their dangerously sweet words , ” Setiawan said by phone this month from Batu , explaining that he wanted his 14 masseuses to feel safe and morally upstanding , while protecting the massage industry ’s image .
Advertisement
But Meutia Fardia Hatta Swasono , minister for women ’s empowerment in the world ’s most populous Muslim nation , calls the return of the chastity belt an affront to all women .
“ It is not the right way to prevent promiscuity .
It insults women as if they are the ones in the wrong , ” she told reporters this month .
“ It is not that we oppose the administration ’s effort to uphold morality , but the problem is their way of treating masseuses as if they ’re all committing prostitution . ”
A 27 - year - old masseuse , who identified herself only as Sani , said she knew that padlocked pants came with the job at Setiawan ’s place when she joined 18 months ago , “ so it ’s nothing special . ”
“ We find it comfortable wearing them , ” said the mother of two children .

A clothing designer before getting into the massage business in 2000 , Setiawan called on his garment - making skills to create his lockable uniform .
The chastity belts of Renaissance Europe were often bulky contraptions made of iron plates , maybe with the rough edges taken off by touches of velvet or leather .
Setiawan wanted something much more minimalist .
“ I considered the fashion trend when designing the uniform , ” he said .
He settled on black pants that zip up at the side , where a padlock is slipped through two cloth loops and snapped shut each time a masseuse meets a client .

The uniform includes a red blouse worn each day except Mondays and Fridays , the Muslim holy day , when his employees wear batik shirts .
All of them have zippers up the back , which remain unlocked , Setiawan said .
He stores the padlocks and keys in a special box at the cashier ’s counter .
When a customer arrives for a massage , given in a private room behind a curtain , the “ cashier calls one masseuse , asks her to prepare things and locks her pants , ” Setiawan said .
“ Because the masseuse knows the drill , she usually pees before that .
And when the client is done , the masseuse comes to the cashier , and the cashier opens the padlock . ”
Once in a while , Setiawan said , he checks to make sure no one lifts the keys to cut copies .
Advertisement
Locking up women ’s pants seemed such an elegant solution , Setiawan suggested that other massage parlor owners try it during a meeting of their association about two months ago , when the main item on the agenda was “ how to handle some naughty guests . ”
At least four owners agreed to start dressing their masseuses in similar uniforms and padlocks , he said , and others plan to follow suit soon .
But local reports have portrayed the move as a government order .
Municipal official Imam Suryono said : “ This new policy is still in the form of a suggestion .
But in the future , we expect this policy to be enacted as city legislation . ”
Putting women and their pants under lock and key has inflamed an already heated national debate over the government ’s role in enforcing morality and strikes many here as bureaucracy run amok .

Last month , Indonesia ’s parliament passed a bill that makes it a crime to look at violent or pornographic material on the Internet .
The penalty is up to three years in prison .
News that massage parlors were clamping down on prostitution soon followed , and with all the publicity , Setiawan is suddenly losing customers .
Many of them never knew that they were getting kneaded and soothed by securely fastened women because the padlocks were hidden beneath their long tops , he said .
“ It ’s not because of the padlocks , but because they are not comfortable with the journalists ” poking around , he added .
The objections of Swasono , the women ’s empowerment minister , were echoed on the editorial pages of the Jakarta Post , where the majority of 26 reader comments published one day this month ridiculed locking up women ’s pants .
Advertisement
Some called it a throwback to the Middle Ages , or even the Stone Age .
Calling for fair treatment , one said , “ The customers ’ hands should be chained too to prevent them from sexually harassing the masseuse . ”
Another suggested that modern technology offered a better solution : monitoring the women and their clients by closed - circuit TV .
Amid news that officials in the capital , Jakarta , were weighing the padlock option for its massage parlors , a Post reader wrote , “ Jakarta should consider locking up the hands of politicians to prevent corrupt officials from taking bribes . ”

The liberal anti-war group MoveOn.org today launched a petition drive calling on former White House official Scott McClellan to donate the proceeds of his book to veterans of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan .
The petition drive , intended to create pressure for Mr. McClellan to be asked about it on the morning news - interview shows Sunday , is the latest signal of a backlash by Democrats and Republicans alike against the former press secretary for turning on his ex-boss , President Bush .
MoveOn ’s petition e-mail , sent out to its supporters Saturday morning , said that Mr. McClellan ’s “ coming clean is admirable . ”
“ But McClellan should n’t profit off the role he played in our nation ’s largest foreign policy blunder , ” the release reads .
“ After spending years defending the Bush administration and perpetuating the lies that led our country into war , Scott McClellan is poised to make bank — his tell - all book is a bestseller and he may make hundreds of thousands or millions , ” MoveOn says .
“ Meanwhile , our troops are still dying in Iraq . ”
Mr. McClellan ’s new book , “ What Happened : Inside the Bush White House and Washington ’s Culture of Deception , ” accuses the Bush administration of going to war in Iraq on false pretenses and of over - hyping the weapons of mass destruction threat .
The tome rocketed to No. 1 on Amazon.com this week in advance of its release Monday after copies were obtained in advance by a handful of newspapers , including The Washington Times , on Tuesday night .
Conservative bloggers critical of Mr. McClellan have pointed out that former Pentagon official Douglas J. Feith , one of the war ’s architects , is donating his proceeds from his new book , “ War and Decision : Inside the Pentagon at the Dawn of the War on Terrorism , ” to a group he set up to help war veterans .
Mr. McClellan , a 40 - year - old Texan who worked for Mr. Bush when he was governor of Texas and worked in the White House for six years , will appear Sunday on NBC ’s “ Meet the Press ” and on ABC ’s “ This Week . ”
“ If we make enough noise , he ’ll probably be asked about it on tomorrow ’s Sunday shows , ” MoveOn said .
The liberal group ’s move to shame Mr. McClellan into giving his money away is the most recent slam on him for being a turncoat .
Terry McAuliffe , the former head of the Democratic National Committee who now is chairman of Sen.
Hillary Rodham Clinton ’s presidential campaign committee , said Mr. McClellan was “ wrong ” to write the book .
“ I find it abhorrent the way these people come out and write books about their boss .
It made ‘em money , it made ‘em prestige , it gave them all this power and then they turn around and slap ‘ em , ” Mr. McAuliffe said in an interview this week with National Journal .
“ I do n’t care who it is — Democrat , Republican — it ’s wrong , ” he said .
And on Thursday , former Republican Sen. Bob Dole , of Kansas , sent an e-mail to Mr. McClellan directly calling him a “ miserable creature ” and also suggesting that he donate his profits , though in a different way than MoveOn did .
“ There are miserable creatures like you in every administration who do n’t have the guts to speak up or quit if there are disagreements with the boss or colleagues , ” Mr. Dole wrote .
“ No , your type soaks up the benefits of power , revels in the limelight for years , then quits and , spurred on by greed , cashes in with a scathing critique . ”
Mr. Dole said that “ when the money starts rolling in you should donate it to a worthy cause , something like , ‘ Biting The Hand That Fed Me . ’ ”
“ You should have spoken up publicly like a man , or quit your cushy , high - profile job , ” Mr. Dole said .
“ You ’re a hot ticket now , but do n’t you , deep down , feel like a total ingrate ? ”
Mr. McClellan responded to Mr. Dole publicly , saying , “ I have had time to reflect and go back , and what I ’m saying is sincere . ”
“ I have a lot of respect for Sen . Dole , ” he added .

Yeah , this one 's a rumour .
A crazy rumour , right ?
Maybe not as crazy as you think , so bear with us .
Here 's what Quartermann says in the latest issue of EGM :
We 'll tell you what 's up with Microsoft : new hardware options .
It may sound totally insane — trust us , we did a double - take the first time Qmann whispered it in our ears — but word has it that Microsoft may begin allowing third - party manufacturers to create Xbox 360 hardware .
And we 're not talking about peripherals , people ; we mean hardware that runs 360 game discs created by someone other than Microsoft .

Nuts nuts , yes ?
Probably .
But at least think about it .
It 's not like such a move would be without precedent .
You could purchase Sega CD drives for PCs .
Panasonic released the Q , a Japan - only GameCube that doubled as a DVD player .
And we 've heard whispers that Microsoft have also been exploring the idea of releasing 360 - compatible disc drives for the PC .
Not that any of that makes the prospect of seeing , say , a Samsung Xbox 360 / Blu- Ray player any more likely ( as the rumour seems to suggest ) , but hey , crazier things have happened .

Bright Chunks at Phoenix Lander 's Mars Site Must Have Been Ice

TUCSON , Ariz . – Dice - size crumbs of bright material have vanished from inside a trench where they were photographed by NASA 's Phoenix Mars Lander four days ago , convincing scientists that the material was frozen water that vaporized after digging exposed it .
" It must be ice , " said Phoenix Principal Investigator Peter Smith of the University of Arizona , Tucson .
" These little clumps completely disappearing over the course of a few days , that is perfect evidence that it 's ice .
There had been some question whether the bright material was salt .
Salt can't do that .
" The chunks were left at the bottom of a trench informally called " Dodo - Goldilocks " when Phoenix 's Robotic Arm enlarged that trench on June 15 , during the 20th Martian day , or sol , since landing .
Several were gone when Phoenix looked at the trench early today , on Sol 24 .
Also early today , digging in a different trench , the Robotic Arm connected with a hard surface that has scientists excited about the prospect of next uncovering an icy layer .
The Phoenix science team spent Thursday analyzing new images and data successfully returned from the lander earlier in the day .
Studying the initial findings from the new " Snow White 2 " trench , located to the right of " Snow White 1 , " Ray Arvidson of Washington University in St. Louis , co-investigator for the robotic arm , said , " We have dug a trench and uncovered a hard layer at the same depth as the ice layer in our other trench .
" On Sol 24 , Phoenix extended the first trench in the middle of a polygon at the " Wonderland " site .
While digging , the Robotic Arm came upon a firm layer , and after three attempts to dig further , the arm went into a holding position .
Such an action is expected when the Robotic Arm comes upon a hard surface .
Meanwhile , the spacecraft team at Lockheed Martin Space Systems in Denver is preparing a software patch to send to Phoenix in a few days so scientific data can again be saved onboard overnight when needed .
Because of a large amount a duplicative file - maintenance data generated by the spacecraft Tuesday , the team is taking the precaution of not storing science data in Phoenix 's flash memory , and instead downlinking it at the end of every day , until the conditions that produced those duplicative data files are corrected .
" We now understand what happened , and we can fix it with a software patch , " said Phoenix Project Manager Barry Goldstein of NASA 's Jet Propulsion Laboratory , Pasadena .
" Our three - month schedule has 30 days of margin for contingencies like this , and we have used only one contingency day out of 24 sols .
The mission is well ahead of schedule .
We are making excellent progress toward full mission success .
" The Phoenix mission is led by Smith of the University of Arizona with project management at JPL and development partnership at Lockheed Martin , located in Denver .
International contributions come from the Canadian Space Agency ; the University of Neuchatel , Switzerland ; the universities of Copenhagen and Aarhus , Denmark ; Max Planck Institute , Germany ; and the Finnish Meteorological Institute .

this february , the Pew Forum on Religion & Public Life released the most comprehensive of its surveys of the “ religious landscape ” of the United States .
Front and center was the finding that 26 percent of American adults — around 54 million — are evangelical Protestants .
The idea that 1 in every 4 of us thumps a Bible only confirmed what many had assumed to be gospel since 2000 , when evangelical voters were credited with winning the White House for George W. Bush and the media began its grand genuflections toward a resurgent fundamentalism , casting evangelicals ( and more broadly , “ values voters ” ) as a politicized wedge that politicians ignored at their peril .
And who could blame them ?
Not only are evangelicals supposedly our biggest religious voting bloc , but Pew reports that nearly 80 percent of Americans are Christian , and 40 percent attend church weekly according to Gallup Polls .
But what if those numbers — and everything we ’ve assumed they tell us about the power of the religious right — are wildly wrong ?
Take that 40 percent church attendance stat .
Looking around her half - empty Southern Baptist church outside Dallas , Christine Wicker had her doubts .
Wicker , a veteran Texas newspaper reporter , was born again when she was nine but drifted away from her evangelical roots in adulthood .
A few years ago , she returned to the Southern Baptist Church to both renew her faith and write The Fall of the Evangelical Nation , an insider ’s look at evangelicals ’ power , wading in where secular journalists feared to tread .
When she started looking into the numbers on church attendance , she found that researchers could vouch for only 18 percent of Americans being regular churchgoers — less than half the accepted figure .
That led her to wonder about the already widely reported claim that 25 percent of Americans are evangelicals ; could the real number also be less than half that ?
In size , only the Catholic Church dwarfs the Southern Baptist Church , the biggest evangelical denomination and by far the most organized and fastidious of the Protestant record keepers .
But Wicker discovered that the numbers the Southern Baptist Convention ( sbc ) releases for public consumption tell a much different story than the ones it uses internally .
The organization claims 16 million members , but as one reverend cracks , “ the fbi could n’t find half of [ them ] if they had to . ”
A 2006 sbc report states that only 11 million of its members live in the same area as their home church anymore ; that number includes those who ’ve been double - or even triple - counted elsewhere .
It also includes perennial no -shows and those who attend services at “ bedside Baptist ” ( they sleep in on Sunday but show up for Easter and Christmas ) .
And that ’s not to mention those who ’ve lost their religion or converted to another faith .
If their names were ever on “ the roll ” at a Baptist church , they ’re probably inscribed there for life .
With more digging , Wicker came across a 2007 sbc report that found only 5.4 million adults attended services regularly enough to be considered church members .
Further complicating matters , many of those who regularly filled the pews were n’t official members , and , most significantly , 1 in 8 was n’t saved or born again .
Factoring all this in , Wicker calculated that there are fewer than 4 million devoted Southern Baptists .
Her math seems to be backed up by collection - plate totals :
If the church truly has 16 million members , then they contributed a miserly $ 3.50 each to a nationwide fundraising campaign last year .
And it ’s not just the Southern Baptists who appear to be playing number games .
The National Association of Evangelicals , an umbrella group that does not include the sbc , claimed 30 million members on its website .
When Wicker contacted the association for comment , the figure changed to 4.5 million .
No one there could — or would — explain the sudden 85 percent drop in believers .
( However , the group ’s website currently describes its lobbying arm as the voice of “ 30 million Americans united under a common banner . ” )
The emperor ’s - new - clothes flimsiness of these widely accepted exaggerated numbers says much about the cold calculation of far - right religious leaders .
Moral Majority and Focus on the Family have happily staked their clout on coreligionists who never knew they were being counted — often twice or three times — among the faithful for political ends .
“ The idea that evangelicals are taking over America is one of the greatest publicity scams in history , ” Wicker concludes , “ a perfect coup accomplished by savvy politicos and religious leaders , who understand media weaknesses and exploit them brilliantly . ”
Though she does n’t delve into those weaknesses , Wicker ’s findings speak volumes about the limitations of a Fourth Estate that accepted and uncritically deferred to the power of the religious right .
Having been handed a ready - made story line by the thou - shalt - not brigades , the media became transfixed by a phenomenon they could n’t fully fathom but felt bound to report on .
Those unexamined numbers and claims of followers in theological lockstep launched a thousand cover stories and columns — rarely prompting questions about what a term as broad as “ evangelical ” really meant on the ground .
Whether they viewed it as a new political reality , a megatrend , or a bogeyman , the media embraced the idea of a reenergized , monolithic Christianity and faithfully chronicled something that did n’t exist .
Part of the problem is that the national - level journalists who control the discourse tend not to be , nor have they ever been , committed religionists as adults .
Newsrooms are determinedly secular , and self - consciously so .
Afraid of being tagged as godless liberals , most journalists would never dream of calling BS on believers .
Which may explain why Wicker ’s book could only have been written by a born - and - bred Baptist .
Innumeracy and gutlessness aside , why did we never ask ourselves if the label “ evangelical ” tells us anything more than the yarmulke or the head scarf on the person next to us at Starbucks ?
To assume that evangelicals overwhelmingly oppose divorce , abortion , and gay rights ; that they believe in school prayer and intelligent design ; and that they ’re overwhelmingly politicized is a gross oversimplification that evangelicals themselves ought to find disquieting .
As Wicker suggests , perhaps one ’s answer to the drone who interrupts dinner to ask your “ religious preference ” is more reflex than exit poll .
Wicker finds that many of the most active believers belong to both a small “ home ” church and a megachurch where they “ vacation . ”
And as the most recent Pew study shows , 44 percent of Americans say they have switched their religious affiliation or moved between periods of declaring a faith and religious free agency .
Religious identity , it turns out , is as fluid as any other .
It is with believable regret that Wicker pulls the threadbare rug out from under the “ powerful ” Christian far right .
“ Just as I had finished convincing myself that the evangelical church was smarter and had more to offer than ever — I ’m still convinced of that — I was hit with the growing suspicion that the entire faith might be sinking fast , ” she writes .
She ’s probably right that old - school fundamentalism is going the way of the dinosaurs .
The Southern Baptist Church ’s much - publicized effort to baptize a million souls in 2006 was a dismal failure ; only one - third of that number “ bathed in Jordan ’s water . ”
According to George Barna , an independent evangelical researcher who tracks spiritual trends , 20 million born - again Christians are moving beyond formal churchgoing , meeting in small groups , often in each other ’s homes .
He predicts that by 2025 , local churches will have lost half of their current “ market share . ”
No doubt many of those leaving the church find fire and brimstone as anathema as any liberal but still believe that there is a living God who loves them .
If there are as few evangelicals as Wicker claims , can we ink - stained wretches go back to ignoring them ?
Not so fast .
Religion will always be of more cultural significance than the mere number of its adherents , especially as the United States becomes ever more diverse and other religious traditions clamor to be heard .
We will have to go on respecting Christianity and deferring to its oversize voice in public affairs if only because all those bedside Baptists might just stop sleeping in on Sunday if the beliefs they rarely dust off suddenly come under attack .
Still ,
The Fall of the Evangelical Nation makes plain that the media must be doggedly skeptical whenever faith - based constituencies claim their place in the public square .
Maybe all us godless liberal journalists need to get religion about confronting America ’s most sacred cow .

There were 28 rebel attacks during the construction of the rail link
What are the human costs of building a railway link in one of India 's most restive regions ?
To begin with , 36 people - railway workers and security forces guarding the tracks - died in some 28 rebel attacks during work to link the north - eastern city of Agartala in Tripura state to the rest of the country .
That 's not all .
A total of 67 people connected with work on the rail link were kidnapped by the rebels .
Only 19 were freed after ransom payouts .
The fate of the rest is still unknown .
On top of all that , a raging tribal insurgency in Tripura has ensured that the $ 186 m , 109 km - long ( 68 - mile ) link took 15 years to build .
But by the end of June , the link will be complete and Agartala will become the second state capital of north - east India - after Assam 's capital , Guwahati - to find a place on India 's railway map .
Big network Trains first reached Tripura in 1964 when the railway was extended to the state 's northern business hub , Dharmanagar .
Later it was extended further to Kumarghat .
" But it has taken more than 40 years since then to connect Agartala by rail , " said Tripura Chief Minister Manik Sarkar .
In the last two years , Tripura 's communist - led government has successfully contained the tribal insurgency .
Indian Prime Minister Manmohan
Singh has declared the railway link in Tripura a national project and more connections are planned .
The link runs to the Tripura capital , Agartala ( Photo : Debiprasad Bhowmik )
Next on the cards is the extension of the railway from Agartala to southern Tripura .
FS Meena , chief engineer of the Northeast Frontier Railway , said work to build the 110 km Agartala - Sabroom line would begin by January .
The project would cost almost as much as the one just completed to connect Agartala .
" After Indian Railways extends its line up to Sabroom , it would be very easy to connect with the Chittagong international port in Bangladesh , which is just 75 km from there , " says Manik Sarkar .
India recently signed a deal with Burma to upgrade the Sittwe port so that goods from Indian ports can land there and then be taken up to India 's Mizoram state by river for onward shipment to other north - east Indian states .
" But if Bangladesh plays ball and allows Chittagong to be used for north - east Indian states , we will have an alternative access to the north - east from the Indian mainland , " said Mr Sarkar .
The first train in the subcontinent ran on a 33 km ( 21 - mile ) stretch of track from Mumbai ( Bombay ) to Thane in western India in 1853 .
The first passenger train rolled out of the eastern city of Calcutta the following year .
Today , Indian Railways operate at least 11,000 trains every day covering 63,465 km ( 39,435 miles ) across the length and breadth of the country , making it one of the world 's largest rail networks .

I watched another really great video lecture .
It 's called ' From Nand to Tetris - Building a Modern Computer From First Principles ' .
At first I thought it was just a video lecture by some computer hobbyist , but it turned out to be a lecture about a new computer science course for both undergraduate and graduate students , developed by professor Shimon Schocken .
The goal of this course is to teach students various levels of abstractions in computing by letting them build a computer from scratch and have it run a computer game .
One of Shimon Schocken 's colleagues says that , " Computer science is a thousand layers of abstraction " , which is quite true .
If we write a program in a high level language , it gets translated into assembly language which in turn gets translated into machine code , which in turn gets executed on hardware platform , which in turn uses logic gates to perform computation which is itself electrical engineering and physics .
This video lecture briefly explains all of these abstractions ( except physics ) .
Before you watch the lecture ( it 's 1 hour long ) , you might first want to view a 10 minute introduction , to see if you 're interested in this topic :
And here is the whole 1 hour lecture :
Moments from the lecture :

[ 53:43 ]
Summary of both hardware and software parts .
[ 57:45 ] Q and A !
Great news about the course this lecture talks about is that you can actually take it on your own , if you buy Mr. Shimon 's book The Elements of Computing Systems .
The book covers all the 12 steps in building the computer .
Shimon makes the necessary software , such as HDL , the testing suite and other programs available on book 's website .
The course goes under a few different titles , such as ' Digital System Construction ' , ' Elements of Computing Systems ' , and the same ' From Nand to Tetris ' , depending on university .
Apart from that , Professor Shimon Schocken mentioned a few famous computer scientists during his talk .
I got interested , and wrote them down for your convenience :
Have fun getting smarter with each lecture and until next time .
Where does fascism come from ?
The first records of the word fascism in English come from around the 1920s .
It comes from the Italian fascismo , from fascio , meaning “ political group . ”
Mussolini formed these small political groups into a political party , Partito Nazionale Fascista — the National Fascist Party .
Fascism and the Italian fascio ultimately derive from the Latin fascis , meaning “ bundle ” ( the plural form is fasces ) .
In ancient Rome , fasces consisted of a bundle of rods with an axe blade sticking out .
This was used as a symbol of a government official ’s power .
The Italian fascists brought back the fasces as a symbol of their brand of nationalism , which became known as fascism .
The suffix - ism indicates a doctrine or set of principles .
As an ideology , fascism typically centers around extreme nationalism and an opposition to democracy and liberalism .
In practice , fascism revolves around a ruler who uses absolute power to suppress the individual freedom of citizens , making everyone completely subject to the power of the state .
To achieve this , fascism often uses violent methods for political ends .
In the context of a fascist government , this often involves the use of the military against citizens .
Fascist leaders typically gain support by appealing to people ’s nationalism and racism , especially by promoting suspicion or hatred of people that they label as foreigners or otherwise cast as illegitimate citizens — as Hitler did with the Jews in Germany .
Such leaders often reinforce these themes among their followers with rallies and mass parades ( developing what ’s sometimes called a cult of personality ) .
Fascism is often considered a form of totalitarianism , in which the government controls almost every aspect of ordinary life .
( Some left - wing forms of government , such as forms of communism , are also considered to be totalitarian . )
Today , the terms fascist and fascism are often applied in a general way to practices that resemble those of military dictatorships , especially when based on nationalism , racism , and authoritarian rule .
What is antifascism ?
Antifascism is active opposition to fascism .
Those who actively oppose fascism can be called antifascists .
The first antifascist groups were those opposed to the rule of Mussolini , but there have been many others since then .
The term antifascist is the basis of the word Antifa , which typically refers to a movement that opposes fascism .
Hundreds of rebels from Sudan 's troubled Darfur region reached the outskirts of the capital , Khartoum for the first time Saturday and clashed with security forces , rebel and government officials said .
Sudan 's army deployed on the streets of Khartoum , putting up checkpoints and imposing an overnight curfew .
An Interior Ministry statement said the curfew was in effect while the government was " dealing with the infiltrators . "
State television showed footage of burning trucks and other cars pockmarked by bullets .
At least one body was sprawled in a dusty street , covered in cloth , and another victim was slumped in the cab of a jeep nearby .
The clashes come after government warnings that the Justice and Equality Movement , [ JEM ] one of Darfur 's main rebel movements , was going to target Khartoum .
Saturday 's attack is the closest the rebels have ever gotten to the capital .
After nightfall , Interior Minister Ibrahim Mahmoud Hamed told state TV that government troops had successfully expelled the rebels from the city but were still searching for possible remnants of the force .
The government also extended the curfew in Khartoum , saying some rebel fighters have shed their uniforms and are hiding among civilians .
In a statement , the military said that " elements " of JEM had infiltrated northern Omdurman , across the River Nile from Khartoum .
The statement said the Sudanese forces had stopped the main advance of the JEM forces in nighbouring Kordofan province but that a few had reached Khartoum .
Rebels vow to fight on
JEM leader Abu Zumam , however , told The Associated Press by telephone that hundreds of his fighters had reached Omdurman and engaged government forces .
Gunfire could be heard in the background .
" We entered Omdurman by force , " he said , adding that his army of some 700 vehicles planned to take over the state radio building in the city .
JEM once confined its activities to Darfur , where local ethnic African rebels took up arms against the Arab - dominated central government in 2003 complaining of discrimination .
Nearly 300,000 people have died in the Darfur region , and millions have fled to neighbouring countries , other parts of Africa and the rest of the world .
An embattled force of peacekeepers , authorized by the UN and made up largely of soldiers from African countries , has had little impact on the situation so far .
The peacekeepers and aid workers are often targets of the Sudanese government - backed militias that are fighting the rebels , and have been heavily criticized for human rights abuses .
Sudan 's government insists the conflict is an internal matter and has done little to assist international efforts in support of the victims of violence in Darfur .
Pi is a mathematical constant that is the ratio of a circle 's circumference to its diameter , and it is also one of the most revered mathematical constants in the known world .
[ 1 ]
Pi Day was first officially celebrated on a large scale in 1988 at the San Francisco Exploratorium .
[ 2 ]
Since then , Pi Day has been celebrated by millions of students and math - lovers each year .
The holiday is celebrated on 14th March , since 3 ( the month of March ) 1 and 4 ( the 14th day ) are the first three and most well - known digits in the decimal form of pi .
Though you can observe this fun little holiday however you choose , there are a few pi day celebrations that are popular and guarantee a good time for everyone !
In my previous post - downloading youtube videos with a Perl one - liner - I used Perl 's special variable $ _.
This is just one of many Perl 's special variables .
One day last year I decided to go through all the Perl 's special variables carefully so I could become a better Perl programmer and make a cheat sheet which I could always keep on my desk and look things up when needed .
As I explained in the previous cheat - sheet post ( awk 's cheat sheet ) , the cheat sheets are for learning things better and not doing things blindly and looking the stuff each time up .
Here is another example why cheat sheets are helpful - suppose you programmed for 5 hours and then sat back in your chair to relax for 10 minutes .
You could relax by taking cheat sheet in your hands and just scan through it and remember a thing or two .
This cheat sheet contains all the perl 's special variables , their description and examples where possible .
It can be nicely printed on one sheet of paper by having two pages per side .
Two on one side and two on other .
That 's how I have printed it .
Available as usual in .doc and .pdf formats .

風俗の仕事は、スタイルや見た目によって人気がでて稼げるのではないかと思われている方も少ないないでしょう。実際、太ったり、痩せたりは、人気に影響しますが、ぽっちゃりだから稼げないというわけではありません。ただし、動くのに負担にならないスタイルを維持することは大切です。ここでは、風俗アルバイトと体型の関係について説明します。
風俗バイトは肉体的にハード
体型の話に入る前に、風俗の仕事内容は体力勝負です。体を使う分にハードであることは覚えておきましょう。デリヘルやファッションヘルス、ホテヘルといった仕事であれば素股プレイが基本となるので、女性側が率先して動く必要もあります。また、一日に何人もお客さんの相手をすることもありますから、肉体的疲労は大きくなってしまいます。
さらに、最近はマッサージ系のソフトサービスを売りにする風俗店も人気となっています。しかし、いくらソフトサービスと呼ばれていたとしても、慣れなうちは特に、大変さを感じるかもしれません。
このように一口に風俗と言ってもプレイ内容は様々ですから、求められるスタミナも変わってきます。しかし、中でも一番体力を使う業種と言えばソープランドでしょう。マットプレイは独特なうえに、身体をすり合わせるのにコツも必要で、滑りやすいローションを垂らしたマットの上ですから思って以上に疲れてしまいます。
業種でのサービスの違いは、事前に知っておくと体力に自信がない方が大変に感じることを減らせるでしょう。また、痩せたり太ったりしたことで体力が低下してしまうことはできる限り避けたほうが無難です。原則的には、自分の体型を維持することを優先しましょう。
ピルの副作用で太ることもある
風俗で働くのなら、体型の維持が大切です。意外と注意しなくてはいけないのがピルです。実は、ピルには副作用があり、これが原因で太ったという女性もいます。その他にも副作用があったり、そもそも複数の種類があって、人による相性があったりします。この点については、医師と確認をとりながら自分の体にあったものを探してください。
また、風俗店の中には、高級志向を取り入れている店舗もあります。代表的なのは「高級ソープランド」「高級デリヘル」ですが、このようなコンセプトのお店では接客マナーやテクニックだけでなく、ルックスやスタイルの良さも風俗嬢には求められます。そのため、太っていたり、極端に痩せたりしていると、面接で採用されることは難しいでしょう。また、在籍店が高級店であれば、体型の変化でお客さんから指名されなくなってしまう可能性もあります。
ぽっちゃり専門店で稼ぐ
魅力的なスタイルの維持が稼ぐのに欠かせないケースもありますが、これは必ずしも「痩せていなくてはいけない」という事ではありません。太った女性は、風俗で稼げないと考えがちですが、ぽっちゃり専門店であれば歓迎されるのです。ぽちゃ系風俗店に在籍中の女性であれば、痩せてしまっては稼げなくなるのは当たり前です。
人それぞれ好みは様々なのですが、ぽっちゃり体型を好む男性は多いです。なので、風俗エリアにはぽっちゃり専門店が1件はあります。ぽっちゃり体型が気になる女性はこういったお店を選びましょう。
また、ぽっちゃり専門店はプレイ料金がリーズナブルに設定されていることほとんどです。あまり稼げないイメージがあるかもしれませんが、「安い＝稼げない」ではありません。実際、安くプレイをしたい風俗ファンは多くいますので、接客数を増やす事ができるのです。お客さんをリピートさせられる風俗嬢になれば高級店に負けず劣らずの収入を得ることも夢ではないでしょう。
自分に合ったお店を選択する事が、高収入を得る最大の近道になります。もちろん、痩せた体型を目指すことも大切かもしれませんが、ありのままの自分を強みに変えてしまうのも選択肢だと考えておくとよいでしょう。
基本的にスレンダーが人気
ぽっちゃり専門風俗店の紹介をしましたが、一般的にはスレンダー体型の方が男性も好みであるケースが多く、その分お客さんが付きやすいです。働き始めて固定のリピーター獲得ができている場合には、体型を維持するように努めましょう。
また、働く地域にも注意してください。東京や大阪などの大都市圏であれば風俗店も多いのでデブぽちゃ専門店も数多くありますが、地方は無いという場所も存在します。そのため、ぽっちゃり系風俗嬢は地方で苦労することもあります。田舎に住むぽっちゃり体型の女性は、都会への出稼ぎをおすすめします。
ほとんどの風俗店では出稼ぎを受け入れていますし、寮完備など待遇がよいお店も多くあります。家具や家電が最初からそろっているケースもあるので、長期間でも滞在は可能です。
風俗のお仕事をするうえで、体型は重要です。ただ、それは風俗店のコンセプトと自分がマッチしてるかという意味です。お店のイメージとかけ離れたスタイルの女性は、稼ぐことはできなでしょう。まずは自分に合ったお店を探すことをおすすめします。
Anyone following recent Lisp dialects is probably aware of Jonathan Bachrach 's Goo , a descendant of Dylan that has returned to its Lispy roots .
It 's not being developed any more , but it 's worth studying for a language designer , because it is the best - designed recent Lisp .
I 've learned a number of things from it that I did not expect .
Easy variables
Goo 's internal def is more convenient than let .
Because it does n't affect the indentation of the code that follows it , it makes the common operation of adding or removing a lexical variable much easier .
It 's annoying that def is distinct from dv , and that the other defining forms have no internal version ( especially df ) .
And of course it only works in a seq , so it 's not always an option .
A def that worked in more contexts would be a big step torward eliminating the common hassle of creating a variable when a value is used twice .
Short names
Short names are a win , of course , but you can go too far .
Many of Goo 's names - df , < lst > - omit a vowel to save one character , at the cost of making the name unpronounceable .
So one - syllable " def " and " list " become " D.F. " and " L.S.T . " in speech .
Names are read aloud often enough that this matters more than the decrease in characters .
The authors say " goo opts for pronounceable special forms as much as possible " , but some of the most frequently used names are n't .
Short names also have more collisions .
Goo used to abbreviate define - slot as ds , but there were n't enough two - letter names to go around .
It was later renamed to dp ( for define - property ) so ds could become define - syntax .
I do n't think that 's common enough to deserve a two - character name , but Goo 's names are either full - length or tiny .
There 's no convention of intermediate length , so defsyntax ( or , for that matter , the traditional defmacro , which ds closely resembles ) was n't an option .
Flexibility in naming conventions is important .
Speaking of naming conventions , the < lst > convention for classes is annoyingly long .
It looks short because you do n't pronounce the brackets , but those two extra characters are repeated quite often in type declarations .
The problem that motivates this convention is that class names want to be overloaded as constructors .
In a language where anything can be callable , this would be easy to avoid : a class is its own constructor , so there 's no need for another name .
The shorter the names get , the more important conciseness of other syntax becomes .
Parentheses and spaces start to dominate the character count .
Getting rid of those takes syntax , which is hazardous stuff .
Goo uses a little of it to shorten lambda and arglists .
Research vs. development
Goo suffers from being a compilation research project .
The implementors have spent much of their effort on on - the - fly translation to C .
The result is reasonably fast , and the ability to write inline C is interesting , but other aspects of the language are rather unfinished .
There are other experimental features , like dp , that are awkward in practice .
I do n't blame the authors for not trying very hard to make the language useful , but if they were , this would not be a good strategy .
op wins
Goo's op macro makes partial application easy , and it 's more flexible than curried functions .
Every functional language should have it .
Would You Adopt a “ Pet Boy ” ?
If you ’re a girl looking for a man who will keep you company anytime you want , go to movies you want to see , shop with you and even take you on a romantic dinner , then you will love the recently popular South Korean trend of adopting a “ Pet Boy ” .
â€ œI ’m 6 ft tall guy and nice looking .
Girls who would like to adopt me as your pet , please contact me.â€ 
Pet Boys , who are often college kids in their 20’s , find â€ œBeing someone ’s pet is stress free job with no financial burden at all.â€ 
The idea came from a Japanese anime story that was popular about 5 years ago .
It was about a business woman who always had bad luck in relationships .
One day , she decided to take home a young man off the street to live with her as her pet .
The story was later made into a Japanese TV show as seen in the video below .
Last month , a local Korean TV show announced they were accepting â€ œPet Boyâ€ applications and around 2,200 people applied .
Even on the internet , agencies have started popping up offering “ Pet Boys ” services .
The trend is expected to spread throughout Asia in the near future .

Researchers ...
Within the field of psychology more and more research is based on the functioning of the brain .
Even in fields such as social psychology , which traditionally was opposed to looking at the relationship between brain and behavior , is neuroscience growing .
More and more psychological disorders are being explained in relation to neurological function or dysfunction .
Depression is caused by too few or too many neurotransmitters .
Schizophrenia is caused by a “ mis- wired ” brain .
Anxiety is caused by a hyper - reactive sympathetic nervous system ( and possibly an abnormal amygdala ) .
We are overweight because of hypothalamic problems and can’t sleep because our reticular activating systems are out of whack .
All psychopathology is now being described in neurological terms .
Many believe this implies that all psychopathology is now treatable and curable by medication because all psychopathology has a biological basis .
Cartesian dualism is alive and well ; in fact , it ’s never been stronger .
Does this spell out impending doom for psychotherapy ?
Can we simply medicate our problems away ?
Let ’s return to philosophy to find out .
The increasing emphasis on the brain is leading to a blurring between what is mind and what is body .
Perhaps , Descartes ’ philosophy is n’t as strong today as we thought .
If body and mind are not separate entities then we no longer have a dualism but rather a monism .
This implies that psychopathology is , at its core , nothing more than pathological brain function or structure .
For example , according to the philosophy that underlies the neuroscience of psychopathology , depression is nothing more than a perhaps smaller cingulated gyrus and basal forebrain with abnormally low production or abnormally high re-uptake of serotonin and norepinephrine .
This does not , however , imply that behavioral or cognitive therapies are not necessary and that all psychopathology is ultimately treatable by medication or electrode implants or neurogenesis or whatever the next neuroscience fad is .
Having no distinction between mind and body or brain and behavior ( a monism opposed to a dualism ) implies that affecting either mind or body affects both because they really are the same .
As confusing as that sounds , it ’s an important concept .
It means that psychotherapy is not threatened with extinction by neuroscience or pharmaceuticals .
Treating the mind ( behavior ) changes the body ( brain ) .
Conversely , treating the body ( brain ) changes the mind ( behavior ) .
There is room for both biological and psychological therapies .
There are people who seek a purely biological cure and those who eschew biology for psychology .
However , the ultimate solution lies in moderation — a balance between the two .
For decades most Americans were n’t aware that there was a Georgia other than the southern state .
Today most Americans probably still are n’t aware that there is another Georgia .
Yet U.S. officials are breathing fire at Russia for confronting the country of Georgia , a former Soviet Socialist Republic , which won its independence from the dissolving Soviet Union in 1991 .
At issue : the status of Abkhazia and South Ossetia , two territories within Georgia that have declared their independence in turn .
The normal reaction of any normal American who learned about the controversy would be , who cares ?
Surely an arcane territorial dispute between two former parts of the Soviet Union over the disposition of two even smaller parts does n’t concern the United States .
But one should never underestimate Washington ’s determination to micro-manage global affairs .
The Bible says that God cares about a sparrow falling from the sky .
If the sparrow were flying in a foreign country , the U.S. State Department would demand to know who shot it down .
Throughout its history Georgia was a target of foreign invasion by competing empires , including the Mongols , Ottomans , and Persians .
Georgia turned to Russia for assistance and found itself forced into the Russian empire in 1801 .
Georgia achieved a brief independence after the Russian Revolution , before being forcibly incorporated into the Soviet empire in 1921 .
Another revolution , the collapse of communist rule in the Soviet Union , led to Georgia ’s declaration of independence in 1991 .
The path to democracy was not easy , however .
The first democratically elected president  Zviad Gamsakhurdia  was ousted by a coup later in the year .
He was replaced by former Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze , who in turn was forced to resign in 2003 by massive street demonstrations protesting his government ’s rigging of parliamentary elections .
Mikheil Saakashvili rode the so - called Rose Revolution to power in 2004 , but he has demonstrated his own authoritarian tendencies .
Jonathan Wheatley of the Swiss AARAU Center for Democracy argues that Georgia is one of several former Soviet republics stuck " halfway between authoritarianism and democracy . "
He explains that Saakashvili prefers " to impose change by decree in time - honored Soviet style , " forcing debate and conflict to be " played out on the streets rather than in parliament . "
This all may have been interesting political theater for foreign observers , but it was of little concern to America and Europe .
After all , freeing Georgia was never a U.S. objective during the Cold War .
European capitals spent no time worrying about Georgia ’s role in Soviet planning .
When the U.S.S.R. came apart , Georgia ’s independence was a happy afterthought to Ukraine ’s departure , which materially weakened the Soviet giant .
However , one consistent Georgian policy has been to seek U.S. and European support in resisting Russian encroachments .
Tbilisi wants to join the West , and who can blame it ?
America and Europe offer bountiful markets , potential foreign aid , and possible military protection from Russia .
As a result , Georgia , a one - time constituent part of the Soviet Union far from Europe , let alone America , wants to join NATO .
The North Atlantic Treaty Organization would become the North Atlantic - Asia / Caucasus Treaty Organization , or NAACTO .
The idea is nutty on its face .
Georgia is irrelevant to allied security and brings no military assets to the table .
It has put a few troops into Iraq , but while the burden on Tbilisi might be real , the value to the U.S. is minimal .
Most importantly , including Georgia in NATO would force the alliance to take Georgia ’s side against Russia in any territorial disputes .
Such as Abkhazia and South Ossetia in Georgia .
Abkhazian separatism led to conflict in 1992 - 93 and was concluded after a severe defeat of the Georgian forces , followed by a cease - fire monitored by the Commonwealth of Independent States , namely Russia .
Fighting in South Ossetia ran from 1991 to 1992 , when Georgia accepted a cease - fire under Russian pressure .
The peacekeeping force there too is dominated by Moscow .
Russia cites American and European support for Kosovo ’s declaration of independence as a reason to consider accepting similar Abkhazian and South Ossetian claims .
De facto absorption by Moscow is a possibility .
Tensions , which never fully abated between Georgia and its secessionist territories , have recently flared anew .
Russia has upgraded its diplomatic ties to the territories while both Tbilisi and Moscow have enhanced their troop presence around the disputed areas .
Georgia claims that Russia shot down a Georgian unmanned reconnaissance aircraft , a charge Moscow unpersuasively denied .
Russian President Vladimir Putin strongly lobbied NATO not to begin membership talks with Georgia at the alliance ’s summit last month .
Georgia retaliated by breaking off talks with Russia over the latter ’s accession to the World Trade Organization .
Moscow has increased its pressure , and Georgian President Saakashvili has called on NATO to respond in this " moment of truth " since " This is not just an attack on a piece of Georgian territory " but " on what some politicians in Moscow regard as the dangerous virus of democracy and freedom spreading in Russia ’s neighborhood . "
These are nasty little conflicts to be sure , but of no consequence to the West .
First , neither side is obviously right .
As the U.S. and leading European nations acknowledge regarding Kosovo  and other parts of the old Yugoslavia , including Bosnia , Croatia , Macedonia , Montenegro , and Slovenia  secession can be a valid demand .
If yes for Albanian - Kosovars , then why not for Abkhazians and South Ossetians ?
Second , Russian support for secession might offend Georgia , but outside involvement in otherwise internal struggles is a constant of international relations .
Indeed , given Georgia ’s proximity to Russia , right next door , Moscow has a lot more at stake in the future of Abkhazia and South Ossetia than Washington had in Kosovo , which it " liberated " through direct military intervention .
The West ’s sudden concern for proper international protocol when it comes to dismembering Georgia warrants at most a horselaugh from Russia in response .
Yet American and European officials and pundits are treating the Georgia - Russia confrontation as if it involved someone , anyone in America or Europe .
London ’s Independent denounces Russia for acting like a " colonial bully . "
Helle Dale of the Heritage Foundation calls Russia a " bully . "
NATO spokesman James Appathurai complains that Russia has " undermined Georgia ’s territorial integrity . "
State Department spokesman Sean McCormack accuses Russia of engaging in " political mischief . "
Senators Joseph Biden and Richard Lugar , chairman and ranking member , respectively , of the Senate Foreign Relations committee , argue that " Russian actions require a timely , robust and intensive diplomatic response from Washington " and NATO .
Presumptive GOP presidential nominee John McCain insists that " We must not allow Russia to believe it has a free hand to engage in policies that undermine Georgian sovereignty . "
Why not ?
Let us stipulate that Moscow should avoid NATO ’s Balkan precedent and America ’s Iraq precedent and stay out of Georgia ’s internal affairs .
" Do as I say and not as I do " seems to apply to countries as well as parents .
But Russia views territorial conflict on its border as a matter of its national interest , rather like the U.S. perspective regarding Mexico and the rest of Central America , as well as the Caribbean .
Over the last 15 years Washington has twice forcibly removed governments of Haiti .
Washington had its reasons and would n’t have reacted well to a condemnatory lecture from Russia  or most anyone else .
Still , assume Moscow to be in the wrong .
The U.S. and Europeans should tell Russia so and move on .
Put bluntly , Georgia does n’t matter .
Biden and Lugar call Georgia " an important friend , " but by that standard there is no country on earth that is not an " important friend . "
So is Chad .
So is Fiji .
So is Nepal .
So is Paraguay .
So many " important friends , " so little time and money .
Georgians are a fine people and many thirst for real liberty .
But their country is of no particular interest to the U.S. or Europeans .
Tbilisi does n’t matter to Western security .
Georgia is an imperfect democracy at best .
And control of Abkhazia and South Ossetia is n’t even critical to Georgia , let alone the West .
Their combined population is less than 300,000 , compared to Georgia ’s 4.6 million inhabitants .
In contrast , America and Europe have much at stake with Russia .
It remains a nuclear - armed power with significant , if much weakened , conventional forces .
As in Georgia , Moscow is capable of intimidating other countries , some NATO members , along its borders .
Russian energy resources give it a strong card to play in Europe .
Moscow ’s veto on the UN Security Council matters to Washington , since controversies involving Iran , Iraq , and Kosovo all come before that body .
Russia also has a role to play in Asia , including in negotiations over North Korea ’s nuclear program .
Moreover , mutual antagonism toward U.S. dominance and arrogance is the lifeblood of improved Chinese - Russian relations .
So far , other nations have been more inclined to balk when pushed by the U.S. , rather than to coalesce against Washington .
But that could change .
In short , nothing going on in Georgia is worth a confrontation with Moscow .
Certainly nothing concerning Abkhazia and South Ossetia .
The United States is the globe ’s sole superpower .
Washington really does n’t have to worry about everything that goes on everywhere .
If a sparrow falls to the ground somewhere else , it really does n’t matter to America who shot it down .
Does that mean that small states stuck in a " bad neighborhood , " such as Georgia , might face unpleasant pressure at times ?
Sure .
But it is not America ’s duty to right every wrong , especially when doing so interferes with Washington ’s ability to achieve more important objectives elsewhere .
The principle duty of the U.S. government is to protect America  its people , liberties , constitutional system , and territory .
It ’s time America ’s leaders focused on the interests of their own political community rather than planned crusades , always expensive and often bloody , on behalf of other countries to slay imagined monsters around the globe .

The Bush - Cheney administration ’s Department of Homeland Security , the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) , and the Department of Health and Human Services ( HHS ) have collectively set guidelines that recommend — in the event of a " pandemic " or mass crisis — that the elderly , the sick , the severely injured , and the poor will be denied life - saving medical treatment .
Details are discussed in this Associated Press report :
Who should MDs let die in a pandemic ?
Report offers answers
The proposed guidelines , meant to serve as a blueprint to be followed by hospitals across the country , specifically recommends that the those deemed at " higher risk of death " with a " slimmer chance of survival " will be denied services and “ scarce resources ” , as dictated by designated officials .
Specifically , those who will be denied help include people who are :
* older than 85 , * suffering from severe trauma , which include injuries from crashes and shootings , * severely burned , * suffering from mental impairment ( Alzheimer ’s disease ) , and * suffering from chronic diseases , including lung , heart , and diabetes
In other words , the most disadvantaged will be left to die .
For years now , we have witnessed the gutting and militarization of the US , and the systematic march towards total population control : the creation of the Department of Homeland Security , the destruction of law and civil liberties , manufactured elections , domestic spying , and the increasingly aggressive reduction , rationing of social and health care services .
With the world plunging deeper into crisis ( manufactured as well as natural ) — endless world war , economic upheaval , energy and food shortages — this bone - chilling new plan is further evidence that the powers that be are preparing ( and / or planning for ) a die - off .
This is nothing short of eugenics — the “ cleansing of the unfit ” that Hitler and his like only dreamed of — delivered through Bush - Cheney , obediently carried out by legions of surrogates , and opposed by few .

SAN FRANCISCO ( MarketWatch ) -- ANB Financial N.A. , a Bentonville , Ark. - based bank , has been closed by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. has been named receiver , the FDIC said late Friday .
The failure of ANB Financial marks the third bank failure of the year , following the closure of Hume , Mo. - based Hume Bank in early March .

It 's gone before you even knew it was there :
As energy is unlocked from fuels at power plants , two - thirds of the energy consumed to create electricity is lost .
The laws of thermodynamics dictate that conversion efficiency will never be 100 percent , because heat is lost at every step of the conversion process .
But new technologies may be able to greatly increase conversion efficiency , moving from an overall rate of 36 percent to closer to 50 percent .
At present , coal — in all its carbon - belching inefficiency — is king because it 's cheap .
Still , the use of natural gas to create electricity has been rising rapidly , in part because of more - efficient gas turbines .
Natural gas prices have been climbing , however , and coal prices could rise as well .
" High fossil fuel prices will drive technology and innovation , because they respond to price signals , " said Frank A. Wolak , an economist at Stanford .
" Technology can improve efficiency by working the margin , gaining 10 to 15 percent .
That 's money . "
China is refusing to guarantee that it wo n't censor the Internet during this summer 's Olympic Games , but insists that the international media will still be able to function normally .
Officials from China 's Technology Ministry took a somewhat odd opportunity to speak about its censorship plans during a press conference after the Olympic torch relay crossed Mount Everest .
They said that while the government would be able to " guarantee as much [ access ] as possible , " there 's no way that China would turn off the Great Firewall entirely during the Games .
" China has always been very cautious when it comes to the Internet , " Technology Minister Wan Gang said , according to Reuters .
" I 've not got any clear information about which sites will be shut or screened .
But to protect the youth there are controls on some unhealthy web sites . "
Wan 's statement comes just over a month after the International Olympic Committee reminded China of its obligations as an Olympic host city to allow the press to report as freely as they have in the past — which usually includes full , unfettered access to the Internet .
The IOC insisted to the government that the Internet be " open at all times during Games time , " and commission vice chairman Kevan Gosper appeared optimistic that China would comply .
" On all issues where that 's been concerned they 've lived up to the ( host city ) agreement so we do n't see any reason why they 'd step back from that now , " he said at the time .
The IOC may have little recourse on China 's decision to maintain some degree of filtering .
One option for the organization is to insist on a list of things that would be blocked , such as porn sites , to ensure that the international media has free access to all of the sites it needs .
However , China 's vague description of " unhealthy web sites " gives it plenty of wiggle room .
China defends its decision by pointing out that it's not the only country to filter the Internet .
" Every country limits access to some web sites .
Even in developed countries not every site can be accessed , " Wan said .
Translation : " Everyone else does it ! "
It 's true that some countries do restrict the free flow of information to a degree , but very few do it as strictly as China .
And , China did agree to open up the ' Net as part of its agreement with the IOC .
Finally , officials said that they would not be able to guarantee that the Beijing Olympic trademark would not be ripped off and that unlicensed items would not be sold on the streets .
" The law enforcement authorities are not able to guarantee that infringement never happens .
What we are trying our best to do is combat it and crack down when we find it , " Beijing IPR Bureau head Liu Zhengang said .
Just a few weeks ago , the State Intellectual Property Office said that it was cracking down on intellectual property infringement in anticipation of the Games .
Is China now trying to give itself some wiggle room ?
Maybe , but it's not reasonable to expect that authorities will be able to nab every single violator .
But given China 's long and checkered history with IP enforcement , the IOC will likely be satisfied with visible , high - profile , and frequent crackdowns .
New Federal Report on Marijuana Use
is Misleading , Groups Say Tim King , Salem - News.com , 2008-05-10
Is this a reaction to the beginning of the end of marijuana prohibition ?
With some comments in italics by Peter Meyer , 2008 - 05 - 12 .
( SALEM , Ore. ) 
A new federal government report on the ill effects of marijuana on teens may be a last - ditch effort to demonize the medical weed before it sees its own day of emancipation .
As it stands , even the most hardcore marijuana legalization advocates do not support children using anything that causes intoxication .
This new report uses scare tactics and seems to regard medical facts as a meaningless burden , and its authors are enlisting the help of celebrities with big money and big media ties to drive their message home .
( See : TEEN " SELF MEDICATION " FOR DEPRESSION LEADS TO MORE SERIOUS MENTAL ILLNESS , NEW REPORT REVEALS )
" Do n't be fooled into thinking that pot is harmless , " said Dr. Drew Pinksy , internist , addiction expert , and host of VH1's Celebrity Rehab .
" Marijuana is an addictive drug .
Teens who are already depressed and use marijuana may increase their odds of suffering from even more serious mental health problems . " [ " May " ?
" Increase their odds " ? ]
But medical marijuana and pharmacology experts like Dr. Phil Leveque of Molalla , Oregon , who writes regularly for Salem - News.com , suggest that there is no truth to the statement , and that most of those who ultimately suffer from mental illness already would have .
" One of the biggest claims from the federal government is that marijuana causes ' euphoria ' and if anyone needs that explained to them , it means the opposite of depression , " Leveque said .
He and most other advocates say kids should stay free and clear of marijuana use unless it is medically necessary , but it is a pussycat next to more deadly things like alcohol , prescription drugs , heroin and meth that potentially lead to death .
Marijuana has no lethal quality ; it can't kill a person .
It seems like a waste of time to get people listening , and then only tell them the bad data on marijuana .
It seems very irresponsible .
[ PM : The U.S. federal government does not see it as a waste of time ( or taxpayer money ) because maintaining the criminal status of marijuana use is vital to the profits to be made from the use of prescription drugs ( with " contributions " from the pharmaceutical industry to the government ) , from the prison system and from " rehabilitation programs " , plus , of course , the huge profits from the drug trade conducted by the CIA . ]
Marijuana is not " Different Today "
Marijuana is a natural herb that is cultivated to have better potency .
The herb is the same that it has always been , and the ability of people to grow it well and to learn about the agricultural significance has improved .
In the 1970 's most marijuana was sold under the name " commercial " and it all came from Mexico .
In that country the male and female plants are not separated , and the result is a below average grade of marijuana packed with seeds .
When the government tries to suggest that marijuana is " different today " , they are suggesting that a human process has changed marijuana into something it did n't used to be .
This is scientifically impossible .
No doubt far more money is invested in other types of ag research , and so far fruit is about the same as it used to be , except maybe for the addition of human - added poisons to increase its marketability .
But this study , like others that benefit the pharmaceutical companies that do n't want to compete with marijuana as a medical product , is more of the same , " The potency of smoked marijuana has risen consistently over the past decades and higher potency translates into serious health consequences for teens . "
They also stated , " Some studies show that higher potency marijuana may be contributing to an increase in the number of American teens seeking treatment for marijuana dependence . "
Marijuana dependence ?
This in and of itself is extremely debatable .
For the most part , doctors agree that marijuana is only mildly addicting and that relates to a mental addiction , not a physical addiction .
One interesting fact always deleted from the federal studies is that for many years , marijuana was considered the best substance for getting people off hard drugs .
Heroin addicts given marijuana , can kick their deadly habit .
Of course funding all of those taxpayer - funded , court - ordered " marijuana addiction " programs is another concern of the federal government .
They make money from marijuana being illegal , plain and simple .
The notion of " marijuana addiction " is unique to the groups and agencies and courts that profit directly from it .
The new federal report suggests that marijuana use can cause a small percentage of users to consider " suicide . "
[ PM : " Suggest " ?
" Can cause " ?
Lots of people occasionally consider suicide , whether or not they smoke marijuana .
Might as well claim that consuming milk " can cause a small percentage ... " .
And how about consuming alcohol ? ]
Perhaps if this is true , it is based more on the stigma that the federal government , fully in bed with the pharmaceutical groups , gives to marijuana .
" Gateway Theory "
It is not very different from the so - called " Gateway Theory " that marijuana leads to harder drugs .
Many believe that the seed is planted by the theory , and that kids feel compelled to " move to harder drugs " because that is what the government and the D.A.R.E. officer told them would happen .
It is a simple notion called " programming " that has undeniable impact on a person 's mode of thinking , their overall knowledge , and ultimately their actions .
Those willing to face the truth on a daily basis know that half of what is wrong with people in this country is a result of adverse and negative programming .
[ PM : Plus having to live continually in a neurotic , superficial , terminally dysfunctional materialistic society with apparently no way out  which itself is sufficient to cause major depresssion . ]
It happens when clergy sexually abuse children and tell them they will go to hell if they ever talk to their families or police .
It is the conditioning applied to people in Communist nations that makes them believe Americans and western countries are all evil , and it is the same poison given to Islamic fundamentalist radicals whose lives are entirely based on fear .
Our government needs to give it up and move into the light of truth .
Marijuana may not be " great " to anyone except a medical patient who directly benefits from it , but it is a plant and a flower that God placed on the earth and it is entirely vain and ironic of our society to place what is probably the single most useful plant on the planet in an illegal criminal category with heroin and meth .
It reflects our own ignorance as a nation .
[ PM :
Or more exactly , the official lies about marijuana are believed by many in the U.S. because that nation is full of naïve , ignorant people who get their " information " from the mainstream media which just parrots the disinfo provided by U.S. government agencies . ]
Real Studies
The nation 's second largest association of doctors , the American College of Physicians , stated in a report that marijuana has been smoked for its medicinal properties for centuries , and preclinical , clinical , and anecdotal reports suggest numerous potential medical uses for marijuana .
( See : American College of Physicians Position Takes Aim at Marijuana Laws )
They confirm that the use of medical marijuana in treating HIV wasting and chemotherapy - induced nausea and vomiting has been well documented , and they believe additional research is needed to clarify marijuana 's therapeutic properties and determine standard and optimal doses and routes of delivery .
Reports like this new one from the federal government do not help doctors learn the real facts about medical marijuana .
In fact , the oldest continuously published pediatric journal in the country , the Journal of the American Medical Association , called the " Archives of Pediatrics & Adolescent Medicine " , released new information in November 2007 ( see : Study Shows Surprisingly Few Negative Impacts on Kids Who Use Marijuana ) indicating that pot-smoking teens tend to function at better levels than teens who also smoke tobacco , and better in some ways than kids who abstain from both .
The study , completed in Switzerland , did not have an obligation to demonize marijuana on behalf of the pharmaceutical companies as the U.S. studies seem to .
The report should actually make parents feel much better about teens and marijuana .
The study compared students who smoked both pot and cigarettes , with kids who smoke marijuana only .
The study revealed that those who use only cannabis were more socially driven , and showed no more psychosocial problems than those who had never taken either of the substances .
As far as marijuana leading to harder drugs , the authors of the study say an accurate listing of the problems actually fall in a different order , and that cancer - related illnesses suffered by cigarette smokers are the biggest risk of all .
The government report suggests that " Not only are adolescents at greater risk for drug abuse , but they may suffer more consequences , " said Nora D. Volkow , M. D. , Director of the National Institute on Drug Abuse .
[ PM : Adolescents are " at greater risk " for " drug abuse " simply because people such as Volkow use the term " drug abuse " to mean " illegal use of any drug " and teens are known to be inclined toward risky behavior , such as doing what is illegal . ]
" There is also some evidence that in vulnerable teens  because of genetic factors  the abuse of marijuana can trigger a schizophreniform disorder . "
[ PM : " Some " evidence ?
" Vulnerable " teens ?
Obscure " genetic factors " ?
" Can trigger " ?
" Schizophreniform " disorder ?
Volkow may or may not herself " abuse " marijuana but clearly she is abusing the English language , and is really stretching , presumably in an effort to please her employer , the U.S. federal government . ]
Misleading Statements
Groups involved in marijuana laws and policy say the report is misleading .
U.S. News and World Report quoted Bruce Mirken , director of communications at The Marijuana Policy Project , saying " We agree that kids should n't smoke marijuana , but we simply have to be honest to teens and parents .
This report [ is ] deliberately confusing correlation with causation . "
( See : Teen Depression Worsened by Marijuana , Government Says [ PM :
If the " Government Says " it then you know it must be false , or at best misleading . ] )
The Washington - based group Mirken represents intends to remove criminal penalties for marijuana use and make medical marijuana available to seriously ill patients with doctor 's approval .
" This very week the British government 's official scientific advisors on illegal drugs issued a report saying they are ' unconvinced that there is a causal relationship between the use of cannabis and any affective disorder ' , such as depression . "
Mirken also questions the lack of warning about alcohol 's relationship to depression , which is completely left out of their new report .
" Data linking alcohol to depression is much stronger and alcohol use by teens is greater than marijuana use , " he notes .
Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton have each been clear that they do not see marijuana as a problem in our society that requires federal money and intervention and incarceration .
Perhaps this new federal report represents the death throes of a movement that began in the 1930's as an effort to remove hemp rope from the commercial marketplace .
Hemp , the industrial marijuana plant , provides the strongest natural fiber known to man .
Dow Chemicals , Dupont and the Hearst Newspaper chain were the biggest foes of marijuana at the time .
They funded the movie " Reefer Madness . "
Today the pharmaceutical companies that manufacture addictive " prescription drugs " are enlisting the federal government 's help to produce more fiction presented as fact .
The list of marijuana opponents is different in this century , but the corporate spirit of greed that made it illegal in the first place is alive and well .

What ’s more , the Gulf of Carpentaria object was a skipping stone compared with an object that Abbott thinks whammed into the Indian Ocean near Madagascar some 4,800 years ago , or about 2,800 B.C.
Researchers generally assume that a space object a kilometer or more across would cause significant global harm : widespread destruction , severe acid rain , and dust storms that would darken the world ’s skies for decades .
The object that hit the Indian Ocean was three to five kilometers across , Abbott believes , and caused a tsunami in the Pacific 600 feet high — many times higher than the 2004 tsunami that struck Southeast Asia .
Ancient texts such as Genesis and the Epic of Gilgamesh support her conjecture , describing an unspeakable planetary flood in roughly the same time period .
If the Indian Ocean object were to hit the sea now , many of the world ’s coastal cities could be flattened .
If it were to hit land , much of a continent would be leveled ; years of winter and mass starvation would ensue .
At the start of her research , which has sparked much debate among specialists , Abbott reasoned that if colossal asteroids or comets strike the sea with about the same frequency as they strike land , then given the number of known land craters , perhaps 100 large impact craters might lie beneath the oceans .
In less than a decade of searching , she and a few colleagues have already found what appear to be 14 large underwater impact sites .
That they ’ve found so many so rapidly is hardly reassuring .
Other scientists are making equally unsettling discoveries .
Only in the past few decades have astronomers begun to search the nearby skies for objects such as asteroids and comets ( for convenience , let ’s call them “ space rocks ” ) .
What they are finding suggests that near - Earth space rocks are more numerous than was once thought , and that their orbits may not be as stable as has been assumed .
There is also reason to think that space rocks may not even need to reach Earth ’s surface to cause cataclysmic damage .
Our solar system appears to be a far more dangerous place than was previously believed .
The received wisdom about the origins of the solar system goes something like this : the sun and planets formed about 4.5 billion years ago from a swirling nebula containing huge amounts of gas and dust , as well as relatively small amounts of metals and other dense substances released by ancient supernova explosions .
The sun is at the center ; the denser planets , including Earth , formed in the middle region , along with many asteroids — the small rocky bodies made of material that failed to incorporate into a planet .
Farther out are the gas - giant planets , such as Jupiter , plus vast amounts of light elements , which formed comets on the boundary of the solar system .
Early on , asteroids existed by the millions ; the planets and their satellites were bombarded by constant , furious strikes .
The heat and shock waves generated by these impacts regularly sterilized the young Earth .
Only after the rain of space objects ceased could life begin ; by then , most asteroids had already either hit something or found stable orbits that do not lead toward planets or moons .
Asteroids still exist , but most were assumed to be in the asteroid belt , which lies between Mars and Jupiter , far from our blue world .

Science fiction usually sticks hibernating spaceflyers in glowing capsules of goo , but a real - life ingredient for suspended animation may not be too far off , scientists say .
Hydrogen sulfide is the key stinky compound in rotting eggs and swamp gas .
New research shows it can slow down a mouse 's metabolism , or the consumption of oxygen , without dampening the flow of blood .
" A little hydrogen sulfide gas is a way to reversibly and , apparently , safely cut metabolism in mice , " Dr. Warren Zapol , a medical researcher at Massachusetts General Hospital , told LiveScience .
" There seemed to be no side harmful effects to the mice after hours of breathing it in .
They got sluggish , but still responded to a pinch on the tail . "
Zapol , also chief of anesthesia and critical care at the hospital , and his colleagues will detail their findings in the April issue of the journal Anesthesiology .
Heart of the problem
Previous studies showed hydrogen sulfide gas could slow down metabolism but never examined what happens to the circulatory system , the network of blood distribution commanded by the heart .
Zapol 's team used ultrasound technology to view the hearts of mice as they inhaled hydrogen sulfide .
After six hours , the heart rate of the mice halved , but their blood pressure remained normal , crucial to keeping blood adequately flowing through the body .
" When you make everything sluggish , you 'd think the heart would become sluggish , but it did n't , " Zapol said .
He said that respiratory failure and other problems he expected to see were n't observed .
" I was surprised how well it worked , " Zapol said .
" You 'd think poisoning the metabolism would dangerously slow it down , but it did n't really seem to interfere . "
Suspended animation ?
Zapol expects that combining hydrogen sulfide inhalation with chilling the body , another method of slowing down the body 's machinery , could cut metabolism by up to 90 percent .
" Nine months in a spaceship heading out to Mars takes a lot of oxygen to burn , food and water to consume , and produces a lot of waste [ carbon dioxide ] , " said Zapol , who is on the Institute of Medicine 's Committee on Aerospace Medicine and the Medicine of Extreme Environments .
Theoretically , cutting metabolism would reduce the need for consumables and produce less waste , enabling spacecraft to travel lighter and faster .
" Would n't it be nice to arrest metabolism safely for long periods of time and reverse it when you wanted to ? " Zapol said .
Before any spaceflyers benefit from hydrogen sulfide research , Zapol thinks severely injured people will .
" If someone loses a lot of blood , we might be able to safely reduce their need for oxygen , " he said .
" That would feasibly extend limited windows to perform life - saving operations . "
Much to learn
For now , however , Zapol says an incredible amount of research remains before any work on humans can start .
" The next thing we need to do is scale this up to animals bigger than a mouse , " he said , explaining that larger creatures can react very differently to experiments .
People , for example , have reported headaches and nausea from doses of hydrogen sulfide gas 2,700 times less concentrated than those used in the team 's experiments .
Ten weeks of continuous exposure to the same levels Zapol and others used has been shown to cause nose lesions , or ulcers , in mice .
But Zapol thinks that hydrogen sulfide may not be the key ingredient for inducing a suspended animation - like state in mice — a less - toxic compound may form after the gas is inhaled .
If so , the toxicity of hydrogen sulfide could be circumvented .
" Chemistry of the blood is very complex , " Zapol said .
" We need to find out what , exactly , is circulating in the blood and causing what we 've observed . "
The National Institute of Health and Linde Gas Therapeutics in Lidingo , Sweden , funded the team 's research .
Incredible footage has emerged of a man who was talked out of jumping off a bridge by emergency workers , only to slip and then fall into the windscreen of a fire truck as the vehicle moved into position to bring him down to safety .
The drama began when ' Bruce ' walked onto a railway overpass in the NSW regional centre of Dubbo late last week .
He was seen carrying a bladder out of a cask of wine and appeared intoxicated .
Concerned family members called police and when they arrived Bruce threatened to jump off the 10 m - high bridge .
A senior officer then negotiated with him over a loudspeaker but Bruce clambered over the bridge railing and became stuck in the steelwork support braces beneath the rail line .
It appeared the negotiators had successfully talked him out of jumping and encouraged Bruce to " hang in there , big fella " as a fire truck moved into position under the bridge with a view to lowering him onto the roof of the vehicle .
But with freakish timing , Bruce lost his grip just as the vehicle approached and slammed into the flat windscreen of the moving truck mid-fall .
Onlookers screamed as his limp body bounced and rolled to a stop on the dusty ground ?
but it turns out the bizarre event was a blessing in disguise .
Bruce was taken to Dubbo Base Hospital in a satisfactory condition and was found to have no broken bones or serious injuries , leaving emergency workers to conclude that the impact with the perspex screen of the truck may have saved his life .
Investigations are continuing .

Would the US allow its citizens to be attacked and killed by a foreign power and then cover up the facts ?
It would - and it has .
On June 8th , 1967 , the Israeli military attacked and attempted to sink the USS Liberty as she sailed under a US flag in international waters .
Thirty - four US servicemen were killed and 171 injured by a well - coordinated , multi- wave assault which included the use of napalm .
The Israeli military called the attack a " tragic mistake " and then - President Lyndon Johnson agreed it was nothing more .
Sailors who were aboard the ship were warned not to disclose the facts of what happened that day under penalty of court martial - or worse .

Researchers from several Universities are currently working on a search technology that could make BitTorrent sites obsolete .
While the idea of a completely decentralized filesharing network is not new , there are some downsides that are often overlooked .
BitTorrent may be decentralized , but a large part of the BitTorrent community still relies on centralized websites and trackers .
These trackers and torrent sites are considered to be the Achilles heel of the BitTorrent hydra .
At the moment , the top three BitTorrent sites host are handling the majority of all BitTorrent users , and even worse , The Pirate Bay tracks well over 50 % of all public torrent files .
BitTorrent has welcomed many new users over the past three years , and we are now in the uncomfortable situation where the downtime of one of the larger sites may cause problem for the others , simply because they can’t handle the traffic .
This is exactly what happened last month when Mininova was offline for a day due to a hardware problem .
Mininova has well over three million visitors a day , these people went to other sites while Mininova was down , and this increase in traffic got some sites in serious trouble .
The question is : Is there an alternative ?
The answer to this question is yes and no .
A solution to the tracker problem that works pretty well is DHT , or “ trackerless torrents ” .
With DHT you can still connect to other people who are downloading the same file , even when the tracker for that torent is not working properly .
Thanks to DHT , people were able to download torrents that were tracked by Demonoid.com , up to six months after the tracker went down .
The downside of DHT ( the mainline version ) is that not all clients support it , and that it is maintained by one company , BitTorrent Inc .
Replacing BitTorrent sites is even more complex .
How do you find torrents when there are no BitTorrent search engines that store them ?
A possible solution to this problem comes from researchers of Cornell University , who developed an Azureus plugin named Cubit .
The Cubit plugin allows you to find torrents , and does n’t require a centralized server as BitTorrent sites do .
You basically search for torrent files among other peers , similar to Kazaa and Limewire .
An interesting concept , but unfortunately , this also has a lot of downsides .
Cubit opens the gates for floods of spam , because it misses one key feature : moderation .
Since BitTorrent has become so popular , anti-piracy organizations like MediaDefender and BayTSP are constantly uploading fake files , and scammers are uploading malware and spyware , often wrapped in fake media players .
To most people is goes unnoticed , but sites like Mininova and The Pirate Bay have a dedicated team of moderators that remove hundreds of fake and scammy torrents a day .
Together these moderators remove more than a thousand torrents per site , day in and day out .
In addition , most BitTorrent sites also use IP - filters to prevent known scammers and anti-piracy outfits from uploading their content again .
So , for now , Cubit is not yet going to replace BitTorrent sites , as they need to address the lack of moderation first .
Tribler , another application that is developing a BitTorrent site replacement that seems to be far ahead of Cubit , already implemented such moderation features and spam filtering .
Branded as the “ social ” BitTorrent client , is also has community features that many people appreciate .
In sum , I think it is safe to conclude that BitTorrent as it is has some weak spots that could cause problems in the future .
The Pirate Bay , Mininova and isoHunt – the top three BitTorrent sites – are all involved in a court case .
Depending on the outcome of these cases , the need for alternative search technologies may become more apparent .
For now , however , we need BitTorrent sites , and in particular their moderators .
When an airline sneezes , does the entire travel business catch a cold ?
Maybe .
Experts say that as airlines raise fares and cut routes , they 'll squeeze other businesses who depend on a constant flow of passengers to keep the money rolling in .
Tourism is one industry that 's bound to be impacted .
Fewer flights and higher prices will cause some travelers to forgo the big summer trip and do something closer to home ( though if gas prices do n't come down they might just sit home in their air conditioning ) .
The chairman of the Caribbean Tourism Association says the airlines ' moves are putting thousands of regional jobs and billions of dollars of investment at risk .
Caribbean markets are especially susceptible to the cuts , he says , because struggling American Airlines handles a majority of traffic into the region .
American recently announced that it 's cutting its daily flights at its San Juan hub from 93 to 51 and will no longer serve Santo Domingo , Antigua , St Maarten , Aruba , or Samana from San Juan .
And that in turn messes things up for the cruise lines .
Ten ships use San Juan as their home port , and if getting to the island becomes too much of a hassle , vacationers may blow off the cruise altogether .
Vegas might also take a huge hit .
Wachovia
Bank thinks the airlines will reduce service into Vegas by 12 percent , resulting in 2.4 million fewer visits each year .
This in a year when over 11,000 new hotel rooms will open on the strip .
There are a whole slew of other industries that depend on the airlines to keep the money flowing .
Airports are watching the amount of money they collect in landing fees shrink .
Rental car companies , nervous about fewer travelers flowing through airports , are opening new location in the burbs .
Hotels located around airports are concerned that as passengers trade in flights for road trips , they 'll choose to stay at properties further out of town .
Web - based travel agencies like Orbitz are anticipating that as number of airlines shrinks through mergers , passengers will feel less need to comparison shop online .
Long suffering airline employees are facing another round of pink slips , but they 're not the only ones .
Employees at the companies contracted by the airlines are also likely to get the axe .
And with what 's left of airlines ' domestic food service gone or likely to go , the kitchens that provide in - flight catering are likely to make cuts as well .
Of course , not everyone loses .
Airport shops and restaurants may see fewer passengers wandering the concourse , but the ones who are there might be more likely to pay $ 19 for a plate of Buffalo Wings and $ 4 for a bottle of water before boarding their bare - bones flight .

People who believe that God is involved in worldly affairs are less likely to participate in national elections than others , according to a new survey .
The study , which included nearly 1,700 U.S. men and women with an average age of 53 , suggests that a person 's view of God is a variable that determines whether he or she will donate money to a campaign , read political news , or even vote .
" It can be reasoned that if one believes God determines worldly affairs , then there is little reason for individuals to participate in civic events , " study leader Robyn Driskell and her colleagues write in the June issue of the journal Social Science Quarterly .
" God is taking care of things . "
Religion vs. religion
Overall , about 58 percent of citizens age 18 and over voted in the 2004 presidential elections , according to the U.S. Census Bureau .
Evangelical and black Protestants on average were least likely to " get out the national vote " in the 2004 elections , the study finds .
The researchers say both denominations espouse the view that God is active in world affairs , so the lower political engagement makes sense .
The researchers found that a person who views God as more inactive and less involved in the world is more likely to engage in political activities .
Jewish respondents and mainline Protestants , who commonly take this inactive - God view , scored higher on political participation than evangelical and black Protestants .
Catholics also scored higher than Protestants .
Specifically , individuals who prayed about " general world concerns " or who believed that " actively seeking social and economic justice is important in being a good person " showed at least 5 percent higher scores on political involvement .
So while the belief in God in general is not a predictor of voter participation , the researchers say , whether this God is involved in worldly affairs does impact voting patterns .
The results are part of the nationally representative Baylor Religion Survey , 2005 .
Politics and religion
Though the separation of church and state has remained a pillar of national jurisprudence since the concept was added to the U.S. Constitution in 1791 , research consistently reveals religion 's significant role in political and social behavior .
For instance , past research has shown that people who are the most avid churchgoers or otherwise active in their churches also are more likely than others to register to vote , vote , campaign and attend political speeches .
Other studies revealed no link between church attendance and more demanding forms of political involvement , such as running for office or holding leadership positions in local politics .
Also , " churches were an instigating force for both political and social movements such as the civil rights movement and , more recently , Christian conservatism , " Driskell writes .
Another study , published this week in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences ( PNAS ) , found individuals who voted inside school buildings were more likely to support an educational initiative than those who cast ballots at other civic locations .
The PNAS researchers suggest the same dynamics could extend to other locations , such as churches , and other ballot measures , such as support for gay marriage or stem cell research .
After a four - year legal battle , a US federal judge has dismissed all charges against an avant - garde artist who public officials condemned as a bio - terrorist in a case critics are calling " a persecution , not a prosecution . "
The artist is Dr. Steven Kurtz , a professor of Visual Studies at the University of Buffalo , and a founding member of the award - winning collective Critical Art Ensemble ( CAE ) .
The case started in May of 2004 .
While Kurtz was preparing for an exhibition of an art installation at MASS MoCA , a museum in North Adams , Massachusetts , his wife of 20 years died in her sleep .
When police responded to his 911 call , they noticed a small food - testing lab and petri dishes containing bacteria cultures .
The lab was part of the scheduled installation , which would have allowed museum visitors to see if their store bought food contained genetically modified ( GM ) organisms .
The cultures were part of a multimedia project commissioned by the British - based art - science initiative , The Arts Catalyst , and produced in consultation with scientists from the Harvard - Sussex Program .
The project used the harmless bacteria Bacillus subtilis and Serratia marcescens in an installation , performance , and film dedicated to demystifying issues surrounding germ warfare programs and their cost to global public health .
Some of CAE ’s work is designed to protest the potential risks of genetically modified ( GM ) food .
Local police called the Federal Bureau of Investigation ( FBI ) .
While politicians and federal prosecutors rushed to trumpet the thwarting of a major threat , Kurtz was detained under the PATRIOT Act on suspicion of bioterrorism .
The street where Kurtz ’s home was located was cordoned off , his house searched , and his property seized .
Federal agents confiscated Kurtz ’s art projects , computers , and all copies of a book manuscript Kurtz was working on , as well as his reference books and notes .
The book , Marching Plague : Germ Warfare and Global Public Health , had to be entirely reconstructed and was finally published in 2006 .
The then governor of New York , George Pataki , lauded the work of the FBI for disrupting a major bioterrorism threat .
And the then US attorney in Buffalo , Michael A. Battle  the lawyer who was later to become the Department of Justice employee who notified eight US attorneys that they were being fired  praised the work of the Buffalo Joint Terrorism Task Force .
But after a several - month - long investigation , the FBI and the Department of Homeland Security ( DHS ) failed to provide any evidence of " bioterrorism . "
On the contrary , FBI tests revealed within a few days of the incident that there were no harmful biological agents in Kurtz ’s house and that his wife had died of heart failure .
Forced to drop its charges of weapons manufacture , the government instead accused Kurtz and Ferrell of mail and wire fraud .
The government claimed that when Dr. Ferrell gave the cultures to Dr. Kurtz , this violated a contract between the University of Pittsburgh and the supplier , American Type Culture Collection ( ATCC ) .
Neither the university nor ATCC had brought any complaint , and observers pointed out that scientists routinely share non-hazardous cultures .
The Department of Justice further claimed that this alleged contract discrepancy constituted federal mail and wire fraud .
Because the charges against the two academics were brought under the PATRIOT Act , the maximum penalty was increased from five years to 20 .
Earlier , Dr. Ferrell pled guilty to a lesser misdemeanor charge rather than facing a prolonged trial for the mail and wire fraud felonies .
During the legal wrangling , he had two minor strokes and a major stroke that required months of rehabilitation .
He was indicted as he was preparing to undergo a stem cell transplant , his second in seven years .
But Kurtz rejected any plea deal , instead demanding a public trial .
Most of the art world has rallied behind him .
His colleagues in the Critical Art Ensemble set up a website and a legal defense fund , and Kurtz continued to teach at the University of Buffalo .
When the case finally arrived in a courtroom this month , Federal Judge Richard J. Arcara ruled to dismiss the indictment .
It is unclear whether the government will appeal the dismissal .
Lucia Sommer , coordinator of the CAE Defense Fund , which raised funds for Kurtz ’ legal defense , told IPS that the judge ’s decision " is further testament to our original statements that Dr. Kurtz is completely innocent and never should have been charged in the first place . "
Kurtz ’s supporters said , " The government has pursued this case relentlessly , spending enormous amounts of public resources .
Most significantly , the legal battle has exhausted the financial , emotional , and physical resources of Ferrell and Kurtz , as well as their families and supporters .
The professional and personal lives of both defendants have suffered tremendously . "
The case against Kurtz and Ferrell came to a nation still gripped by the terrorist attacks of 9/11 and the 2001 anthrax attacks .
The anthrax attacks occurred over the course of several weeks beginning in September 2001 .
Letters containing anthrax spores were mailed to several news media offices and two Democratic US senators , killing five people and infecting 17 others .
Despite a massive government investigation costing millions and covering several continents , the crime remains unsolved .
The FBI named a government researcher , Dr. Steven Hatfill , as " a person of interest " in the investigation .
His name was widely publicized in the media for months , but he has never been charged with any crime .
Hatfill sued the New York Times for libel , contending that that the newspaper erroneously linked him to the anthrax attacks .
In an unusual legal maneuver , the New York Times invoked the " state secrets " doctrine in a motion to dismiss the libel suit .
The Times argued that the classification restrictions imposed on the case by the government were tantamount to an assertion of the state secrets privilege .
The " state secrets " doctrine , the newspaper said , " precludes a case from proceeding to trial when national security precludes a party from obtaining evidence that is … necessary to support a valid defense Dismissal is warranted in this case because the Times has been denied access to such evidence , specifically documents and testimony concerning the work done by ( Hatfill ) on classified government projects relating to bioweapons , including anthrax . "
The court agreed and the case was dismissed in January 2007 .
The Kurtz - Ferrell prosecution has drawn widespread criticism from both the art world and from legal experts .
The New York Civil Liberties Union ( NYCLU ) questioned the propriety of a grand jury investigation into Kurtz ’s work .
" It does n’t appear that this investigation satisfies the FBI standards that the facts and circumstances of the case must reasonably indicate that a crime has been committed , " said Donna Lieberman , executive director of the NYCLU .
Patricia J. Williams , professor of law at Columbia University , questioned whether the Kurtz - Ferrell prosecution is part of a larger government reaction against anti-administration expression in the arts .
She wrote , " Recently scholars from around the world have been barred from the US for reasons stated and unstated , but all in the name of Homeland Security .
They include a South African peace activist , a Canadian antipoverty worker , an Iraqi epidemiologist , most Cuban academics , a Greek economist , a British musician , a Bolivian historian . "
Critical Art Ensemble , which Kurtz co-founded in 1987 with Steven Barnes , has won numerous awards for its bio-art , including the prestigious 2007 Andy Warhol Foundation Wynn Kramarsky Freedom of Artistic Expression Grant , honoring more than two decades of distinguished work .

We ’ve all been there .
You ’re waiting in line when suddenly you reach for your back pocket … and realize your wallet is n’t there .
Well , good news , fellow geeks :
The days of needing cash or even a credit card to pay for purchases are almost behind us .
The cell phone is gaining new power in the world of payment and can actually connect you to cash right now – if you know how to make it happen .
Where we ’re headed
Let ’s start with what ’s in the works .
A developing technology called NFC , or near field communication , is growing closer to our pockets by the day .
NFC lets your cell talk to other receive sites – kind of like BlueTooth , but quicker .
With NFC , you can wave your phone in front of a receiver and have a connection within a second .
NFC also works in a shorter range – about four inches max – and uses two - way communication , so the connection ’s more secure .
As you can imagine , the possibilities with this thing are endless .
The hope is that NFC will eventually act as a virtual credit card , letting you simply wave your phone in front of a panel to make a purchase .
It ’s also being tested for public transportation – hold your phone up to send your fare and board the bus – as well as eventually for identification , storing your official documents to send to anyone in a split second .
In the future , NFC could even let your phone act as your car or house key , connecting with a panel on the door to transmit your identification and let you in .
Promising progress
So how far away are we from having this in our hands ?
Not as far as you ’d think .
Just this week , Nokia launched a new phone with built - in NFC .
The 6212 is being marketed as a “ mobile payment device . ”
And days earlier , Mobile Candy Dish introduced its Blaze Mobile Wallet for AT&T , Sprint , and T - Mobile customers .
This bad boy will let you use whatever phone you ’ve got to “ wave - and - pay ” at NFC - ready credit card terminals right now .
“ Consumers can make contactless purchases … without having to upgrade their mobile phone , ” explains Mobile Candy Dish CEO Michelle Fisher .
The Mobile Candy Dish can also let you access your personal accounts to check balances or transfer money .
Most carriers are charging about five bucks a month for the service .
Other recent developments in the world of wallet - free spending :
The Bay Area ’s BART system is conducting a trial that ’ll let riders wave their phones to pay their fare and even pay for meals at selected fast food restaurants .
About 230 people are participating .
U.S. Bank , Mastercard , and Nokia have launched a mobile payments pilot program in Spokane .
Movie theaters and restaurants in the area have signed on to give it a go .
SCM Microsystems just released a new USB reader for merchants to set up NFC transactions .
The tool , announced a couple weeks ago , lets businesses basically plug - and - play to be ready for you to pay hands - free at cash registers , parking meters , and more .
Some other nations are a few steps ahead , too :
Japan ’s been widely using instant cell phone payments for almost four years for both purchasing and building access .
Austria is more than halfway through a two - year test of NFC at a college campus .
Engineers are seeing how smoothly the technology works when offered for access to secured buildings , product payment , or even instant downloads of course materials .
About a hundred people are taking part .
Bulgaria has already introduced an “ SEP , ” or Systems for Electronic Payment , that ’s being used across the country .
The system is being marketed as “ the mobile way to pay . ”
Parts of India are using NFC to let families get their social security pensions and manage their bank accounts .
London ’s launched a wristband NFC trial at festivals and other events .
Organizers hand out the bands to VIPs , who then wave them in front of sensors to get into private areas .
They eventually want to move into widespread use of the bands to let concertgoers pay for items and even download songs on the spot .
Text - based transfers
All right , so that ’s all fantastic for the future – but there ’s still a ways to go before the technology becomes ubiquitous enough to let you leave your wallet behind .
In the meantime , though , you can still use your phone to help with your finances , even if it ’s not completely hands - free .
I ’m talking about a site called Obopay that lets you literally transfer cash via text message .
Citibank just signed on to integrate it into its services for checking customers , but anyone can use it .
Here ’s how it works :
You sign up for an account with them ( free ) and then add money from your bank account or credit / debit card as you wish .
You can now send cash to anyone with a cell phone through either the Obopay web site or a regular text message .
The service only charges you ten cents for any amount you send , and it does n’t charge anything to the person who ’s receiving .
The person who you send money to will get a text message letting them know they got the cash .
They ’ll have to login once and start an account , but once that ’s done , they can configure it so that the cash goes straight into their bank account for all future transfers .
It may not be quite as cool as wave - and - pay , but for families and friends who need to exchange money often ( think college students here ) , this service has a pretty sweet sell , and at almost no cost to the end user .
It can also come in handy for small business owners or independent contractors who need to collect payments and fees from clients outside their communities .
All in all , the days of a forgotten wallet meaning a ruined night are numbered .
Between services like Obopay and the storm of NFC - based possibilities in the works , the wallet itself may very well soon become a thing of the past – good news for us geeks who would rather use that back pocket to hold our flash drives , anyway .

iTunes has officially eclipsed Best Buy in music sales and now comes in as the number two music retailer in the world .
That 's not just digital music either — that 's all music , including CD sales .
iTunes now sits just behind Wal - Mart , according to new data from the NPD Group that accounts for the amount of music sold during 2007 .
The trend shows once again that digital music sales are exploding at the expense of physical CDs , but the increase has yet to offset the decline in physical media sales .
According to NPD , there was " a sharp increase " in legal digital downloads , but a 10 percent decline in overall music spending ( most likely because digital music stores enable people to buy individual tracks instead of full albums ) .
The research firm says that the number of customers buying music digitally increased by five million last year , driven largely by those between the age of 36 and 50 .
Comparatively , NPD estimates that a million customers dropped out of the CD market last year , led mostly by the younger demographic .
" In fact , 48 percent of US teens did not purchase a single CD in 2007 , compared to 38 percent in 2006 , " said NPD .
People are no longer flocking to P2P anymore either , NPD found .
It said that the number of US consumers using P2P file sharing for music plateaued at 19 percent during 2007 , while legal music downloads grew .
About 10 percent of music acquired in the US are legal music downloads , said the research firm , with iTunes coming out the strongest of all digital - only music stores .
" The continued growth in legal download sites is encouraging , yet the industry struggles to improve the value of each digital customer , " said NPD analyst Russ Crupnick in a statement .
" With so many baby boomers and gen- Xers entering the market , there are certainly opportunities to sell more digital albums , promote older catalog titles , or create bundles that will raise revenues .
In the near term that ’s going to be the best means available to narrow the gap on dwindling CD revenues . "
It was only eight months ago that iTunes passed Amazon to become the number three music retailer .
Wal - Mart is still holding its own with a massive brick - and - mortar retail business in addition to its online music store , but must be getting nervous as iTunes continues to close in .
NPD did not provide data this time around about whether Amazon has shifted positions , but if it has n't yet passed up Best Buy , it probably will soon .
Amazon 's DRM - free music store is the only one that sells unprotected tracks from all four major music labels ( something that even iTunes can't brag about yet ) , and remains a force to be reckoned with in the digital market .
Wal - Mart started selling DRM - free tracks as well in August of last year , but only from EMI and Universal , and only censored albums .
As CD sales continue to spiral downward , 2008 will be the first year during which all major music labels sell their music without DRM .
The record industry hopes that will translate to even better sales throughout the year .
But the labels will still need to figure out ways to sell more , by volume , to digital consumers .
Otherwise , the trend of buying one - offs or a handful of track purchases will continue to eat away at the music industry 's overall revenues .

How is it we keep falling for the same trick ?
Why is it so hard to remember : there is no silver bullet .
I 've spent a significant amount of my time for the past 3 years focusing on testing .
I 've learned several lessons .
Unfortunately , that list does n't represent best practices or rules for better testing , it represents patterns for creating a readable , reliable , and performant test suite -- if and only if you work on the kind of projects I work on and you use tests the way I do .
And that 's the killer .
Context is still king .
I work on teams generally of size 6 - 16 developers .
More often than not I fix tests that I 've never seen before .
I never read test files to understand class responsibilities .
I never generate documentation based on my tests .
I do my best to write perfect tests so that my application runs perfectly , but the best tests I write , I never look at again .
My tests have a thankless task : guide my system design and ensure that I do n't introduce regression bugs , and that 's it .
I run the entire test suite every minute on average .
I expect some of my readers work the way that I do , and in environments similar to mine ; however , the vast majority probably do n't .
That means that a small minority can blindly follow my suggestions , but the majority of my readers will need to understand why I prefer those patterns and if they apply to their work environment .
Perhaps an example is appropriate .
Which of these tests would you prefer to find when the build fails because of it .
It 's actually a trick question .
The context is too important to ignore when composing an answer .
If this test lived in a project where I was the sole author and expected maintainer then the latter is probably a better solution because I would know where to find the creation of @validation .
However , on a large team where it's more likely that I 'll never see this test until it 's broken , there 's a great argument for keeping all the necessary logic within the test itself .
The same test could be written with or without a test name .
Again , the context is critical in deciding which approach to use on your project .
The second test is one line , but it provides very little understanding of why it exists .
You can resolve this issue by adding a comment or ( what I would prefer ) by changing the class to have a more fluent interface that explains why as well as how .
However , both of these solutions make it hard to easily scan the file for an understanding of Validates Presence
Of or generate documentation based on the tests .
Are those things important to you ?
Dan North and I agree more than we disagree , but we have very different styles of testing .
We also use test in different ways , but we both have the same goal in mind -- use tests to create reliable , readable , and performant software .
I believe striving for reliable , readable , and performant applications and tests is a good goal to have and there are several ways to get there .
Your best bet is to understand the patterns that work for me , understand the patterns that work for Dan , and understand the patterns that work for anyone else who is passionate about developer testing .
You 'll find that some of their approaches are in direct conflict .
This is n't because one pattern is superior to another in isolation , it 's because one pattern is superior to another in context .
There 's also another factor worth mentioning .
Innovation around testing is still happening at a rapid pace .
It seems as though there 's a new testing or mocking framework appearing on a weekly basis .
I suspect this is probably representative of the future of testing -- testing frameworks targeted at specific contexts .
As of right now you may write your unit tests and functional tests using the same framework ; however , in the future you may prefer Synthesized Testing when focusing on developer tests and RSpec Story Runner for acceptance tests .
It 's also possible that the newest features of XUnit.net JMock or Mockito will give you a better way to model your domain .
These , and the other testing frameworks , are evolving at a rapid pace because developer testing patterns are still immature and are being adapted to the contexts in which they are used .
In the future you may not use the same tool for several different types of tasks -- and that 's probably a good thing .
It all comes back to context .
The best advice anyone can give you is to consider yours and take the patterns that should help the most ... and then adapt as your context changes .
CRIMES AND CORRUPTION OF THE NEW WORLD ORDER NEWS
by Bob Fertik
George Bush has been tied to a prostitution ring involving as many as 50,000 women and girls and is expected to resign or be impeached , according to Congressional sources .
The prostitutes , some as young as 13 , are among the 1.2 million desperate Iraqis who fled to Syria after Bush ’s invasion of Iraq in 2003 , according to the U.K. Independent .
Bush ’s invasion destroyed the Iraqi government and unleashed a wave of political and sectarian violence that has killed over 1 million Iraqis and forced 4 million to become refugees , according to the UN .
Facing starvation , as many as 50,000 women and girls have been forced into prostitution in Syria alone , according to Hana Ibrahim of the Women ’s Will Association .
“ 70 percent to 80 percent of the girls working this business in Damascus today are Iraqis , ” 23 - year - old Abeer told the New York Times .
“ The rents here in Syria are too expensive for their families .
If they go back to Iraq they ’ll be slaughtered , and this is the only work available . ”
According to the Times , “ inexpensive Iraqi prostitutes have helped to make Syria a popular destination for sex tourists from wealthier countries in the Middle East .
In the club ’s parking lot , nearly half of the cars had Saudi license plates . ”
Driving women and girls into prostitution violates numerous human rights agreements , including the Convention on the Rights of the Child , the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women , and the Protocol to Prevent , Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons , especially Women and Children .
George Bush himself denounced sex trafficking at the United Nations in 2003 .
Bush ’s invasion of a country that posed no threat to the U.S. was illegal under both U.S. and international law , according to legal experts .
Bush has been convicted of war crimes by citizen tribunals around the world , including New York , Paris , Tokyo , and Istanbul .
Just las week , the towns of Brattleboro and Marlboro Vermont voted to indict and arrest Bush and Cheney .
In 2002 and 2003 , Bush led a propaganda campaign to defraud Congress , the American people , and key allies into believing Iraq was a threat .
Bush claimed Iraq had stockpiles of chemical , biological , and nuclear weapons to use against the U.S. , and was sharing them with Al Qaeda .
Speaking near Rochester NY , Bush later admitted , “ See in my line of work you got to keep repeating things over and over and over again for the truth to sink in , to kind of catapult the propaganda . ”
According to a recent study by the Center for Public Integrity , top Bush Administration officials told at least 935 lies about Iraq on 532 separate occasions .
These included 259 lies by Bush , 254 lies by Secretary of State Colin Powell , 109 lies by Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld , 109 lies by Press Secretary Ari Fleischer , 56 lies by National Security Advisor Condi Rice , and 48 lies by Vice President Cheney .
The lies about Iraqi WMD ’s were manufactured by the White House Iraq Group ( WHIG ) , which included the most senior White House staff : White House Chief of Staff Andy Card , Condi Rice , Stephen Hadley , Karen Hughes , Mary Matalin , Jim Wilkinson , Nick Calio , Michael Gerson , and Vice President Cheney ’s Chief of Staff , Scooter Libby .
In July 2003 , former Ambassador Joseph Wilson exposed Bush ’s lie that Iraq sought uranium from Niger in a New York Times op ed.
Libby secretly sought retribution against Wilson by revealing the name of his wife , covert CIA operative Valerie Plame , to several reporters .
The scandal led to the appointment of Special Prosecutor Patrick Fitzgerald , who won conviction of Libby for perjury and obstruction of justice .
Libby was sentenced to to 30 months in prison and fined $ 250,000 , but his jail sentence was commuted by President Bush at the urging of Vice President Cheney to prevent Libby from telling Fitzgerald the truth .
According to George Mason , the “ father of the Bill of Rights , ” it was unquestionably an impeachable offense for a President ( or Vice President ) to “ pardon crimes which were advised by himself . ”
WHIG was chaired by Bush ’s propaganda mastermind Karl Rove , who admitted under harsh questioning at the University of Iowa on Monday , “ I fully expect to be indicted by the end of the year . ”
After the invasion , 1,400 experts in the Iraq Survey Group scoured Iraq for WMD ’s but found none .
Charles Duelfer wrote the ISG ’s final report in September 2004 and concluded Iraq ended its WMD program in 1991 .
This publicly confirmed what the CIA had privately known since 1995 , when Saddam Hussein ’s son-in - law , Gen .
Hussein Kamel , defected to Jordan and told the CIA he had personally overseen the complete destruction of Iraq ’s WMD after 1991 Gulf War .
In May 2005 , the Times of London published the “ Downing Street Memo ” which revealed Bush ’s pre-war intelligence was a deliberate fraud , according to Sir Richard Dearlove , head of Britain ’s MI6 spy agency , who met with George Tenet in July 2002 .
“ The intelligence and facts were being fixed around the policy ” of invading Iraq , Dearlove told a secret meeting of Tony Blair ’s war cabinet on July 23 , 2002 , eight months before Bush invaded Iraq .
This publication of the “ Downing Street Memo ” led to widespread calls for the impeachment of Bush and Cheney .
John Conyers and other Democrats held preliminary impeachment hearings in the basement of the Capitol on June 16 , 2005 .
In 2006 , Conyers published his explosive findings in “ George W. Bush Versus the U.S. Constitution : The Downing Street Memos and Deception , Manipulation , Torture , Retribution , Coverups in the Iraq War and Illegal Domestic Spying . ”
After Democrats won Congress in 2006 , Conyers became Chairman of the Judiciary Committee , and has met repeatedly with impeachment advocates .
Despite widespread reports that Speaker Pelosi is blocking Conyers from starting impeachment , Conyers recently declared , “ I do n’t know who ’s ever stopped me before , I do n’t know why Pelosi ’s going to stop me now . ”
In 2007 , Rep. Dennis Kucinich introduced three Articles of Impeachment against Dick Cheney for his role in the Iraq War lies .
Kucinich ’s bill , H. Res. 333 , has 26 co-sponsors .
The bill was debated on the House floor last November the House voted 251 - 162 to refer it to the Judiciary Committee for further action , rather than kill the bill .
( The bill was renamed to H. Res. 799 . )
Last December , Rep. Robert Wexler and two other members of the House Judiciary Committee urged Conyers to begin hearings on the impeachment of Vice President Cheney .
Wexler posted an online petition and collected over 230,000 signatures .
Rep. Kucinich ran for President in 2007 and his calls for impeachment were enthusiastically received by voters .
Last week , Kucinich fended off a primary challenge in his Congressional district and is expected to introduce the first Articles of Impeachment against George Bush .
But some in Congress believe Bush and Cheney will resign before they are impeached .
“ When the American people finally learn the truth about Bush ’s crimes , Bush and Cheney will have to resign , just like Richard Nixon and Spiro Agnew , ” said a key Congressional Democrat .
“ The pressure on Eliot Spitzer is nothing compared to what we ’ll see for Bush and Cheney , ” he added .
The latest polls by Newsweek and AP - Ipsos put Bush ’s approval rating at 30 % , a record low .
His disapproval rating is over 60 % , a record high , and suggests more Americans now favor Bush ’s impeachment than in earlier polls which showed strong support for impeachment .

A JetBlue pilot forced a Manhattan man to sit on the toilet for three hours during a cross-country flight to free up his seat for a stewardess , the flush - with - fury passenger charges in a $ 2 million lawsuit filed yesterday .
Gokhan Mutlu claims the experience made him feel like a first - class loo-ser – and his Manhattan Supreme Court suit says that he suffered “ emotional and psychological trauma ” and that the JetBlue crew “ publicly . . . humiliated and dishonored ” him .
“ In the middle of the flight , the pilot told me to go to the bathroom and have a seat , ” Mutlu told The Post from his home in upper Manhattan last night .
“ I guess the flight was overbooked , and I did n’t want to make a big deal in front of the other passengers , so I just had a seat .
“ I do n’t feel good .
I was humiliated . ”
Mutlu says the can - finement happened Feb. 23 , when he was a standby passenger for a flight from San Diego to New York .
He was told the flight was full , but a stewardess told him that he could take her assigned seat and that she would sit in the “ jump seat , ” said his lawyer , Zafer Akin .
Mutlu was issued a boarding pass and took Seat 2E , but got a rude awakening as he dozed off about 90 minutes into the red - eye flight , he claims .
The pilot called him to the front and “ advised the plaintiff that he would have to give his seat up ” to the flight attendant , the suit says .
The pilot told him the “ flight attendant wanted to be more comfortable and that the ‘ jump seat ’ was not comfortable for her . ”
A stunned Mutlu asked whether that meant he was supposed to sit in the jump seat for the rest of the five - hour flight , but the pilot told him that would be against regulations , Akin said .
The pilot told him to “ hang out ” in the bathroom , ” the suit says , adding the stewardess took Mutlu ’s seat , “ closed her eyes and pretended to sleep .
When Mutlu argued , the pilot advised him that “ this was his plane , under his command , and that [ he ] should be grateful for being onboard , ” the suit says .
“ The plaintiff walked to the back of the plane , trying to hide and cover his face , ” and “ stepped into the bathroom , closed the door and locked it , ” the suit says .
Soon after , the plane ran into turbulence .
While other passengers were ordered to buckle up , Mutlu was “ sitting on a toilet stool with no seat belts , ” the suit claims .
“ He was looking for things to hold on to , ” Akin said .
After landing , the suit says , the pilot asked Mutlu “ if everything was OK . ”
“ The pilot said , ‘ I do n’t think you appreciate what I did for you . ’
My client said , ‘ You locked me in the bathroom , ’ ” Akin said .
“ I brought you home , ” the pilot countered .
Akin said his client would have been happy to wait for a later flight , and probably would n’t have sued had the crew let him sit in the jump seat .
JetBlue said it does n’t comment on pending litigation .

THE global food crisis has shone a harsh spotlight on the consequences of government meddling in agriculture .
Poor people go hungry , in part , because Americans pay their farmers to divert crops from food to fuel .
But in at least two areas , the crisis has emboldened those who are sceptical of free markets in food .
The first is “ food security ” .
Politicians in rich and poor countries have seized on recent price spikes as proof that free farm trade is a risky business and self - sufficiency a worthy goal .
The second area concerns the poor .
For years reformers have advocated freer trade on the grounds that market distortions , particularly the rich world 's subsidies , depress prices and hurt rural areas in poor countries , where three - quarters of the world 's indigent live .
The Doha round of trade talks is dubbed the “ development round ” in large part because of its focus on farms .
But now high food prices are being blamed for hurting the poor ( the topic of a big United Nations summit in Rome starting on June 3rd ) .
The argument for self - sufficiency is easiest to counter .
Anyone who believes autarky is the route to food security should look at starving North Korea .
In world markets trade barriers , not the lack of them , have exacerbated the mess .
The commodities that have seen the biggest price spikes are those which tend to be traded least .
Only 6 % of global rice production , for instance , flows across borders .
Unilateral export restrictions , such as those imposed by Vietnam and India , have made matters worse .
Global supply is disrupted and domestic farmers discouraged from producing more .
The route to deeper , less volatile markets lies through freer trade and fewer distortions .
The notion that free trade precludes food security is plainly wrong - headed .
The links between trade , food prices and poverty reduction are more subtle .
Different types of reform have diverse effects on prices .
When countries cut their tariffs on farm goods , their consumers pay lower prices .
In contrast , when farm subsidies are slashed , world food prices rise .
The lavishness of farm subsidies means that the net effect of fully freeing trade would be to raise prices , by an average of 5.5 % for primary farm products and 1.3 % for processed goods , according to the World Bank .
These effects are still much smaller than recent food - price spikes , but would they , on balance , help or hurt the poor ?
In crude terms , food - exporting countries gain in the short term whereas net importers lose .
Farmers are better off ; those who buy their food fare worse .
Although most of the world 's poor live in rural areas , they are not , by and large , net food sellers .
A forthcoming study * of nine poor countries by M. Ataman Aksoy and Aylin Isik - Dikmelik , two economists at the World Bank , shows that even in very rural countries , such as Bangladesh and Zambia , only one - fifth of households sell more food than they buy .
That suggests the losers may outnumber winners .
But things are not so simple .
The authors point out that net food buyers tend to be richer than net sellers , so high food prices , on average , transfer income from richer to poorer households .
And prices are not the only route through which poverty is affected .
Higher farm income boosts demand for rural labour , increasing wages for landless peasants and others who buy rather than grow their food .
Several studies show this income effect can outweigh the initial price effect .
Finally , the farm sector itself can grow .
Decades of underinvestment in agriculture have left many poor countries reliant on imports : over time that can change .
The World Bank has often argued that the balance of all these factors is likely to be positive .
Although freer farm trade — and higher prices — may raise poverty rates in some countries , it will reduce them in more .
One much - cited piece of evidence is a study† by Thomas Hertel , Roman Keeney , Maros Ivanic and Alan Winters .
This analysis simulated the effect of getting rid of all subsidies and barriers on global prices and trade volumes .
It then mapped these results on to detailed household statistics in 15 countries , which between them covered 1 billion people .
Fully free trade in farm goods would reduce poverty in 13 countries while raising it in two .
A question of numbers
But lately the bank seems to be taking a different line .
Robert Zoellick , the bank 's president , claims that the food - price crisis will throw 100 m people below the poverty line , undoing seven years of progress .
His figure comes from extrapolating the results of a different study ** by Mr Ivanic and Will Martin , another World Bank economist .
This study analyses the effects of more expensive staple foods on poverty by examining household surveys in nine countries .
In seven cases , higher food prices meant more poverty .
( Dani Rodrik , a blogging Harvard economist , was one of the first to highlight the tension between these studies . )
In fact , the bank 's results are not as contradictory as they seem .
The two studies are based on different sets of countries : only Peru , Zambia and Vietnam appear in both .
And the gloomy analysis measures only the effect of pricier staple foods , whereas the other examines freer trade in all farm goods .
Such trade brings broader benefits : even if higher prices for staples exacerbate poverty in some countries , at least in the short term , the effect may be outweighed by increased demand for other farm exports , such as processed goods , as rich countries cut tariffs .
These subtleties suggest two conclusions .
First , the bank , and others , should beware sweeping generalisations about the impact of food prices on the poor .
Second , the nature of trade reform matters .
Removing rich - country subsidies on staple goods , the focus of much debate in the Doha round , may be less useful in the fight against poverty than cutting tariffs would be .
The food - price crisis has not hurt the case for freer farm trade .
But it has shown how important it is to get it right .

Some call The Matrimandir , the giant golden golf ball .
Enlarge Image
Auroville sounds like a throwback to the 60s , advocating no rules and leaders and promising peace and harmony , but Rachel Wright hears claims of exploitation and abuse at the southern Indian community .
Some call it the giant golden golf ball , and the description is just right .
The Matrimandir - literally the temple of the Mother - is a huge eight - sided almost - spherical building .
It is surrounded by carefully manicured lawns , something of an achievement in arid southern India , and visitors are allowed in only by special appointment .
I joined a group of tourists , mainly Indians , who were being shown around by a middle - aged Frenchman called Gilles .
It struck me as a little strange that a European was showing Indians round a town in their own country .
But then Auroville is a strange place .
Gilles , who has lived there since the early 1980s had helped build the Matrimandir .
He enthused about the symbolism , about the symmetry , and about a woman known as the mother , while we stood under an enormous banyan tree , sheltering from the blistering south Indian sun .
The mother was a French woman called Mirra Alfassa , who lived in nearby Pondicherry , a former French colony .
She was a disciple of a well - known Indian philosopher called Shri Aurobindo , who had moved to the town after he was imprisoned under the British Raj .
Pixie dust Shri Aurobindo believed that evolution was not at an end .
The mother decided that Auroville would be where that evolution could continue , a universal town where people from around the world could live together in harmony and unity , without having to worry about food and shelter .
A place where there were no rules , no leaders and no money .
She proclaimed that at its centre would be the Matrimandir , the soul of Auroville .
It was only finished this year , in time for the 40th anniversary .
Gilles took us inside .
Everything was completely white ; the carpets on the floor , the marble on the walls , even the socks we were given to wear so we would not dirty the floors .
We ascended a walkway to the upper chamber , and opened the door to see what was said to be the largest crystal in the world , lit by a single shaft of sunlight .
As my eyes adjusted to the gloom , specks of fluff rose up from the carpet twinkling like pixie dust .
We all sat down on mats in front of white pillars that did not actually connect to the ceiling .
Cushions were handed out to protect the columns from being marked when we lent against them .
We sat in silence for 15 minutes .
The idea is not necessarily to pray , but rather to be quiet in a holy place .
As we walked out into a wall of heat , Gilles explained that the building of the universal town was going very slowly .
When they began in 1968 the plan had been for a city for 50,000 , 40 years later there are only 2,000 people living there , two thirds of them Westerners .
I asked my French guide whether he thought the ideals of the mother had been realised .
Ideal society ?
" For an ideal society , " he replied , " you have to have ideal people , and we do n't have ideal people . "
" So how do you make them ideal ? " I asked .
Well , the answer is , according to the philosophy of Auroville , through practising yoga .
Later I asked Gilles whether there were some residents here less ideal than others .
" I 'd get rid of half of them , " he told me conspiratorially .
Around 4,000 people are employed at Auroville Aurovillians receive a small maintenance grant , partly funded by the Indian government .
In exchange they are supposed to volunteer for a few hours work every day , " the rest of the time they are seeking the divine " , supposedly .
Actually , they are also in the business of making money , there are at least 120 commercial enterprises operating here , making incense , clothes , silk paintings and so on .
Under the rules , they can keep two - thirds of the profits and pay no tax .
The locals think it is not fair .
They are the ones who work full - time , and often for less than the Aurovillians get in maintenance grants .
" I feel like a slave , " one of them told me .
It 's like being back in the days of the British Raj
Worker at Auroville " Of course they do provide us with jobs , " he said , " but it 's very difficult for us local Tamils to become members . "
" It 's like being back in the days of the British Raj , " said another .
Abuse claims " They are allowed to get away with whatever they like , including paying our children to have sex with them , and we are powerless to complain . "
To be fair Auroville does do a great deal for the local community ; it employs 4000 people , runs schools for local children and has reforested an enormous area that was once a barren landscape .
But even the Aurovillian authorities admit that the community did in the mid-90s include a convicted paedophile .
They say they have strict procedures in place to deal with any incidents that might arise in the future .
Auroville is certainly a strange sort of place , but some way short , I would say , of being an ideal society .

To take a glimpse at what life might be like without today ’s reliable supply we take a trip to Africa , Uganda , courtesy of Nokia who have carried out an investigation looking at how people manage to keep their mobile phones charged and maintain some degree of electricity use at home in off - grid parts of the country .
In Europe we take our electricity supply largely for granted , almost all Europeans have reliable grid electricity at affordable prices .
This is n’t the case everywhere in the world and may not always be the case in Europe .
Electricity is a particular concern in the UK where a generation crisis is brewing with the decommission of the aging nuclear fleet , the closure of around a third of the coal fleet under the EU Large Combustion Plant Directive and the rapid depletion of North Sea gas .
Special thanks to Jan Chipchase ( blog ) and Indri Tulusan of Nokia upon whose research this is based .
The two Nokia presentations discussed below are available for download here
1 ) Power Up : Street Charging Services in Kampala
How to stay charged without access to mains power ?
Much of Uganda ’s population is not served by wire - line telecoms services ( ~100 k telephones for a population of over 30 million ) and likely never will be .
Today ’s obvious choice for network deployment is wireless mobile networks .
A single base station ( which itself requires several kW ) can provide coverage over 60 km if the terrain allows .
This results in mobile phone coverage in areas without grid electricity , possibly for many km , and leads to the question asked by the Nokia researchers :
The mobile phones are charged at stalls on the street .
The example in the photo below was located at bus station .
You deposit your phone with the stall holder in exchange for a receipt detailing the unique identification numbers of both the phone and the battery , the phone is locked in the cupboard and after several hours can be collected fully charged .
Street charging service provider , Kampala , Uganda , Jan Chipchase , 2006
The cost of this service is ~500 Ugandan Shillings or 23 euro cent , for comparison a one minute phone call costs between 200 and 500 Shillings .
Considering a typical phone battery only stores a few watt - hours of energy ( 3.6V and ~ 1000 mAh = 4Wh ) , then at almost 60 euros per kWh this must be some of the most expensive electricity in the world , several hundred times more expensive than European electricity .
When considered next the price of the calls however it does not seem unreasonable .
This is a good example is improvisation .
The stall vendor has taken components that were readily at hand ( chargers and sockets ) and developed the phone charging solution .
The chargers are nothing fancy , just relativity inefficient AC to DC transformers producing a few hundred mA at around 5V , the charging circuitry is in the phone itself .
A more efficient solution would involve a single high performance transformer however I expect absolute efficiency is a secondary consideration to simply cobbling together a solution that works .
I ca n’t help thinking this whole approach is misguided though .
When mobile phones only need such small amounts of energy , investment in a solar charger , shared between several people or even a mechanical hand charger must be a better idea in the long run .
I wonder why they are not used .
Street charging service provider , Kampala , Uganda , Jan Chipchase , 2006
2 ) Rural Charging Services , Uganda
How to stay powered up without access to mains power
The second of the Nokia presentations shifts the focus away from phones on to home power with the question :
The researchers discovered that in rural communities where grid electricity supplies are not available car batteries are the primary means of supply .
A used car battery is said to cost between 30 and 40 US dollars and is enough to last a household using items such as radios , CD players , televisions and domestic lighting for a month .
The challenge , as with the mobile phones , is how the charge the batteries .
The process identified takes 3 to 5 + days :
Deliver the car - battery to a charging service , often tens of kilometres away the nearest town with mains electricity access .
The battery is taken and returned by a trusted and friendly taxi driver or trader .
I takes 3 days to charge a battery , longer if the town where the service is based itself experiences power cuts .
The cost of charging a battery around 1,000 Ugandan shilling ( 0.46 Euro ) , not including delivery .
As a comparison a mobile phone battery costs half as much to be recharged .
Rural car battery charging service provider , Uganda , Jan Chipchase , 2006
As with the solar or mechanical charging for mobile phones I mentioned above , I ’m not convinced this is the best approach .
Lead acid batteries are heavy and the charging process plus transport is expensive .
Surely using off - grid electricity generation using photovoltaic or even a bicycle and dynamo would be better .
Question to the group – how long does it take to charge a car battery with a bicycle ?
Summary
Whist no part of Europe is likely to face prolonged failure of grid electricity in the foreseeable future it is reasonable to suggest the reliability will decline in some areas over the next couple of decades .
We should be asking ourselves ( or possibly the off - grid Ugandans ) how to minimise the socioeconomic impacts of unreliability .
When tackling this issue the Ugandans do not seem to have developed any specific , innovative solutions but rather make do with improvisations based on the technology at hand .
They use banks of regular chargers for the phones not a single large DC power supply , they use car batteries ( according to Nokia ) not the more suitable deep discharge batteries .
I suspect the same will be the case in Europe unless we act with foresight , designing and deploying equipment today , that is tolerant of the intermittent grid supplied electricity we may be faced with in the future .
Previously on The Oil Drum :
Well technically it ’s still Coke by branding alone , but as for the recipe …
Well I noticed the first day we arrived in the U.S.A. that it tasted different to the Coke I was used to back in Australia .
Due mainly to the substitution of an ingredient .
Coke in Australia uses sugar , while Coke here uses HFCS , or High Fructose Corn Syrup .
A horrible sweetening agent that ’s found in absolutely everything .
Well almost , it just seems like everything here is sweetened .
Even bread is sweet .
Yuck .
As anyone who ’s been reading my blog for a while now will know , I have a lot of trouble ordering Coke here in the U.S.A. , my guess is primarily it ’s because of my accent ( Australian ) , and that in many cases that I ’ve seen , that the person I ’m speaking too is either stupid , ignorant , or just plain not paying attention .
So understandably I ’ve been drinking a lot of non-Coke drinks .
Mainly water and sparkling water , as I ’m not generally a big drinker of flavoured beverages anyway .
However , recently Mark discovered that there is such an animal as “ Kosher Coke ” , he discovered this while looking for items for Passover , which is coming up shortly , as he ’s Jewish .
Kosher Coke is made the same way as Australian Coke , no HFCS , just sugar , apparently it ’s hard to find .
But we found some last night while shopping at a supermarket in an area that has a large Jewish population , and of course bought several bottles .
As a side note , if you get a chance to buy Kosher Passover Chocolate ( Alprosa ?? or something like that ) , it ’s brilliant .
But do n’t get me started on chocolate .
That ’s crap here too !
I mean , who puts Glycerine into Chocolate ?
Blurgh .
We brought chocolate back with us on a recent trip , and there ’s more on its way in the post as we speak .
To all you Americans out there , I ’m sorry to be picking on your Coke and Chocolate , but as far as those items go , you do brilliant steaks .
😉
I ’m serious , you do .
I may bitch about some things here , but your steaks are absolutely brilliant !
Anyway … Kosher Coke …
Here ’s an article that was recently on the Australian newspaper site The Age , the details are below to maintain data integrity should the link be removed .
It ’s not just me that has Coke issues .
😉
Oh , and to the author …
Nice tie in to the Jewish holiday * sigh *… “ pass over ” .
Enjoy !
Kosher
Coke too sweet to pass over
Jenny Kleeman , London
March 21 , 2007 AMERICAN
Coca -Cola connoisseurs are celebrating the start of the most important season in their calendar .
They say the perfect can of Coke is only available for a few weeks a year — and if you want the authentic taste of the Real Thing , you need to buy the Jewish Thing .
Passover begins on April 2 .
For eight days , observant Jews keep kosher for Passover by not consuming any product containing grains , apart from matzo , eaten in place of bread .
This poses a problem in the US , where cheap high - fructose corn syrup has been used instead of sugar to sweeten American Coke since the drink ’s relaunch in 1985 .
Corn is a grain , so Coke is n’t kosher .
The company has responded by manufacturing a limited quantity of Kosher Coke , sweetened with sugar , in cans and bottles with “ OU - P ” or “ Kosher L’Pesach ” printed in Hebrew on a yellow cap .
Kosher Coke is only available during March and April in areas with high Jewish populations , such as New York , Los Angeles , Miami and Boston .
Kosher Coke has been hard to find in recent years because non-Jewish aficionados are bulk - buying the product while stocks last .
They say sugared Coke does n’t have the cloying aftertaste associated with corn syrup , and could be less harmful to your health , as recent research has shown a link between increased consumption of high - fructose corn syrup and the growing incidence of obesity and type 2 diabetes .
The Kosher Coke buzz began on online message boards in early February .
“ Woohoo ! ” exclaimed Zap , a sugar - fuelled member of BevNet.com .
“ I ’ve had to ration the remaining cans from last year ’s stash — there are only about nine left ! ”
The Coca -Cola Company insists that this sugar rush is misplaced .
“ We have heard that our kosher - for - Passover Coca - Cola is popular with a variety of consumers , ” says spokesman Scott Williamson .
“ However , consumer taste testing indicates that the final products are equivalent in taste . ”
Non-American consumers keen to sample this new variety need not necessarily rush to the US .
In 500 millilitres of Australian Coke , according to a 2006 Choice survey , there are 10 ½ teaspoonsful of sugar .

Dear Ayman al - Zawahiri :
Please find attached my homemade terror video , entitled “ Death to America . ”
In it , you will see that I brandish an AK - 47 , make angry facial expressions , and threaten the infidels with imminent doom .
Am seeking a full - or part - time position with Al Qaeda making spooky tapes .
Have own cave .
— Fingers Crossed in Peshawar
Ayman al - Zawahiri writes :
Thank you for sharing this with us .
While I ’m afraid your terror video does not meet our needs at the present time , we would be interested in seeing anything scary you do in the future .
Dear Ayman al - Zawahiri :
I am a member in good standing of the Al Aqsa Martyrs Brigade and am considering switching my terror membership to Al Qaeda .
Is there a difference in dental ?
— Confused in Cairo
Ayman al - Zawahiri writes :
Unfortunately , that is not my department .
Please call the office between the hours of eight and five and ask for Al Qaeda No. 37 .
Dear Ayman al - Zawahiri :
I was hatching a terror plot on my cell phone the other day , but now I ’m afraid that the C.I.A. was listening in .
What should I do ?
— Worried in Sharm al - Sheikh
Ayman al - Zawahiri writes :
American law allows the government to eavesdrop on any phone conversation for no reason whatsoever .
But , as a practical matter , this means the Americans are too busy spying on one another to ever spy on us .
Plus , they do n’t know Arabic .
Still , you can never be too cautious .
When talking on your cell phone , never use the words “ Al Qaeda . ”

Here are three questions we ’re asking celebrities this month :
If you could be any character on “ Gossip Girl , ” who would you be ?
Who would be a better friend , Lauren on “ The Hills ” or Ashley Tisdale in “ High School Musical ” ?
Who is hotter , Zac Efron or Joe Jonas ?
( LOL )

Dear Ayman al - Zawahiri :
Does Al Qaeda ever endorse political candidates ?
If so , I recommend that you give a big thumbs - up to Barack Obama .
I guarantee you he hates America as much as you do ( if not more ) !
It would be great if you appeared in a bunch of TV ads and called him “ the evildoing President that evildoers have been waiting for . ”

Ayman al - Zawahiri writes :
Al Qaeda is only interested in American elections to the extent that we can plunge them into abject chaos .
So this year , as in every other year , we are supporting Ralph Nader .

Eight thousand pages of documents related to the Pentagon 's illegal propaganda campaign , known as the Pentagon military analyst program , are now online for the world to see , although in a format that makes it impossible to easily search them and therefore difficult to read and dissect .
This trove includes the documents pried out of the Pentagon by David Barstow and used as the basis for his stunning investigation that appeared in the New York Times on April 20 , 2008 .
The Pentagon program , which clearly violated US law against covert government propaganda , embedded more than 75 retired military officers -- most of them with financial ties to war contractors -- into the TV networks as " message surrogates " for the Bush Administration .
To date , every major commercial TV network has failed to report this story , covering up their complicity and keeping the existence of this scandal from their audiences .
News of the Pentagon 's online posting of the documents came from Joe Trento of the National Security News Service , who notes that NSNS provided the New York Times " limited information about a military office early in the reporting process . "
Here is the official Pentagon website with the 8,000 pages of documents , the most interesting and revealing of them previously secret and only available to the Pentagon and the New York Times :
http://www.dod.mil/pubs/foi/milanalysts/
More than two weeks after the New York Times reported on the Pentagon 's military analyst program to sell controversial policies such as the invasion of Iraq , the broadcast television news outlets implicated in the program are hoping to tough out the scandal by refusing to report it .
Recently Media Matters of America ( MMA ) reported that , according to a search of the Nexis database , " the three major broadcast networks -- ABC , CBS , and NBC -- have still not mentioned the report at all . "
The Pew Excellence in Journalism project has a chart showing that " there was virtually no mainstream media follow up to The Times ' expose " with the only national TV coverage being the introduction segment and live debate featuring CMD's John Stauber on the PBS NewsHour .
Congresswoman Rosa L. DeLauro and three dozen colleagues have sent a letter to the Department of Defense Inspector General calling for an investigation of this " propaganda campaign aimed at deliberately misleading the American public . "
The collapse of New York 's World Trade Centre on September 11 , 2001 is arguably one of the most well documented events in human history .
Less well documented is the controversy over why the buildings fell as they did .
At the time of writing , 357 architectural and engineering professionals have signed a petition which directly challenges the National Institute of Standards & Training 's official finding that the destruction of these massive buildings was caused solely by structural damage from the impact of jet airliners and the resulting fires .
The petition , demanding of Congress a truly independent investigation , states , in part :
" ... the 9/11 investigation must include a full inquiry into the possible use of explosives that may have been the actual cause behind the destruction of the World Trade Center Towers and WTC Building 7 . "
This alarming statement is based on evidence from many sources , including observations of the structural behaviour of the towers as they collapsed , the known characteristics of steel framed buildings , eyewitness testimony of explosions , and research into the chemical composition of dust recovered from the collapse zone .
Current research indicates that an incendiary ( thermite ) may have been used to sever the massive box columns of the towers , causing the buildings to plummet to the ground at close to free - fall speed .
Chemical analysis has been conducted by a multi- disciplinary team led by
Professor Steven E. Jones and the results published in the Journal of 9/11 Studies .
The membership of Architects and Engineers For 9/11 Truth is worldwide , and qualified Australians have made contributions .
Dr. Frank Legge , a chemist , has co-authored a peer reviewed paper , and Dr. David Leifer of the Faculty of Architecture at the University of Sydney is a registered member of the group .
A major focus of research is the mysterious collapse of the
47 storey WTC 7 ( Salomon Brothers ) Building , which was not hit by any plane , yet suddenly collapsed into its own footprint late in the afternoon of September 11 , 2001 .
Building 7 came down in six and a half seconds , generating a massive dust - cloud similar to the one that had enveloped Manhattan when the Twin Towers collapsed earlier the same day .
Researchers contend that only explosives could have provided enough energy to cause the pulverisation of thousands of tons of concrete into dust , and they highlight the symmetrical , free - fall collapse of the building through the path of greatest resistance , indicating that the supporting columns offered no resistance to the falling mass above .
Historically , the only way a modern office building has ever been made to collapse vertically in free - fall , as observed in WTC Building 7 , is through the use of shaped cutter charges detonated in a timed sequence .
This procedure is known as controlled demolition , and requires a precise placement of explosives which are designed to cut through supports successively , usually from the bottom up , pulling buildings down under their own weight .
The collapse of Building 7 is visually identical to a controlled demolition , as illustrated in a side by side comparison on Youtube .
Demolition expert Danny Jowenko has gone on record confirming this observation .
" A team of experts did this " , he said .
The essence of why we need a new investigation into the World Trade Center collapses is summed up in a recent paper by Dr. Frank Legge :
" As no reports have come to light of any steel framed buildings collapsing due to fire , and as all steel framed buildings which had collapsed had done so due to explosive demolition , the logical way to have started the investigation of this surprising event would have been to question whether explosives had been used .
This apparently did not occur .
The organisations carrying out the investigations clearly selectively collected data and contrived arguments to support the fire theory and ignored contradictory evidence .
This is in defiance of the scientific method and flouts the ethical standard of behaviour which the public is entitled to receive from their paid servants . "
The hypothesis of controlled demolition finds further support in many eyewitness accounts , including live TV coverage , which described massive explosions in the lower levels of the World Trade Center prior to the collapse .
William Rodriguez , an acknowledged hero of 9/11 who single - handedly rescued fifteen people from the North Tower , described a massive explosion in the basement which occurred before the first plane struck , pushing him upwards out of the seat of his chair .
The New York Fire Department 's oral histories project contains 118 witness statements which are strongly consistent with explosive demolition .
Incredibly , none of this shocking testimony was included or acknowledged in any official investigation , including the 9/11 Commission .
There is a groundswell of public pressure from family members of victims and ordinary people the world over , to re-open the investigation of 9/11 .
As seen in the groundbreaking film 9/11 : Press For Truth , it was due to the pressure of a group of victim family members , known as the Jersey Girls , that the 9/11 Commission was created , and yet that same commission failed to answer the majority of questions raised by these courageous women .
Films such as Loose Change and 9/11 Mysteries have been viewed by millions on the internet , and opinion polls have consistently shown that a large proportion of the public does not accept the official narrative of 9/11 .
Many believe there has been a major cover - up , while others believe that September 11 was an " inside job " .
As an Australian , I believe there is an urgent need for a new investigation for several reasons .
First , there is the war in Afghanistan , which has already claimed thousands of lives , and appears to have no end in sight .
If the 9/11 official narrative proves to be false , then the attack on Afghanistan may be a war crime .
Second , there is the continued erosion of civil liberties in the form of anti-terror legislation , and increases in police powers of surveillance and detention , which relies largely on 9/11 as the primary justification .
Finally , there are core values of truth , decency and justice at stake , which I wish to uphold and which I ask all Australians to join me in upholding as I say to our elected leaders , with all due respect , we need a new investigation .
Recently I was having a little bit of fun and decided to go about writing a pure JavaScript HTML parser .
Some might remember my one project , env.js , which ported the native browser JavaScript features to the server - side ( powered by Rhino ) .
One thing that was lacking from that project was an HTML parser ( it parsed strict XML only ) .
I ’ve been toying with the ability to port env.js to other platforms ( Spidermonkey derivatives and the ECMAScript 4 Reference Implementation ) and if I were to do so I would need an HTML parser .
Because of this fact it became easiest to just write an HTML parser in pure JavaScript .
I did some digging to see what people had previously built , but the landscape was pretty bleak .
The only one that I could find was one made by Erik Arvidsson – a simple SAX - style HTML parser .
Considering that this contained only the most basic parsing – and none of the actual , complicated , HTML logic there was still a lot of work left to be done .
( I also contemplated porting the HTML 5 parser , wholesale , but that seemed like a herculean effort . )
However , the result is one that I ’m quite pleased with .
It wo n’t match the compliance of html5lib , nor the speed of a pure XML parser , but it ’s able to get the job done with little fuss – while still being highly portable .
htmlparser.js :
4 Libraries in One !
There were four pieces of functionality that I wanted to implement with this library :
A SAX - style API
Handles tag , text , and comments with callbacks .
For example , let ’s say you wanted to implement a simple HTML to XML serialization scheme – you could do so using the following :
var results = " " ; HTMLParser ( " < p id=test > hello < i> world " , { start : function ( tag , attrs , unary ) { results += " < " + tag ; for ( var i = 0 ; i < attrs.length ; i++ ) results += " " + attrs [ i ] . name + '= " ' + attrs [ i ]. escaped + ' " ' ; results += ( unary ? " / " : " " ) + " > " ; } , end : function ( tag ) { results += " </ " + tag + " > " ; } , chars : function ( text ) { results += text ; } , comment : function ( text ) { results += " <!--" + text + " --> " ; } } ) ; results == ' < p id =" test " > hello < i>world </i></p >"
XML Serializer
Now , there ’s no need to worry about implementing the above , since it ’s included directly in the library , as well .
Just feed in HTML and it spits back an XML string .
var results = HTMLtoXML ( " < p> Data : < input disabled > " ) results == ' < p> Data : < input disabled =" disabled " /></p >'
DOM Builder
If you ’re using the HTML parser to inject into an existing DOM document ( or within an existing DOM element ) then htmlparser.js provides a simple method for handling that :
// The following is appended into the document body HTMLtoDOM ( " < p> Hello < b> World " , document ) //
The follow is appended into the specified element HTMLtoDOM ( "< p> Hello < b> World " , document.getElementById( " test " ) )
DOM Document Creator
This is a more - advanced version of the DOM builder – it includes logic for handling the overall structure of a web page , returning a new DOM document .
A couple points are enforced by this method :
There will always be a html , head , body , and title element .
There will only be one html , head , body , and title element ( if the user specifies more , then will be moved to the appropriate locations and merged ) .
link and base elements are forced into the head .
You would use the method like so :
var dom = HTMLtoDOM ( " < p> Data : < input disabled > " ) ; dom.getElementsByTagName( " body " ) .length == 1 dom.getElementsByTagName ( " p " ) . length == 1
While this library does n’t cover the full gamut of possible weirdness that HTML provides , it does handle a lot of the most obvious stuff .
All of the following are accounted for :
Unclosed Tags : HTMLtoXML ( " < p >< b> Hello " ) == '< p >< b> Hello</b></p >'
Empty Elements : HTMLtoXML ( " < img src=test.jpg > " ) == ' < img src=" test.jpg " />'
Block vs. Inline Elements : HTMLtoXML ( " < b> Hello < p > John " ) == '< b> Hello </b><p>John</p >'
Self - closing Elements : HTMLtoXML ( " < p> Hello < p > World " ) == '< p>
Hello</ p><p>World</p >'
Attributes Without Values : HTMLtoXML ( " < input disabled > " ) == ' < input disabled =" disabled " / >'
Note :
It does not take into account where in the document an element should exist .
Right now you can put block elements in a head or th inside a p and it ’ll happily accept them .
It ’s not entirely clear how the logic should work for those , but it ’s something that I ’m open to exploring .
You can test a lot of this out in the live demo .
While I doubt this will cover all weird HTML cases – it should handle most of the obvious ones – at least making HTML parsing in JavaScript feasible .

NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - Oil surged $ 6 to over $ 128 a barrel on Thursday in the largest outright gain on record as signals the European Central Bank may raise interest rates this year pushed down the U.S. dollar .

U.S. crude traded up $ 6.08 to $ 128.38 a barrel after settling up $ 5.49 earlier at 127.79 , erasing two days of sharp losses that had been triggered by worries high prices were starting to eat into global demand .
London Brent crude futures settled $ 5.44 higher at $ 127.54 a barrel , before trading up to $ 127.83 in post - settlement activity .
Oil prices have doubled in a year on growing Asian demand and as investors rushed into commodities as a hedge against the weak dollar and inflation , helping drive crude to a record $ 135 a barrel in May .
“ The dollar had a reversal and that helped to support crude , ” said Tom Bentz , BNP Paribas Commodity Futures Inc .
“ Basically , this is still an uptrend that goes back 10 years .
It is going to take more than two days of losses and talk of demand destruction to end it . ”
Thursday ’s surge came as the greenback fell sharply against the euro on after European Central Bank President Jean - Claude Trichet signaled possible rate hikes later this year .
The comments offset a rare warning this week from the U.S. Federal Reserve on the inflationary risk of a weak dollar , suggesting more interest rate cuts this year are not likely .
“ If the ECB does raise rates it has the same impact on the dollar as the U.S. cutting rates .
So the feeling is , here we go again with the weaker dollar , ” said Peter Beutel , president of Cameron Hanover .
DEMAND WORRIES
Oil ’s losses this week came from concerns that Asian demand growth -- which has helped underpin the six - year rally -- could falter as some countries ease fuel subsidies .
“ You have a large layer of global oil demand which is undertaking cuts in subsidies .
Right now , that is what ’s driving the fundamental worries , ” said Olivier Jakob , analyst at Petromatrix .
This week , India raised retail petrol and diesel fuel prices by about 10 percent and Malaysia hiked petrol prices by 41 percent , after Taiwan , Sri Lanka and Indonesia reviewed their subsidies last month .
Rising fuel prices in Asia and weaker consumption in the United States , the world ’s top consumer , are expected to lead to further reductions in estimates for global oil demand growth in 2008 .
The International Energy Agency , adviser to 27 industrialized countries , issues its latest forecasts next week and has said it may lower its 2008 demand projection further .
The U.S. Energy Information Administration on Wednesday reported gasoline inventories rose 2.9 million barrels last week while gasoline demand over the past four weeks slumped 1.4 percent versus last year .
Distillate stocks jumped by 2.3 million barrels , while crude stocks fell 4.8 million barrels .

The 9 Best Loans for Bad Credit in 2019
Over 8 million people in the United States have bad credit .
While this is n’t great news for the economy , if you ’re one of those millions of people , it ’s nice to know you ’re not alone .
However , when you ’re strapped for cash or need help making a large , life - changing purchase , it does make it more difficult to get a loan .
If you can get a loan , you ’re slapped with ultra - high interest rates .
Do n’t fret !
There are still options .
In today ’s market , everybody ’s got options .
That ’s why we ’ve compiled a list of the best loans for bad credit .
Offering Collateral for a Secured Loan
Secured loans are a great alternative to lowering the loan amount you request .
The only catch is that you ’ll have to put something up for collateral .
This can be a car , truck or even a motorcycle .
If you ’ve already got motorcycle loans or even a lien on your car , you might not qualify for this one .
If you can , however , it ’s a great option .
This is one of the best loans for those with bad credit because they tend to have lower interest rates .
And , you ’ll be able to request more money .
Forego the Banks for a Credit Union Loan
Credit union loans are generally easier to get than loans from a bank .
This is because credit union standards are a little more flex .
Nearly anybody is eligible to join a credit union as long as they live in a certain area .
And , because credit unions are non -for - profits , they ’re able to offer loans at a cheaper rate than traditional financial institutions .
They tend to even give out unsecured loans for bad credit owners .
This means you wo n’t have to hand over anything in collateral !
Peer - to - Peer Lending Offers Some of the Best Loans for Bad Credit
P2P ( peer - to - peer ) lending has become popular in recent years , as it means whoever is providing the loan assumes less risk .
These platforms match borrowers up with one or more lenders who lend the money on their own terms .
This is one of the best loan options for those with bad credit simply because it takes banks out of the equation .
You ’re still responsible for paying the money back , but you ’re less likely to get turned down .
Installment Loans That Require Monthly Payments
If you need cash and you need it now , you can look into an installment loan .
These types of loans are repaid in regular installments ( hence the name ) , that are usually monthly .
They ’re easier to get than other types of loan because they ’re considered short - term .
The repayment period is usually set to about six months .
People with all types of credit scores can usually qualify for installment loans .
Co-Signed Loans for Those with Great Friends
If you ’ve fallen on hard times but a friend or family member still has great credit , you might consider a co-signed loan .
The person who will co-sign the loan is essentially saying that they ’ll pay back the loan if you can’t .
This is a lot of responsibility , so it ’s important to be smart about who you ask .
However , if you can find someone you trust who will co-sign , then these types of loans are great .
They are like regular loans with normal interest rates and terms .
Taking Out a Loan on Your Home Equity
If you own a home and have equity tied up in it , you could qualify for a Home Equity Line of Credit .
What you ’ll be doing is putting your property investment up as collateral .
While this might sound risky , they ’re one of the best loan options if you have poor credit .
This is because you ’re able to take out a tax - deductible line of credit with fair interest rates .
And , the bank wo n’t monitor how you spend the money .
Credit Cards Offer a Different Type of Loan
If you have bad credit , it might be hard to get a new credit card .
Companies like Fingerhut , Total Visa , and First Access Solid Black tend to offer cards with lines of credit to those with low credit scores .
Most people do n’t seem to consider this when thinking about taking out a loan .
But , credit cards are a great way to save on interest fees .
Most cards give you 21 days from the end of the payment period to pay your bill .
If you pay the amount due in full , they wo n’t charge you interest for the things you purchased .
A 0 % interest rate is hard to come by .
This makes credit cards a great choice for those in need of smaller amounts of quick cash .
Let Bad Credit Loans Do the Work for You
If none of the other options have worked for you , then you ’ll want to head over to Bad Credit Loans .
They ’re known for pairing those who have bad credit with willing lenders .
This is similar to a P2P lending platform , but specifically for those who ca n’t get a loan anywhere else .
To qualify , you ’ll need to have a valid phone number and email address .
You ’ll also need to have a regular source of income and have an open checking account .
Personal Loans from Friends or Family
If you can show that you ’re working on correcting your money management habits , then asking for a personal loan from friends or family is a good idea .
This reduces the risks involved in working with a bank .
And , you ’ll be able to decide on how to repay it in a way that makes more sense for you .
Drafting up a loan agreement is still a good idea , and it ’s important to ensure you can repay the loan .
It ’s never a good idea to let finances create a strain between you and loved ones .
Working Around Bad Credit
Bad credit means different things to different lenders .
This is why it ’s so important to shop around , compare and speak with different providers .
The best loans for bad credit , however , will be ones that provide you with fair interest rates and good terms .

For years , I 've wanted to write this piece , but for one reason or another , I did n't think it was the right time to do it .
But now , as I look at technology zealots like myself who have been forced to submit to the will of the vocal minority that has no idea what this industry is all about , I think it 's time .
Whether it 's lawmakers , the RIAA , MPAA , " family groups " or other misguided individuals , these people are taking the technology industry to task for everything it stands for and anything it does .
Gone are the days of appreciation for what technology provides and here are the days of contempt .
Years ago , technology lovers were not - so - affectionately called geeks who had no idea what the real world looks like .
These people were ostensibly scared of the opposite sex in high school , enjoyed tinkering with electronics on weekends and hardly ever played sports .
But as those geeks created technologies that transcended industries , they suddenly gained respect and the pejorative has become a term of endearment in appreciation for the creature comforts those people created .
But now , a new group of people has emerged to confront the tech lovers all over the world and stop them from being able to do what they want with the technology they own .
And while many have tried to confront them on an individual basis , it has not worked .
And it's for that reason that we must all come together and fight the ridiculous impositions brought upon us .
How many times must we hear that video games cause violence before we stand up together and stop the spewing of inaccurate ideas ?
How many times must we listen to the RIAA tell us that college students are the root of all evil as it pertains to piracy before we tell the organization that it 's wrong ?
How many times must we listen to public interest groups allow families to get off the hook instead of blaming them when " security concerns " are revealed to the public before we tell them the truth ?
How many times must we listen to people who have no knowledge of the technology industry restate the misguided ramblings of lawmakers before we vote for change ?
These questions have yet to be answered .
Sure , some of us have ensured that we continue to inform tech lovers from all across the globe about what 's really going on in the industry , but none of us -- journalists and readers -- have stood together to confront the beast that continues to grow each day .
Everyday when I wake up , I 'm constantly reminded by how limited we are in our rights with technology .
Why are women forced to pay ridiculous sums of cash for stealing 20 songs ?
Why are ten - year old children forced into a deposition that the plaintiff hopes will yield even more cash for a misguided cause ?
Why are college students blamed for piracy when huge cartels overseas are allowed to run amok ?
Why can companies charge too much for too little and get away with it ?
Why am I paying for 10 mbps service when I only get 2 mbps ?
According to GamePolitics.com , an Arizona bill that was passed in the state 's House of Representatives last month " would make content producers , publishers and distributors liable for monetary damages if any written , audio , visual or digital material from which they profited was judged to have been " dangerous " or obscene and motivated someone to commit a felony or an act of terrorism . "
The ambiguity of that bill is indicative of many of the laws enacted by lawmakers all over the country .
Instead of forcing people to be responsible for their own actions , lawmakers have seen it fit to embrace a policy that makes those who provide technology to individuals the lawbreakers .
Ironically ( or maybe not ) , that does n't happen in any other industry .
In other , more political , industries , the companies win out , but in the technology business , we 're expected to suffer .
Of course , the plight of the technology industry goes far beyond video games .
Each day , we 're told that what we really want to do is wrong .
You want to download music ?
Nope , you should be paying a ridiculous premium on CDs .
You plan on ripping a DVD you own onto your computer ?
Do n't even think about it .
You 're paying for faster speeds than you really get ?
Oh well .
You 're forced to pay $ 175 to get out a cell phone contract ?
Tough luck .
Some have said that it 'll eventually get better when the younger generation assumes positions of power and I agree with that .
But who really wants to wait that long ?
Why has the entire technology industry rolled over in the face of lawmakers and misguided organizations for no good reason ?
Enough is enough .
I think it 's time that every person who truly cares about the future of the technology industry and their own well - being stands up and rights the injustices being forced upon each and every one of us .
We should n't be forced into specific arrangements that promise more than they provide and we surely should n't wait in anxious anticipation of what could be .
For what it 's worth , I call on all journalists , readers and companies to forego their apathy and do what they can to stand together and fight the ridiculous notion that technology should be throttled back for fear of its inability to adapt to the expectations of the Old Guard .
If nothing else , technology is the beacon of hope in these times of economic and socio-political tumult and we should do what we can to ensure that misguided individuals and lawmakers alike understand and fully appreciate the value and importance of technology .
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) -- America 's first female four - star general has been nominated , the Pentagon announced Monday .
Lt. Gen. Ann E. Dunwoody was nominated to be America 's first four - star female general .
President Bush nominated Lt. Gen. Ann E. Dunwoody to serve as head of the Army 's supply arm .
By law women are excluded from combat jobs , the typical path to four - star rank in the military .
" This is an historic occasion for the Department of Defense and I am proud to nominate Lt. Gen .
Ann Dunwoody for a fourth star , " said Defense Secretary Robert Gates .
" Her 33 years of service , highlighted by extraordinary leadership and devotion to duty , make her exceptionally qualified for this senior position . "
The Senate must approve the nomination .
Dunwoody , a native of New York , was commissioned as a second lieutenant in 1975 after her graduation from the State University of New York in Cortland .
She also holds graduate degrees in national resource strategy and logistics management .
She became the Army 's top- ranking woman in 2005 when she received her third star and became deputy chief of staff for Army logistics .
" I am very honored but also very humbled today with this announcement , " said Dunwoody .
" I grew up in a family that did n't know what glass ceilings were .
This nomination only reaffirms what I have known to be true about the military throughout my career ... that the doors continue to open for men and women in uniform . "
The Army Materiel Command handles all material readiness for the Army .
During her career , Dunwoody has been assigned to the 82nd Airborne Division , 10th Mountain Division and the Defense Logistics Agency .
She served with the 82nd Airborne in Saudi Arabia during the 1991 Persian Gulf War .
She has been awarded the Distinguished Service Medal , Defense Superior Service Medal , the Legion of Merit , the Meritorious Service Medal , the Army Commendation Medal , the Army Achievement Medal , Master Parachutist Badge and the Army Staff Identification Badge .
The first woman to become a general officer in the U.S. armed services was Brig .
Gen. Anna Mae Hays , chief of the Army Nurse Corps , who achieved the rank in 1970 and retired the following year .
Elizabeth Hoisington , the director of the Women 's Army Corps , was promoted to brigadier general immediately after Hays .
She also retired the following year .
Maj . Gen. Jeanne M. Holm , the first director of Women in the Air Force , was the first woman to wear two stars , attaining the rank in 1973 and retiring two years later .
In 1996 , Marine Lt. Gen. Carol A. Mutter became the first woman to wear three stars .
Mutter retired in 1999 .
Currently , there are 57 active - duty women serving as generals or admirals , five of whom are lieutenant generals or vice admirals , the Navy 's three - star rank , according to the Pentagon .
All About U.S. Army Activities
It 's hard to believe that there was a time before high - speed Internet access , wi-fi , or even USB .
Back then , the word " computer " meant a big beige desktop box with a bulky CRT monitor - not a sleek notebook - and being online means you 're tying up the phone line to the consternation of your mom .
Here 's what I remember from the good ol ' days of computing :
IBM PC Compatible
The original IBM PC ( Model 5150 )
My first computer was an IBM PC , except it was n't made by IBM - it was a Taiwanese clone , euphimistically called " IBM PC compatible " or an " IBM clone " .
In the 1980s , IBM marketed the PC ( or personal computer ) as a response to Apple 's products - to grab market share , IBM decided on the open architecture and many manufacturers rushed their own computer brands to the market .
My old PC compatible computer looked similar to the original IBM PC ( Model 5150 ) shown above .
It had a green CRT monitor and ran MS - DOS the operating system .
Sometimes when I turned the computer on by flipping the switch at the back , I 'd get a mild electric shock .
The two black squares in the front are floppy disk drives ( A : and B : , respectively ) - if you ever wonder why your hard disk is called C : , that 's because it comes after the two floppy drives .
Even after the floppies became obsolete , the hard disk is still called C : out of convention .
By the way , IBM PC was developed in a very short time by a " skunkworks " project , called Project Chess , at IBM 's Boca Raton Florida facility , led by Don Estridge and Larry Potter .
The team of 12 engineers was authorized by the company to bypass the usual ( and lengthy ) IBM design process and get something to the market quickly .
Within one year , the team managed to use off - the - shelf components to build the first IBM PC .
Sadly , once the IBM PC became a commercial success , the company put it under the usual IBM management , which decided to restrict the performance of the computer as not to " cannibalize " profits from higher - priced models .
As a result , competitors selling PC clones quickly took over the market .
Mystery House
Mystery House is the first computer game I ever played - in fact , it 's the only thing I remember about our Apple II computer .
In the game , you are an uninvited guest locked inside a Victorian mansion with no way out .
Inside , there are seven guests and a note about a hidden treasure .
While exploring the house , you start finding dead bodies ... and you have to discover the murderer before becoming the next victim .
Mystery House was created by Ken Williams and his wife Roberta .
It was the first computer game ever to contain graphics .
Before it , computer games depended entirely on text to tell their stories .
Ken coded the game in a few nights and Roberta drew the graphics .
The game caught on quickly and became the most popular game for the Apple II computer , selling over 10,000 copies .
Shortly afterwards , the Williams founded a gaming company called On - Line Systems which would later become Sierra On - Line and then Sierra Entertainment .

Macintosh Classic
I did n't own a Mac until grad school , when I was forced to buy one to write a thesis ( blue iMac , btw ) - but I did play mahjongg on my uncle 's old Macintosh Classic ( 128 K ?
I do n't remember ... ) when I was growing up .
It was so different than my PC at the time : the Macintosh had a graphical interface and a mouse !
I remember fondly the little mac icon that smiled when you boot up the computer .
Floppy Disk
Before hard disks became affordable , we had floppy disks .
They were called floppy disks because , well , they were floppy ...
The 5.25 inch diskette could hold - get this - 360 KB .
Twice that if you punched a hole on the left side of the disk and put it the drive in upside down .
To protect the disk from being re-written , all you have to do was put a sticker over the notch and the disk drive would n't write on it .
When the 3.5 inch disk came out , we all thought that it was so cool that you could store 1.44 MB worth of files on the things .
So much space , what would we do with it all ?
LOGO
Ah , Logo - now that was a fun computer programming language !
Logo was the first programming language I 've ever learned , and to this day , the only one I like and probably the only one I was ever proficient at .
Well , at least in making simple shapes :)
The language is all about the turtle , an on - screen cursor that you use to draw simple line graphics .
You can tell the turtle to go forward 100 units , then turn left or right , and so forth .
Dot Matrix Printer
Ah , the screeching sound of a dot matrix printer !
There 's nothing like it ...
One minute you 're printing ( noisily ) , and the next minute the darned paper got off the reel and suddenly you 're printing at an angle ... before the stupid printer jammed .
But if everything worked out , then there 's nothing as satisfying as ripping the little strips of " holey " paper on the sides .
Never heard a dot matrix print before ?
Count your blessings , but if you 're curious , here 's a YouTube clip :
If you remember dot matrix printer , you probably remember creating " Happy Birthday " or some other silly banners with this iconic software that had since gone the way of dinosaurs : Broderbund 's Print Shop .
Dot matrix printers are actually still around - they 're now called " impact " printers , and , surprisingly , are more expensive than ever !
Modem
Ever heard a modem " handshake " ?
No ?
It 's just like a fax machine .
My first modem was a 2400 baud ( 240 characters per second ! ) , and over the years I upgraded to 9600 - baud , then to 14.4 K , then 28.8 K and so on .
With every upgrade , I felt that the speed improvement was incredible !
How fast is a 9600 baud modem ?
Consider this : after 1 minute of downloading at 9600 baud , you 'll get 72 KB .
A cable modem can download that in less than a second .
With modem comes connectivity , which brings us to to our next item :
Bulletin Board System ( BBS )
Remember the Buggles ' song " Video Killed the Radio Star " ?
Well , Bulletin Board System was the Radio Star , and Internet was the Video .
For all of you who are too young to remember BBSes , they are computer systems that you dial in ( with a phone line , and yes , you get the phone bill at the end of the month if it's not a local call ) to connect .
Once you 've connected to a BBS , you can do things like post messages , upload and download software .
BBSes often have highly detailed ASCII art - some are black and white , but others are in full color , like this one below :
Image : Carsten Cumbrowski aka Roy / SAC
This one is for an elite board ( which traded in warez or pirated softwares ) with two nodes ( 2 phone lines ) run on two Intel 80486 or simply " 486 " computers with 8 MB of RAM and a ( then unbelievably huge ) storage of 1 GB .
And no , I was n't cool enough to be invited into an elite board ...
See Carsten 's website roysac.com for an amazing collection of ASCII art .
Oh , and this invariably happened at least once to those who have dialed into a BBS : your mom picked up the phone while you 're online and thus disconnected you just seconds away from when the file was supposed to finish downloading !
Prodigy
Before the web , there were Prodigy and CompuServe .
They were premium online services , much like a proto - Internet , except they provide proprietary content ( and were both heavily censored - more on that later ) .
Of the two , I subscribed to Prodigy , which was more kid-friendly ( and cheaper - CompuServe charged by the minute ! ) .
I remember fondly perusing their message boards , which were very popular at the time ( what was I doing ?
Looking up NES cheat codes , actually ! ) .
I cancelled the service because of heavy - handed censors who admonished me for having the word " damn " in one of my posts .
That was enough to put me on their watch list and I got harrassed for innocent words like " cockroach . "
When Prodigy went out of business because of the Internet , I was n't sad .
Doom
Doom took the computer gaming world by a storm in 1993 :
It was n't the first game in the FPS ( or first person shooter ) genre , but it was unique that id Software , the creator of the game , marketed it by ... giving it away !
Doom was distributed as a shareware that you could download and play for free ( once you 're hooked , you have to pay for subsequent versions ) .
Doom was so popular that during lunch times , computer networks in university campuses sometime grind to a halt as people log on to play the game !
CompUSA
CompUSA store in Santa Clara , California .
Photo : Coolcaesar [ wikipedia ]
You guys probably remember it as the retail chain that went out of business a year ago , but I first remember them first as Soft Warehouse .
I even bought a 486 " Compudyne " computer ( their house - brand ) for college !
In an effort to restructure or rebrand or whatever , the company changed its name to CompUSA but forgot to change their horrible customer service ...
Their service was so bad that ultimately the once largest chain of computer superstores in the world went out of business .
NCSA Mosaic
Before the Internet Explorer , and Firefox browsers , there was the NCSA Mosaic .
It was the first graphical web browser ( which was an improvement over the text - only Gopher and telnet protocols ) .
Mosaic was designed by Marc Andreessen ( then an undergraduate ) and Eric Bina .
Even though you may not be familiar with this browser , you 're viewing this webpage on a browser that is its legacy .
We have n't talked about many things - Amiga , MUDs ( Multi - User Dungeons ) , IRC ( Internet Relay Chat ) , and countless other topics .
And obviously , your trip down computing memory lane may be different than mine ( and if you 're young enough , none of these things above - perhaps with the exception of CompUSA - are familiar ) .
So , tell us what you remember - share your computing memory lane !

I hope that those of you who voted for Huckabee are now completely ashamed at yourselves .
I further hope that you realize that the religious right which controls the Republican Party most likely agrees with him .
I wo n't go as far to say McCain is in that camp .
I think McCain is playing to the right , but is far more neutral .
But I think McCain needs to come out right now and slap Huckabee down .
If he fails to do this then how can anyone possibly think he can handle another country if he can't control the leadership of his party .
This comment from Huckabee honestly made me sick .
I also think Clinton needs to comment .
This is a statement so vile that is has to make you wonder how this nation allows people like Huckabee even get this far .
I am outraged .
During a speech before the National Rifle Association convention Friday afternoon in Louisville , Kentucky , former Republican presidential candidate Mike Huckabee — who has endorsed presumptive GOP nominee John McCain — joked that an unexpected offstage noise was Democrat Barack Obama looking to avoid a gunman .
“ That was Barack Obama , he just tripped off a chair , he 's getting ready to speak , ” said the former Arkansas governor , to audience laughter .
“ Somebody aimed a gun at him and he dove for the floor . ”
Obama supports extending the assault weapons ban , limits on gun sales , and a national law against carrying concealed weapons , with exceptions for retired police and military personnel .
John McCain – whose legislative record was awarded a C+ rating by the NRA in 2004 , but has received a perfect score – will address the group later Friday afternoon .
His speech will include remarks " on the issue of unconditional negotiation with state sponsors of terror " that aides tell CNN ’s Dana Bash are a direct response to Obama ’s comments earlier Friday .
Watch Huckabee 's joke at the NRA Convention Friday .

The cast of villains in Latin American politics always seems to feature the same players : left - wing guerrillas , right - wing death squads and Chiquita Brands International .
The leftist rebels want to take from the rich and give to the poor , the right - wing death squads want a political system that favors a wealthy elite , and Chiquita wants bananas .
And in pursuit of an endless supply of tropical gold , it is even willing to placate Colombian terrorists .
Although the U.S. State Department placed the left - wing Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia , known as FARC , on the list of terrorist organizations in 1997 , and added the right - wing United Self Defense Forces in 2001 , Chiquita did business with both , making “ protection payments ” it said were necessary to safeguard the lives of its employees .
U.S. law prohibits such deals with terrorists , but when the government caught Chiquita in violation , it graciously agreed to fine the company $ 25 million -- the precise amount the company had suggested .
None of that money , however , will reach the victims of the terrorists that Chiquita ’s money helped arm .
That ’s why a lawsuit filed this month by the widows of five men killed by the FARC gives such grim satisfaction .
It joins several others , also in federal district court in Miami , accusing Chiquita of complicity in the deaths of Colombians killed by the two paramilitary groups .
This most recent suit seeks unspecified damages , but we can only hope the company is punished severely for a business strategy that enabled terrorists in order to protect Chiquita ’s people and profits .
While the FARC was dragging three American military contractors off to the jungle -- where , five years later , they are still being held , along with hundreds of other hostages -- Chiquita was doing business with their captors .
And while American taxpayers were sending Colombia billions of dollars in military aid to fight drug trafficking -- the primary source of funding for the terrorists -- Chiquita was countering that effort by providing revenue to the thugs .

Maybe it ’s true that Chiquita could n’t have done business in rebel territory without negotiating with the rebels , but that was its choice .
And if dealing with terrorists is a legitimate business expense , then so is compensation for terrorists ’ victims .
Having made a deal with the devil , it ’s time for Faust to pay up .
If you 're familiar with the work of aging researcher Michael Rose , you 'll know that he uses " immortality " to mean no increase in mortality rate with advancing time .
He demonstrated that mortality rates in flies , for example , stop rising after a certain age .
This is counterintuitive for most people , given our experience with the world - we expect the chance of death on any given day to continue to increase as age - related degeneration piles up .
The flies all still die , of course , because the odds come up sooner or later , but they do n't get any more likely to die per unit time whilst in this " immortal phase . "
You can find a more detailed explanation in Rose 's essay in the online version of The Scientific Conquest of Death - it 's the first essay in the book .
Biological " immortals " will often die , just not because of a systematic , endogenous , ineluctable process of self - destruction .
Death is not aging .
Biological immortality is not freedom from death .
Instead , the demonstration of immortality requires the finding that rates of survival and reproduction do not show aging .
...
In caged insects , kept under good conditions , mortality rates stop increasing in late life .
The new facts of death reveal three phases of mortality : juvenile , aging , and late life .
In the juvenile period , mortality rates do not show sustained increases .
In the aging phase , mortality rates increase rapidly .
In the third phase of life , mortality rates are roughly constant , though they tend to maintain a very high level .
Organisms that reach the third phase can be said to be biological immortal , in that they no longer age .
This all sprang to mind when I noticed a paper on cancer rates in the old :
Increased age is regularly linked with heightened cancer risk , but recent research suggests a flattening around age 80 .
We report that , independent of cancer site or time period , most incidence rates decrease in the more elderly and drop to or toward zero near the ceiling of human life span .
...
Almost all cancers peak at age approximately 80 .
Generally , it seems that centenarians are asymptomatic or untargeted by cancers .
We suggest that the best available justification for this pattern of incidence is a link between increased senescence and decreased proliferative potential among cancers .
Then , thus far , as senescence may be a carcinogen , it might also be considered an anticarcinogen in the elderly .
Your guess is as good as mine as to the mechanism by which cancer rates fall after 80 , though the centenarian mention is probably a red herring .
Centenarians tend to suffer less of everything bad , being more healthy and active than their peers at every age , as a result of ( to some degree ) genetic luck and ( more influentially ) lifestyle choices like exercise and light calorie restriction .
That every cancer type is affected probably points to something global , such as the immune system , but nothing plausible springs to mind .
In any case , we can speculate that this is one component of Rose 's late life immortality , as demonstrated in humans .
Less cancer means a decreasing contribution to mortality rate due to death by cancer .
Does human mortality rate in fact flatten out in old age ?
I believe that remains debated but plausible , lacking the irrefutable sort of statistical data one can produce with flies in the laboratory .
With all of the Prius hybrids on the road these days and Toyota 's emphasis on gas- electric drivetrains , it 's easy to forget the company is a big player in hydrogen fuel cell vehicles - and it's developed one that sets a benchmark for range .
The FCHV - adv has a maximum cruising range of 516 miles on a single tank of hydrogen , more than twice the range of its predecessor and considerably higher than the 270 miles of the FCX Clarity that Honda will begin leasing to a very small number of people this summer .
Toyota says the FCHV - adv has been certified by the Japanese government , and the company plans to begin leasing them in Japan later this year .
So how'd they do it ?
Toyota upped the size of the storage tank from 148 to 156 liters and doubled the storage pressure to 70 MPa ( about 10,000 PSI ) .
It also increased fuel efficiency by 25 percent through improved fuel cell performance , enhanced regenerative braking and cutting the amount of energy required to drive the accessory systems .
The fuel cell also will operate at temperatures as low as 22 degrees Fahrenheit below zero .
The FCHV - adv still uses a nickel metal hydride battery , whereas the Clarity has a lithium - ion battery .
The two companies were the first to introduce hydrogen fuel cell vehicles in 2002 , and they 've been locked in a race to develop the first commercially viable hydrogen vehicle .
Although both companies plan to have the vehicles on the road - albeit in very limited numbers - by the end of the year , fuel cells remain hobbled by their high costs , which is why the vehicles are being leased .
Fuel cells remain expensive to manufacture and their long - term durability remains suspect ( although it is improving ) , and - the FCHV - adv aside - they offer relatively limited range .
Still , most major automakers are aggressively developing hydrogen vehicles .
BMW is putting its Hydrogen 7 in the hands of Hollywood celebrities , General Motors promise to roll out the Equinox Cell Vehicle later this year and Hyundai says it will produce hydrogen cars by 2012 .
Clearly the auto industry is clearly confident that it can clear those hurdles .
That just leaves the matter of creating the fueling infrastructure ...

Obama cannot win , Hillary Clinton allegedly told Bill Richardson

Bill Richardson , the New Mexico governor who amid much fanfare recently endorsed Sen.
Barack Obama for president , admitted at the time that his call to Sen.
Hillary Clinton , disappointed with his allegiance about - face , was " heated . "
What was actually said between Sen. Clinton and Richardson , the former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations during the White House years of Sen. Clinton 's husband , has been off the record .
That is , until now .
ABC News chief Washington correspondent George Stephanopoulos reports that Sen. Clinton insisted to Richardson , " [ Obama ] cannot win , Bill .
He cannot win . "
Stephanopoulos , himself a former Clinton administration official , said the details of the call were confirmed with " sources who have direct knowledge of the conversation , " during which , he says , the New York senator " made the most stark argument you can make . "
This video is from ABC's World News , broadcast April 2 , 2008 .
Candy cigarettes are joining real cigarettes as a top cause of cancer .
Word came last week from both sides of the Atlantic .
Doctors in England , pouring through the records of nearly 300,000 cancer cases , have found that being overweight raises the risk of developing 20 different kinds of cancer .
The study , led by Andrew Renehan of the University of Manchester , is detailed in the current issue of The Lancet .
Meanwhile in Boston , at the annual meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science , nutrition expert Walter Willett of the Harvard School of Public Health predicted that obesity will soon replace smoking as the leading cause of cancer in the developed world .
He was referring to multiple studies — some on animals and some ongoing , involving hundreds of thousands of humans — that leave little doubt to the obesity - cancer connection .
Upwards of 20 percent of cancers are associated with obesity , Willett said , rapidly narrowing in on tobacco 's 30 - percent hold .
But as fewer people smoke in the United States , and as more of us pack on pounds , those numbers will soon be reversed .
Fat chance
In some ways , this is getting to be old news .
Obesity is unhealthy , a study will say , and news editors everywhere get to run those recycled photos of fat bodies with enormous butts and guts , cropped below the head as they walk across the street .
Yet these latest results help correct a misconception that has arisen in recent years that carrying extra weight , particularly as we age , can be beneficial .
Studies have indeed shown that being slightly overweight at age 75 or above can lower the risk of death .
The reason is not clear and might be a figment of statistical analysis .
Doctors attribute the finding to the fact that being underweight at that age is a result of disease that leads to death ; that bodies shrink , distorting the body - mass index and shifting a person into the category of " overweight ; " and that extra weight can improve the odds of surviving cancer treatment or a bad case of the flu .
One such study from 2006 , from the University of Southern California , published in the American Journal of Epidemiology , found that men and women in their 80s who were a few pounds overweight had lower mortality rates than lean individuals .
That same study , however , found that people who were overweight or obese at age 21 had the highest rates of mortality of all the groups studied .
The caveat to these studies is how many extra pounds and when were they gained .
In the USC study , sadly , there were no obese subjects in their 80s .
How to live to 100
The trick to living to 100 , the joke goes , is to live to 99 .
The trick to being a healthy overweight at age 80 is to be at a healthy normal weight all your life , or you 'll never get to age 80 .
Having some meat on your bones is a good way to weather the trauma of cancer treatment .
But not getting cancer just might be a bit more practical .
And remaining lean is a good start on that goal .
Of course , there are no guarantees , only means to reduce risks .
You'd be hard - pressed , however , to find overweight people in the 90s or over 100 .

FALLUJAH – Amidst unemployment and impoverishment , Iraqis now face a cutting down of their monthly food ration – much of it already eaten away by official corruption .
Iraqis survived the sanctions after the first Gulf War ( 1990 ) with the support of rations through the Public Distribution System ( PDS ) .
The aid was set up in 1995 as part of the UN ’s Oil - for - Food program .
The sanctions were devastating nevertheless .
Former UN program head Hans von Sponeck said in 2001 that the sanctions amounted to " a tightening of the rope around the neck of the average Iraqi citizen . "
Von Sponeck said the sanctions were causing the death of 150 Iraqi children a day .
Denis Halliday , former UN humanitarian coordinator for Iraq who quit his post in protest against the sanctions , told IPS they had proved " genocidal " for Iraqis .
During more than five years of US - occupation , the situation has become even worse .
The rationing system has been crumbling under poor management and corruption .
From the beginning of this year , the rations delivered were reduced from 10 items to five .
" We used the PDS as counter - propaganda against Saddam Hussein ’s regime before the US occupation of Iraq began in 2003 , " Fadhil Jawad of the Dawa Party led by Prime Minister Nouri al - Maliki told IPS in Baghdad .
" But then we found it necessary to maintain basic support for Iraqi people under occupation .
We blamed Saddam for feeding Iraqis like animals with simple rations of food – that we fail to provide now . "
" When the Americans came to occupy Iraq , they promised us a better life , " Ina ’m Majeed , a teacher at a girls school told IPS in Fallujah .
" After killing our sons and husbands , they are killing us by hunger now .
The food ration that was once enough for our survival is now close to nothing , and the market prices are incredibly high .
It is impossible for 80 percent of Iraqis now to buy the same items they used to get from the previous regime ’s food rations . "
Ina ’m ’s husband was killed in a US air strike during the April 2004 siege of her city , leaving her with four children to bring up .
A World Food Program ( WFP ) report in May 2006 found that just over four million people in Iraq were " food - insecure and in dire need of different kinds of humanitarian assistance . "
According to the United Nations Refugee Agency ( UNHCR ) in April 2007 , of the four million Iraqis who cannot regularly buy enough to eat , only 60 percent had access to PDS rations .
The situation is worse today .
The former Iraqi ministry of trade used to distribute fair quantities of food in the PDS , then low quality food at the beginning of the UN sanctions .
The quantities were reduced after the sanctions lasted longer than the former government expected .
After Iraq signed the memo of understanding in 1996 with the UN , the quality and quantity of food notably improved .
" Do not blame Iraqis for calling the sanctions days ‘ the good old days ’ because they were definitely good compared to the dark days we are living under US occupation , " Abu Aymen , a 45 - year - old lawyer with eight children told IPS in Fallujah .
" All Iraqis complained about life under Saddam ’s regime because it was bad , but it seems that all the good things , little as they were , have been taken away along with his statues . "
Aymen added , " We used to get cheese , powdered milk for us and our children , shaving paste and blades , tomato paste , special food for children , beans , soap and cleaning detergents , and even chicken , as well as basic foods like flour , rice , cooking oil , tea and sugar .
Now we get bullets and missiles and polluted food and medicines . "
Haj Chiad , a PDS distribution agent in Fallujah , told IPS that he now also distributes illness .
" I used to deliver food , but now I distribute poison with it , " he said .
" It has happened many times during the past four years that the food given to us by the ministry of trade was either rotten or actually poisoned .
We distributed rice and sugar from sacks that had been stored a long time in damp places , and tomato paste that was long past its expiry date before we received it . "
The Iraqi parliament ’s Committee for Integrity has demanded comprehensive interrogation of minister for trade Abdul Falah al - Sudany for the " vast corruption in his ministry . "
But as with other complaints of corruption , Maliki has taken no action .
Company can fire medical pot user , court rules CALIFORNIA
Inside his Oakland lawyers offices , Gary Ross talked to the media about his court case Thursday .
Ross was fired by a Sacramento company with federal contracts after they learned he uses medical marijuana for back spasms .

The state Supreme Court poked another hole in California 's medical marijuana law Thursday , ruling that the voter - approved measure does n't protect users from being fired for testing positive for the drug at work .
In a 5 - 2 decision , the court said the 1996 initiative , Proposition 215 , exempted medical marijuana patients and their caregivers from state prosecution , but did n't limit an employer 's authority to fire workers for violating federal drug laws .
" We have no reason to conclude the voters intended to speak so broadly , and in a context so far removed from the criminal law , as to require employers to accommodate marijuana use , " Justice Kathryn Mickle Werdegar said in the majority opinion .
Dissenting Justice Joyce Kennard said the voters never intended to subject medical marijuana users to the " cruel choice " of forgoing their medication or losing their jobs .
A state lawmaker spoke in similar terms later in the day in announcing legislation that would overturn the ruling .
" The people of California did not intend that patients be unemployed in order to use medical marijuana , " said Assemblyman Mark Leno , D - San Francisco .
He said he would introduce a bill in a few weeks that would protect employees from being fired for off - the - job marijuana use that had been recommended by a doctor for pain or illness .
Leno said the legislation would not allow employees to possess or use the drug at work .
He said he is optimistic the Legislature will pass such a bill but is uncertain whether Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger would sign it .
The governor 's office declined to comment .
Schwarzenegger endorsed medical marijuana during the 2003 recall campaign that put him in office , but he has also been receptive to the concerns of businesses , which are likely to oppose any legislation restricting their ability to fire drug users .
Prop. 215 , which made California the first of a dozen states to legalize medical marijuana , has been weakened in a series of conflicts with federal laws , which prohibit the possession , cultivation or distribution of marijuana and declare that the drug has no legitimate use .
The U.S. Supreme Court has upheld the federal government 's authority to shut state - approved medical marijuana dispensaries in California and prosecute patients and their suppliers under federal law .
Thursday 's case involved Gary Ross , a 45 - year - old computer technician who was fired by a Sacramento firm for testing positive for marijuana despite a doctor 's note saying he needed the drug to combat back spasms that cause severe pain .
Ross , according to his lawsuit , injured his back while in the Air Force in 1983 and could find no relief from the spasms until 1999 , when his doctor recommended marijuana .
He was hired as a computer administrator by RagingWire Communications in September 2001 and was fired 11 days later for testing positive for marijuana .
Ross said he had never used the drug at work or been impaired by its effects on the job , and that he had performed his duties competently .
Nonetheless , the court majority said , neither Prop. 215 nor the state 's disability discrimination law requires employers to allow workers to use drugs banned by federal law .
Prop. 215 " does not eliminate marijuana 's potential for abuse or the employer 's legitimate interest in whether an employee uses the drug , " Werdegar said .
She noted that the initiative did not mention employment or the workplace and said RagingWire " has not prevented ( Ross ) from having access to marijuana . "
Kennard , joined in dissent by Justice Carlos Moreno , countered that the ruling " renders illusory the law 's promise that responsible use of marijuana " will not be penalized .
Ross now manages campgrounds in and around Sacramento , a job that he said did not require a drug test .
" People are going to endure pain and suffering because Supreme Court justices do n't feel marijuana has medical value , " Ross said .
" It does n't matter what the citizens say .
It does n't matter what the doctors say . "
Lawyers on both sides of the case said pre-employment testing for marijuana is common among California employers , especially those that have federal contracts and are legally required to keep their workplaces drug - free .
No surveys have been conducted on the prevalence of testing , but attorney Joseph Elford of the advocacy group Americans for Safe Access , who represented Ross , said hundreds of people have called the organization in its six years of existence with similar complaints .
He said he feared the ruling would prompt more employers to fire medical marijuana users or refuse to hire them .
Robert Pattison , the lawyer for RagingWire , praised the court for clearing up the uncertain relationship between Prop. 215 and workplace discrimination laws , which require employers to offer reasonable accommodations to employees suffering from disabilities .
The ruling demonstrates , he said , that disability law " does n't require California employers to accommodate the use of illegal drugs , including so - called medical marijuana . "
Stuff reports , via Fark :
[ A ] man suffered minor burns in a brief but " dramatic " operating theatre fire which is believed to have been caused by flatulence , The New Zealand Herald reported today .
The man was at the Southern Cross Hospital in Invercargill to have haemorrhoids removed and was singed in the " exceedingly rare " incident involving his own gas .
Scribal Terror has covered the issue of unintentional surgical patient ignition in relation to polypectomies , but never hemorrhoidectomies .
In any event , here 's a reprise :
According to an MDSR ( Medical Device Safety Reports ) article called " The Patient Is on Fire !
A Surgical Fires Primer ,
Virtually all operating room fires ignite on or in the patient , and about 10 surgical patient fires a year come to ECRI 's attention through various medical and legal communications .
These fires typically result in little damage to equipment , cause considerable injury to patients , and are a complete surprise to the staff .
One little - known source of surgical fires is methane , which can ignite during intestinal surgery , or even during colonoscopies ( when a polyp is removed and the site is cauterized ) .
Here 's an example from the same article in a section titled " Bowel Explosion " :
A methane - producing diet and improper cleansing of the bowel before surgery led to a bowel explosion .
Without first venting the bowel , the surgeon exposed the colon and proceeded to enter it using an ESU .
The hot ESU tip caused the explosive ignition of the bowel gases , which caused a 10 cm tear of the colon .
The patient was otherwise uninjured and subsequently recovered .
Not all outcomes were quite as salubrious however .
In the journal Gastroenterology ( 1979 ) Bigard , Gaucher , and Lassalle report on a " fatal colonic explosion during colonoscopic polypectomy " :
A patient is described who sustained the first reported colonic explosion during colonoscopic polypectomy .
Mannitol solution was used for bowel preparation , and the colon was completely clean .
During snare removal of a cecal polyp using high - frequency current a loud explosion occurred .
In spite of emergency surgery with transfusion of 45 units of blood , uncontrollable hemorrhage persisted from multiple bleeding points , and the patient died .
This occurrence seems to us to justify the routine use of carbon dioxide insufflation during polypectomy and the avoidance of mannitol for bowel preparation .
But if you prefer not to think about colonic explosions , you can always think about eyelid flashfires instead .

The San Francisco earthquake of 1906 was a major earthquake that struck San Francisco and the coast of northern California at 5:12 A.M. on Wednesday , April 18 , 1906 .
The most widely accepted estimate for the magnitude of the earthquake is a moment magnitude ( Mw ) of 7.8 ; however , other values have been proposed from 7.7 to as high as 8.3 .
[ 1 ]
The mainshock epicenter occurred offshore about 2 miles ( 3 km ) from the city , near Mussel Rock .
It ruptured along the San Andreas Fault both northward and southward for a total length of 296 miles ( 477 km ) . [ 2 ]
Shaking was felt from Oregon to Los Angeles , and inland as far as central Nevada .
The earthquake and resulting fire is remembered as one of the worst natural disasters in the history of the United States .
The toll from the earthquake and resulting fire represents the greatest loss of life from a natural disaster in California 's history .

When you surround the enemy Always allow them an escape route .
They must see that there is An alternative to death .
— Sun Tzu , The Art of War
Do n’t raise the pressure , lower the wall .
— Lois McMaster Bujold , Komarr
I recently happened into a conversation with a nonrationalist who had somehow wandered into a local rationalists ’ gathering .
She had just declared ( a ) her belief in souls and ( b ) that she did n’t believe in cryonics because she believed the soul would n’t stay with the frozen body .
I asked , “ But how do you know that ? ”
From the confusion that flashed on her face , it was pretty clear that this question had never occurred to her .
I do n’t say this in a bad way — she seemed like a nice person without any applied rationality training , just like most of the rest of the human species .
Most of the ensuing conversation was on items already covered on Overcoming Bias — if you ’re really curious about something , you probably can figure out a good way to test it , try to attain accurate beliefs first and then let your emotions flow from that , that sort of thing .
But the conversation reminded me of one notion I have n’t covered here yet :
“ Make sure , ” I suggested to her , “ that you visualize what the world would be like if there are no souls , and what you would do about that .
Do n’t think about all the reasons that it ca n’t be that way ; just accept it as a premise and then visualize the consequences .
So that you ’ll think , ‘ Well , if there are no souls , I can just sign up for cryonics , ’ or ‘ If there is no God , I can just go on being moral anyway , ’ rather than it being too horrifying to face .
As a matter of self - respect , you should try to believe the truth no matter how uncomfortable it is , like I said before ; but as a matter of human nature , it helps to make a belief less uncomfortable , before you try to evaluate the evidence for it . ”
The principle behind the technique is simple : as Sun Tzu advises you to do with your enemies , you must do with yourself — leave yourself a line of retreat , so that you will have less trouble retreating .
The prospect of losing your job , for example , may seem a lot more scary when you ca n’t even bear to think about it than after you have calculated exactly how long your savings will last , and checked the job market in your area , and otherwise planned out exactly what to do next .
Only then will you be ready to fairly assess the probability of keeping your job in the planned layoffs next month .
Be a true coward , and plan out your retreat in detail — visualize every step — preferably before you first come to the battlefield .
The hope is that it takes less courage to visualize an uncomfortable state of affairs as a thought experiment , than to consider how likely it is to be true .
But then after you do the former , it becomes easier to do the latter .
Remember that Bayesianism is precise — even if a scary proposition really should seem unlikely , it ’s still important to count up all the evidence , for and against , exactly fairly , to arrive at the rational quantitative probability .
Visualizing a scary belief does not mean admitting that you think , deep down , it ’s probably true .
You can visualize a scary belief on general principles of good mental housekeeping .
“ The thought you cannot think controls you more than thoughts you speak aloud ” — this happens even if the unthinkable thought is false !
The leave - a- line - of - retreat technique does require a certain minimum of self - honesty to use correctly .
For a start :
You must at least be able to admit to yourself which ideas scare you , and which ideas you are attached to .
But this is a substantially less difficult test than fairly counting the evidence for an idea that scares you .
Does it help if I say that I have occasion to use this technique myself ?
A rationalist does not reject all emotion , after all .
There are ideas which scare me , yet I still believe to be false .
There are ideas to which I know I am attached , yet I still believe to be true .
But I still plan my retreats , not because I ’m planning to retreat , but because planning my retreat in advance helps me think about the problem without attachment .
But the greater test of self - honesty is to really accept the uncomfortable proposition as a premise , and figure out how you would really deal with it .
When we ’re faced with an uncomfortable idea , our first impulse is naturally to think of all the reasons why it ca n’t possibly be so .
And so you will encounter a certain amount of psychological resistance in yourself , if you try to visualize exactly how the world would be , and what you would do about it , if My - Most - Precious - Belief were false , or My - Most - Feared - Belief were true .
Think of all the people who say that without God , morality is impossible .

If theists could visualize their real reaction to believing as a fact that God did not exist , they could realize that , no , they would n’t go around slaughtering babies .
They could realize that atheists are reacting to the nonexistence of God in pretty much the way they themselves would , if they came to believe that .
I say this , to show that it is a considerable challenge to visualize the way you really would react , to believing the opposite of a tightly held belief .
Plus it ’s always counterintuitive to realize that , yes , people do get over things .
Newly minted quadriplegics are not as sad , six months later , as they expect to be , etc .
It can be equally counterintuitive to realize that if the scary belief turned out to be true , you would come to terms with it somehow .
Quadriplegics deal , and so would you .
See also the Litany of Gendlin and the Litany of Tarski .
What is true is already so ; owning up to it does n’t make it worse .
You should n’t be afraid to just visualize a world you fear .
If that world is already actual , visualizing it wo n’t make it worse ; and if it is not actual , visualizing it will do no harm .
And remember , as you visualize , that if the scary things you ’re imagining really are true — which they may not be !— then you would , indeed , want to believe it , and you should visualize that too ; not believing would n’t help you .
How many religious people would retain their belief in God if they could accurately visualize that hypothetical world in which there was no God and they themselves have become atheists ?
Leaving a line of retreat is a powerful technique , but it ’s not easy .
Honest visualization does n’t take as much effort as admitting outright that God does n’t exist , but it does take an effort .

Stacking The Patsies of 9/11
by Chaim Kupferberg
www.globalresearch.ca 20 December 2003
The URL of this article is : http://globalresearch.ca/articles/KUP312B.html
The following are selected excerpts plus new material .
The excerpts are taken from Truth , Lies , and The Legend of 9/11 , which may be found at http://www.globalresearch.ca/articles/KUP310A.html
In perhaps the most controversial segment of his landmark article , Chaim Kupferberg argues that , in addition to the " Official " 9/11 Legend , a number of counter - legends were built in so as to generate false leads and to take the emphasis away from the most likely instigators .
Plus :
An all - new section on former CIA agent Robert Baer and Daniel Pearl .
The events of September 11 gave birth to three parallel threads - or counter - legends - pointing the way to the culpability of three possible foreign suspects , or patsies - namely , Saudi Arabia , Pakistan , and Israel .
Of the three , the Saudis were the patsies of choice for the mainstream " critics " , who were a motley assortment of neo-cons , FBI investigators , or " retired " national security types opposed to the war in Iraq .
The Pakistan / ISI thread to 9/11 flared up most noticeably in the events surrounding the death of Daniel Pearl and the alleged involvement of Omar Saeed Sheikh - events which were used , in fact , to smother the Pakistani / ISI connection to the 9/11 money trail .
As regards Israel , the most radical opponents of the War On Terror were nursed on the twin threads of an Israeli spy ring and a neo -con cabal supposedly at the helm of the Bush Administration .
It was not by accident that these three countries were chosen to play the role of second - tier patsies - for each of them contained insular cliques of operatives which had played seminal roles in the covert arms and drug trade - in cahoots with their more senior Anglo - American handlers - throughout the Reagan - Bush years .
Moreover , these countries would make useful patsies for the very reason that they were essentially outside the " established " - i.e. Euro - American - ring of nations .
In other words , if insular cliques of criminal operatives were to be ferreted out of Germany , France , or Italy , no one would think to brand these nations wholesale with the mark of Cain .
The same could not be said of Saudi Arabia , Pakistan , and Israel , whose very security - physical , political , and economic - would be staked to the publicized activities of their own respective political / criminal cliques .
Moreover , much of the political and corporate elites within these countries were integrally networked with their American counterparts - indeed , largely subservient to them - to such a degree that they would also serve as useful proxies in building their own counter - legends under Anglo - Euro - American supervision .
In the early stages of the 9/11 Legend , Saudi Arabia and Pakistan were employed as the central bases for building up a terrorist home front within the borders of Afghanistan .
As for Israel - despite its aforementioned spy ring and its supposedly allied neo-con " cabal " - its most direct and public contribution to the 9/11 Legend in fact occurred after 9/11 , with the November 2002 coordinated attack on an Israeli - owned hotel and airliner in Kenya - an attack for which Israeli investigators now marshaled evidence as proof of Osama bin Laden 's opening shot against the State of Israel ( which was more likely Israel 's " buy - in " in return for a promised attack on the Saddam Hussein regime ) .
Thus , evidence could be amassed to cast aspersions on the activities of each of these three countries , depending on the intended audience .
On another level , political elites within these countries could be assured that any aspersions would be relegated to insular " rogue " cliques .
In the case of Saudi Arabia , a few princes of the Saudi royal family were thus eliminated within days of one another in 2002 .
In the case of Pakistan , " rogue " elements within the ISI were publicly purged in the months after 9/11 .
Yet in the case of Israel , its apparent " buy - in " through the 2002 Kenya attack served to strengthen , rather than weaken , the thread connecting Israel as a possible 9/11 culprit .
If , in the context of this article , this would appear to be a short - sighted strategy by Israeli political elites , one can only surmise that these elites were blinded - or assured - by an apparent post - 9/11 geo-strategic shift in favor of Israeli interests ( i.e. an attack on Iraq ) in conjunction with a publicly affirmed surge in influence among its supposed neo -con allies .
With three alternative counter - legends in place to co-exist with the Official ( i.e. mainstream ) 9/11 Legend , the stage was thereby set to muddy the real trail leading to the events of September 11 .
With the participation of a global network of well - connected spinmeisters - both passive and active - each of the 9/11 threads could thus be nurtured through a series of carefully calibrated revelations .
Of all the 9/11 spinmeisters , one of the most effective - and therefore damaging - was Jean - Charles Brisard , co-author with Guillaume Dasquie of The Forbidden Truth .
Brisard burst on to the mainstream scene shortly after September 11 as one of the first " credible " critics of 9/11 , weaving a trail of seemingly incriminating red herrings that will , in all probability , tie up a number of otherwise industrious conspiracy researchers for decades .
In Brisard and Dasquie 's version of 9/11 , the main protectors of al - Qaida were the Saudis , who in turn were protected by greedy oil interests which sought - through the State Department - to obstruct any investigations that might unsettle their Saudi business associates .
To nail down the point , Brisard recounted his summer 2001 meeting with John O'Neill , in which a frustrated , scandal - ridden O'Neill purportedly confided to Brisard that the " answer " to the al - Qaida riddle lay in Saudi Arabia .
For good measure , Brisard had the well - timed implosion of Enron as a backdrop for his revelation , implicating this now - dead shell of a corporation in a stubborn push for an oil pipeline through Afghanistan ( though senior Enron exec - and CIA offspring - Frank Wisner , Jr. , was , as it happens , also one of the 17 elite " players " in the aforementioned " Dark Winter " exercise ) .
Through Brisard ( in addition to Pakistani Foreign Minister Niaz Naik ) , we learned that the U.S. had made plans as early as June of 2001 to invade Afghanistan by October of that year .
During that summer , as Brisard chronicled it , a number of nations - including Iran , Russia , and India - got together for a four - day conference in Berlin , where the dispute with the Taliban was broached by U.S. diplomats .
The U.S. demanded that the Taliban hand over bin Laden ( in addition to negotiating for pipeline rights ) .
Otherwise , the Americans threatened to blanket Afghanistan with " a carpet of bombs . "
Brisard 's initial theory , then , was that this threat prompted bin Laden to launch a pre-emptive attack against the very nation that was now placing him in imminent peril .
Brisard also seemed to implicate Bush , Sr. by way of his Carlyle Group interests .
But in the end , as Brisard essentially kept bin Laden in place as the sole 9/11 culprit , the aspersions cast on the Bushes , the State Department , " oil interests " , et al , would not amount to much - at least from a legal standpoint .
At most , these parties could be judged as too blinded by greed to recognize - and pre-empt - the very real threat from al - Qaida .
However you clothed Brisard 's revelations , the " official " 9/11 Legend remained in place .
Al - Qaida was still the defendant ( albeit with a new excuse ) , O'Neill was still a martyr ( albeit with a new Saudi gripe ) , and the Saudis were still suspicious ( albeit with possibly a new gripe against Brisard ) .
Brisard , incidentally , also happened to have written - for French intelligence - the first comprehensive report on the financial structure of al - Qaida , a copy of which was furnished to the Bush administration .
Thus do national security types and their 9/11 critics have a deeper understanding of the 9/11 Legend courtesy of the efforts of Jean - Charles Brisard .
Brisard 's co-author , Guillaume Dasquie , also comes by his own intelligence connections , by way of his role as editor of Intelligence Online .
It was through Dasquie 's efforts that Intelligence Online , in March 2002 , announced that it had come into possession of a 61 - page " secret " DEA report on a large Israeli spy ring of " art students " who were casing federal buildings several months before September 11 .
The " leaking " of this document , in conjunction with Carl Cameron 's December 2001 Fox News report on the spy ring , ignited an online firestorm among 9/11 critics - pointing the way , for some , to the Israelis as the main operative agents behind September 11 .
Yet , as we shall see , in the campaign to paint Israel as the main suspect , here was a case of mostly right wing sources doling out the goods for largely left wing consumption ( with the obvious exception of Justin Raimondo , a political supporter of , and former speechwriter for , Pat Buchanan ) .
Thus , while the likes of Stephen Emerson , Daniel Pipes , and John Loftus were doing the lecture circuit at Jewish Community Centers across North America , regaling this influential community with insinuations of possible Saudi and / or Iraqi involvement in 9/11 , a more covert - and subtle - plan was afoot to plant the seeds of a new Jewish neocon / Zionist conspiracy among the left wing ( i.e. the traditional foothold of the bulk of the American Jewish community ) .
This relatively recent campaign to subvert the left with visions of a Jewish neocon / Zionist conspiracy dovetailed nicely with a more longstanding covert campaign - dating back more than thirty years - to build up a small but powerful right wing contingent of Jews to wean the rest from their knee - jerk liberalism ( and thereby sap the strength and vigor of the traditional Democrat wing ) .
The species of the Jewish " neo " conservative is best represented by Irving Kristol , a self - admitted former Trotskyite who had been a member of the " left - wing " Congress of Cultural Freedom ( later exposed as a CIA front ) before making a " sudden " right turn in the late sixties , bringing along with him a few other like - minded " disillusioned " Jews from CIA - funded " leftist " groups .
The typical neo-conservative was " neo " in the sense that he would continue to hold liberal social values while espousing hard right ( i.e. pro-corporate ) economic views and a hawkish foreign policy - pretty much the course that American society has taken in the thirty - odd years since Kristol made his ideological " shift . "
Though the history is far more complex and detailed than indicated above , the crux of the point is this : in order to neutralize the influential American Jewish community on the subject of civil rights and domestic dissent ( where they historically predominated ) , it was not sufficient only to wean the Jews from the left , but to turn the left against the Jews by now slurring them as right wing , Zionist " imperialists " ( best exemplified by Richard Perle , who is actually more a product of the national security community than of the Jewish community ) .
In concert with this strategy was a plan - also dating back more than thirty years - to wean the South from the Democrats by promoting a fundamentalist Christianity that grew in counter - point to the overall loosening social values .
The typical fundamentalist Christian Republican would hold conservative social views while espousing hard right ( i.e. pro-corporate ) economic views and a hawkish foreign policy ( best exemplified by John Ashcroft , who is actually more a product of a deeply cynical political community than of the community of belief ) .
With that background in mind , we may now touch upon the national security / conservative clique which has furnished most of the information concerning Israeli perfidy and 9/11 .
For our purposes , the story begins on May 7 , 1997 , when Nora Boustany of The Washington Post first broached the existence of Mega , a suspected code name for a suspected Israeli mole within the upper echelons of the Clinton government .
As reported by Boustany , the National Security Agency had intercepted a request from a Mossad operative to view a diplomatic letter from Yasser Arafat .
When the operative was heard to ask his superior for the assistance of someone or something called Mega , he received the reply , " We do n't use Mega for this . "
The story , in fact , broke on the very day when South Korean spy Robert C. Kim was scheduled to deliver a guilty plea after a plea bargain - a similar bargain that was , in fact , dishonored in the case of convicted Israeli spy Jonathan Pollard in the mid-80's .
Kim , like Pollard , had worked in the Office of Naval Intelligence , though Pollard had worked in the counter - terrorism section .
A week before the Mega story broke - on April 30 , 1997 - Pollard had petitioned the Israeli High Court to compel the Israeli government to reveal what it knew about his case .
If a battle was brewing between Pollard supporters ( Likud / neocon elements ) and opponents ( the Bush / Baker clique / Woolsey / the national intelligence apparatus ) , the May 7 Mega leak by way of the National Security Agency seemed to head it off , publicly raising the specter of yet another Israeli mole .
And then the story ultimately went cold , with no official resolution and - most crucially - no hard details by which to flesh out this possible mole hunt .
Yet Jeffrey Steinberg of Lyndon LaRouche 's Executive Intelligence Review has attempted to draw a line between this morsel of an item and a Mega Group that was mentioned by Lisa Miller in the Wall Street Journal on May 4 , 1998 .
In Steinberg 's telling , the Mega Group is , in fact , the shadowy Mega from the Boustany article .
As Steinberg put it , the Mega Group - a select group of Jewish billionaires including Bronfman , Steinhardt , Spielberg , Tisch , and others - had come together to influence U.S. security policy toward Israel .
Yet that was a disingenous - and I dare say , dishonest - reading of the Miller article .
In other words - and this was very clear from the Miller article - their main concern was assimilation and philanthropy , not Israeli national security issues , as Steinberg had reported .
But Steinberg 's technique was all too typical - mischievously weaving two totally disconnected items so as to give the impression that he was uncovering bona fide evidence of a fully known Jewish / Israeli conspiracy .
Yet taking the thread of a burgeoning Israeli spy conspiracy further , in May 2000 , J. Michael Waller and Paul M. Rodriguez of Insight magazine ( the sister publication of the ultra - right wing Washington Times , which is in turn owned by the Moonies ) broke the story that the Israelis had possibly compromised U.S. government phone lines , giving them access to sensitive information .
Carl Cameron of Fox News followed this up on May 5 , 2000 by reporting on the investigation into the Israeli - founded company AMDOCS , describing " an alleged penetration of U.S. government phone systems . "
This thread was also taken up by Gordon Thomas , the MI5 ( British intelligence ) connected editor of the website Globe - Intel .
Thomas , in his book , Gideon 's Spies , broached the subject of the Israeli infiltration of the Clinton White House by way of the Mega mole .
He also had alleged that the Mossad had a possible role in the death of Princess Diana ; that the Mossad tapped Monica Lewinsky 's phone in order to pick up her conversations with President Clinton ; and that the Israelis stole the sophisticated PROMIS software , which eventually ended up in the possession of Osama bin Laden .
Incidentally , Gordon Thomas holds himself out as a friend and intimate confidant of Mossad insiders .
We shall return to Thomas shortly , for he - like Brisard and Dasquie - has also played a significant part in lining up new alternate 9/11 suspects ( most recently China , in his book Seeds of Fire ) .
Picking up the thread , in March 2001 - significantly , several months before September 11 - the U.S. National Counterintelligence Center sent out an advisory for federal employees to be aware that a number of young Israelis were approaching federal agents at their offices and at their residences throughout the country , passing themselves off as art students looking to sell their work - but more peculiarly , identifying themselves as Israeli art students , thereby " red-flagging " themselves for the benefit of the National Counterintelligence Center .
A few months after September 11 , Carl Cameron - in December of 2001 - once more visited the issue of Israeli penetration , this time naming a second Israeli company , Comverse Infosys , as having access to nearly all wiretaps placed by U.S. law enforcement .
As part of a four - part series for Fox News , Cameron also cited a " secret " DEA report that chronicled the actions of the aforementioned Israeli " art student " spy ring .
Soon after a transcript of Cameron 's report was uploaded on the Fox News website , it was taken offline and purged from the archives - a presumed cover - up that actually raised far more suspicions over Israeli / Jewish influence than the report itself .
Perhaps that was the intended effect - as the purpose would be to " red flag " this item for an " alternative " online audience , not for the mainstream couch potatoes who were wedded to the Official 9/11 Legend in any case .
Was Cameron simply a dedicated journalist who was muzzled by his conservative , pro-Israeli , employers at Fox ?
Or was he rather a passive disinformation asset , coyly nursing the Israeli thread when told to do so ?
On May 13 , 2002 , with government warnings of a follow - up terrorist attack seeding the media zeitgeist , Cameron red-flagged the Israelis once more , this time reporting that a rental truck with traces of TNT was pulled over near an army base in the State of Washington .
Once again , suspicious Israelis were discovered as occupants , and once again , the news suspiciously disappeared from the airwaves .
There was a curious parallel to the manner by which various Israelis tended to be " pulled over " in the Israeli /9/11 Counter - Legend as opposed to the manner by which various al - Qaida operatives tended to incriminate themselves through those fortuitous cell phone and email " intercepts " in the al - Qaida / 9/11 Legend .
On June 23 , 2002 , ABC News picked up the earlier story of five " suspicious " Israelis celebrating on the roof of their van in the wake of September 11 .
When the police had pulled them over and searched the contents of the van , sure enough , they found ... box cutters .
And just as sure enough , this story also " suspiciously " vanished without a follow - up .
It is also a curious fact that former CIA counterterror chief / ABC News consultant Vincent Cannistraro lent his own spin on that report .
As I had pointed out in The Propaganda Preparation For 9/11 , and as I will show further in this article , Cannistraro has " spun " a great deal of information on the 9/11 Legend .
While the spy ring story has been neglected by much of the mainstream media , it nevertheless remains in the background , ready to be " mainstreamed " if or when the " official " 9/11 Legend begins to show cracks ( or if the resident Israeli government proves to be troublesome ) .
As I have pointed out , much of the first - hand revelations of Israeli penetrations have come not from alternative sources , but from well - established , " credible " conservative sources highly placed within the intelligence apparatus .
While Daniel Pipes ( CFR member and former Defense Department employee ) made a disingenuous attempt at discrediting the spy ring story , the actual DEA report that was acquired by Dasquie 's Intelligence Online was confirmed as authentic on February 25 , 2002 by Will Glaspy of the DEA 's public affairs bureau .
Moreover , according to a May 5 , 2002 report in Le Monde , Cameron 's four - part Fox broadcast was shown and cleared with the CIA , FBI , and NSA before its airing .
Clearly , somebody high up wants this out in the ether .
Yet it is a curious fact that some of this information comes from sources which are traditionally known to be friendly to Israeli interests .
For instance , J. Michael Waller , who wrote the Insight piece with Paul M. Rodriguez , is a member of the right wing , pro-Israel Center For Security Policy , which , according to the Center 's own site , includes an " extraordinary number of members of the Center 's National Security Advisory Council " in the top echelons of the Bush Administration .
Waller , incidentally , also wrote an Insight piece entitled " Preparing For The Next Pearl Harbor Attack " - just a few months before 9/11 - in which he described the plan for a Homeland Security Agency , as recommended by the Hart - Rudman Commission report ( yes , they had the " homeland security " blueprint in place several months before 9/11 ) .
As for Waller 's associate , Paul M. Rodriguez - the managing editor of Insight - has had a history of printing incriminating items that do n't quite circulate yet get the point across all the same .
One particularly creepy example concerns an Insight piece that Rodriguez wrote in 1989 , reporting on a pedophile ring in the nation 's capital , linking one of its participants to Donald Gregg , a senior aide to President Bush .
Since then , Gregg has served as Ambassador to South Korea and as head of the Korea Society .
This might have something to do with the fact that the Moonies , owner of Insight , have been rumored to be a front for the South Korean CIA .
Incidentally , since President George H.W. Bush has left office , he has put in a considerable number of appearances at Moonie functions .
As for Gordon Thomas of Globe - Intel , it turns out that he has been a major contributor to the Israel / 9/11 / Counter - Legend in addition to his other contributions to Israeli legends .
Perchance he had come by this good fortune through his father - in - law , a former MI5 British intelligence operative who had introduced Thomas to so many of his intelligence contacts .
Adding his own " insider " gloss to the spy ring tale , Thomas is a source for the claim that Israel sent out spies to infiltrate al - Qaida in the U.S. , writing that Israel sent warnings about the impending attacks to the Bush administration through French and German intelligence .
In his May 21 , 2002 article for Globe - Intel , Thomas - in a Mossad " insider " scoop - revealed that Israeli Prime Minister Sharon in fact authorized a " leak " of documents showing that Bush was warned by Israel of the approaching al - Qaida threat by virtue of Israel 's comprehensive infiltration of al - Qaida cells on American soil .
In other words , Sharon wanted to prove to Bush ( and to Globe - Intel readers ? ) that his Mossad agents - art students , perhaps ?
- had learned of 9/11 over coffee with Mohammed Atta .
As Thomas put it : " Sharon 's reaction is a calculated response to growing claims that Mossad has been running spy operations in the United States ... "
A calculated response ?
Either Thomas is serving us up some fairly heavy British intelligence disinformation ( false - flagged as a Mossad scoop ) , or he 's implying that Sharon was on some pretty serious weed at the time - for insisting with documented proof that , yes , his own agents did in fact illegally spy on U.S. territory , and what 's more , did lunch with the 9/11 hijackers .
Yet given Thomas ' record of pinning likely British intelligence " hits " on the Mossad - Princess Diana , Robert Maxwell , etc. - I 'm willing to bet that the former is the case .
In that context , it is perhaps curious that Thomas - like Brisard - has chosen to use John O'Neill , this time in order to weave a counter - legend of Israel at the center of a global criminal network .
In his latest book on Robert Maxwell , Thomas alleges that Maxwell was an Israeli " super-spy " who , in the words of John O'Neill , " was at the heart of the global criminal network . "
Thomas writes that O'Neill 's contribution to the book was " enormous " - which is indeed interesting , as the book covers much of the corruption wrought through the British / C.I.A. / BCCI networks , though Thomas employs O'Neill to " spin " the global corruption instead as the joint work of Israel ( via Maxwell ) and Russian criminal gangs .
Thomas ' fellow Globe - Intel editors are also an interesting bunch .
One fellow editor , the British Sunday Express correspondent Yvonne Ridley , had made her own entry into the 9/11 Legend as a high - profile captive of the Taliban .
Ridley , who claimed that the British government were inciting the Taliban to kill her by implying that she was their covert agent , was fortunately released by her captors on October 8 , 2001 , just one day after the invasion of Afghanistan had begun .
Given such a grave accusation , one wonders why she would subsequently take up office space with an MI5 " groupie " ( Thomas ) - unless , of course , she had now established her bona fides as a " credible " source of disinformation . [ [
New material added on December 19 , 2003 : Apparently , Yvonne Ridley 's episode among the Taliban did help to establish her credibility - at least among the Muslim masses of the Middle East .
In the aftermath of her well - publicized captivity , Ridley embarked on a course of study in the Koran , culminating in her conversion to Islam - and , most significantly , her subsequent posting to Qatar as an anti-Western correspondent for al - Jazeera .
Last month , she was abruptly dismissed from al - Jazeera for reasons that remain unclear .
Sandwiched between her role as a famous Taliban captive and her subsequent incarnation as a fundamentalist employee of al - Jazeera , Ridley was a key source - in collaboration with Gordon Thomas - for the contention that Mossad had provided forewarnings specifically by reason of its infiltration of al - Qaida cells .
Perhaps only time will tell - but Ridley is looking more and more credible as a source of disinformation as her legend proceeds down its bizarre , twisted path . ] ]
Rounding out the Globe - Intel editorial group is terrorism expert Martin Dillon , who wrote a well - circulated tribute to his friend John O'Neill , substantiating the official legend that O'Neill was " frustrated " by State Department efforts to block his pursuit of bin Laden .
In reading the detailed revelations of Brisard , Dasquie , and Thomas , one enters the proverbial hall of mirrors , where subtle truths reflect back upon themselves as half - lies , and perceptions splinter amid a cascade of contradictions .
Such is the world of the disinformation operative .
As a first defense , all you need to know is when you 're in it , not particularly what 's in it .
Still , a more curious case is that of John Loftus , a long - standing Catholic friend of the Jews who had served in the Justice Department 's Nazi- hunting unit , where he had discovered - through CIA archives - the depth of the CIA program to smuggle in Nazi war criminals through " ratlines " to the United States after the Second World War .
In his book , The Secret War Against The Jews , Loftus documented in painful detail the anti-Semitic history of the powerful Anglo - American " Establishment " , the Wasp clique which , through their oil and industrial holdings , has had a stranglehold on American foreign - and military - policy for close to a century .
Loftus , clearly intimate with a great many operatives in the intelligence community - whom he refers to as the " old spies " - had posited that the Jews were repeatedly used as pawns and scapegoats in the grand match played out by these men on the geopolitical chessboard .
Loftus ' reading of this Establishment - which encompasses the likes of the Rockefellers , the Dulles brothers , the Bakers , and the Bushes - dovetails nicely with the writings of scholars like Peter Dale Scott ( whose personal integrity and research skills are beyond question ) .
In other words , Loftus knows who is the real power behind the throne .
Yet in the light of 9/11 , it appears that Loftus has put on his blinders , going out on the lecture circuit and offering the warmed - over neo-conservative view that September 11 was essentially the work of wicked Saudis intent on destabilizing the West by priming the terror pumps with their oil wealth .
More ominously , Loftus was offering his audiences a neocon bird 's eye view into the near future ( courtesy of his military contacts out of MacDill Air Force Base in Tampa ) - a future in which a liberated Iraq would be turned over to a compliant Hashemite monarchy ( now resident in Jordan ) , and then on to Saudi Arabia , where the Saudis would be booted and replaced by compliant Hashemite monarchs in a new Hashemite Arabia .
And as for the West Bank Palestinians - well , they would be handed over to the custody of the compliant Jordanian Hashemites .
As for Loftus , he was making his own contribution by heading up a class action lawsuit on behalf of the families of 9/11 against those ruthless Saudi financiers .
And , as an aside , he was assuring his mostly Jewish audience that George W. Bush is , at root , a decent fellow .
In short , Loftus was propagandizing his audience toward a highly selective reading of 9/11 .
Gone were the ominous shadows of BCCI and Iran - Contra , casting their pall over the credibility of those powerful politicians feeding us their take on a new world order .
More than anyone ( this writer included ) , Loftus should have been able to detect a high - level disinformation campaign to set up " the Jews " and " the Zionists " as the main evil conspirators behind 9/11 .
Yet ironically , here was Loftus casting his lot in with those very neo-conservatives who will one day serve as the showcase exhibits for what is sure to be the latest entry in an updated blood libel .
From the Crucifixion , to the Rothschilds , and on to the Twin Towers , the Jews were being set up once more to play their historical role as punch toys to smokescreen a powerful oligarchy .
The set - up was on two fronts - foreign and domestic .
On the domestic front , the neo-conservatives headed by Dick Cheney and Richard Perle - widely dubbed by the mainstream press as the " hawks " - were being marketed as the true ideological powers behind the Bush administration .
Their patchwork of inter-connected think tanks - Center for Security Policy , Project for A New American Century ( PNAC ) , Center For Strategic and International Studies ( CSIS ) , American Enterprise Institute ( AEI ) - were deeply involved in sending out various " experts " to explain the War On Terrorism in a mainstream forum , thereby setting out the parameters of debate ( in addition to the parameters of the perceived threat ) .
But did these neo-conservatives constitute a mere " rogue element " - an insular " cabal " of pro-Zionist conservatives holding a largely naive President Bush in their sway ( as Lyndon LaRouche and the folks at Executive Intelligence Review would have us believe ) ?
Or rather , were they just a group " cut-out " for other , more powerful interests - in other words , the public face that would skew the ultimate responsibility , letting the true masterminds off the hook while the " cut- out " proxies would double as potential patsies ?
It had certainly been the case during the Clinton era , when Richard Mellon Scaife 's organization took center stage as the most vociferous entity in attacking the integrity of President Clinton .
Thus , while Scaife 's cronies made sure that all eyes were focused on Whitewater , Lewinsky , Foster , et al , the mainstream focus was kept far from the infinitely more nefarious , and damaging , scandal that was known by the four - letter word Mena , the crucial transit point in Arkansas which , under Governor Clinton , had served to sustain the arms / drug dealing operations that were fed through Iran - Contra and laundered through BCCI .
Thus , with Whitewater as the Scaife - funded public face of the Starr inquiry into Clinton , those Clinton associates who could really provide the dirt on the Clinton / Mena connection were being " purged " in plain sight - through various prosecutions , accidents , murders , or well - timed heart attacks ( in the case of Jim MacDougall ) .
Meanwhile , all eyes were directed to the curious stain on the blue dress .
Once Clinton was safely out of office ( and a leash presumably was no longer needed ) , Scaife disappeared from public view as suddenly as he entered it - to be replaced by Dick Cheney , Richard Perle , and their coalition of fundamentalist Christian / Jewish Zionists .
Picking up on the above theme , in the excerpt below , Kupferberg analyzes the contributions of Vincent Cannistraro and Robert Baer to the neo -con / Israel counter - legend .
Cannistraro and Baer , two " former " CIA officials who have since served as frequent consultants and " critics " in the mainstream media , have elsewhere inserted themselves personally into the 9/11 Legend - Baer , in his self - professed capacity as Daniel Pearl 's " research " partner ; and Cannistraro , through his past revelation of an Iraq / Oklahoma City connection .
Richard Sale [ of UPI ] would later go on to cite both Baer and Cannistraro ( on record here ) for their views of the neo-con clique in Washington - the one that was widely marketed as pushing for war in Iraq .
Sale 's February 11 , 2003 UPI article quoted Cannistraro thusly : " ' Clearly Iraq is not the last phase of what the administration tends to do in the Middle East . '
According to the neo-con theory , [ Cannistraro ] said , ' Syria is to be the next target . '
He concurred with another view in Washington that holds that part of the Bush plan was to ' wean the Jewish lobby away from the Democrats ' and that 'it 's already pretty much happened . '
" As for Baer 's own assessment of the neo-cons : " Former CIA official Robert Baer , when asked about the master plan for the Middle East , told UPI last fall that Bush 's team allegedly wanted ' to divide up Syria , give part of Iraq to Turkey , overthrow the monarchy in Saudi Arabia , [ and ] restore the Hashemites to the Hijaz , ' a very center of Saudi Arabian culture .
' The underlying motivation ' for this , Baer said , 'is Israel ... ' "
Recall that previously I had argued that both the " Jewish " neo-cons and the state of Israel were to be set up as second tier proxy / patsies for the events of 9/11 .
And while 9/11 was not at issue in the above - referenced article , it is not unreasonable to conjecture that the article was meant to be read on two levels .
On the " mainstream " level , Baer and Cannistraro were pushing the view that the approaching war in Iraq was a project of an insular group of neo-cons acting on behalf of the state of Israel , allied with the Jewish lobby .
No indication here of a 9/11 conspiracy .
Elsewhere , Cannistraro and Baer had repeatedly gone on record as adhering to the main contours of the Official 9/11 Legend - that al - Qaida was the key perpetrator of the 9/11 attacks , perhaps with a bit of help from Saudi elements .
On the " alternative " , more " conspiracy - minded " level , Cannistraro and Baer were reinforcing suspicions that this powerful neo -con clique was perhaps responsible for plots more sinister than a push toward Iraq .
In this respect , perhaps it was not just a matter of happenstance that Yosri Fouda had chosen to pair Cannistraro 's commentary about the cheering Israelis on the white van with Lyndon LaRouche 's well - circulated theory of a " rogue " , self - contained , " cabal " of largely Jewish neo-cons behind 9/11 .
Again , something for everyone .
Cannistraro and Baer - who both have gone on record as criticizing the neo-cons and their spurious evidentiary claims of an Iraqi connection to 9/11 - also share a common journalistic connection with Seymour Hersh , the investigative journalist who has played his own part in discrediting the neo-cons and the state of Israel .
Hersh , in fact , wrote the foreword to Baer 's See No Evil - a recommended book for those wedded to the complacency theory of 9/11 , to be read in conjunction with Brisard and Dasquie 's The Forbidden Truth and Coleen Rowley 's congressional testimony .
Hersh , a classic " access " reporter who first made his reputation in an expose of the Mai Lai Massacre in Vietnam , was playing the neo -con angle for all it was worth .
In the Spring of 2003 , in the midst of global hysteria over Iraq , Hersh raised allegations that arch - neo - con Richard Perle had peddled his influence with the Defense Policy Board for financial gain , thereby forcing Perle to resign his position as Chairman .
Thereafter , Hersh revealed - in a May 12 , 2003 article in The New Yorker - the intellectual influence behind the scheming , insular neo-cons : the late Leo Strauss , a professor at the University of Chicago .
In Hersh 's telling , the Bush Administration was in the grip of the influential Office of Special Plans at the Pentagon , dominated by the neo-cons , who were now branded as " Straussians . "
In nailing down his point , Hersh quoted Cannistraro , who claimed to have intimate knowledge of this Straussian clique :
" The group 's members , Cannistraro said , ' reinforce each other because they 're the only friends they have , and they all work together .
This has been going on since the nineteen - eighties , but they 've never been able to coalesce as they have now .
September 11th gave them the opportunity , and now they 're in heaven . "
Again , Cannistraro here can be - and probably was intended to be - read on two levels .
On the " mainstream " level , the charge consists of nothing more sinister than that of an " opportunistic " post - 9/11 grab at the foreign policy agenda .
Yet on the " alternative " level , Cannistraro was providing a powerful ready - made quote for use by the " 9/11 conspiracy crowd . "
Indeed , the Lyndon LaRouche apparatus at Executive Intelligence Review was once more playing counterpoint to Cannistraro 's melody - for , whether coincidental or otherwise , LaRouche 's unveiling of Leo Strauss as the intellectual godfather of the neo-cons ( whom he dubbed as the Children of Satan ) had in fact just preceded Hersh 's more " mainstream " take on the neo-con Strauss crowd .
And now that Cannistraro had furnished his " smoking gun " quote , the LaRouchites at Executive Intelligence Review were subsequently quoting Cannistraro in order to burnish their contention that 9/11 was likely the work of the insular neo-con " Perle / Wolfowitz cabal " .
Meanwhile , both Baer and Cannistraro were lending their growing reputations as critics of the War on Iraq in order to bolster the legitimacy of the case for the War on Terror .
At least that was the inevitable effect .
Like Brisard and Dasquie , Baer and Cannistraro seemed to be informational Zeligs , showing up all over the media map , structuring perceptions in a very definite direction , offering legends and counter - legends intended for various audiences , both mainstream and alternative .
On the broadest level , Cannistraro and , especially , Baer were advocating the complacency theory behind 9/11 , posing as mainstream " critics " of their " former " CIA employers while at the same time keeping the general contours of the Official 9/11 Legend in place .
In lockstep with the neo-cons , they were also raising suspicions of possible Saudi perfidy , primarily for the Saudi role as financial and political enablers of al - Qaida .
A sub-set of the Saudi thread also connected with the Cheney / Halliburton / Enron / Big Oil theory behind 9/11 .
This theory had a dual use - one , for an opportunistic complacency theory behind 9/11 , and the other for an opportunistic complicity theory .
In any case , the ailing Cheney had already been pre-packaged as a self - contained , potentially " rogueish " , power behind the Bush throne , while the dead husk of Enron was marketed as the self - contained , rogue manifestation of " Big Oil " .
If " Big Oil " and Cheney seemed to be taking a large dose of bad publicity in the first several months following 9/11 and the War in Afghanistan , the storyline - and the villain role - gradually shifted over to the Perle / Wolfowitz neo-cons in the year - long lead - up to the War In Iraq .
And here , too , a dual use was made of the neo-cons - one , to raise suspicions of premeditated complicity , and alternatively , to raise the allegation of post - facto opportunism .
As for Iraq , Cannistraro seemed to be playing it both ways - casting aspersions on the Iraqis for the Oklahoma bombing , yet giving them a clean bill of health with regard to the alleged evidence linking them to 9/11 .
And , as stated before , Cannistraro and Baer 's criticisms of the War In Iraq only served to bolster the credibility of their opinions concerning the War On Terror - and , by extension , to lend credibility to the Official 9/11 Legend .
If , during the whole War In Iraq episode , the Bush and Blair regimes ' sputtering efforts at propaganda and disinformation were being repeatedly exposed as amateurish and ill - considered , then surely - the reasoning goes - any attempts at information management concerning 9/11 would likewise have been exposed as fraudulent .
Yet it is a curious fact that , in the aftermath of the War In Iraq - at a time when more Americans do not trust CNN - the structural pivots of the Official 9/11 Legend appear more sturdy and unassailable than ever before .
For surely if all those British and American intelligence operatives were heaping scorn on the " evidence " linking Iraq to 9/11 , then why not repose our trust in them when they tell us exactly who was behind September 11 ?
End of excerpts .
[ The following is new material added December 18 , 2003 ] :
Who , exactly , is Robert Baer ?
In the months after 9/11 , Baer first emerged on the public radar scope as a " former " CIA official involved in counter - terrorism .
After publishing his widely acclaimed book , See No Evil , Baer established himself as the mainstream media 's " go - to " guy when making the case for pre-9/11 complacency and opportunistic blindness .
But his contributions to our understanding of 9/11 did n't end there .
In addition to focusing attention on Saudi Arabia and the dominating influence of the neo-conservatives on foreign policy , Baer has personally insinuated himself into the Daniel Pearl story .
On September 30 , 2002 , Richard Sale of UPI reported :
" Wall Street Journal reporter Daniel Pearl was investigating the man who allegedly planned the Sept. 11 airplane hijackings and attacks on New York and Washington when he was kidnapped and murdered in Pakistan , according to two Central Intelligence Agency officials ...
...' I was working with Pearl , ' said [ Bob ]
Baer , who had written a book about his time as a CIA official and has acted as a consultant and source for numerous media outlets .
' We had a joint project .
[ Khalid Shaikh ]
Mohammed was the story he was working on , not Richard Reid [ a.k.a. the shoe bomber ] . ' "
Was Baer being truthful , or rather was he disseminating a blatant slice of disinformation ?
You be the judge .
In Baer 's latest widely acclaimed book , Sleeping With The Devil - published after the September 30 , 2002 UPI article - Baer blatantly contradicts himself , as evidenced on p.199 :
" I have no way of knowing whether Pearl went to Karachi and asked about Khalid Sheikh Mohammed .
The Wall Street Journal says no , that he was working on the shoe - bomber case . "
No way of knowing ?
What about that " joint project " with Pearl ?
According to Baer 's UPI version , back in 1997 , Baer learned of efforts by the government of Qatar to shield Khalid Shaikh Mohammed from FBI apprehension .
Khalid , at the time , was wanted for his alleged role in the aborted 1995 Bojinka plot .
Yet when none of his former colleagues in counter - terrorism would follow up on Baer 's leads , according to UPI , " Baer said he was frustrated and called Pearl ... " telling him that " he had a hot story on terrorism ... "
However , in Baer 's book version , it was Pearl who had first initiated contact after hearing of Baer 's leads from other sources :
" In 1998 , when I was living in France , I got a call from a young Wall Street Journal reporter named Danny Pearl . "
As for that " joint project " alluded to in the UPI article , here is how Baer sums up the course of their interaction in his book :
" We met in Geneva ... I told him about KSM [ Khalid ] and Qatar .
He listened , took notes , and promised to follow up on it one day .
We saw each other from time to time in Washington .
He would bring up the Khalid Sheikh Mohammed story , but neither of us had anything new to add . "
And here is the version that Baer offered to UPI , describing the aftermath of his very first telephone contact with Pearl :
" Baer said to his annoyance , Pearl did not begin to work on the story .
Nothing was done until the day of the Sept. 11 attacks when Pearl called to talk to Baer . "
Thus are we faced with two alternate realities .
In the quantum reality offered in Baer 's book , Daniel Pearl is the dogged investigator who tracks down Baer for his story on Khalid , following it up on subsequent meetings with further queries of Baer , though neither has " anything new to add . "
Yet in the quantum reality offered to UPI , it is Baer who tracks down Pearl , and who subsequently becomes annoyed with Pearl 's presumed disinterest in Baer 's revelation - that is , until September 11 , 2001 .
In Baer 's book , three days after September 11 , Pearl called Baer after sending him an email the day before .
What follows is Baer 's account of their very last conversation :
" I reminded him about our talks on KSM [ Khalid ] and Qatar .
' Worth thinking about , ' [ Pearl ] replied . "
Thus , in Baer 's book version , that fateful phone call signals the end of their interaction , consequently leaving Baer with " no way of knowing " whether or not Pearl had picked up the ball and hustled on over to Karachi to flesh out Baer 's initial lead on Khalid .
Meanwhile , over in the UPI parallel universe , that post - 9/11 phone call marks the beginning of their " joint project " :
" Baer said he gave Pearl all the old information he had and new information he had since obtained -- for example , that there are files on [ Khalid ] in the Qatari Embassy in London .
Baer said he and Pearl then ' began to work together ' -- in other words , Pearl would get info and check it out with Baer and Baer would feed Pearl what he was getting .
It was ' a joint project , ' said Baer .
Baer was giving direction , but Pearl 's contacts were not confined to Baer . "
Simply based on the foregoing , one might reasonably conclude that Baer is either a quantum leaper or a bona fide fibber .
But even if Baer 's credibility is undermined by all this , what 's the big deal ?
Is n't Baer , after all , just a retired CIA guy far out of the loop , trolling the media circuit as an " independent " critic ?
Or is he , rather , a key operative among an insular ( though by no means rogue ) counter - terror clique involved in the formation and presentation of the Official 9/11 Legend and its off - shoots ?
At the time of Baer 's UPI revelation , Khalid Shaikh Mohammed had only been known to the public for less than four months - dating from the time in June 2002 when he was first introduced as the " official " 9/11 mastermind .
Prior to that date , scarcely any details at all were offered to the public concerning Khalid - other than a generic " wanted " listing for his alleged role in the 1995 Bojinka plot .
And , perhaps , a very brief , general reference to Khalid as an expert in the hijacking of planes in Baer 's first book .
Yet if we are to believe Baer 's post - June 2002 account , Khalid was the object of intense concern to both Baer and Pearl - neither of whom had ever gone on record as evincing any substantive interest in Khalid at any time prior to Baer 's September 30 UPI account .
More curiously , by June 2002 , with Khalid now making the headlines as the brains behind 9/11 - and coming more than four months after Pearl 's own widely publicized kidnapping - Baer was continuing to do the media circuit , promoting his earlier book along with his version of the 9/11 Complacency
Theory , yet still no word on his purported " joint project " with Pearl on the newly unveiled 9/11 mastermind .
Rather , Baer waited until three weeks after the well - publicized apprehension of Khalid 's alleged co-plotter , Ramzi Binalshibh , and only then broached the news of his " joint project " with Pearl , tying this in with the latest bombshell that Khalid had also likely killed Daniel Pearl .
Curious timing , that .
So who , exactly , is Robert Baer - and , more to the point , why should this question matter ?
Baer - along with the likes of Vincent Cannistraro and Milt Bearden - is among the select few who have managed to " dirty " their hands with past CIA involvement with the Afghani mujahedin .
Terror , drugs , arms - smuggling , and the Byzantine workings of Mideast geopolitics - Baer has personally seen it all .
In Baer 's chronicle of the past CIA / Bin Laden / Muslim Brotherhood nexus , there is really nothing particularly sinister in the fact that the CIA had originally fostered and funded a network that would later go on to unveil itself as America 's foremost enemy .
Baer characterizes it all as blowback .
But perhaps
Baer manages to provide us a crucial - though probably unintended - insight as to how we may characterize all that purported blowback .
In Baer 's oft - repeated account of Khalid Shaikh Mohammed 's escape from Qatar , he reveals that Khalid had managed to slip away with another member of his al - Qaida cell - a man by the name of Shawqui Islambuli , whose brother happens to be the man who had assassinated Egyptian President Anwar Sadat on behalf of the Muslim Brotherhood .
It is indeed an artful pairing - for these two men serve , on a symbolic level , as the operative bookends of the Official 9/11 Legend .
At the tail end , of course , stands Khalid as the 9/11 mastermind .
At the front end stands the Egyptian fundamentalist clique whose 1981 move against Sadat would coincide with its recruitment by Baer 's CIA colleagues into the Afghan effort .
One member of that Egyptian clique , Sheik Omar Abdel - Rahman , would go on to become a CIA asset , and , after his acquittal in relation to the Sadat killing , would then be cleared to enter the United States in 1990 by way of a CIA - approved visa .
Setting up shop in a Brooklyn mosque , the men in Abdel - Rahman 's circle - Sayyid Nosair , Ramzi Yousef , etc. - would go on to be implicated in the assassination of Rabbi Meir Kahane , the plot to destroy New York City landmarks , and , most importantly , the 1993 bombing of the World Trade Center .
If the early shoots of what would eventually evolve into " al - Qaida " look suspiciously like an Egyptian - CIA hybrid , that is probably due to the fact that - from the vantage point of 1993 - a suspicious number of Egyptian CIA assets ( and / or FBI informants ) were popping up all over the map .
For one , a former Egyptian military officer ( and FBI informant ) named Emad Salem had managed to " infiltrate " former CIA asset Abdel - Rahman 's New York circle , giving his FBI handlers the " heads - up " on the plot to take down the Twin Towers in ' 93 .
Meanwhile , another former Egyptian military officer ( and subsequent FBI informant ) by the name of Ali Mohamed would train Abdel - Rahman 's men in the arts of bomb - making , formation of operative cells , and all the sophisticated military tactics Ali had gleaned from his three - year stint as a U.S. sergeant with the Special Forces at Fort Bragg .
Ali had first entered the United States on a CIA - sponsored visa in 1981 , in order to serve his first four - month stint with the Green Berets at Fort Bragg - incidentally , the same year in which Ali had reportedly joined the ranks of the Muslim Brotherhood implicated in the Sadat assassination .
After being honorably discharged from service at Fort Bragg in 1989 , Ali's resume would include the training of Abdel - Rahman 's men , an ongoing stint as an FBI informant ( carrying on even after the 1993 WTC bombing ) , the authorship of al - Qaida 's training manuals , along with the training of bin Laden 's personal security detail and the refinement of al - Qaida 's military tactics .
Publicly outed for the first time in 1995 as the trainer of the 1993 New York landmarks suspects , Ali would remain free to carry on his busy globe - trotting itinerary for three more years before being lured out of his cozy Sacramento digs in the aftermath of the 1998 Embassy bombings in Tanzania and Kenya .
Duly subpoenaed and then " secretly " indicted , Ali would go on to plead guilty , implicate his fellow conspirators , and then forever fade from public view ( and scrutiny ) .
With just the foregoing facts in mind , it does n't take a forensic expert to connect the dots and draw certain conclusions as to the likely paternity of what would later become known as " al - Qaida . "
From the vantage point of 1993 , where were those suspicious dots connecting this close - knit terrorist network to Saddam Hussein ?
Or the Pakistani ISI ?
Or the Saudis ?
Or the Israelis ?
After 1995 , however , there would be new dots to connect up , with new links subsequently forming in Afghanistan , Pakistan , and Saudi Arabia , along with new al - Qaida cells springing up in London , Hamburg , and across the globe - and , in lockstep with the times , new investigative cliques forming across the US , UK , and the EU .
Yet from that crucial , embryonic time period of 1981 - 1993 , we can venture a reasonable guess as to which entity was most involved in coddling , handling , clearing , and funding this insular grouping of Egyptian - born radicals , from out of which would grow the full blossom of al - Qaida .
And so we must ask what the likes of Bob Baer , Vincent Cannistraro , and Milt Bearden were truly up to in those years .
But that , perhaps , is a tale for another day .

" I 'm trying to assemble the best advice to two new candidates who are approaching election , " Mr Aldrin said .
" There will be one person preparing to take over the government in January to implement things that are of great concern . "
The space programme was nowhere near the top of the list , he said .
" We want to get in there and talk to them because it 's so important .
Here is the thing , and I can't believe I need to say this : simply showing something on a screen is n't an implicit recommendation that you should go out and do that thing .
I enjoy The Shield , for instance , but never once have I been tempted to bring my own brand of hard - nosed justice to the streets .
Most people can watch something and see that in real life , it may be a bad idea .
It may sound obvious , but no one told Mothers Against Drunk Driving .
Each year nearly 13,500 people die in drunk driving crashes and another half a million are injured in alcohol - related traffic crashes .
This is why MADD is extremely disappointed by the decision of the manufacturers of the game Grand Theft Auto IV to include a game module where players can drive drunk .
Drunk driving is not a game and it is not a joke .
Drunk driving is a choice , a violent crime and it is also 100 percent preventable .
MADD is calling on the Entertainment Software Ratings Board to reclassify Grand Theft Auto IV as an Adults
Only game , a step up from the current rating of Mature and for the manufacturer to consider a stop in distribution – if not out of responsibility to society then out of respect for the millions of victims / survivors of drunk driving .
I 'm not sure where to start .
Yes , in Grand Theft Auto IV you can drink .
Yes , you can then get into a car .
However , the game will warn you that this is probably a good time to simply get in a cab .
Not only that , but if you do decide to get into a car , you 'll find it nearly impossible to drive ; you 're asking for an accident .
If anything , I 'd say the game does a pretty good job of proving that getting behind the wheel after a few drinks is a bad , bad idea .
So the game allows you to do something , shows you clearly the negative consequences , and it's a bad , bad thing that only adults should get to see .
I have a problem with that , as I think teenagers are just the people who need to see what can happen when you drive drunk .
Clearly , MADD is not thinking of the children .
The number of dollar millionaires around the world increased by 6 % last year , defying the impact of the credit crunch , with the fastest growth in the emerging economies of India , China and Brazil .
There are now 10.1 million people worth more than $ 1 m ( £ 508,000 ) excluding the value of their main homes , according to the latest World Wealth Report from Merrill Lynch and the consultancy Capgemini .
Developed economies in Europe and North America continued to create millionaires , though the rate of growth slowed significantly from 2006 as the credit crunch and inflationary pressures caused the world economy to falter .
But developing markets , driven by thriving exports of commodities and booming domestic markets , proved to be far more resilient .
The number of dollar millionaires in India 's red - hot economy grew by 22.7 % , China followed with growth of 20.3 % and Brazil came next with 19.1 % .
As an illustration of the growing buying power of emerging markets and the shifting world order , the report cites General Dynamics , the US engineering group , which sold more Gulfstream jets to overseas buyers than in North America for the first time last year .
Ferrari also experienced unprecedented sales to emerging markets .
The luxury carmakers ' sales in the Asia - Pacific region increased by 47.2 % last year , while sales to the Middle East grew by 32.3 % .
That compared with single - digit growth in Ferrari 's traditional markets of the US and Germany .
The combined wealth of the millionaires , defined by Merrill Lynch as " high net - worth individuals " , grew by 9.4 % to $ 40.7tr , demonstrating once again the truism that the wealthy get wealthier .
The average assets held by high net - worth individuals now exceeds $ 4 m .
The number of super - rich - defined as people with more than $ 30 m - increased by 8.8 % to 103,320 .
The report also details the different tastes of the wealthy in different parts of the world .
In Europe , they spend 22 % of their spare cash on art ; 17 % on " luxury collectibles " , including cars , jets and boats ; 12 % on luxury travel ; and 6 % on sport , including buying teams and racehorses .
In Asia , their most popular items are jewellery , gems and watches , accounting for 19 % of their spare money , followed by " luxury consumables " such as designer clothes .
" This year 's report found that the number of high net - worth individuals , and the amount of wealth they control , continued to increase in 2007 , " said Nick Tucker , executive director at Merrill Lynch 's global private client group .
" We expect the environment to remain challenging over the next six to 12 months but long term the trends remain intact . "
In Britain , there are 494,500 dollar millionaires , the number advancing by 2.1 % last year , far slower than the European average of 3.7 % but still faster than France and Germany .
The UK remains home to about 5 % of the world 's dollar millionaires , ranking it fourth in the world , though that could change if threats to quit Britain made by " non-doms " angered by changes to the tax laws are carried out .
Tucker said much of the high wealth in Britain is now entrepreneurial , in contrast with 10 - 15 years ago when it was largely inherited .
However , he said the number of wealthy individuals in Britain could slip into reverse in 2008 if the economic conditions persist .
The growth in new millionaires in 2007 had slowed significantly from 8.1 % in 2006 .
According to Merrill Lynch forecasts , there will be more millionaires in China than in Britain by the end of next year .
Ireland was one of the few countries last year in which the number of dollar millionaires fell - by 4 % to 20,000 - reflecting a slide in the Dublin stockmarket , inflationary pressures and a downturn in the property market .
" I 'm not predicting that will happen in the UK yet but it is quite possible , " Tucker said .
" If the property market and the stockmarket conspired against it then the UK could possibly see the same thing happen . "
He said that if conditions in the second half mirrored the first then the United States , which has suffered a collapse in its property market , could also see a decline in the number of millionaires this year .
The number of millionaires in North America expanded by 4.2 % last year , down from 9.2 % in 2006 .
Tucker said there had been a divergence between developed and emerging markets in the second half of last year .
" Mature economies have had significantly slower growth compared with other regions and compared with last year . "
The acceleration in emerging markets was supported by strong GDP growth and soaring local stockmarkets .
The total market capitalisation of the Bombay exchange expanded by 118 % in 2007 ; China 's stockmarket grew by 291 % and the Bovespa in São Paulo expanded by 93 % , as foreign investors flooded into Brazil .
In Britain , by comparison , the market capitalisation of the London stockmarket contracted by 1.5 % during 2007 .
The number of dollar millionaires in the Middle East grew by 15.6 % last year .
The high - net - worth population in eastern Europe grew by 14.3 % , compared with growth of 3 % in western Europe , though the relative numbers still show a wide disparity in wealth .
There are 1.8 million in western Europe and only 235,000 in the less mature eastern markets .
Historically , investments in art , private planes , luxury cars and other high - priced collectibles have been more resistant to economic downturns because the super - rich buyers tend to be less impacted by recessions than average earners .
The bad news for millionaires is that their dollars are not stretching as far they used to .
According to Merrill Lynch , they face personal inflation rates of 6.2 % .
Although the global economy is looking fragile in the short term , the report forecasts continued growth in the medium term .
It suggests that the global wealth of high net - worth individuals will grow to $ 59.1tn by 2012 , advancing at a rate of 7.7 % a year .
The Ministry of Justice said some people may be circumventing the law Drawings and computer - generated images of child sex abuse would be made illegal under proposals announced by Justice Minister Maria Eagle .
Owners of such images would face up to three years in prison under the plans .
The Obscene Publications
Act makes it illegal to sell or distribute photos of child abuse but it is legal to own drawings and computer - generated images .
Ms Eagle said the proposed move would " help close a loophole that we believe paedophiles are using " .
The plans are part of the government 's response to a public consultation exercise carried out last year .
If we do not address the issues these images raise now it is likely their availability will continue to grow
Ministry of Justice
The government has acknowledged that paedophiles may be circumventing the law by using computer technology to manipulate real photographs or videos of abuse into drawings or cartoons .
A Ministry of Justice spokeswoman said the authorities had " noticed an increase in the existing availability of these images on the internet " .
She said : " If we do not address the issues these images raise now it is likely their availability will continue to grow .
" They are often advertised as a legitimate depiction of child sexual abuse . "
' Unacceptable ' images
The spokeswoman said police and child welfare groups had expressed concern at the " growing increase in availability of these depictions of child sexual abuse " .
Ms Eagle said the plans were " not about criminalising art or pornographic cartoons more generally , but about targeting obscene , and often very realistic , images of child sexual abuse which have no place in our society " .
Shaun Kelly , safeguarding manager for children 's charity NCH , said the proposals were a step in the right direction .
He said : " This is a welcome announcement which makes a clear statement that drawings or computer - generated images of child abuse are as unacceptable as a photograph .
" It adds to the range of measures to help ensure the safeguarding of children and young people . "
The Child Exploitation and Online Protection Centre ( Ceop ) works to track down paedophiles and identify children via online images .
It welcomed the move .
" We are positive that there is a need to clarify this position in law and believe that people actively seeking out , creating or sharing images of young children being abused represent a potentially significant risk .
We are therefore committed to further engage with the Ministry Of Justice to ensure the most effective measures possible are implemented , " said Ceop chief executive Jim Gamble .

What are these ?
Straight Acting GOP state Rep. Richard Curtis resigned last week in the wake of a sex scandal involving a male prostitute , ladies ' lingerie , and an alleged extortion plot .
Dan Savage heads to Spokane to recreate Curtis 's big gay adventure .
THE HOTEL
The lobby , my God , the lobby .
" Everlasting Love , " an early disco hit , is booming over the sound system .
The walls and floors of the L - shaped room are covered in beige and tan marble .
Faux - Victorian chandeliers dangle from the ceiling .
Huge bronze elephant heads with gleaming brass tusks top every column , stained - glass panels with giraffe motifs enclose the bar area , and overstuffed chairs and banquettes are upholstered in black - and - tan leopard - print velvet .
It looks like all the furniture has been upholstered with Siegfried and Roy 's old thongs .
There 's some trouble getting the room I requested — 968 .
When I made the reservation yesterday , I was told that my room request was no problem .
But today , the room is " off - line , " the receptionist informs me .
A pair of stained - glass tigers stares down at me from the wall behind her .
The receptionist is blond and perky , and she does n't seem to suspect anything .
She sets about trying to get the room back online for me and invites me to have a drink in the hotel bar — where the waiter is wearing a zebra- striped apron — while she works on the problem .
When I return to the reception desk 15 minutes later , a noticeably cooler receptionist informs me that the room I wanted will be off - line for the " duration of my stay , " which is only one night .
So I do n't get " the " room — the room where Washington state representative Richard Curtis ( R - La Center ) , 48 , had anal sex — twice — with Cody Castagna , 26 , " a part - time waiter and porn model , " as Castagna was tagged by the Spokesman - Review .
But I do manage to get a room on the ninth floor — room 957 — and the evacuation map on the back of the door shows that 957 is a mirror image of 968 .
It 's a small room ( but pricey , at $ 300 a night ) with oil paintings of rhinos and elephants and cheetahs ; a flat - screen TV on the wall opposite the bed ; a large , beveled mirror over the bed serving as a headboard ; and a large leopard - print pillow .
I 'm in Spokane to retrace Curtis 's footsteps on that fateful night .
But before I can party like a Washington state rep , I need to gather a few things : lingerie , a sack , some rope , a toy stethoscope , condoms , and a few items I can not identify .
After the last humiliating detail about Representative Richard Curtis and his adventures with an admitted male prostitute and alleged extortionist dribbled out early last week — that would be the plastic sack police found in Curtis ' room containing rope , a stethoscope , and other items the police " could not immediately identify " — I thought to myself , " Well , at least Washington State 's GOP gay sex scandal had a dignified setting . "
Curtis was n't busted , for instance , in an airport bathroom or a public park .
The reported location of Curtis 's undoing , the Davenport Hotel in downtown Spokane , is a grand hotel in the style of Seattle 's Fairmont Olympic Hotel .
The Davenport opened its doors in 1914 , enjoyed several successful decades , went into decline in the 1960s ( along with the rest of downtown Spokane ) , and closed its doors in 1985 .
After several close calls with the wrecking ball , Walt Worthy , a Spokane developer , bought the Davenport in 2000 for $ 6.5 million , poured $ 36 million into the hotel , and reopened it to rave reviews in 2002 .
" With dedication , taste , and respect for history , [ Worthy ] has restored the Davenport to its former grandeur , " reads the essay about the Davenport at HistoryLink.org .
But — I figured this out later — it turns out that Curtis was n't staying at the grand old Davenport Hotel .
He was staying across the street at the brand - new Davenport Tower , a sister hotel that opened in January of this year .
As for Worthy 's lauded sense of taste , well , it appears to have been fatally struck by an automobile as it attempted to cross the street .
The Davenport Tower , for no discernable reason whatsoever , is done up in an African safari theme — hence the elephants , leopards , tigers , giraffes , hippos , and rhinos crowded into the lobby , the restaurant ( The Safari Room ) , and the guest rooms .
Not even the elevators are spared .
So there was nothing dignified about Curtis 's spectacular pratfall from grace — not his attire , not his behavior , not even the setting .
" Man , " I think looking at the mirror behind the bed , " this would n't look out of place on Aurora Avenue . "
THE SCENE OF THE CRIME
Until he resigned from the state legislature on October 31 , Richard Curtis represented La Center , Washington , a small town you 've never heard of somewhere between Vancouver , Washington , and the state capital of Olympia .
A beefy Republican with a bushy gray moustache , Curtis is a social conservative .
In this context , " social conservative " means , of course , " antigay . "
Curtis voted against adding gays and lesbians to the state 's antidiscrimination statutes ; he voted against domestic partnerships for gay couples ; he voted against gay marriage .
When Curtis spoke to the Columbian , the daily paper in Vancouver , Washington , before all the details were out , he echoed the words of Larry Craig .
" I am not gay , " Curtis told a reporter from the Columbian on Monday , October 29 .
" I have not had sex with a guy . "
But the morning of Friday , October 26 , in room 968 of the Davenport Tower , Curtis , who was in Spokane attending a retreat with other state GOP lawmakers at the nearby Red Lion Hotel , told to two detectives from the Spokane Police Department that earlier that morning he had engaged in consensual anal sex with a much younger man whom he met in an adult bookstore .
Curtis had called the police after the man , whose name he never knew , took off with his wallet while Curtis was asleep .
The man later called demanding $ 1,000 — and threatened to out Curtis as gay if he did n't pay up .
" [ Curtis ] only wanted his wallet back and wanted to keep the incident as low - key as possible , " Detective Tim Madsen wrote in his report .
" If the incident became public , it could cost him his marriage and career . "
THE MALL
Terry , my boyfriend of 12 years , is from Spokane and pretty happy about it .
In fact , the further he is from Spokane the happier he gets .
But he agreed to join me in his hometown on a Saturday night because , like me , he assumed we would be staying at the storied Davenport Hotel .
He gets a rude shock when he arrives a few hours after I do .
But I do n't have time to worry about that — I have supplies to get .
Two blocks from the hotel is River Park Square , Spokane 's downtown shopping mall : Nordstrom , Restoration Hardware , Abercrombie & Fitch , Macy's .
Built to revitalize the downtown area , River Park Square seems to have removed what little foot traffic there was in downtown Spokane from the streets .
I pass a dozen or more shuttered storefronts on my way to the mall .
To River Park Square 's credit , I quickly find a toy stethoscope , lingerie , some condoms , and a tasteful card for a friend whose mother recently passed away — and every item comes in a plastic sack , so that 's taken care of , too .
But , alas , there 's no rope for sale at the mall .
THE DIRTY BOOKSTORE
Sometime after the first day of the GOP retreat wrapped up on the evening of Thursday , October 25 , Curtis drove to Hollywood Erotic Boutique in Spokane Valley , a neighboring nothing of a town .
It was n't Curtis 's first visit to Hollywood Erotic Boutique .
According to an employee quoted in the Spokesman - Review , Curtis had visited the adult bookstore at least three times in the past month .
The employees had even given him a nickname : " the crossdresser . "
A young man named Cody Castagna was also at the bookstore that night .
Castagna , according to the police report , approached Curtis and asked him for a cigarette sometime around one in the morning .
After determining that Curtis was n't a cop , Castagna asked him if he " wanted to get together . "
Curtis told Castagna that he would not pay for sex " because that would be prostitution " — well , that 's what Curtis told the police he told Castagna .
But Curtis did offer Castagna $ 100 " to help him out for gas . "
Curtis then gave Castagna his cell - phone number and left Hollywood Erotic Boutique for a casino near Spokane 's airport .
Hollywood Erotic Boutique is housed in a crumbling , two - story building marooned in the endless sprawl of parking lots that characterize Spokane proper and Spokane Valley .
There 's a discount tire dealership on one side and a plasma center on the other .
When my boyfriend and I walk in , the very first thing we notice is a picture of Castagna on the wall .
" This person is banned from the premises ! " reads the hand - written note tacked above a screen grab from an interview Castagna did on MSNBC .
" No prostitution allowed ! "
When I ask about Curtis and Castagna , the friendly , heavy - set woman behind the counter tells us she just started .
The only thing she knows about Curtis is that he was living a lie .
" And that 's just sad , " she says .
" You have to be who you are ! "
She tells us about her son — now her daughter , who lives in California .
She had the courage to come out as transgendered .
" And she 's six - foot - three ! " she exclaims .
" And you 're telling me Richard Curtis was too scared to come out as a gay man ? "
It was at Hollywood Erotic Boutique that Curtis was spotted wearing " long red women 's stockings and black sequined lingerie , " according to an employee quoted in the Spokesman - Review .
Before meeting Castagna , employees observed Curtis receiving oral sex from " a man who appeared to be around 40 and [ walked ] with a cane . "
This may have been captured on the store 's security video from the night Curtis met Castagna , a video that is now in the hands of the police and could ultimately be released to the public .
Despite being described as an " adult bookstore " in every newspaper account of the Curtis scandal , there are n't any books for sale at Hollywood Erotic Boutique .
There are hundreds of old DVDs , dildos and butt plugs , cheap blowup dolls with " O " mouths , and exactly two sad pieces of lingerie .
A handful of men come and go while we 're standing at the counter talking with the clerk ; clearly the scandal has n't been bad for business .
Hollywood Erotic Boutique 's regular customers eye us suspiciously .
Our demeanors are n't furtive enough , I guess .
We 're obviously together , Terry is dressed a little too stylishly , we did n't arrive in a pickup truck — we 're interlopers , openly gay men , and we 're ruining the vibe .
No one is interested in the merchandise for sale at Hollywood Erotic Boutique .
Every customer who comes through the doors while we 're in the shop pays $ 10 and heads immediately up the stairs to the " porn theaters " — really five small video viewing booths .
For $ 10 you can stay upstairs for up to six hours .
According to the reviews posted at CrusingForSex.com , the Hollywood Erotic Boutique is a " very nice , very safe " place to meet men .
" This is a great spot to get a load or dump one , " reads one of the longer reviews .
" It 's mostly straight men and they usually do n't care who sucks their cock — they just want it sucked ...
Also , I have met several guys who would get a room and have a fuckfest . "
Curtis had a room ; Castagna was game for a fuckfest .
Before we leave the bookstore , I ask Terry if he wants to slip upstairs and give me a little head .
You know , in the spirit of following in Curtis 's footsteps .
" Are you fucking kidding me ? " he says .
" Yes , " I lie .
" Of course .
I mean , come on . "
THE CASINO
On our way to the casino , we swing by the General Store , a Spokane institution .
Picture a Chubby & Tubby ( RIP ) on steroids and with guns .
For serious kinksters , a hardware store is a sex - toy shop — well , Seattle kinksters would love Spokane 's General Store .
Christ , the rope selection alone !
We select a nice pack of soft , blue - and - white nylon rope and toss it in the backseat of our rental car .
Out of all the pleasures Curtis pursued during his adventures in Spokane , the hour or two he spent at the Northern Quest Casino in the middle of the night mystifies me most .
Who does n't enjoy blowjobs and buttfucking ?
As for crossdressing , well , it 's not my thing , but I can see how it could turn some men on .
Rope and stethoscopes ?
I feel compelled to admit that I 've got a few bondage and medical toys at home .
Perhaps this is a good time to get this on the record : I do n't think Richard Curtis did anything wrong that night in Spokane .
I 'm all for men having sex with other men .
I certainly do n't think it should be illegal for men to wear women 's underwear , or for men to get blowjobs from other men at dirty bookstores , canes or no canes , lingerie or no lingerie , nor should it be illegal for men to pay male porn stars for their time and attention .
I also do n't think it should be illegal for men to marry each other .
What makes this case a scandal — besides the alleged extortion attempt , of course — is that Curtis led people to believe he thought all those things should be illegal .
Just as Idaho's Larry Craig would certainly have voted against a bill decriminalizing toilet sex had one come up for a vote in the U.S. Senate , Curtis would have voted against a bill that decriminalized public sex and crossdressing and porn - star renting had it come up for a vote in the Washington State House of Representatives .
I , of course , would vote to legalize every supposedly " criminal " thing that Curtis did in Spokane — and ever so much more .
But casinos ?
I 'd vote them out of existence if I had the chance .
Casinos are grim .
We 're not three steps into the massive Northern Quest Casino before I spot her .
There 's one of her in every casino in the country : a little old lady hooked up to an oxygen tank , feeding coins into a slot machine , a drink in one hand and a cigarette in the other .
( Cigarettes and oxygen tanks ?
When , I wonder , is one of these little old ladies going to explode ? )
I 'm beginning to think casinos plant these women by the doors so that writers like me can dash in , get the one squalid detail that sums up the whole scene , and dash back out , without disturbing any of the real gamblers .
Unlike downtown Spokane — deserted despite a boom in condo development — Northern Quest is packed .
The parking lot stretches for acres in all directions , and we had to hunt for a spot .
Once inside , we have to fight to find an open table .
Poker is all the rage these days , and the crowded poker tables have pride of place in the middle of Northern Quest 's gambling floor .
Terry and I finally find an empty blackjack table — shoved into a corner , by the bathrooms .
We sit down , buy $ 100 worth of chips .
Fifteen minutes later , our $ 100 gone , we slip into the bar for a drink .
The casino is working its magic — we are , despite our best efforts , having a blast .
Curtis was at the Northern Quest Casino at 3:00 a.m. when Castagna called his cell .
Castagna asked if Curtis still wanted to get together .
The men arranged to meet back at the Davenport Tower .
When both men arrived , Curtis again told Castagna he was n't paying him for sex , just giving him $ 100 to " help him out . "
Once they got up to Curtis 's room , Curtis gave Castagna the money .
After Curtis — still wearing women 's lingerie — got fucked , he asked if he could fuck Castagna without wearing a condom .
Castagna told Curtis that unprotected anal sex was unsafe — well , that 's what Castagna told the police he told Curtis .
When Curtis asked him how much " help " it would take for Castagna to consent to unprotected sex , the men agreed on a price : $ 1,000 .
Castagna , according to the police report , was crying when he related these details .
THE GAY BAR
Richard Curtis spent an awful lot of time in his car the night he met Cody Castagna .
It 's 12.5 miles from the Davenport Tower to the Hollywood Erotic Boutique , 20 miles from the Hollywood Erotic to Northern Quest Casino , and another 8.5 miles back to the Davenport Tower .
Spokane 's only gay bar — Dempsey 's Brass Rail — is just a block from the Davenport Tower .
Terry and I walk over to the bar after returning from the casino .
If Curtis was after a little gay sex , why did n't he just go to Dempsey's ?
We arrive around midnight , hoping to catch one of Dempsey 's tragic drag shows before putting on our own tragic show in front of that mirrored headboard back in our hotel room .
Sitting on a pool table at the back of the room , my eagle - eyed boyfriend spots some familiar - looking facial hair — it's Castagna , in a red T - shirt , tucking a dollar bill into the bra of a lip - synching drag queen .
Castagna is a star in Spokane 's gay demimonde .
He 's blowing kisses , accepting hugs , and chatting with friends .
I get close enough to eavesdrop and hear Castagna retell the story of that night .
He can relate the story now , it seems , without weeping .
He 's laughing .
For some reason , I 'm nervous about introducing myself .
Castagna looks rougher in person than he did on MSNBC , like the kind of guy who might take a swing at someone who pissed him off in a bar .
He 's a small guy , gone to seed a bit , certainly not in the shape he was when he was making porn ( Damon Blows America # 3 ) .
But he 's charismatic in that slightly crazed way the kings of small - town gay bars typically are .
When I finally work up the nerve to introduce myself , Castagna tells me he can't talk right now — but he tells me he 'll come and find me before he takes off .
I ask him one quick question : So is Richard Curtis gay or what ?
I 'm trying to be funny .
Castagna looks at me like I 'm crazy .
" Richard Curtis is a freak , " he says .
" A big , gay freak . "
We do n't see Castagna again .
THE SEX
Tracing Richard Curtis 's footsteps through the Spokane area was easy .
Now comes the hard part .
Bondage is practically vanilla these days , but I 've never played with a stethoscope .
I listen to my boyfriend 's heartbeat for a minute , then roll him over and listen to his buttbeat .
And there we give up on playing doctor .
I break out a few items I can not immediately identify .
Terry says no dice .
Now I 'm feeling pretty silly in the red stockings I bought at Nordstrom early in the day , which — did I mention this ?
—I 've been wearing under my jeans most of the night .
The boyfriend implores me to take them off , take it all off .
It turns out there 's a limit to how much fun you can have following in someone else 's footsteps .
You can enjoy entertainments that are n't your own — playing blackjack , lurking in adult bookstores , chatting up small - town porn stars — but it 's nearly impossible for a couple to enjoy kinks that are n't their own .
( And , yes , we have kinks of our own — plenty . )
We turn on the television .
Sitting up in bed , Terry leaning into me , I start to feel something unexpected for Curtis : pity .
No , not pity .
Sympathy .
I hopped on an airplane this morning intending to run around an easily mocked city so that I could mock the latest GOP elected official exposed as a hypocrite .
And why not ?
It has been tremendously gratifying to be a gay person in this country over the last 18 months .
After the horrors of 2004 — when gays and lesbians were attacked on daily basis by Karl Rove and George W. Bush — it has been thrilling to watch a party united , it seems , only by its loathing of gay people , weather the storms of Ted Haggard , Bob Allen , Larry Craig , and now , Richard Curtis .
Some people credit the Republicans losing control of Congress in 2006 to the Haggard scandal .
I do n't know if that 's true .
But GOP sex scandals have unnerved and alienated the Republican base and shredded the party 's claim to moral superiority .
GOP no longer stands for Grand Old Party .
It 's Gross Old Perverts now .
But I find myself feeling bad for Curtis .
What a sad and solitary figure .
He could n't risk staying at the same hotel with the rest of the GOP colleagues , lest they spot him coming and going with young thugs .
So he slunk off to the soulless Davenport Tower alone , before slipping into the Hollywood Erotic Boutique alone , before heading to the Northern Quest Casino alone , before heading back to his hotel to have sex with a man whose name he did n't know — a man who thought he was a freak .
I do n't think Curtis is a freak — not on account of his kinks , anyway .
Curtis is a very kinky girl — but guess what ?
I am , too .
( After writing Savage Love for 16 years , I 'm convinced that abnormal is the norm , and that we 're all kinksters and freaks to greater or lesser extents . )
I would like to go into greater detail about my own kinks to balance the detail I 'm giving on Curtis 's , but 12 years ago when I met my boyfriend I promised to keep his sex life private .
But I can say this :
Thinking back on all the sexual adventures I 've had with my boyfriend over the years , I realize how close they 've brought us , how central they are to our bond , to our sense of well - being and satisfaction , to our love for each other .
Then I think of Richard Curtis hiding his kinks , lying to his wife , sneaking around Spokane , realizing his fantasies with the likes of Cody Castagna , and I 'm even more grateful for what Terry and I have , for what we 're able to do and be for each other .
How sad for Richard Curtis that he 's never had someone with whom he could truly share himself — lingerie , stethoscopes , rope , items that can not be identified , his full name , and all .
THE FLOWER POT
Unable to sleep , I decide to take a stroll to the Washington Street Bridge , which is n't too far from our hotel .
There 's a point in the police report where the Curtis scandal jumps through the looking glass .
At 20 minutes to noon on October 26 , Curtis is being interviewed in his room by the detectives .
The police are trying to talk Curtis into allowing them to collect physical evidence — dirty sheets , a used condom containing Castagna 's semen , a DNA sample from Curtis .
Curtis is reluctant .
He does n't want to prosecute the case .
He wants to keep this quiet .
" I told Curtis that the toothpaste was already out of the tube , " Detective Tim Madsen 's report states .
" Curtis told me he was just trying ' to put the cap back on the tube . ' "
Suddenly Curtis 's cell phone rings .
" Curtis tipped the phone so I could hear , " writes Madsen .
" I heard a male voice telling Curtis to leave [ the money ] in the last flower pot on the west side [ of ] Washington Street Bridge at the far north end .
Curtis asked the male how he would get his billfold back .
The male told Curtis that he would drop it off at the front desk of the hotel lobby after receiving the money . "
Castagna tells Curtis he wants to pick the money up in 25 minutes .
The police tell Curtis to stall — they need time to get surveillance personnel " to the specific flower pot on the Washington Street Bridge . "
Curtis stalls long enough for the police to get into position .
The police videotape Curtis slipping an envelope full of money into the flower pot and a man — not Castagna — picking up the envelope a few minutes later .
The whole thing reads like something out of a bad spy novel .
The flowerpot is an ugly , concrete box with some tall ornamental grass growing out it .
The Red Lion Hotel — the hotel where Washington 's GOP legislators were meeting , the place where Curtis was supposed to be staying — looms over the bridge .
I take a picture .
When he dropped off that envelope Curtis was probably wishing he'd stayed there , and stayed in , that night .
THE STRAIGHT DOPE
Sitting up in bed , I think of an e-mail I received shortly after the Curtis scandal broke .
A friend , a sex researcher , read an item I posted about Curtis on Slog , The Stranger 's blog .
I titled my post " XXX - Gay , " a reference to the adult bookstore and the porn films Curtis purchased for Castagna to watch while the men had sex .
My friend was writing to say it was possible that Curtis was telling the truth when he said he was n't gay .
I scoffed when I read my friend 's e-mail .
Curtis was recycling Larry " I'm Not Gay " Craig 's talking points , for crying out loud .
That 's pretty damn gay .
Curtis had been fucked in his ass by a dude .
It does n't get any gayer than that .
Does it ?
By the time we arrived in Spokane , of course , no one believed Curtis was anything other than gay .
From Fox News to the Seattle Gay News , the headlines read : " GOP Lawmaker Resigns Over Gay Sex Scandal . "
The Seattle Times , like the woman working at Hollywood Erotic Boutique , argued that Curtis ' real offense was being a closeted gay man .
The Seattle Times quoted a psychologist who said , " People are more upset about covering something up , living a lie , than being gay . "
The gays , myself included , were only too delighted to claim Curtis for our team — look , another GOP hypocrite !
The homophobes were delighted to let us have him .
In the Spokesman - Review , unfunny " humor " columnist Doug Clark composed a song in Curtis 's honor : " Well , he says that he 's not gay / He just dresses that way , " go the lyrics .
Only thing is , I do n't know any gay people who dress that way .
Crossdressing for sexual thrills , not for laughs or attention , is an almost entirely heterosexual phenomenon .
Cruisy " adult bookstores " are primarily patronized by straight and straight - identified men , according to sex researchers and the reviews on sites like CruisingForSex.com .
And not only did Curtis not act like any gay man I know , he did n't act much like a homophobe in the Washington State legislature .
" While Representative Curtis had an anti-gay voting record , " Washington state senator Ed Murray tells me on the phone , " he was never an ideologue . "
Murray served in the Washington State House of Representatives with Curtis .
Curtis sat on the transportation committee , which Murray chaired .
" He did n't seem driven by antigay stuff , " recalls Murray .
" He was n't one of the jerks .
He was n't one of the members so obsessed about the gay issue that you started to wonder why . "
Openly gay Washington State Representive Jamie Pedersen describes Curtis as " decent and kind " in an e-mail .
He was one of two
Republicans who , after the [ domestic partnership ] vote , came across the floor to shake my hand and congratulate me , " Pedersen recalls .
" Mostly , the whole situation makes me sad , " Pedersen adds .
" For his family , for him , and for a world that makes people feel like they can't be who they are . "
So who is Richard Curtis exactly ?
Sitting in bed at the Davenport , rope and stethoscope and items that can not be identified strewn about me , I entertain the possibility that a married man with two kids and a taste for cock could be bisexual .
But not gay ?
P'shaw .
I send my sex researcher friend an e-mail asking for more info .
She forwards my e-mail to two experts .
The next morning I check my e-mail .
" When I first read about the Curtis affair , I assumed that Curtis 's principal sexual attraction was to men , that his marriage was essentially one of convenience , " writes Anne A. Lawrence , M.D. , Ph.D. , a Seattle physician and psychotherapist who specializes in gender identity issues .
" [ I interpreted ] that his statement about ' not being gay ' simply meant that he did n't identify as gay , even though he was a man who had sex with men . "
But as more information came in about Curtis , Lawrence arrived at a conclusion opposite to the one everyone else was arriving at .
The crossdressing , the rope , and , yes , even the anal sex — it all pointed to Curtis 's heterosexuality .
" The information that has come out about Curtis allegedly wearing women 's lingerie while engaging in receptive anal intercourse suggests the alternative hypothesis that Curtis 's principal sexual attraction is to women but that he is also sexually aroused by the idea of being a woman himself , " writes Lawrence .
Curtis is so into heterosexual sex , according to this theory , that he wants to experience it from both sides .
" Hypothetically , when being penetrated anally by a man , he might imagine himself as a woman being penetrated vaginally by a man .
This hypothesis would also be consistent with his statement that he is ' not gay . ' "
Wait — what ?
" A small percentage of men who are principally sexually attracted to women — perhaps as many as 2 – 3 percent — are also sexually attracted to the idea of being women themselves .
Canadian psychologist and sex researcher Ray Blanchard coined the term ' autogynephilia ' ( literally , ' love of oneself as a woman ' ) to describe this phenomenon . "
Autogynephilia most commonly manifests itself in erotic crossdressing — which is practically unheard of among gay men .
" Roughly 30 percent of male heterosexual crossdressers report some sexual experience with men , so Curtis would not be unusual if he were , in fact , a heterosexual crossdresser who engaged in sex with men when crossdressed . "
Shortly after the e-mail from Lawrence , another arrives from Ray Blanchard , Head of Clinical Sexology Services at the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health in Toronto and Professor of Psychiatry at the University of Toronto .
Blanchard , again , gave autogynephilia its name .
He did n't want to comment directly on Curtis but was willing to discuss autogynephilia .
" There is a class of heterosexual men called autogynephiles , who are sexually aroused by the thought or image of themselves as women , " Blanchard confirms .
" They may act out this fantasy in various ways .
One common way is to dress up as women and seek sex with men .
It is not rare that they employ pornographic movie theaters for this purpose , although that strategy usually limits them to wearing brassieres or panties beneath their male clothes . "
Which is precisely what Curtis did .
" The exciting aspect of the men they have sex with is the symbolic value of the male partner , which enhances their fantasies of being women , " Blanchard continues .
" Autogynephiles are not interested in men's bodies , they rarely or never have sex with men when they are not crossdressed , and they are being truthful when they state that they are not gay .
In their normal lives , they are unremarkably masculine and they often have wives or girlfriends . "
But Curtis did n't seek penetration only ; he got a blowjob , he fucked Castagna — how does that jibe with his desire to be a woman ?
" Some autogynephiles will allow or even seek to be fellated or to perform anal penetration on a partner as part of the interaction , " says Blanchard .
" A penis is , after all , the sexual organ that they have , and if they want to achieve orgasm as part of the encounter , that is what they need to have stimulated , one way or another . "
Curtis 's heterosexuality — if he is heterosexual — does n't excuse his antigay voting record , of course .
If anything , his willingness to vote against gay people while indulging in inarguably gay sex acts — whatever was going on in his head — is less defensible in light of his potential autogynephilia .
Even if Curtis 's attraction to men was a kink , a means by which he was able to indulge his fantasies about being a woman himself , having sex with men should have sensitized him to the issues faced by men who are capable of loving other men , not just using them .
But it casts Curtis 's actions , and his early statements , in a different light .
It certainly explains the cross - dressing , which is out of character for a gay man .
It also might explain why Curtis did n't go to the nearby gay bar , opting instead for a far - off adult bookstore patronized by straight and " straight " guys .
Yes , Curtis is a victim of the very homophobia that his votes worked to sustain , but he was not , as Murray says , one of the jerks .
Sitting in bed on the ninth floor of the Davenport Tower , my boyfriend sleeping beside me , my anger with Curtis — just Curtis , not Craig or Allen or Haggard — softens somewhat .
He 's already lost so much — his job , his dignity , potentially his marriage , the respect of his children .
Maybe we should let him have his heterosexuality .
THE MORNING AFTER
" Sure , there are hypocrites everywhere — it 's awful ! "
We 've stopped in the Safari Room for a quick meal before heading to the airport .
When I ask our impossibly cute , dark - haired waitress about Richard Curtis , she says she does n't know all that much about it .
But she knows he was doing one thing at the hotel and another thing in the legislature .
" It 's like Jodie Foster , " she goes on , smoothing her zebra-striped apron .
" She 's like this big Hollywood liberal and she wants to take our guns and there she is in her new movie shooting guns !
Another hypocrite , you know ? "
" Yeah , " my boyfriend offers , pushing his eggs around on his plate .
" And think of all the actors who have played serial killers , thieves , and cheaters but disapprove of actual murder , robbery , and adultery . "
" Yeah , " the waitress says , nodding vigorously .
" Can I get you guys anything else ? "
No , we say , we have to head to the airport .
" We 'll see you , then , " she says , smiling .
" I hope you enjoyed your stay in Spokane . "

Shirley Preiss was born in Kentucky in 1910 - a full 10 years before American women gained the right to vote .
She first voted in a presidential election in 1932 , for FDR .
She 's voted in every presidential election since , but that 's all about to change due to Arizona 's draconian voter ID law .
As Art Levine reported , Shirley effectively lost her right to vote when she moved to Arizona :
After living in Arizona for two years , she was eagerly looking forward to casting her ballot in the February primary for the first major woman candidate for President , Hillary Clinton .
But lacking a birth certificate or even elementary school records to prove she 's a native - born American citizen , the state of Arizona 's bureaucrats determined that this former school - teacher who taught generations of Americans should n't be allowed to vote .
The state 's voter ID law , passed in 2004 , requires voters to show ID at the polling place and to provide proof of citizenship in order to register .
But birth certificates were n't issued in 1910 in Shirley 's birthplace of Clinton , KY , and her elementary school no longer exists .
Shirley appeared on the local news Monday night in Phoenix to tell her story :
She 's far from the only victim of this law .
The Arizona Advocacy Network reports that nearly 40,000 voter registration forms have been rejected due to inadequate proof of citizenship .
And it 's getting to be a national problem .
The Supreme Court gave Indiana the green light last month on its restrictive voter ID law , and other states have already or are in the process of passing similar laws .
Everywhere such laws are enacted , the voting rights of thousands of Americans - especially among the poor , elderly , and minorities - are put at risk .
Fortunately many other states have fended off voter ID laws , and I 'm proud that People For the American Way 's Democracy Campaign played a role in many of those fights .
Nothing short of a concerted effort by the progressive movement over the coming years will succeed in safeguarding the right to vote .

It is more than a decade since Clare Short wrote the extraordinary letter that some have characterised as ' the spark ' that set off Robert Mugabe .
Zimbabwe 's President was pressing Britain to fulfil a commitment to pay for land redistribution from white farmers to poor black people , which he regarded as a pillar of the deal that brought an end to Ian Smith 's unilateral declaration of Rhodesian independence and the birth of a free nation in 1980 .
Taking back the land was a key platform of the liberation war and , Mugabe said , the time had come for London to honour its commitment .
Short , in the letter to Zimbabwe 's Agriculture and Land Minister , Kumbirai Kangai , in late 1997 , repudiated the claim .
' I should make it clear that we do not accept that Britain has a special responsibility to meet the costs of land purchase in Zimbabwe .
We are a new government from diverse backgrounds without links to former colonial interests .
My own origins are Irish and , as you know , we were colonised , not colonisers , ' she wrote .
Short , then International Development Secretary , said that Britain would help pay for long - term redistribution only as part of an agreed poverty alleviation programme , but added that it would be ' impossible ' to support rapid land acquisition because of the damage it would cause to agriculture .
Given how things have turned out , that might seem a reasonable position .
But Short was in essence saying that the past was done with , because Britain was no longer an imperial power and that Zimbabwe 's liberation war was history .
Her letter laid bare a fundamental misunderstanding of Mugabe and the nature of the regime he leads , a mistake that others - including Zimbabwe 's whites and a rising black opposition - were to repeat as they struggled to prise him from office and that has , arguably , helped him cling to power .
Britain did have a special responsibility , not only as the former coloniser but also because it had failed to act against Smith 's illegal regime - making necessary a liberation war that cost tens of thousands of lives , most of them black - on the grounds that it could not move against its ' kith and kin ' in Rhodesia , in Harold Wilson 's phrase .
It was those kith and kin who made the same mistake as Short in thinking the past was history .
When the farm invasions began eight years ago , it would have taken a particularly hard heart not to be moved by the sight of people forced from their homes at machete point , sometimes losing everything but their lives , desperately fearful for the safety of their children .
But looking around those farms as the white families fled , it was also apparent that independence had not done much for the daily lives of their workers .
Often they still lived in rows of cramped , bare accommodation , sometimes all too reminiscent of prison cells , built in colonial days .
Liberation had not changed the fundamental link between being white and rich and being black and poor .
Zimbabwe 's whites were not only complacent ; they also misjudged how Mugabe saw their place and the unwritten pact that allowed them to stay on .
In the cities they kept their houses and their pools and their servants .
Life went on as before , but without the war .
The white farmers had it even better .
With crop prices soaring , they bought boats on Lake Kariba and built airstrips on their farms for newly acquired planes .
Not much of that trickled down to the poor , and not many of the farmers reflected on the essence of the liberation war and its cry not only for freedom but also for land .
Instead Zimbabwe 's whites reached an implicit compact with Zanu - PF ; they could go on as before , so long as they kept out of politics and did not criticise publicly .
That is the way it stayed for 20 years , but then quite a number of whites - some of them farmers - made a misjudgment .
They thought they had the same rights as everyone else .
It began with the visible and extensive white opposition to Mugabe in a constitutional referendum in 2000 , which he was shocked to lose .
Mugabe went on television to concede defeat .
Emboldened whites stuck their heads above the political parapet , imagined that the old man could be driven from power and threw their support behind the fledgling Movement for Democratic Change under Morgan Tsvangirai at the parliamentary elections a few months later .
White people accounted for only a small proportion of the party , but they were highly visible and had clout in part because they were the ones with the money and the cars .
They could be seen delivering party propaganda and running its offices .
White farmers appeared on stage with Tsvangirai , handing over fat cheques to party coffers .
The MDC and its white activists regarded all that as everyday politics in a normal society ; Mugabe and the Zanu - PF old guard saw an attempt to refight the liberation war by other means .
Their fears were not entirely unfounded .
A man called ' Monty ' Montgomery was heading the MDC 's campaign in the Hurungwe and Kariba regions in the 2000 election .
His family lineage in Zimbabwe went back to the 1890s .
His parents were teachers in Bulawayo , at a school once attended by Hendrik Verwoerd , the architect of South Africa 's apartheid .
Montgomery was conscripted into the Rhodesian police and rose to become an officer in the notorious special branch responsible for the interrogation of political prisoners and ' terrorists ' - men like Mugabe .
By the time I met him , Montgomery was running an agricultural supply business that had fallen on hard times .
He had not taken much interest in democracy until his pocket was hit , but talking to him , and to other older whites , there was a sense that this was payback time , an opportunity to ' get ' Mugabe .
When 5,000 black MDC delegates elected the party 's executive in January 2000 , three out of the top four were whites .
The head of the party 's campaign in Mashonaland West , Duke du Coudray , explained it this way : ' There 's only one reason we whites are so visible .
The mass of this party is black , but the black bourgeoisie is afraid to take a public stand .
They are intimidated away from public support .
They are pushing us to the fore , saying we support you , but we can't do it in public . '
What the whites did not understand was that they could not do it either .
They might have had a legal right , but the history was too recent and they soon found themselves exploited by Mugabe as targets and scapegoats .
Far from bringing him down , they had helped to strengthen him .
Tsvangirai welcomed whites for sound reasons , but it proved to be a misjudgment to allow them such a public role while maintaining an equivocal policy on land redistribution that fed Mugabe 's claim that the MDC would give the farms back to their former owners .
The opposition leader made other political misjudgments that Mugabe exploited .
Tsvangirai was paralysed by indecision after Zanu - PF stole the 2002 election and failed to mobilise the mass of MDC supporters in the crucial days following the vote , when many were ready to take to the streets .
The opposition had again failed to appreciate the measure of Mugabe , imagining that , if he lost the election , he would simply step aside - and so it had no Plan B .
Tsvangirai also failed to appreciate how well Mugabe would exploit his liberation credentials in the rest of southern Africa .
He portrayed the MDC as a neo -colonial conspiracy in which blacks were a front for unreconstructed Rhodesians .
When the farm seizures began , the region 's leaders threw their weight behind Mugabe , accusing his detractors of ignoring history .
Joachim Chissano , then President of Mozambique , defended Mugabe by saying that there was a tendency to ' put a blanket ' over the history of the independence struggles in Africa .
He condemned those who would portray ' former heroes of the freedom struggle ' as ' anti- democratic and even dictators ' .
A couple of years later , as Mugabe bludgeoned and murdered his way to a rigged election victory , Chissano said : ' There 's nothing the world has to teach Robert Mugabe about the rule of law . '
Britain did n't help by wading in with loud denunciations .
Peter Hain , then Africa minister , called Mugabe 's government ' uncivilised ' .
Hain might have given more thought to how other African leaders would view a minister of a former colonial power , who was also the product of an apartheid - era whites - only school in Pretoria , describing one of their number that way .
Thabo Mbeki had not long before become South Africa 's President .
He views politics and much else besides through a racial prism in a way that Nelson Mandela does not .
Rainbow nation man had given way to Zebra man .
The highly visible white involvement in the MDC made Mbeki twitchy .
The region 's leaders decided to put him in charge of dealing with the Zimbabwe problem and Mbeki embarked on his ' quiet diplomacy ' that had one aim - to ease Mugabe from power with dignity , but keep Zanu - PF in control .
Quiet diplomacy did not mean remaining silent in public ; it meant refraining from criticism .
Mbeki frequently justified actions by Mugabe .
So it was that , last Sunday , at a dinner at the South African High Commission in London , he endorsed the recent election whose result we are still awaiting .
' We have been very pleased with the manner in which the elections were conducted : the opposition had access to every part of the country , there was no violence , no one was beaten up ; it 's gone very well .
You have a very serious effort by the people of Zimbabwe to resolve their problems , we could see there was a common spirit among them and that 's the sense we got .
And in the conduct of the election none of the parties came back to us to intervene to say something was going wrong , ' he said .
Mbeki's yardstick for a fair election was that no one was murdered or beaten , as occurred in the previous three presidential and parliamentary ballots .
But by almost every other measure , it was far from free .
Most of the opposition media , including the main daily newspaper , have been banned for years , while the state - run press ran a vitriolic hate campaign against the opposition .
Parliamentary constituencies were gerrymandered to diminish the power of opposition voters .
The electoral roll contained hundreds of thousands of ghost voters .
By the time Mbeki gave his speech , the opposition was saying something was very wrong .
South Africa 's Deputy Foreign Minister , Aziz Pahad , publicly bought the line that the result of the presidential election was not being released for logistical reasons , and said that sceptical reporters were ' instruments of conspiracy and destabilisation ' .
Mbeki said much the same in accepting that the election commission was ' verifying ' the results .
The practical effect was to give Mugabe time to unleash his forces to terrorise Zimbabweans to ensure they do not again vote against him in the second round of elections that the election commission was trying to engineer .
Mbeki flew into Harare yesterday to meet Mugabe and emerged from their talks again saying there is ' no crisis ' and once again appealing for patience until the results are released .
Mbeki 's principal contribution over recent days has been to try to arrange what he always wanted - Mugabe out , but Zanu - PF still in power .
He is also insisting that , if Mugabe goes , it must be without humiliation .
To Mbeki , the pipe - smoking , urbane intellectual , the dignity of an African leader is more important than the indignity of Africans scrabbling on rubbish dumps for food , dying in hospitals for want of drugs , or forced to crawl through barbed wire into a foreign country to find work .
The region 's leaders have spent years indulging Mugabe .
Now he is snubbing them by refusing to attend their summit in Zambia to discuss his country 's crisis .
The coming days will show whether Mugabe 's useful idiots will finally do right by the people of Zimbabwe .
I just received this email .
The irony is great .

Chinese Man Pierced 2008 Times for Upcoming Olympics
China has been buzzing with anticipation for the 2008 Olympics this summer .
From putting up sexy Olympic street lights to naming 3,500 babies after the event , you can definitely feel the pride and excitement for the coming games .
Wei , a 60 year - old Chinese acupuncturist from Guangxi province , showed his patriotism for the upcoming Olympics by piercing his head , face , chest , and arms with 2008 decorative needles in five different colors .
The event broke his previous Guinness Record of 1790 needles set in 2004 .
Wei also hopes to share more about the history of acupuncture to the world .
Initially inspired after reading about a Canadian who had set a record for inserting 420 needles in his arm , Wei felt that it was “ not much compared to our centuries - old acupuncture , ” and began experimenting with piercing his own body with needles .
On January 13 , 2007 , Wei had also paraded through town with 800 needles in his forehead and even put on skates and skated around the streets to show he was not in pain and alright .
“ I shook with fear when I saw his hedgehog - head .
It seemed like he must be hurting himself . ” said a lady in her sixties .

New York is currently planting more trees Children who live in tree - lined streets have lower rates of asthma , a New York - based study suggests .
Columbia University researchers found that asthma rates among children aged four and five fell by 25 % for every extra 343 trees per square kilometre .
They believe more trees may aid air quality or simply encourage children to play outside , although they say the true reason for the finding is unclear .
The study appears in the Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health .
US rates of childhood asthma soared 50 % between 1980 and 2000 , with particularly high rates in poor , urban communities .
In New York City , asthma is the leading cause of admission to hospital among children under 15 .
The researchers found the city had an average of 613 street trees per square kilometre , and 9 % of young children had asthma .
This is a positive first step into a new area of research linking the environment and asthma
Leanne Male
Asthma UK
The link between numbers of trees and asthma cases held true even after taking into account sources of pollution , levels of affluence and population density , the researchers said .
However , once these factors were taken into account , the number of trees in a street did not appear to have any impact on the number of children whose asthma was so severe that they required hospital treatment .
Exposure theory
Some experts believe that children who are exposed to few microbes in early life are at an increased risk of asthma because their immune systems do not get the practice they need at fighting infection .
Therefore , if a tree - lined street encourages outside play , it might help reduce the risk of asthma by maximising the odds that children will be exposed to microbes .
However , trees are also a source of pollen , which may potentially exacerbate asthma symptoms in vulnerable children .
Lead researcher Dr Gina Lovasi admitted the effect , if any , of trees was far from clear .
She said : " There may be something else healthful about the areas that had more trees .
" For example , trees could be more abundant in areas that are well maintained in other ways . "
Leanne Male , assistant director of research at the charity Asthma UK , said : " Previous research looking at the influence of the environment on levels of asthma has focused on negative aspects , such as pollution and chemical exposure .
" This innovative report is the first to look specifically at the potentially beneficial effects of trees in urban areas and raises some interesting issues .
" However , there are a number of other factors that have not been considered , for example whether the families involved have pets .
" Despite the need for further work , this is a positive first step into a new area of research linking the environment and asthma . "
New York City is planning to plant 1 million extra trees by 2017 .

Maoists are in the majority in the new assembly A newly - elected assembly is set to meet in Nepal with the tasks of abolishing the monarchy and preparing a new national constitution .
Nepal is due to become a republic on Wednesday .
As the assembly was being sworn in on Tuesday a bomb explosion in the capital injured two people .
The assembly is huge and the ceremony saw 575 men and women being sworn in , many in traditional clothing .
The ceremony was performed by an older member of the newly - elected body .
Huge change
Many used their mother tongues for the occasion in this ethnically mixed country .
Just 26 more members have yet to be nominated by the biggest parties .
Nepal stands on the brink of huge change .
King Gyanendra has given no sign he will step down willingly
The assembly has been given the initial task of rubber - stamping the abolition of the monarchy .
Reports said King Gyanendra and Queen Komal were seen driving out of the royal palace on Tueasday afternoon , but it was not clear where they were going or for how long they would be gone .
Senior politicians have urged the monarch to leave the palace peacefully , but some have said force might be used if that does not happen .
Exactly how a republic will be voted in is still not clear .
For the second day running , bombs were placed in the capital on Tuesday .
Two were left in a city centre park , but police said only one exploded , slightly injuring two people .
As before , pamphlets were found in the name of a little - known hardline Hindu group .
Some militant pro-Hindu and pro-royal factions are campaigning violently against Nepal 's shedding of its royal - and its officially Hindu - status .

McCain , GOP unleash anti-Obama plan
Republicans might have a reason to smile : John McCain and his allies seem to have finally settled on a way to draw a stark contrast with Barack Obama .
After weeks of criticism from Republicans about the leisurely pace at which they seemed to be preparing for the general election , McCain ’s campaign has apparently settled on a highly personal campaign theme that aims to differentiate McCain and Obama on both character and issues .
Advertisement
The strategy : Paint Obama as conventional politician who always takes the safe and easy political road , then amplify the distinction by framing McCain as a patriot , somebody who has put sacrifice above self .
It ’s seemingly an effort by McCain to remind voters of his Vietnam - era heroism and compelling life story while touching on key issues to avoid running purely on biography .
The message also is designed to underline McCain ’s unique record of service to his country without touching on subterranean questions about Obama ’s patriotism .
Whether it will work — or if the famously improvisational McCain will even stick to it — is an open question .
But it is finally clear that McCain and many of his allies — including Karl Rove and Mitt Romney — are finally working in unison to push one message , and push it aggressively .
In a memo sent to reporters Thursday morning headlined , " Country First Vs. Self - Serving Partisanship , " McCain senior adviser Steve Schmidt traces an unbroken line from the physical courage McCain demonstrated in the Hanoi Hilton to the political bravery his supporters say he demonstrated on Capitol Hill .
“ When John McCain was offered early release as a prisoner of war , he refused , subjecting himself to torture rather than give a propaganda victory to his captors , ” Schmidt writes .
“ Is it any wonder that during the Republican primary , John McCain was working with Democrats and talking about the need for comprehensive immigration reform ? ”
Obama , Schmidt contends , has never picked the harder right over the easier wrong .
“ In his time on the national stage , he has consistently put his party and his self - interest first , ” he writes , citing energy and Iraq as two issues where Obama is constrained by the base of his own party .
Schmidt also seeks to use the same self - interest frame to bruise Obama for his decision to reverse course on taking public funding to finance his campaign and for not being willing to engage McCain in multiple town hall meetings .
The Obama campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment .
There is also an element of triangulation in the new theme , a recognition that McCain needs to set him apart from a toxic Republican administration and the political status quo .
To this end , Schmidt seeks to rebut the consistent Democratic effort to fuse McCain and President Bush by suggesting that it ’s not just Bush but Washington that is broken .
The country ’s political challenges are n’t due to “ a Republican administration that has disappointed many or a Democratic Congress that cannot take action on the challenges facing our nation , ” Schmidt writes .
“ The problem is that politicians in Washington are working for their own self - interest or that of their party . "
Schmidt , who is taking on a broader portfolio in the campaign and has returned from the trail to work at headquarters full time , developed the theme , according to campaign sources , and it has been quickly accepted as the new line .
McCain , who rarely discusses what is perhaps the most compelling element of his biography , used the new language twice on Tuesday to bring up his refusal to take early release in Vietnam .
" When I was offered a chance to go home early from prison camp in Vietnam , I put my country first , ” McCain said on a conference call Tuesday night with independent and Democratic voters in South Florida .
“ And I ’ve been doing that ever since . "
He said much the same later that night at a fundraiser in Newport Beach , Calif .
Also picking up the theme Thursday were Rove and Romney .
Rove used his regular perch on the Wall Street Journal opinion page to openly press the patriotism issue .
" In a contest over who is willing to put principle above personal ambition and self - interest , John McCain , a war hero and a former POW , wins hands down , " Rove wrote .
In a clear sign of the desire of McCain ’s campaign to drive this message , Romney , who has emerged as one of McCain ’s most frequent and on - message surrogates , appeared on three television morning shows to make the case .
" He has consistently voted with his party on the most partisan issues and put his party and personal interests ahead of those of the nation , " Romney said of Obama on CNN's " American Morning . "
" I think [ he 's ] been unable during his career at any time to reach across the aisle , find compromise , find ways to get things done other than simply toeing the party line . "
Dowd : ' McCain really does n't like Obama ' David Edwards
Published : Sunday May 25 , 2008
|
Print This Email This New York Times Columnist Maureen Dowd appeared on NBC's Meet the Press on Sunday morning .
Dowd reviewed a video clip of John McCain talking about Barack Obama 's level of experience and concluded that McCain does not like Obama .
At a campaign stop last week , McCain had joked about Obama 's experience .
" For a young man with very little experience , he 's done very well .
So I appreciate with his very , very great lack of experience and knowledge of the issues , he 's been very successful , " joked McCain .
Dowd observed that McCain 's mocking tone showed his distaste for Obama .
Dowd said , " I think we learned something very interesting in this exchange .
For one thing , McCain really does n't like Obama and he thinks that he's the punk who has n't bled , as McCain people like to say it .
And does n't deserve to be in this arena .
Dowd also sees that Obama has been hesitant to attack Hillary Clinton but less hesitant to attack McCain .
" And we also see Obama is not as intimidated by John McCain as he was by Hillary Clinton .
He is much freer when he goes on the attack , much more confident . "
She continued noting a difference between Ronald Reagan and McCain 's handling of age .
" And McCain has another problem .
He does n't sound as fun and as genial as Reagan did when he said those lines .
And also he tends to take any policy criticism as an attack on his integrity and then attack back on the other person 's integrity , and it sounds nasty . "

LONDON , England ( CNN ) --
New technology that can " see " through clothing and detect what 's underneath can now be used to scan crowds , making it a potentially effective tool to prevent terrorist attacks in public places .
The camera can see through people 's clothes from up to 25 meters away , detecting objects .
The ThruVision T5000 camera picks up Terahertz rays , or T - rays , which are naturally emitted by all objects and can pass through fabric or even walls .
The camera can then image metallic and non-metallic objects hidden under clothing on still or moving subjects without revealing any body detail , according to its British manufacturer , ThruVision Limited .
While similar technology is being unveiled at airports around the world , the T5000 is designed to be used in large , open areas .
With a range of 25 meters , the T5000 can screen people in public places , thus avoiding bottlenecks at border crossings or security checkpoints .
It also means people can be screened without knowing it .
Amid privacy concerns , ThruVision Chief Executive Clive Beattie said the image produced by the camera did not reveal detailed anatomy .
" It 's almost a glowing light bulb , " Beattie told CNN .
" You do n't see the detail that people might be concerned about . "
Explosives , liquids , narcotics , weapons , plastics , and ceramics can all be detected by the camera 's imaging technology , which the company says is completely safe .
Unlike X -rays , the T5000 does not emit radiation -- it only picks up on it .
Watch the camera in action »
The technology stems from British astronomers ' work in studying dying stars .
Astronomers use T -ray cameras to see through dust and clouds in space .
The company sees uses for its camera at high - profile sites like political or business venues , and outdoor areas like tourist attractions and sports arenas .
The camera is already in use in London 's Canary Wharf financial area .
In London 's busy Piccadilly Circus -- which is already filled with closed - circuit surveillance cameras -- reaction to the new technology was mixed .
What do you think of this technology ?
Some said the camera was going too far and invading privacy , but others said they are willing to put safety before privacy concerns .
" There 's surveillance everywhere anyway , " said one commuter .
" I do n't think it 's much of difference .
I do n't care that they can see through me , because they can see me anyway . "
Some experts said the intrusion of the camera was not worth the benefit .
" What we should consider is how much we want to lose aspects of our privacy in order to attain a sort of notional security , " said David Murakami Wood , director of the Surveillance Studies Network , which deals with surveillance and privacy issues .
" In most cases this is n't real security -- it 's a sense of safety that has very little real effect . "

Climate researchers at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory recently set themselves the task of building a supercomputer that can model the Earth 's entire atmosphere at an unprecedented level of resolution .
What they came up with initially was a set of specs that , at 10 petaflops and 100 terabytes of memory , was n't just beyond their monetary budget — it was beyond their power budget as well .
So they turned to embedded systems maker Tensilica to help them design a novel supercomputer that could get them to their goal on the cheap , and without breaking the power grid in the process .
In a new study , the researchers propose to use embedded hardware that can be tailored to their specific application , i.e. , weather simulation .
By working closely with Tensilica , an embedded system designer firm , they calculated the cost and power requirements for such an application - specific supercomputer , and found that it could be done for an order of magnitude less cost and will require an order of magnitude less power than if they used general - purpose processors from AMD , Intel , or IBM .
The researchers estimate that a cluster based on AMD Opterons would require 1.78 million cores drawing a total of 179 megawatts and could be built for around $ 1.8 billion ( not including interconnects ) ; an IBM BlueGene / L type system would require 3.56 million cores drawing only 27 megawatts at the low , low price of $ 2.6 billion .
In contrast , a Tensilica system with simple cores that are optimized for the task at hand would require 3.84 million cores drawing a mere 2.5 megawatts of power and could be had for a relative pittance ( $ 75 million ) .
Incidentally , 179 megawatts is enough to power a small city .

Can a system full of low - power embedded processors eat the big boys ' lunch on this one ?
It certainly looks like it based on the above calculations .
Of course the simplification above misses a few points , some of which the authors point out , some of which they do n't .
In particular , the Tensilica system would require a fair bit of software customization to achieve its goals .
The authors point out that any system on the scale that they are talking about would be a huge challenge to program .
And of course the big boys are n't standing still , so while such a cost comparison might make sense today , what will it be like in the near future ?
The authors attempt to address this by looking at predicted future processor cost and power requirements .
They suggest that by 2011 , you could build a BlueGene / L or traditional cluster with comparable cost and power requirements of the Tensilica system they can build today .
What the authors miss is something we have covered extensively at Ars , namely Larrabee and the general purpose GPU push .
Indeed , Intel and Cray have already announced that they are collaborating , and NVIDIA and AMD are moving full steam ahead with supercomputer - bound , flexibly programmable GPUs of their own .

Dragons are creatures that are considered mythical , until you run into one .
It is contrived that as the Chinese dragon walked South it began to lose toes ; hence Chinese Dragons have 5 toes , Korean dragons 4 toes and Japanese dragons 3 toes .
Also , as the Dragon migrates north , it gains toes .
In the old days it was usual to make offerings to dragons at lakes and rivers .
Poorer people appealed to the dragon 's appetites and offered various foods , including lotus flowers and roasted swallows , of which dragons are said to be inordinately fond .
So much so that people were warned against venturing out on the waves after eating roasted swallows because the dragon might smell it , come to the surface for its snack and then grow angry at having been cheated .
Most dragons in Chinese art are shown with four toes and only the Emperor was entitled to five on his insignia .
Anyone else who presumed to display a five - toed dragon without authorization met with swift retribution .
As a result anyone carrying a travel warrant sealed with the Emperor 's five - toed dragon could travel safely from one end of the country to the other and expect hospitality all the way .
In the old days you could lose your head for the unauthorized use of a five toed dragon .
As a kid , I believed you went to hell , or spent a long time in hotel Purgatory , if you ate meat on Friday .
While working in my garden this morning , my garden neighbor offered an interesting premise on the fish on Friday tradition .
It was Sunday , but neither of us had been to church .
He speculated that fishermen were worried about the economic impact of reduced activity as the faithful observed the Sabbath .
The Jewish Sabbath is a weekly day of rest observed from sundown on Friday until the appearance of three stars in the sky on Saturday night .
A lot of fish would spoil on the docks unless fish was brought into the religious observance .
There is no law , nor do I know of any law in the past , that Catholics must eat fish on Friday or anytime .
Over the centuries custom had dictated that Catholics abstain from meat ( the flesh of warm - blooded animals ) on certain days ( chiefly Friday ) .
As a kid I was terrified of eating meat on Friday .
My uncle , who was a missionary priest , cured me of that fear .
It was a Friday .
He was visiting his brothers while on a short leave from his post in South America .
The coals were hot and he was throwing some hot dogs on the grill .
I hesitantly asked him how we could eat the meat .
This was well before the introduction of tofu dogs .
His answer was that God had much more important things to worry about than three brothers celebrating a family reunion on a hot summer day .

Avi Beker , who teaches what he calls “ Jewish diplomacy ” at the University of Tel Aviv and Georgetown University , said that while the two cases are greatly different , “ they evoke a parallel psychological effect ” both among American Jews who have an enduring anxiety about the dual loyalty charge and those who are suspicious of the Israel lobby .
Mr. Rosen and Mr. Weissman each face one charge of conspiracy to communicate national defense information , and Mr. Rosen faces an additional charge of aiding and abetting the conspiracy .
Justice Department officials would not discuss the case .
But at the time of the indictment in 2005 , Paul J. McNulty , then the chief prosecutor in the Eastern District of Virginia , said , “ Those not authorized to receive classified information must resist the temptation to acquire it , no matter what their motivation may be . ”
According to the indictment , the defendants received sensitive information from at least three government sources that was passed on to journalists and Israeli officials .
One of the sources was Lawrence A. Franklin , a Pentagon analyst who has pleaded guilty to passing on sensitive information to a journalist and an Israeli diplomat .
Mr. Franklin has been sentenced to more than 12 years in prison .
After Mr. Franklin was arrested in 2004 , he became a cooperating witness for the government and , while wearing a wire , met with Mr. Weissman and told him that Iran had learned that Israeli agents were in northern Iraq .
Mr. Weissman , according to the indictment , told Mr. Rosen , and they both relayed that information to an Israeli diplomat and intelligence officer and an unnamed Washington Post reporter later identified as Glenn Kessler .
The other two sources of information received by Mr. Rosen and Mr. Weissman are identified in the indictment only as Government Official - 1 and Government Official - 2. Kenneth Pollack , who was the National Security Council specialist on the Persian Gulf , said in an interview that he thought he was Government Official - 1 because on Dec. 12 , 2000 , he had had lunch with Mr. Rosen and Mr. Weissman .
Mr. Pollack , who is no longer with the government , said that he told government investigators , “ I never revealed any classified information to Rosen and Weissman , and I never revealed any information that would be harmful to the security or interests of the United States . ”
There is an alarming trend in America .
The classic gym time game of dodgeball is being banned in some states .
You remember dodgeball right ?
I have wonderful memories of by far my strongest sport .
Had a knack for catching the ball and was a tremendous dodger .
But that 's beside the point .
For the last several years schools in New York , New Jersey , Texas , and Maryland have banned the sport .
Why you ask ?
Many parents ( mostly mothers from the stories I 'm reading ) as well as educators in the schools have been trying to protect their young sons and daughters from being part of a violent game .
It teaches the strong to beat up on the weak .
A kid 's self - esteem can be damaged by getting hit in the chest with a red , rubber ball .
We should teach the children not to use humans as a target .
But it does n't stop there , a Colorado Springs elementary school last year banned the game of tag .
Ditto in Connecticut because if a kid gets injured the school could be held liable which means lawsuit which means possible loss of money / funding .
Even the Massachusetts youth soccer program banned keeping score in games also because of self - esteem fears !!!!
Again .... the topic is dodgeball , but the bans and the excuses are similar across the board .
I 'm ready to go out on a mini rant here because all of those " excuses " for taking away dodgeball are a pile of horse crap .
Strong Beat up on Weak
Are you serious ?
There are strong people and weak people ?
You mean to tell me we can't just be equally weak or strong ?
Dodgeball separates the strong from the weak .
Unless you want your kid to be weak , you address the situation and make s/he STRONGER !!!
Injuries
Depends on what ball you 're using .
If you 're using shot puts for dodgeball then of course you would ban it .
But injuries are a part of growing up .
I remember playing dodgeball 4 years ago and I jumped high to avoid a ball thrown at my legs .
I avoided the ball but I landed awkwardly and sprained my ankle .
If the same people that ban dodgeball were the mothers and fathers of football players we would n't have a league .
Do you really think that going your whole childhood without sustaining one injury is going to solve anything when you 're out in the real world ?
Self Esteem
I 've played dodgeball most of my life .... never hurt my self - esteem when I got hit badly or my team got pummeled .
I will defer that to the proud parents of ArmchairGM for their opinion on that one .
Lastly , if you want to ban dodgeball because of " human targeting " and " self - esteem " and " injuries " , you should ban the following and / or change the rules for :
Baseball .
If you 're a pitcher ( Jeff Weaver ) and you allow 4 dingers in one inning your self - esteem is going to drop dramatically .
Also , pitcher is throwing baseball at catcher , making the catcher a human target .
No one is out , everyone is safe .
Football .
The goal is to get the football , but there is so much tackling and human targeting and violence that this sport should be outlawed , no need to change the rules .
Basketball .
Players can no longer take charges , handle the ball for longer than 5 seconds ( sharing is caring people ! ) .
Hockey .
Uh huh .
Ban PE !!!!!!!!!!
I 'm going to lose it , it 's your turn now .
In my opinion , banning all of these sports like dodgeball and making kids not play tag or keep score in soccer is going to make them as wimpy as hell in the future .
WE WILL NOT KEEP SCORE !!
BAN DODGEBALL !!!
If you can dodge a wrench you can dodge a ball ..... I could n't resist .

Pictured : Daredevil photographer leaps over Grand Canyon to take perfect photo
AS any photographer will tell you , getting the very best pictures can be risky .
But this man appears to have taken the art of reckless dedication to new heights .
Perched on a rock column half a mile above the Grand Canyon , he had clearly found the perfect vantage point to record the spectacular Arizona sunset .

Leap of faith : A dare - devil photographer mid-air as he jumps between two Grand Canyon rocks
Indeed his position was so precarious that he , rather than the setting sun , soon became the centre of attention for other tourists .
But onlookers realised how he had actually reached the rock column only when the time came for him to pack up and go home .
In what appears to have been a death - defying stunt , recorded on camera by a Dutch tourist , the photographer bundled up his gear , tucked it under his left arm and leapt the 8ft void separating him from the main land mass at The Grand Viewpoint on the canyon 's South Rim .

Stunning :
The photographer , with a bag filled with empty beer cans , takes pictures of the amazing scenery before leaping
For added effect , the spectators reported , he was wearing flip - flops .
The observers held their breath as he jumped .
. . and just managed to get a single foot and hand - hold on the other side .
He scrambled for several seconds , they said , before reaching safety .
Earlier , they had watched him relaxing and drinking a six - pack of beer as he waited on the rock column for the sun to go down .

Sequence : Poised to jump , the daredevil springs from the outcrop , clutching his bag and wearing only flipflops , before leaping over the mile - high ravine , and just managing to land on a narrow ledge and grip the side of the second rock
The man who took the pictures , marketing consultant Hans van de Vorst , 47 , said : ' When we arrived he was just taking in the scenery and people were discussing how he managed to get on there in the first place .
Nobody even bothered with the sunset - everyone 's eyes were on this man as they wondered how he was going to get off the rock .
' He looked really relaxed and casually stood up before jumping across the gap .
There was complete silence as he packed his things up and then a few gasps when he jumped .
' He did n't grab the rock properly the first time and slipped back about 50 cm before clinging on to it .
Even then he did n't look fazed . '
Mr van de Vorst has posted his pictures on the internet in an attempt to track down the mystery daredevil .

Washington Superdelegate and DNC member David McDonald became the sixth superdelegate of the day to endorse Barack Obama .
In an email statement to the Associated Press McDonald said , “ This was not an easy choice .
Both of the candidates who remain in contention are capable of winning the general election and would likely do so if selected as the nominee . ”
McDonald also said that Obama has , “ has shown a remarkable ability to organize and mobilize Democratic voters and focus their efforts on the key task of persuading independent voters around the country to join us in changing the White House agenda . ”
He said that he held off making his endorsement until after the delegations from Michigan and Florida were seated .
With Obama likely to pick up 16 more delegates tomorrow night , he will only be 25.5 delegates short of the nomination .
Judging from the rumors of the meetings that are going on among House and Senate Democrats it looks like there will be some sort of en mass endorsement that will be designed to not only put Obama over the top , but also stress party unity .

The Clinton campaign may not be publicly saying it ’s over , but they are taking all of the procedural steps involved in taking down the campaign tent .
After Wednesday it is time to get ready for Denver , where I found out today that I ’ll be heading to in order to cover the Democratic convention in August .
Four - and - a - half years ago , fingers hovering over a keyboard , I did something that , unbeknown to me , would change my life forever : I began to write about my sex life in explicit detail and then publish it , anonymously , on the internet on a blog entitled Girl with a One Track Mind
Back then , I felt frustrated by the view that women needed to have an emotional connection to fully enjoy sex : that certainly did n't apply to me .
We might be living in a post - Sex and the City generation , surrounded by magazines offering tips on how to have better orgasms , and vibrators recommended to achieve that , but those same publications still tend to frown on women who relish and pursue sex outside a long - term relationship .
Being able to write secretly on my blog allowed me to highlight , through my female and feminist perspective , that if a woman enjoyed casual sex it did not make her ' dirty ' or a ' slut ' or pathological : it just meant she liked sex - and there was absolutely nothing wrong with that .
Writing anonymously and not having to worry about people judging me , or about my violating others ' privacy , I recounted , explicitly , the sex I had had , be it good or bad .
I spared no detail , because I wanted to reflect the reality of sex in the most truthful way possible , in the hope that other women who read the blog would relate to my experiences , and that the men reading might unlearn some of the bad habits they 'd seemingly picked up from the falsities of porn .
Little did I know that , a couple of years down the line , all my lovers , exes , friends , neighbours , colleagues and family would be reading the blog too .
But that 's exactly what happened when I lost my anonymity in August 2006 .
By then , visitors to my blog were in excess of two million and I had scored a book deal out of the blog 's popularity .
Quite a few people , it seemed , were interested in what I had to say about sex and , unfortunately for me , certain elements of the press were too : they decided to find out who was the ' shameless ' woman behind the ' sordid ' tales , and three days after the book was published , a national newspaper did an exposé on me and ' outed ' my identity to the world .
It was tough suddenly being thrust into the public eye and having to cope with a media onslaught ; and I struggled to pick up the pieces of my private life .
Suddenly I was deluged by people appearing out of the woodwork whom I had n't spoken to in years ; I 'm not sure whether it was worse fielding calls from exes who wanted reassuring that I had disguised details about them , or that the men who had broken my heart got to read my feelings about that , in all their gory detail .
Either way , whatever privacy in the intimacy I had had was forever lost .
After people discovered who was behind the infamous online secret sex diary , it seemed that everyone wanted to comment on the merits , or not , of me , and especially about how I looked .
I 'd get dozens of emails from men - strangers from the internet - telling me I was ' gorgeous ' and asking me out on a date .
But then I 'd also get the same amount of hate mail .
If you did a web search on my name , you 'd come up with scores of comments about my appearance , almost all negative .
Given I believe that self - worth comes from within , I 'm fine with people thinking me not beautiful ; I accept I 'm not ' pretty ' ; I know that feeling good about myself - who I am - is far more attractive and sexy than surface beauty ; and I do n't base my self - esteem on external validation about my attractiveness from men .
One might assume , then , that I was n't bothered about the vitriol thrown my way .
Privately , though , I reeled from the onslaught of personal attacks , and even now I am conscious that every time my face appears - alongside this article , even - I will be judged on how I look , rather than on what I say .
And a part of me started to care about this , which contradicted everything I wrote about and hoped to achieve on my blog : that it was OK to be a woman expressing her wish to desire a man , rather than be the object of desire .
I 've always relied on my sarcasm , stupid witticisms and nerdy clumsiness to have success in romance and sex and now I was faced with potential dates from men who I neither knew , or trusted , but who had read the most intimate details of my sex life and then told me they thought I was sexy and attractive .
With my confidence at an all - time low , and afraid that these approaches were due to guys who wanted ' a piece ' of the action they 'd read about , I lost all trust in dating , and men in general , removing myself from the dating arena entirely .
The months after my ' outing ' in the press were spent mostly on my own - ironic for such a previously ' active ' sex diarist .
But women have needs , and eventually I ended up bedding a series of Z - list ( OK , perhaps M- list ) celebrities who approached me through the blog and who I knew would n't spill the beans , due to our shared desire for privacy .
Hotels were obtained , condoms procured , and an author , a rock star and a TV personality were all ticked off my nonexistent list .
The excitement and novelty of these secret trysts soon wore off though ; I began to realise that I did need external validation from someone - but of the emotional sort .
The aftermath of losing my anonymity had left me feeling fragile : I needed to curl up in someone 's arms , not just shag them senseless .
Expressing that want to the world though was not something I wished to do : it was bad enough having to ignore the hate mail without then revealing my vulnerabilities to others .
Falling back into the embrace of an ex-lover was almost inevitable , I suppose : their familiarity was reassuring to me and the trust we shared was implicit .
I was able to relax and just be myself , without worrying about how I might be perceived , or judged .
Indeed , one night I burst into tears while having sex - a first for me - and rather than freaking out as a casual fuck - buddy might do , my ex just held me close and kissed me ; it was the intimacy I needed .
While enjoyable , the encounter was short - lived , sadly , and I knew I wanted - and needed - something more meaningful and long - term now .
Eventually I decided to take the plunge and risk dating again .
At first , I thought the best option would be to meet someone through friends .
My mates , bless their hearts , would introduce me to a potential suitor by saying , ' This is Zoe , she 's the sex diarist ! ' and , almost every time , said man 's eyes would widen into an expression of startled shock .
It was n't the most productive method in obtaining future dates : almost every conversation would continue , ' You 're not going to write about this , are you ? ' and I 'd have to point out that describing sharing a pint of beer does n't make for particularly interesting commentary .
The one time I did end up in bed with a friend , he spent the whole night telling me that he was worried he would n't ' be as good as the other men '
I had written about , while I was fretting over what an anti-climax I might be - literally - to him , with his knowing about my supposed sexual notoriety .
Suffice it to say that the time we spent together under the duvet was fraught with anxiety , rather than hot sex .
These issues meant I soon gave up friends as sources of dates , and given I had now lost all my face - to - face confidence with blokes , I figured that perhaps in an environment I felt comfortable with - the internet - I might have more luck with them .
So I joined a number of dating sites , wrote what I thought was a reasonably witty profile , put up the obligatory one - inch - sized photograph , and crossed my fingers , hoping that perhaps I 'd encounter someone who found me interesting enough to want to meet for a date .
What happened shocked me .
Soon after I joined the websites , I was then emailed by handfuls of men who would open their messages with , ' Are n't you Girl with a One Track Mind ? '
Evidently , the medium in which I had become known had propelled me to be a little too well - known for my liking and I 'd politely decline and ignore any further emails .
When guys then wrote to me and did n't mention the blog , I would raise my hopes , only to have them dashed when I met them , and they 'd admit to me that , like the other men , they had recognised me from my picture and were also ' fans ' of the blog .
Because of their massively intimate knowledge of me , I felt there was no foundation on which to build an equal , healthy , romantic relationship : I backed away from those men too , nice though they were , and shut off my computer , calling it a day .
If it sounds like I would never date someone who 's familiar with my blog , that 's not the case .
But if they 're British ?
That 's now highly unlikely .
Faced with a woman who 's written about sex , Brit blokes are more liable to stare at the ceiling and nervously share their insecurities , rather than just getting stuck in , so to speak .
' I feel weird being in bed with the Girl with a One Track Mind , ' one English guy said to me , as we lay side by side , not touching .
' You 're not , ' I sighed .
' You 're in bed with Zoe . '
My experience over the last two years has shown me that we Brits are a little hung up about sex .
We seem to stagger from a saucy , ' Carry - On- ooh - matron ! ' type approach to a stigmatised , disapproving and critical perspective with not much in between .
To talk about sex among British folk causes red faces ; a woman who talks about shagging can expect to be severely chastised .
I 'm still stunned at the terminology the press - and others - used to describe me , just because I wrote about my sex life .
Contrast this to New York , where I 've been spending increasing amounts of time , and the difference is amazing .
When I was last there , I happened to pick up a free paper on a street corner , and read something just as explicit as anything I had ever written .
For a moment I was surprised , and then relieved : it showed a much more progressive attitude to sex than Britain ; I can't imagine an evening paper here carrying an article advocating mutual masturbation .
This open - minded outlook was even more evident to me when I recently met some New Yorkers and told them I was a sex writer .
' Oh , so your book 's like the real Sex in the City ? ' they 'd reply .
Well perhaps , minus the expensive shoes , and with a lot more shagging , yeah .
And then they 'd add , ' Who is n't a sex writer , nowadays ? ' and they 're right : in New York so many folk are .
In fact , there 's a whole community of them : a group of New York - based sex bloggers who meet every month to chat over a cup of tea .
I can't envisage the same happening here in the UK , good cuppa or not ; we are a disparate , embarrassed lot , who write in secret , because , when we speak openly , we 're met with disapproval .
The nicest discovery I 've made about New York though is the men .
In a city where people date in tandem , and only ' go steady ' with one person when they 're ready to be ' exclusive ' to them , the guys naturally have a much more open - minded attitude to sex and dating .
Refreshingly , most of the men I 've met there have never heard of my blog or book , so getting to know one of them on a more personal level offers up an equal starting point from which to learn about the other person - which makes for far more romantic possibilities down the line .
What 's even better is that , when I have mentioned what I 've written about , the blokes seem nonplussed by my past , and it 's comforting to know that actually , it 's really not that big a deal .
In fact , one New York man I slept with shrugged away any interest in reading about my sex life , preferring instead to ' experience it first - hand ' , as he put it , when we were in bed together .
Result .
Through my ' outing '
I 've had time to reflect on my own life a lot and examine my thoughts on sex and relationships .
I still do n't subscribe to the view that women should devote their time solely seeking a spiritual connection to enjoy desirable sex , because I do n't think that is true .
However , I 'm at a point where I now accept I have a need to be fulfilled emotionally as well as physically with someone ; I feel ready to be with someone special for the long - term .
I 'm just not confident that is possible for me to achieve in the UK now ; too much of my personal life has been on display and the English attitude towards sex is reflected in how men view and relate to me : awkwardly .
In contrast , because of the openness of its residents and since I already have some dates lined up for when I am next there , I 'm hopeful about what New York - and my future - might hold for me : I am planning to move there as soon as I can .
It may seem that my view of New York is idealised , but it 's not : I know that there 's superficiality and shallowness in the city and most likely I will still encounter people who feel uncomfortable or threatened by me .
But overall I 'm hopeful that I can make a fresh start and meet a man with whom I can settle down .
At the very least , being there will help me shed the insecurities and inhibitions that I 've developed as a result of losing my anonymity - and that 's no bad thing .
Hopefully I 'll be able to slip quietly into the background and become just another single woman - albeit with the advantage of a London accent - looking for , and finding , love in the Big Apple ... and writing about it , of course .
HAMMER update 23 - jan-08
From : Matthew Dillon < dillon@xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx > Date : Wed , 23 Jan 2008 18:36:25 - 0800 ( PST )
I continue to make excellent progress .
There are just a handful of outright bugs left , though I 'm sure I will introduce new ones as I work on the balancer .
*
The recovery code is written and working but both the spike and recovery code need additional I/O ordering dependancies to operate safely .
For example , the spike code copies a number of records but may sync the original cluster ( where they 've been deleted ) before syncing the new cluster ( where they were copied to ) .
It is also possible for a file 's link count to get out of sync after a crash , for example if you crash in the middle of a rm - rf .
The worst that happens is we wind up with a directory entry pointing to a non-existant inode , or an inode whos directory entry no longer exists .
Since inode numbers in HAMMER are forever - unique it can't actually hurt the filesystem but there will have to be a validator that will run through and fix those , or a transactional solution .
There are still a few transactional issues but I 'm not going to worry about them for the alpha release .
I have to get the I/O ordering worked out before I can even begin thinking about recovering transactions which span more then one cluster .
* I finally put a simple heuristic in the spike code so B - Tree depth no longer spins out of control , though there are still some edge cases that are n't getting deleted ( obvious if you cpdup , sync , rm - rf , sync , and use ' hammer ... show ' to dump the tree ) .
The current heuristic does n't pack files very well .
*
There are still a few fatal bugs , probably related to I /O ordering .
Next up is the balancing code .
This code will be responsible for slowly balancing the topology , removing historical bits based on the retention policy , and straightening out the kinks .
Ultimately no matter how bad an initial layout , the balancer will be able to fix it .

BBC News , Ethiopia
It is a strange and unsettling ride west from the Ethiopian town of Shashamene .
The fields are vibrant green .
There is water in the creeks .
The soil is a deep rich burgundy .
However , the people here speak of a " green drought " .
It is the time when the land is full of new shoots but there is no food .
It happens because the last rains failed and few crops were planted .
In every village there were vulnerable children
You can sense the desperation when you arrive in a village .
A crowd gathers quickly .
Some hold up their children .
They want us to see the distended stomachs which are one sign of hunger .
The parents hope that , by seeing , we will take their children to a treatment centre .
This happened in the village of Odo .
A local priest had visited last week and had taken the most severely malnourished children for emergency care .
But others had been left behind , including a 12 - year - old with shrunken limbs who suffered from malaria .
Walking for hours
It is hard to know the scale of this .
For several hours this morning women walked into the tiny village of Garagoto .
Most had young children slung on their backs .
What we have seen in the villages is not famine but it is a crisis - some say tens of thousands of children are at risk
Aid appeal for Ethiopian children Agencies fear prices and drought Some were carried in bundles of cloth .
All were sick .
Some had the bloated faces of the severely malnourished .
Others were covered in flies .
One of them , eight - year - old Tareking , was starving .
His eyes sunken , his head swollen .
His mother had walked for several hours to bring him to a treatment centre .
We all questioned whether it was too late for Tareking .
Another mother called Muner said she had walked for four hours to get help for her son Sparku .
" I was so tired , she said , and it was very difficult getting here .
The cattle are dying and there is hunger . "
Challenge ahead
For a time , Ethiopia was associated with famine .
The country has come a long way since then .
What we have seen in the villages is not famine - but it is a crisis .
Some say tens of thousands of children are at risk .
I can believe that .
We travelled through five or six villages .
In every one were vulnerable children who will not survive until the next harvest without emergency food aid .
One aid agency has said there is not currently enough food in the country to meet this crisis .
I met Daniel Hadgu , who works for the International Medical Corps .
He was clear that , without help , 50 % of the most needy children would die .
We went to an emergency centre in the village of Eddu that was run by the Missionaries of Charity .
They have already cared for more than 400 of the most seriously ill children .
The vast majority survive but a few have died .
Some are so weak and vulnerable that the slightest setback can be fatal .
And here lies the challenge : what will become of so many poor , frail children in the months ahead before the next harvest in early autumn .

What are these ?
Now that OOXML has been shoved through , ( and if you are new to the story , here 's a very complete and succinct history of what happened by James Hogarth on Tideway ) , we find it cut and bleeding on the other side .
What about appeals of the travesty ?
There is an appeal process , although you may have noticed that Standards Norge 's decision was objected to elsewhere .
Perhaps folks have gotten the idea that ISO is a bit tilted at the moment .
But here 's what ISO says about appeals : " Subject to there being no formal appeals from ISO / IEC national bodies in the next two months , " the text of the standard will be published as ISO / IEC 29500 , ISO said Wednesday .
Here 's what it means if there are any such appeals :
If any national standards organizations do make appeals to JTC1 , the Joint Technical Committee of ISO and the International Electrotechnical Commission ( IEC ) that worked on the draft , then Microsoft may have to wait several months longer while the appeal is heard , according to Section 11 of the ISO / IEC JTC1 Directives .
That is if the appeals are unsuccessful .
So Microsoft has to wait at least two more months for appeals to be filed and heard .
So , that means to me that it will be more than two months , unless ISO just rubber stamps rejections of appeals as fast as they are filed .
Which seems sadly possible .
Some Reactions
Here is a formal statement from IBM :
The need for truly open standards and processes is demonstrably more important than ever .
IBM will continue to be an active supporter of ODF .
We look forward to being part of the community that works to harmonize ODF and OOXML for the sake of consumers , companies and governments , when OOXML control and maintenance is fully transferred to JTC1 ( ISO / IEC ) .
Well , at least they have a sense of humor .
I do n't believe , personally , that that day will ever dawn , when Microsoft will allow true harmonization .
Free Software Foundation Europe has a press release expressing concern for the standards process , and if you are not a tech person and are wondering what all the fuss is about and why so many are disturbed by OOXML , if you click on the links provided , you 'll understand : FSFE concerned about quality of standardisation process Today the International Standards Organisation ( ISO ) approved Microsoft 's Office OpenXML format as ISO / IEC standard 29500 despite severe technical and legal concerns with the specification that have been raised by various parties .
" FSFE published its ' Six questions to national standardisation bodies ' before the September 2nd vote last year .
Considering the statements about progress made on MS - OOXML , one would have hoped that at least one of these questions enjoyed a satisfactory response , " states FSFE 's German Deputy country coordinator Matthias Kirschner .
He continues : " Unfortunately that is not the case .
Issues like the ' Converter Hoax ' and the ' Questions on Open Formats ' are still equally valid .
As the ' Deprecated before use ' and ' Interoperability woes with OOXML ' documents demonstrate , MS - OOXML interoperability is severely limited in comparison to Open Standards .
In addition to these issues , there are the legal concerns that were raised by various parties . "
" Technologically speaking , the state of IS29500 is depressing , " says Marko Milenovic of FSFE 's Serbian Team and co-chair of the Serbian technical committee on DIS29500 .
" In large parts it is low quality technical prose that fails to use the normative terminology mandated by ISO / IEC 's guidelines .
We 've been told to wait for the maintenance process for MS - OOXML to become usable .
That ISO would knowingly approve a dysfunctional specification is disillusioning . "
FSFE vice - president Jonas Öberg states : " Governments have to start asking themselves what the ISO seal of approval really means .
As demonstrated by the MPEG standards , it never meant that something qualifies as a meaningful ' Open Standard . ' "
Öberg continues : " Now it seems that ISO could be the wrong forum for standards development in information technology in general .
It seems to work too slowly or too poorly to make the ISO brand meaningful in the IT world .
We 'll have to see whether ISO can repair its own processes enough to become a meaningful participant . "
" Governments that seek to gain control over their own data and ensure long - term archival of public records independently from any specific vendor will need to establish other criteria in their public procurement , " concludes Georg Greve , FSFE 's president .
" Programs like ' Certified Open ' that seek to assess the actual interoperability and independence are likely to play a larger role in the future . "
When folks flood the market with Brand X products , that is what happens next -- certification , so people know which is The Real Thing .
Microsoft is busy trying to redefine Open in its own image , and make interoperability mean that Microsoft can use whatever it needs but you can't .
Well , all right .
Time to fix that .
And it can be fixed .
Just because ISO did n't bother does n't mean it can't be done .
And you know what the song says , There 's Nothing Like the Real Thing .
Andrew Updegrove writes about fixing things too :
In order for the credibility of the traditional system to be restored , a thorough review of the just completed DIS 29500 Fast Track process should be immediately commissioned .
That review should include recommendations for reform that would include , but not be limited to , suggesting revisions to the rules relating to Fast Track and PAS submissions , new National Body and ISO / IEC JTC1 rules relating to transparency and conflicts of interest , and providing for circuit breakers and corrective actions that could be invoked the next time such a process has clearly run off the rails . "
Bob Sutor also writes that now the standards process needs fixing , so the best tech wins :
So is that it ?
Of course not .
The process of international standards making has been laid bare for all to examine .
People now have some sense that Not all standards are created by a community of independent stakeholders , as some people may have previously assumed
The lack of transparency , the ability to see who voted and why , leads to less understanding and accountability
If intellectual property policies are not clear and comprehensive , significant questions exist over who can implement what in what way
There are no brakes on putting the wrong standards though some existing processes
Politics , and not just standards politics , has fully entered the process
Equilibrium , the need for having a balance of independent people considering a standard and not a majority of business partners , is out of control
In some countries with democratic governments , there is virtually no connection between representation of the people  and votes on international standards
There is very little consistency from country to country in how voting decisions are made , which is their right , but some better common guidance might be appropriate I believe that thousands of motivated yet pragmatic people will now move on to fix the systemic issues Ive identified , with fresh evidence of why it is necessary .
There are now , as there have always been , much bigger issues than OOXML itself .
For that reason , we are still in the early phases of the worldwide movement to true open standards .
Openness means that the best technology for all wins .
Openness means that the process is clean and visible and incorruptible .
Openness means that personal accountability means something and is known and respected by all .
Openness must be earned .
I think that s worth fighting for .
There has been tremendous progress and its happened far faster and wider than most people ever imagined possible .
While fully cognizant of these current results , I m energized to take the bigger fight for openness to the next level with the thousands of individuals who are now convinced that the standards system needs fixing , and soon .
I hope youll take part .
That is a lot of words that say two important things : ISO failed to put the brakes on Microsoft 's politicking , which included calling presidents of countries to overrule decisions and force a bad standard through , we 've been reading in the media ; and 2 ) there is work to do to set up a standards process with some brakes in it should bad actors try this in the future .
Of course , there is another choice , to become a cynic .
If the system is so corrupt that it works like this , why bother ?
However , Groklaw has always been committed to giving things a whirl , and we 've accomplished a great deal more than I ever expected , and anyway , it 's no fun being a cynic .
I think it gives you high blood pressure .
Besides , you did n't think Microsoft would play fair , did you ?
Ha !
Caught some of you .
Because some of you * did * think Microsoft was changing and getting more open and was wanting to build bridges to FOSS , etc .
I know you did .
I hoped for a while myself .
Well , take a look at the evidence splayed out before us on the ISO table .
It speaks .
And what it says is , " There is no new Microsoft . "
And so we need to get smarter .
Make the division more clear .
People will choose well , given a clear choice .
Firefox and Ubuntu and Red Hat and others have demonstrated that .
There is no need to compromise .
And if you are tempted by the money , think about the rest of us , will you ?
Look at ISO .
Do you want to be like that ?
Anyone , then , from this day forward who is naive enough to believe a single word from Microsoft needs to see a doctor right away .
That is the single most important positive result from this OOXML process , as far as I 'm concerned .
Now we know .
They should n't be invited to Open Source conferences to give keynotes , I do n't think , or get to be on boards of directors of organizations , or let inside in any way that gives them the chance to pretend to be members of the community or even fair - dealers with FOSS .
They will harm you any time they feel like it , and clearly from the OOXML story , we see they do indeed feel like destroying FOSS .
They do n't mind if a redefined , brand X version of " open " source limps along in its wake , paying tolls along the way to Microsoft , but they intend to kill off the real thing .
That 's why the OSP does n't cover the GPL and the February " interoperability " statement opening up certain documentation is only for FOSS if it is noncommercial .
Otherwise , all signs point to patent litigation , with all those presidents of countries that just got phone calls from Bill Gates lending a hand , one presumes .
That is the plan , Stan , as best I can make it out , and anyone who enables that strategy by signing patent pledges , inviting them to speak as if they are now members of the community , etc. is helping to kill off FOSS .
There is no middle ground now .
Think before you buy an Asus eeePC , will you ?
There is more at stake here than just you as an individual .
Georg Greve of Free Software Foundation Europe has this to say : Re-enacting the parrot sketch Wednesday 02 April 2008 Calling the past months work - intensive would be something of an understatement .
Fortunately my colleagues in FSFE did an excellent job of working on the same project in various countries while I was partially absent .
They also managed to put out some interesting comments on the IS29500 approval .
What I can say on the issue is unfortunately fairly limited by the various shrouds of secrecy over what in my personal opinion should be like any other public interest process that affects the lives of citizens .
Why are various national standardisation bodies not accountable to the public they represent in ISO ?
Why can the public not know what is going on ?
If I had a magic wand , non-accountability and intransparency would be my top two issues to fix in all of this .
It could also be a good idea to get some procedural buffs from the United Nations to make things more predictable and reliable on a procedural level .
Had you told me a year ago I 'd be wishing for the procedural efficiency of the United Nations , disbelief would have been a likely reaction .
Now the United Nations appear extremely well - functioning in comparison .
Due procedure would allow for fair dialog based on substantial considerations .
In this case it would have allowed discussing technical issues and answering the most fundamental question for any specification :
Is it technically sound so it can be approved without further review or modifications ?
This question can be answered on technical grounds .
There is no need for attempts at authoritative arguments , assertions about the quality of future editorial work , or referrals to the maintenance process .
Attempts at answering that question in any of these ways indeed translate into " No , it is not . "
Of course there are also other questions that are relevant when it comes to standardisation - including the " Six questions to national standardisation bodies " that FSFE put out around July 2007 .
Answering some of these issues is a little less clear - cut than the technical side , but can be done in an environment where people are accountable for their actions and statements .
The media could have helped a great deal at keeping that dialog honest .
As accountability and transparency are sadly lacking , the past months often seemed like a gigantic , world - wide re-enactment of Monty Python 's parrot sketch with the involvement of several multinationals and billions of EUR spent .
I am pretty sure the original was more cost effective -- and thanks to the wonders Gnash we all get to enjoy this classic here : YouTube
My only question is :
Where is the standardisation store of ISO 's brother so I can return IS29500 ?
I love Gnash .

Hogarth , the first link in the article , talks about what he plans to do next :
For my part ?
I will be writing to Mr. Pughs , MP giving my support to his questions .
If he is right about suspicious activity in BSI then the result can be changed for 2 more months as a lodged complaint .
I shall also be writing to my local MP pointing out his parliamentary question and international opinion .
Finally I shall be writing to my MEP .
Poland is being investigated by the EU commission and hopefully support will be lent to that .

Air India faces competitions from other airlines with younger flight crew
An Indian court has ruled that state - owned airline Air India has the right to prevent its air hostesses from flying for being overweight .
The Delhi high court was responding to a case filed by five air hostesses who had been grounded by the airline for being too fat to fly .
The air hostesses are expected to appeal against the decision .
The judges agreed with the airline 's view that overweight crew present a safety and health hazard .
They also said that , in the highly competitive airline industry , an air hostess 's physical condition and appearance played an important role in her overall personality .
Air India , whose air hostesses wear traditional Indian saris , is facing a stiff challenge from a number of private airlines with younger flight crew typically dressed in skirts or Western suits .
A few years ago , during a recruitment drive for new crew , the airline said that it would not consider applicants with acne or bad teeth .
Saudi Arabia , the world ’s biggest oil exporter , is planning to increase its output next month by about a half - million barrels a day , according to analysts and oil traders who have been briefed by Saudi officials .
The increase could bring Saudi output to a production level of 10 million barrels a day , which , if sustained , would be the kingdom ’s highest ever .
The move was seen as a sign that the Saudis are becoming increasingly nervous about both the political and economic effect of high oil prices .
In recent weeks , soaring fuel costs have incited demonstrations and protests from Italy to Indonesia .
Saudi Arabia is currently pumping 9.45 million barrels a day , which is an increase of about 300,000 barrels from last month .
While they are reaping record profits , the Saudis are concerned that today ’s record prices might eventually damp economic growth and lead to lower oil demand , as is already happening in the United States and other developed countries .

by Rep. Ron Paul , MD
Ron Paul in the US House of Representatives , June 4 , 2003
Mr. Speaker , like many Americans , I am greatly concerned about abortion .
Abortion on demand is no doubt the most serious sociopolitical problem of our age .
The lack of respect for life that permits abortion significantly contributes to our violent culture and our careless attitude toward liberty .
As an obstetrician , I know that partial birth abortion is never a necessary medical procedure .
It is a gruesome , uncivilized solution to a social problem .
Whether a civilized society treats human life with dignity or contempt determines the outcome of that civilization .
Reaffirming the importance of the sanctity of life is crucial for the continuation of a civilized society .
There is already strong evidence that we are indeed on the slippery slope toward euthanasia and human experimentation .
Although the real problem lies within the hearts and minds of the people , the legal problems of protecting life stem from the ill - advised Roe v.
Wade ruling , a ruling that constitutionally should never have occurred .
The best solution , of course , is not now available to us .
That would be a Supreme Court that recognizes that for all criminal laws , the several states retain jurisdiction .
Something that Congress can do is remove the issue from the jurisdiction of the lower federal courts , so that states can deal with the problems surrounding abortion , thus helping to reverse some of the impact of Roe v. Wade .
Unfortunately , H.R. 760 takes a different approach , one that is not only constitutionally flawed , but flawed in principle , as well .
Though I will vote to ban the horrible partial - birth abortion procedure , I fear that the language used in this bill does not further the pro-life cause , but rather cements fallacious principles into both our culture and legal system .
For example , 14G in the u201CFindingsu201D section of this bill states , u201C … such a prohibition [ upon the partial - birth abortion procedure ] will draw a bright line that clearly distinguishes abortion and infanticide … u201D
The question I pose in response is this :
Is not the fact that life begins at conception the main tenet advanced by the pro-life community ?
By stating that we draw a u201 C bright lineu201D between abortion and infanticide , I fear that we simply reinforce the dangerous idea underlying Roe v.
Wade , which is the belief that we as human beings can determine which members of the human family are u201 Cexpendable , u201D and which are not .
Another problem with this bill is its citation of the interstate commerce clause as a justification for a federal law banning partial - birth abortion .
This greatly stretches the definition of interstate commerce .
The abuse of both the interstate commerce clause and the general welfare clause is precisely the reason our federal government no longer conforms to constitutional dictates but , instead , balloons out of control in its growth and scope .
H.R. 760 inadvertently justifies federal government intervention into every medical procedure through the gross distortion of the interstate commerce clause .
H.R. 760 also depends heavily upon a u201Cdistinctionu201D made by the Court in both Roe v. Wade and Planned Parenthood v. Casey , which establishes that a child within the womb is not protected under law , but one outside of the womb is .
By depending upon this illogical u201 Cdistinction , u201D I fear that H.R. 760 , as I stated before , ingrains the principles of Roe v.
Wade into our justice system , rather than refutes them as it should .
Despite its severe flaws , this bill nonetheless has the possibility of saving innocent human life , and I will vote in favor of it .
I fear , though , that when the pro-life community uses the arguments of the opposing side to advance its agenda , it does more harm than good .
Dr. Ron Paul is a Republican member of Congress from Texas .

Nevertheless , Chantal can fit in , more or less .
Picture taken at the Ecoauto fair , in Torino , September 2007 .
It is always a shock when people understand that peak oil is about to arrive ( or that it has already arrived ) .
Reactions vary from utter despair to groundless optimism .
Some people immediately jump to the conclusion that the great dieoff is just around the corner .
Others , instead , are sure that some technological marvel will save us .
In both cases , the bottom line is that there is nothing that can be done : either we are doomed , or someone will come up with the miracle solution at the last moment .
But passivity is never a good strategy .
We can adapt ; and if there are no perfect solutions for the incoming petroleum scarcity , there are at least some that may be good enough .
That is why we built our retrofitted , battery powered Fiat 500 .
We do n’t claim it is the first retrofitted vehicle in the world , nor that it is the solution to all problems brought by peak oil .
But we do believe that it is an example of a way for maintaining some low cost transportation for the troubled times ahead .
It is a true “ post peak car ” that has the additional advantage that it can be used for focussing people ’s attention on the reality of the incoming peak oil
Let ’s go more in detail .
Why use batteries ?
Why retrofitting an old car ?
There is a chain of reasoning that led us to that .
As we know , our transportation system runs on liquid fuels obtained almost exclusively from crude oil .
With oil becoming scarce , we ’ll have to cut on travelling and use more public transportation .
But that ca n’t be the definitive solution .
No country of the world has a public transportation system that can completely replace private vehicles .
Expanding public transportation to that level would be so fantastically expensive to be unimaginable , especially in the difficult period that will follow peak oil .
And , of course , it will take a while before we manage to raze down the suburbs and relocate everyone in towns .
Transporting people , then , is only part of the problem : we also need to carry merchandise .
You ca n’t use bicycles to bring food to supermarkets ’ shelves .
So , we still need vehicles able to carry people and things around .
The rush , right now , is all for synthetic fuels and biofuels .
But that ’s not the solution .
Robert Hirsch showed in his , by now famous , 2005 report that we do n’t have enough time and we do n’t have enough money for building the infrastructure that would be needed to liquefy coal or gas .
And even if we could somehow find the resources needed , that would be the perfect way to ruin an entire planet by generating a runaway greenhouse effect .
Biofuels wo n’t do , either , too inefficient and needing too much land ; not a good strategy if we also want to eat .
In any case , the old internal combustion engine is so inefficient that we wo n’t be able to afford to keep using it in the post - peak world .
Hydrogen cars could be more efficient , but the technology wo n’t be ready soon enough and the cost of the infrastructure that would be needed is out of this planet .
In short , there is no technology available right now that could be used to make vehicles which do n't need petroleum derived fuels and which have the same prices as those we have now .
But , if we ca n’t have everything , we can at least have something .
The post peak paradigm is to do things that work ; not perfect , maybe , but good enough .
We can have clean and efficient vehicles that do n’t depend on fossil fuels if we accept the limitations of battery powered electric vehicles .
These vehicles wo n’t have the range and the performances we are used to , but are efficient , non polluting , already exist , and do n’t need a specific infrastructure .
The recent development of lithium batteries for traction is a small quantum leap that has greatly improved the energy / weight ratio of electric vehicles .
But even the old lead batteries can propel a vehicle far enough to be interesting for an average commuter or for carrying goods around .
The strong point of battery powered vehicles in a post - peak world is their flexibility .
Batteries can be recharged with anything that produces electricity .
Normally , the existing power grid would be used and , in this case , electricity is still produced mainly by fossil fuels .
But that is going to change : the energy that powers the grid will be increasingly produced by renewable sources .
It is also possible to conceive stand - alone renewable plants dedicated to recharging vehicles ’ batteries .
In both cases , the batteries of electric vehicles will also provide an energy storage system ; something that renewables badly need .
Despite the advantages of battery powered vehicles , if you shop around for a purely electric car you ’ll find that a tiny , electric 2 - seater costs more than a traditional compact car .
Electric cars are expensive because they are made in small numbers and they are made in small numbers because they are expensive ; a classic catch - 22 situation .
The big car companies never wanted to engage in making electric vehicles in numbers sufficient to escape this problem : surely you heard the story of the ill fated EV1 , an electric car first created and then killed by General Motors .
The situation with prices may improve as electric cars gradually enter the market .
But , in a post peak world , cars may never be again the inexpensive commodity we have grown used to .
In a pre-peak situation , the common wisdom is that scrapping perfectly working cars for new ones is a good idea since , it is believed , it increases the GDP , creates jobs , etc .
But in a post - peak world , you ca n’t afford to throw away things that still work .
So , there comes the idea of retrofitting old cars : you change what you must ( the engine ) and keep what you can still use ( the body ) .
The job of retrofitting an old vehicle is relatively easy .
You get rid of the old engine and replace it with an electric one .
Coupling the new engine with the old transmission is not the optimum in terms of efficiency , but it is the easy way .
Lithium batteries wo n’t occupy much more space than the old fuel tank ; lead batteries are bulkier and will need more creative solutions , but it can be done .
Then you need a few more details : a voltage converter for powering the car ’s electric system ( lights and the rest ) and an inverter in order to be able to charge the batteries from an ordinary AC outlet .
The result is a vehicle that runs and is much more efficient than the old one .
It wo n’t be able to do the same things that a standard internal combustion engine or hybrid car can do ; it does n’t have the same speed , power or range .
But you have a form of transportation that can carry people where they need to go : commute in and out of town and carry goods from the supermarket to home .
Even more important than that , a battery retrofitted truck can still take food to a supermarket .
Also , a battery retrofitted ambulance can carry patients to the hospital ; all that even in the most difficult situation of fuel shortage .
Fig 3 . The electric engine of the little 500 .
It fits easily in the much larger space left by the old engine .
Note also the lack of fans and cooling .
The electric engine is so efficient that it does n’t need to be cooled .
We experimented with these ideas using an old Fiat 500 .
It is a car designed in the 1950s that belongs to the generation of the “ cars for the people , ” of which the Volkswagen “ Beetle ” is the best known example .
These cars were efficient , light , and inexpensive ; much different from the present generation of hormone fattened McCars .
The Fiat 500 , in particular , was a marvel of engineering .
Not much larger than a toy car , it could nevertheless carry four people .
It even had built - in air conditioned in the form of a foldable hardtop .
They do n’t make them any more , but there are still at least two hundred thousands Fiat 500 running in Italy .
Many are kept in tip - top shape by owners who are emotionally attached to their old “ cinquino ” ( “ the little five hundred ” in Italian ) but people also keep those cars because they are practical , inexpensive , and reliable .
You can still easily find spare parts and , if you are careful to keep the body from rusting , the 500 can keep running forever , or almost so .
So , we took the old Fiat 500 ( vintage 1970 ) which had belonged to Pietro Cambi ’s father .
We exchanged the old gasoline engine with an electric engine of the same power .
We replaced the fuel tank with a pack of lithium polymer batteries .
The whole operation took a few hours of work in a mechanical workshop .
The result is a car that reaches approximately the same top speed of the original one ( around 90 km / h ) .
The electric engine has a much higher torque at low speeds and therefore you do n’t need to use the transmission or the clutch pedal .
Theoretically , with all this torque available , you could turn the little 500 into a mini- dragster , but the axles would n’t survive for long .
So , the best way to drive it is gently .
If you do that , the car will run for a good 100 km before needing to be recharged .
If you consider that the battery pack contains about as much energy as a liter of gasoline , that gives you some idea on how much more efficient an electric engine is in comparison to an internal combustion one .
[ Ed : 100 km / l = 282 mpg ( Imperial ) , 235 mpg ( US ) ] .
Fig 4 .
The battery pack .
These lithium polymer batteries contain as much energy as about one liter of gasoline .
Nevertheless , the engine is so efficient that the car can run for 100 km , if driven gently .
Recharging the batteries of the 500 at a domestic outlet takes a few hours for a full recharge but , in normal use , you do n’t completely discharge the batteries , so that about one hour and a half is sufficient .
At the present prices of electricity in Italy , a complete recharge costs about Eur 1.2 .
Since we have a range of about 100 km , it follows that the cost per km of running the car is about 1/5 of what was the cost using gasoline .
We also have charged it using the energy produced by the PV panels on the roof of Ugo Bardi ’s home .
In that case the cost of the recharge is strictly zero .
Our idea with building this car was not just to have fun building a prototype ( well , that too ! ) , but to explore a solution for a low cost everyday transportation .
We think that what we did is already very promising .
The cost of the first prototype was relatively high ( more than 10,000 euros ) ; about the same cost of a small electric two seater bought new .
However , the main cost was that of the batteries , still in their early stage of commercialization .
In the future , we see costs going down with those of lithium batteries .
We think that a retrofitting kit for a small car could eventually cost as little as around Eur 6000 - 8000 ; much less than buying a new electric car .
A further advantage with a retrofitted car is that you know that spare parts for it will be available for a long time ; something that you ca n’t be sure about in the case of a new car built by a small producer .
In short , after this first prototype , we are already planning to make new ones .
The little retrofitted 500 is related to peak oil in more than one way .
One of these is in terms of image .
If you are involved with the peak oil movement , you are often accused of being a catastrophist interested only in seeing civilization collapse ; of wanting people to return to rural times , only travelling by riding donkeys or camels .
But the battery powered “ 500 ” is not a problem : it is a solution .
Not the only , and not even the best solution to the incoming oil crisis but , at least , something that shows a positive attitude .
And we seem to have been doing something right .
The retrofitted 500 has appeared in Italian newspapers and in the Italian TV .
We also exhibited it at motor fairs and public events .
When people ask us “ why did you do that ? ” we mention peak oil and we are bringing people ’s attention the concept much more effectively than if we were going around showing bell shaped curves .
That wo n’t change the world , but it is at least something .
Technical data
A little FAQ
Vehicle : FIAT 500 F , built in 1970 Engine : Separate excitation DC motor , 96 Volts .
Nominal power 10 kW.
Batteries : Li-Polymer : 26 elements .
Total energy stored 9.6 kWh ( the same as approx 1 liter of gasoline ) .
Weight : ca. 65 kgDC / DC converter 96/12 volts .
In principle , you can retrofit any vehicle but the best is to do it with light , compact models .
“ How much does it cost ? ”
The answer is “ it depends ” .
The main cost at present is in the lithium batteries , but if prices keep going down as they have been doing during the past few years , we estimate that soon a complete retrofitting kit would cost around Eur 6000 - 8000 .
“ Can I drive it on public roads ? ” Again , it depends .
We know that in Germany , Switzerland and in the USA it is easy to get a retrofitted car approved for road use .
In other countries , such as Italy , it is nearly impossible because of the bureaucracy involved ( ours runs on public roads because it is a prototype with a special permit ) .
In other countries , you have to check with the local authorities .
“ How about insurance ? ”
We found no problems in insuring the electric 500 for a reasonable price .
“ Does it need special facilities for recharging ? ”
No , you can recharge it with any domestic power outlet .
In some countries you can also use public recharging facilities along the road .
“ Is it safe ? ”
The retrofitted 500 does n’t have all the tricks that the last generation of cars have : airbags , reinforced body , etcetera .
It would n’t be safe to drive it on highways or at high speeds on any road .
But this not a car that is designed to go fast .
It is designed for urban or suburban transportation and , if you go slow , then it is safe .
“ How does it feel to drive it ? ” Like an ordinary car , but the only noise you hear is a soft humming and the engine has a higher torque at low speeds .
You still have the clutch pedal and the shift lever , but you do n’t need to use them , except for backing up .
“ How about maintenance ? ” Almost zero .
No oil to change , nothing to lubricate , no tune up needed .
Lithium polymer batteries should last thousands of recharging cycles , that is for more than 100.000 km .
An electric engine is normally supposed to run for the equivalent of a million kilometers .
The rest of the car will last as long as you ’ll take care that it does n’t rust .

Rising food prices could spark worldwide unrest and threaten political stability , the UN 's top humanitarian official warned yesterday after two days of rioting in Egypt over the doubling of prices of basic foods in a year and protests in other parts of the world .
Sir John Holmes , undersecretary general for humanitarian affairs and the UN 's emergency relief coordinator , told a conference in Dubai that escalating prices would trigger protests and riots in vulnerable nations .
He said food scarcity and soaring fuel prices would compound the damaging effects of global warming .
Prices have risen 40 % on average globally since last summer .
" The security implications [ of the food crisis ] should also not be underestimated as food riots are already being reported across the globe , " Holmes said .
" Current food price trends are likely to increase sharply both the incidence and depth of food insecurity . "
He added that the biggest challenge to humanitarian work is climate change , which has doubled the number of disasters from an average of 200 a year to 400 a year in the past two decades .
As well as this week 's violence in Egypt , the rising cost and scarcity of food has been blamed for :
· Riots in Haiti last week that killed four people
· Violent protests in Ivory Coast
· Price riots in Cameroon in February that left 40 people dead
· Heated demonstrations in Mauritania , Mozambique and Senegal
· Protests in Uzbekistan , Yemen , Bolivia and Indonesia
UN staff in Jordan also went on strike for a day this week to demand a pay rise in the face of a 50 % hike in prices , while Asian countries such as Cambodia , China , Vietnam , India and Pakistan have curbed rice exports to ensure supplies for their own residents .
Officials in the Philippines have warned that people hoarding rice could face economic sabotage charges .
A moratorium is being considered on converting agricultural land for housing or golf courses , while fast - food outlets are being pressed to offer half - portions of rice .
The UN Food and Agriculture Organisation says rice production should rise by 12 m tonnes , or 1.8 % , this year , which would help ease the pressure .
It expects " sizable " increases in all the major Asian rice producing countries , especially Bangladesh , China , India , Indonesia , Burma , the Philippines and Thailand .
Holmes is the latest senior figure to warn the world is facing a worsening food crisis .
Josette Sheeran , director of the UN World Food Programme , said last month : " We are seeing a new face of hunger .
We are seeing more urban hunger than ever before .
We are seeing food on the shelves but people being unable to afford it . "
The programme has launched an appeal to boost its aid budget from $ 2.9bn to $ 3.4bn ( £ 1.5 bn to £ 1.7 bn ) to meet higher prices , which officials say are jeopardising the programme 's ability to continue feeding 73 million people worldwide .
Robert Zoellick , president of the World Bank , said " many more people will suffer and starve " unless the US , Europe , Japan and other rich countries provide funds .
He said prices of all staple food had risen 80 % in three years , and that 33 countries faced unrest because of the price rises .
In the UK , Professor John Beddington , the new chief scientific adviser to the government , used his first speech last month to warn the effects of the food crisis would bite more quickly than climate change .
He said the agriculture industry needed to double its food production , using less water than today .
He said the prospect of food shortages over the next 20 years was so acute it had to be tackled immediately : " Climate change is a real issue and is rightly being dealt with by major global investment .
However , I am concerned there
is another major issue along a similar time - scale - that of food and energy security . "

Entanglement is the strange and beautiful property of certain quantum particles to become so deeply linked that they share the same existence .
According to quantum theory , that link should be maintained whatever the distance between the particles , whether the width of an atom or the diameter of the universe .
This led Einstein to claim that the instantaneous effects of entanglement would lead to “ spooky action - at - a - distance ” in violation of special relativity which prevents faster - than - light signals .
Nobody knows how the different predictions of relativity and quantum mechanics can be resolved .
However , entanglement has been measured in numerous experiments over relatively short distances on Earth .
The tests involve two entangled particles , photons say , being sent to distant experimenters who then perform measurements on them .
In every one of these tests , the results agree entirely with the predictions of quantum mechanics .
And yet naysayers continue to unearth loopholes that allow them to claim that there is a way in which the results are fixed , perhaps because quantum mechanics works only only over the short distances that can be exploited on Earth or by the existence some kind of hidden variable that determines in advance how the particles will behave when they are separated .
There is one way to settle the matter for sure : send entangled photons to two orbiting astronauts on board different spacecraft with large relative velocities .
That leaves no room for hidden variable theories or any other fix because the peculiarities of special relativity allow both astronauts to claim the measurement on their photon was performed before the other .
Today Anton Zeilinger from the University of Vienna in Austria , says he wants to try just such an experiment and has put together an impressive international team to design and promote idea .
The team has submitted its proposal , called Space - QUEST , to the European Space Agency in the hope that one end of the experiment could hosted on the Columbus module , Europe ’s orbiting laboratory attached to the International Space Station .
The other observer need only be on the ground since Zeilinger has already proven that single photons can be bounced off orbiting satellites and detected on the ground .
That should please mission planners for the International Space Station which has yet to host a single significant experiment in space .
Zeilinger ’s Space - QUEST experiment looks like a genuine attempt to push the envelope of physics .
The quicker they get it into orbit , the better .

Authorities can now put the brakes on terrorists who hijack New York buses .
Like something out of the movie “ Speed , ” a new GPS device enables authorities to remotely control a bus – slowing it down to 5 mph and preventing it from restarting once it has stopped .
The device has been installed on thousands of local commuter and tourist buses .
The technology is designed to prevent a terrorist from ramming a bus filled with people and explosives into buildings or tunnels .
Private bus companies have received millions of dollars from the Department of Homeland Security for the security systems .
It costs $ 1,500 to equip each bus , with $ 50 - per- bus monthly maintenance costs .
Gray Line double - decker tourist buses and Coach USA have spent hundreds of thousands of dollars in federal funds to install 3,000 devices .
After receiving a $ 124,000 federal grant , DeCamp Bus Lines is installing the device on its 80 commuter buses , which travel routes from northern New Jersey to the Port Authority Bus Terminal in Midtown .
New Jersey Transit is currently in the process of equipping all of its roughly 3,000 buses with the technology .
NJ Transit Chief of Police Joseph Bober said : “ This enhanced technology helps us protect our bus drivers and customers .
It ’s another proactive tool to protect our property , employees and customers . ”
But New York City Transit is not using the technology .
“ This system requires GPS , and right now , our GPS program is in the pilot stage , with 155 buses being tested out of a fleet of 4,500 , ” spokesman Charles Seaton said .
A Pennsylvania manufacturer , Saucon TDS , makes the device .
In an emergency , a bus driver can hit a panic button installed next to the steering wheel .
That distress call is sent by satellite to the bus company and the command center at Saucon TDS .
A GPS device attached to the bus computer system allows a dispatcher to pinpoint the location of the bus and identify its speed and direction .
Protocol calls for the dispatcher to contact law enforcement and act under its supervision before taking action .
Through the computer hookup , the dispatcher can slow the bus and block it from being restarted , allowing cops to catch up and intervene .
“ If we just stop the bus suddenly , maybe he sets off a bomb and kills 50 people , ” said Gary Pard , DeCamp ’s vice president of operations .
“ It ’s our objective to give a terrorist time to rethink their position . ”
“ Hopefully , we ’ll never have to use it . ”

Expect the Senate to take up the bad House FISA bill on Wednesday .
Whatever lipstick Nancy Pelosi and Steny Hoyer tried to put on this pig , it 's still a bad bill .
While it might be better than the Rockefeller / Cheney bill the Senate tried to ram through , " better " does n't mean " good . "
That provided a fig leaf for 105 Democrats in the House of Representatives last week , but we should make it absolutely clear to our Senators that that argument carries very little credibility .
Russ Feingold provides a quick , non-legalistic summary of the bill -- including it 's very few good points -- showing just that in this fact sheet from Sen.
Feingold .
In synopsis :
On retroactive immunity , the bill virtually guarantees it , despite the fig - leaf of a district court review .
In their infinite wisdom , Hoyer and the negotiators set the bill to sunset in the fall of 2012 -- just before the next presidential election .
This bad bill should not be in effect for that long , and should n't be subject to election year politics , again .
The protections against reverse targeting are inadequte -- the guidelines for targeting someone in the U.S. are not subject to judicial review , or the requirement of a court order for that surveillance .
The bill does n't prohibit bulk collection --" the collection of all international communications into and out of the U.S. to a whole continent or even the entire world . "
The bill contains a far too broad " exigency " exception to the idea of FISC exclusivity -- the Attorney General or DNI can certify that they do n't have time to get a court order .
Even if the FISC determines after that fact that the surveillance violated the law , the government can still keep and use any of the information it obtains under those illegal warrants .
The bill does n't provide additional checks and balances for Americans at home whose international communications are obtained because they are communicating with someone overseas .
Note that most of these provisions had passed the Judiciary committee and received majority support in the Democratic caucus - - majority support obviously meant little to Hoyer / Rockefeller and the other Dem negotiators on the House bill .
Nor did the work of the Judiciary Committees who were either shut out of the negotiations or did n't work hard enough to be included in them .
That means Leahy and the members of the Judiciary Committee should have a vested interest in seeing this bill fail .
To that end , here 's Christy at FDL :
The objective is to strip immunity from the bill .
We need to figure out a way to make that happen before leadership caves on this altogether .
Sen .
Feingold 's office has put up a handy fact sheet on the problems with the bill [ see my link above ] .
One way to push on this is to flood the offices of Senators with calls and FAXes telling them to do just that .
If they do n't hear from you , then they wo n't know you are pissed -- so let 's get to work ...
Toll - free numbers for Congress from Katymine : 1 ( 800 ) 828 - 0498
1 ( 800 ) 459 - 1887
1 ( 800 ) 614 - 2803
1 ( 866 ) 340 - 9281
1 ( 866 ) 338 - 1015
1 ( 877 ) 851 - 6437 Several Senators could use extra contact on this -- uncommitted or wavering Democrats , leadership folks , members of the Gang of 14 , and a number of wavering Republicans .
Tell them no telecom immunity -- period .
It is well past time that respect for the rule of law and the role of Congress in the balance of powers was restored .... [ See that list below the fold ]
In addition to the list that Christy provides ( below the fold ) , there are some Dems who are with us but who need to know that we 'll have their back if they make this a fight .
That includes Dodd and Feingold and those Senators who worked with Dodd to keep the bill from passing last December .

The Not -So -Fertile Crescent Climate Change Threatens Cradle of Civilization
The Middle East 's famous Fertile Crescent was the birthplace of agriculture , the first settlements and civilization .
But a new study shows that climate change will dry up the area 's rivers and destroy its agriculture -- with devasting effects for the region .

Pharmacists are integral members of the health care team in the US .
The profession is composed of highly - educated , well - trained health - care providers .
Pharmacists promote themselves as “ drug experts ” for good reason : the four - years of education required to obtain the Doctor of Pharmacy ( PharmD ) degree encompasses the etiology , pathophysiology , clinical manifestations , prevention , and management of human disease states .
Pharmacists study the clinical application of pharmacology , biopharmaceutics , pharmacokinetics , therapeutics , adverse drug reactions , laboratory data , and drug information to the management of disease states .
This training enables pharmacists to identify and prevent drug interactions , plan patient evaluation of drug- related problems and recommend changes in pharmaceutical care plans , and evaluate and interpret pharmaceutical data .
Still , these drug experts are not granted prescriptive authority under state or federal laws .
Of course , physicians , osteopaths , dentists , and veterinarians have long - standing authority and experience in writing medication orders and prescriptions .
In most states , these practitioners are granted full prescribing rights to any medication available , whether or not it falls within the scope of his or her practice .
Each state governs its own laws regarding the prescriptive authority of more specialized practitioners , including podiatrists , nurse practitioners , and physician assistants .
In some states , these practitioners have broad prescribing powers , while other states limit the type or schedule of medication allowed to be prescribed , or require strict collaborative practice agreements with physicians .
Yet , almost no state allows pharmacists to prescribe or manage medication therapy outside the strict bounds of tightly controlled protocols for relatively routine medications .
Nurse practitioners and physician assistants have fought long legal battles to change the regulations governing their practice and their prescriptive authority .
As more legislation is poised to expand their role further in many states , these groups are exploring the opportunity for almost completely autonomous practice .
These groups focus on education and training as part of their battle for professional independence , and do not take their prescriptive authority lightly .
These practitioners emphasize the need for continued education as part of their expanding role , and it has paid off , as patients accept their role as prescribers freely and believe the practitioners are knowledgeable about medications .
Still , pharmacists are the profession with the most education and experience in drug therapy .
Expanded prescriptive authority for pharmacists would have benefits in cost and safety for the public .
Pharmacists already govern the dispensing of some medications in a quasi - prescriptive role .
Such “ behind the counter ” medications require pharmacists to consult with patients prior to the sale of medications that do not require a prescription , but do necessitate some level of supervision by a health care provider .
The pharmacist is required to assess a patient for medical history , current medications , and drug allergies before dispensing the medication .
Many professional groups advocate for an expanded “ pharmacist - only ” class of over - the - counter medications to increase the public ’s access to medications .
Several studies have shown positive outcomes when pharmacists are directly involved in the prescribing , dispensing , and managing patients ’ medication therapies .
Many test cases have allowed pharmacists to independently manage therapy for diabetes , and overall improvement in patient ’s glycemic control was seen when pharmacists were afforded prescriptive authority .
Further , a reduction in costs and use of health care resources was seen , since diabetes - related complications were diminished .
Favorable outcomes were also achieved when pharmacists took a lead role in the prescription and management of medications to treat chronic pain patients .
The patients were effectively treated and costs were reduced when pharmacists were allowed prescriptive authority .
Barriers do exist to pharmacists ’ prescriptive authority .
Among the most significant include workload and time demands , particularly in today ’s busy community pharmacy settings .
A busy pharmacy counter or drive - through does not provide a safe or appropriate arena for discussing medication management .
Further , most insurance providers do not compensate pharmacists for providing any sort of medication management service and providing clinical care is expensive .
However , the expanding clinical role of pharmacists in hospital , long term care , and outpatient settings increase the opportunity for medication therapy management programs in which pharmacists are integral providers of effective health care .
Even in a community pharmacy , pharmacists are accessible to the public and they are poised to assess and counsel patients more easily than any other health care provider .
Pharmacists are well - trained and well - educated medical professionals with richly - developed clinical judgment and scientific skills that are unparalleled by any other medical profession .
Pharmacists need to fulfill their potential as drug experts and increase the value and access of quality health care to the public .
The profession of pharmacy — and the public — should challenge the notion that pharmacists merely count pills and demand that they be directly involved in the prescription and management of medication therapy .

Dear Emily ,
It 's starting to become clear to me that you have no intention of writing back .
At first I thought it was because you were shy , and did n't know what to say in your letters , which is why I ended the last one with a question designed to begin a dialogue ( " Do you like dogs ? " ) .
However , now I 'm beginning to think you just do n't want to communicate .
Maybe you told your husband that HE was the first guy who ever fingered you , and these letters are a painful reminder of the lie you are living .
If that 's the case , I DEFINITELY understand .
I was once in similar position with a girl who wanted to put something ( a small jar of martini olives ) up my ass .
Of course , I told her she was the first .
But believe me when I tell you , she was FAR from the first .
I lost touch with that girl a long time ago , but if she were to write to me today , I think I would at least have the courtesy to write her back .
I hope you die .
Michael Ian Black P.S.
If you do die , I 'm going to go to the funeral and finger your corpse .

Counterculture icon Emily
The Strange is headed to the big screen with her four mysterious cats .
Dark Horse Comics , which has published several comic books detailing the goth teen 's exploits , will produce a feature film that will detail her origins .
Skateboarder Rob Reger created the character among a multitude of designs he was printing up for stickers , T - shirts and skateboards in Santa Cruz , California , in the early 1990s .
The ' Emily ' design took off and Reger 's company , Cosmic Debris , went on to become a multi-million dollar business with toeholds in fashion , books , comics , toys , school supplies and accessories .
Reger has remained the creative director behind the character and is one of several artists who work on Emily .
The film will be produced by Mike Richardson , the founder of Oregon - based Dark Horse .
The project is not yet set - up at a studio , though Universal is a contender as Dark Horse has a first - look deal there .
" Emily herself is very appealing little girl , there 's an edge to her , " Richardson said .
" There is something very alluring to her image , people see it and respond to it immediately . "
Richardson - who has been a producer on such films as Hellboy and its upcoming sequel , as well as 30 Days Of Night - says he and Reger will be looking for a filmmaker who " gets the character . "
The filmmaker choice may in turn dictate what format will serve the story best - live - action , animation or a combination of the two .
The storyline is being kept under wraps , though Reger , who concocted it , says it will offer up some back story and will feature Emily 's four cats - troublemaker Sabbath , schemer Nee - Chee , imaginative Miles and leader Mystery .
It will also have 13 new characters with names like Earwig , Umlaut , McFreeley and Officer Summers .
The story forms the basis of an Emily young adult novel , which will be published next year by HarperCollins .

WASHINGTON  Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton was gracious in her full - throated endorsement of Senator Barack Obama .
But that does not mean all is forgiven by others in the Clinton universe .
For proof , look no further than Doug Band , chief gatekeeper to former President Bill Clinton .
Mr. Band keeps close track of the past allies and beneficiaries of the Clintons who supported Mr. Obama ’s campaign , three Clinton associates and campaign officials said .
Indeed , he is widely known as a member of the Clinton inner circle whose memory is particularly acute on the matter of who has been there for the couple  and who has not .
“ The Clintons get hundreds of requests for favors every week , ” said Terry McAuliffe , the chairman of Mrs. Clinton ’s presidential campaign .
“ Clearly , the people you ’re going to do stuff for in the future are the people who have been there for you . ”
Mr. McAuliffe , who knows of Mr. Band ’s diligent scorekeeping , emphasized that “ revenge is not what the Clintons are about . ”
The accounting is more about being practical , he said , adding , “ You have to keep track of this . ”
He and his team are trying to determine whether there has been a secular change in the global economy because of pressure from the economic rise of China and India .
If so , stocks that look expensive by traditional measures may still be relatively inexpensive , he says .
“ I do n’t know what the answer is , but we should find it out within very short order because the global economy is clearly slowing , ” he says .
“ Usually that leads to a drop - off in demand for stuff : oil and stuff like that , so those prices should begin to come down . ”
Still , broader diversification does not really appeal to him .
“ I have never found it a useful policy because what it guarantees is that you will be in the worst sectors of the market as a matter of policy , ” he said .
“ That is why so many managers are justly criticized as closet indexers because they do n’t get too far away from the index because they are afraid to be wrong .
My view is that being wrong is part of the business .
You need to focus on making the best investments you can , instead of trying to smooth things out . ”
IN the meantime , Mr. Miller is clear - eyed about some errors in judgment , particularly those that resulted in overexposure to the housing and financial sectors .
For example , Legg Mason began buying Countrywide in 2004 , when the stock was in the $ 20s .
“ We said : O.K. , the Fed is raising interest rates .
That is bad for housing , ” he recalled .
“ We studied housing stocks in other countries .
We looked at the U.K. experience , the Scandinavian experience , places where governments had raised interest rates .
And the answer was that stocks underperformed for about a year and then outperformed . ”
What Mr. Miller missed , he acknowledges , was that lending standards had become much more relaxed in the United States than they were in other countries .
As for Bear Stearns , he views its demise as a classic run on the bank .
While some investors consider Wall Street firms to be inscrutable black boxes , Mr. Miller takes a wider view .
“ To a certain extent almost every company is a black box , ” he says .
“ How many people know what is going on inside General Electric ?
As of March 14 , Jeffrey Immelt did not even know what was going on , ” he adds , referring to a Webcast in which Mr. Immelt , G.E. ’s chief executive , was optimistic about the company ’s performance a month before it reported disappointing quarterly earnings .
WASHINGTON ( AP ) 
The cost of mailing a letter goes up a penny to 42 cents on Monday , the latest in what are expected to be annual price adjustments by the Postal Service .
A new law regulating the post office makes it easier to raise rates as long as the agency does n't exceed the rate of inflation .
Rates are to be adjusted each May .
But the post office also has introduced a way for people to save money when the price goes up , the Forever stamp , which remains valid for first - class postage regardless of any increases .
With the rate increase approaching , sales of the Forever stamp reached 64 million - a- day in April , postal officials said .
Forever stamps currently sell for 41 - cents , but can be used after the rate increase without any additional postage .
However , when the rate goes up , so does the price of Forever stamps .
Unlike the Forever stamps , other 41 - cent stamps will require additional postage under the new rates , and postal officials said they printed an additional 1.5 billion 1 - cent stamps in anticipation of the demand .
Also , for the first time the agency has stamps available at the new rate before the change takes effect .
A set of five 42 - cent stamps honoring pioneering journalists went on sale in April , as did a set of four stamps featuring the American flag flying at different times of day .
A 42 - cent stamp featuring singer and actor Frank Sinatra will be released Tuesday .
The increase comes just a week after the post office announced it had a loss of $ 700 million in the second quarter of the fiscal year , blamed largely on declining mail volume and rising fuel prices .
While the charge for the first ounce of a first - class letter rises to 42 cents , the price of each added ounce will remain 17 cents , so a two - ounce letter will go up a penny to 59 cents .
The cost to mail a post card will also go up a penny , to 27 cents .
Other rates set for Monday : • Large envelope , 2 ounces , $ 1 , up 3 cents .
• Money Orders up to $ 500 , $ 1.05 , unchanged .
• Certified mail , $ 2.70 , up 5 cents .
• First - class international letter to Canada or Mexico , 72 cents , up 3 cents .
• First - class international letter to other countries , 94 cents , up 4 cents .
• Priority mail flat - rate envelope , $ 4.75 , up 25 cents .
•
Express mail flat - rate envelope , $ 16.50 , up 25 cents .
But , the Postal Service said that overall prices for Express Mail , its overnight service , will be lower at the weights and in the delivery zones used by most customers .
And Express mail and Priority mail customers can save money simply buying postage online , the agency said .
Express mail customers will receive 3 % off the published retail prices and Priority mail customers will save an average 3.5 % .
In Los Angeles , Stamps.com said it has released new software which will include discounts on Express and Priority mail for customers buying postage through its Internet site , targeted to small business and home offices .
Postage rates last went up in May 2007 , with a first - class stamp jumping 2 cents to the current 41 - cent rate .
That change came under the old law governing the post office , while the current boost uses the simpler procedures of the new one .

Henry T. Nicholas III , the flamboyant co-founder and former chief executive of the chip maker Broadcom , was indicted Thursday in California on fraud , conspiracy and drug charges , including allegations that he spiked the drinks of other executives with ecstasy .
One indictment said he also maintained several residences that were used to distribute and sell drugs , including cocaine and methamphetamine , and threatened to kill people if they talked about his activities .
A second indictment filed in the Federal District Court in Santa Ana , Calif. , and also unsealed Thursday , charged Mr. Nicholas and William Ruehle , the former chief financial officer of Broadcom , of improperly backdating stock options , forcing Broadcom to take a $ 2.2 billion write - down .
Lawyers for both men said they were innocent of all charges .
Mr. Nicholas , 48 , is a colorful character who , along with his former college professor , Henry Samueli , became a billionaire when he smartly timed the industry ’s need for silicon chips that send voice and data over cable lines .
The aviation industry 's failure to curb its soaring carbon emissions could lead to the " worst case scenario " for climate change , as envisaged by the United Nations .
An unpublished study by the world 's leading experts has revealed that airlines are pumping 20 per cent more carbon dioxide into the atmosphere than estimates suggest , with total emissions set to reach between 1.2 billion and 1.5 billion tonnes annually by 2025 .
! ADVERTISEMENT !
The report , by four government - funded research bodies , is one of the most authoritative estimates of the growth of pollutants produced by the industry .
It was presented to a conference co-organised by the United States ' Federal Aviation Authority but not given a wider audience .
Combining data produced by the leading emissions - modelling laboratories in the US , Britain and France , the study found that the number of people seriously affected by aircraft noise will rise from 24 million in 2000 to 30.3 million by 2025 , despite the introduction of quieter jets , and that the amount of nitrogen oxides around airports , produced by aircraft engines , will rise from 2.5 million tonnes in 2000 to 6.1 million tonnes in 2025 .
Jeff Gazzard , a spokesman for the Aviation Environment Federation , the group that uncovered the report , said : " Growth of CO2 emissions on this scale will comfortably outstrip any gains made by improved technology and ensure aviation is an even larger contributor to global warming by 2025 than previously thought .
Governments must take action to put a cap on air transport 's unrestrained growth . "
The report , Trends in Global Noise and Emissions From Commercial Aviation for 2000 through 2025 , was presented last year to the USA / Europe Air Traffic Management Seminar in Barcelona but withheld from wider publication .
Its authors at the US Department of Transport , the European air traffic management body , Eurocontrol , Manchester Metropolitan University and the technology company QinetiQ predict that CO2 will rise from its current level of 670 million tonnes to up to 1.48 billion tonnes by 2025 .
This exceeds the previous estimate , made in 2004 , of 1.03 billion tonnes by 2025 .
The growth in aviation CO2 means that the highest forecast for aviation emissions produced by the International Panel on Climate Change will be met or exceeded .
The aviation industry , which is exempt from the Kyoto protocol on reducing greenhouse gases , claims the introduction new technology over the next 25 years means that the contribution of flying to global CO2 emissions will rise from 2 per cent of the total to 5 per cent by 2050 .
Critics claim the true figure will be much higher because it does not include the CO2 reductions being made elsewhere .
The International Air Transport Association , which represents 240 airlines , said it was working towards producing binding targets to reduce CO2 emissions .
" With fuel costs doubling in the last year , airlines already have an incentive to work towards greater efficiency , " a spokesman said .
" There has been a 70 per cent improvement in fuel efficiency in the last four decades .
Aviation is a benchmark of environmental responsibility for others to follow . "

Ernest Hemingway ’s Top 9 Words of Wisdom
“ The world is a fine place and worth the fighting for and I hate very much to leave it . ”
As you probably know Ernest Hemingway was a writer , journalist and Nobel Prize Winner .
Some of his most famous stories include “ The Old Man and The Sea ” and “ The Sun Also Rises ” .
He also participated in both World Wars and worked as a correspondent during for instance the Spanish Civil War .
Now , here are 9 of my favourite words of wisdom from Ernest Hemingway .
1. Listen .
“ I like to listen .
I have learned a great deal from listening carefully .
Most people never listen . ” 
Learning to really listen to someone rather just waiting for our turn to talk can be a difficult skill to develop .
Often we may have much on our mind that we want to say and so listening falls by the wayside .
How can you become a better listener ?
Here are three tips :
Forget about yourself .
Focus your attention outward instead of inward in a conversation .
Place the mental focus on the person you are talking and listening to instead of yourself .
Placing the focus outside of yourself makes you less self - centred and your need to hog the spotlight decreases .
Focus your attention outward instead of inward in a conversation .
Place the mental focus on the person you are talking and listening to instead of yourself .
Placing the focus outside of yourself makes you less self - centred and your need to hog the spotlight decreases .
Stay present .
This will help you to decrease the bad habit of thinking about the future and what you should say next while trying to listen .
If you are present and really there while listening then that will also come through in your body language , which gives the person talking a vibe and feeling that you are really listening to what s/he has to say .
This will help you to decrease the bad habit of thinking about the future and what you should say next while trying to listen .
If you are present and really there while listening then that will also come through in your body language , which gives the person talking a vibe and feeling that you are really listening to what s/he has to say .
Be open .
Keep your mind open to the possibility that whatever the person is about to say will actually be interesting .
If you have already made up your mind that he or she will say something boring then it will be hard to pay attention .
Also , if you really listen then that alone will often provide you naturally with a better and more genuine answer than the clever response thought up while trying to listen simultaneously .
2 . Take the first step .
“ The best way to find out if you can trust somebody is to trust them . ”
The thing is if two people or more are waiting for someone else to take the first step then that step may never be taken .
Or you may at least have to wait for a very long time .
If you after some time realize that , like in this example , you could n’t trust the person then at least you have learned that .
By not taking the first step you ’ll perhaps never know .
So instead of waiting around and trying to figure things out just take first steps of different kinds in interactions .
Be proactive .
3 . Keep your eyes on where you are going .
“ Never mistake motion for action . ” 
It ’s very easy to get lost in busy work .
You may spend much time in your in - box or filing and organizing things .
But at the end of the day or week , what have you accomplished ?
Just because you ’re moving does n’t mean that you are moving in the direction you really want to go .
To do that you have to do the things that you know are really important and in alignment with your goals .
And not getting lost in busy work .
So , improve your effectiveness and productivity .
But , more importantly , never lose your view of your big picture .
And take the action and do the things you need to do to get yourself where you want to go .
4. Just do .
“ The shortest answer is doing the thing . ”
How do you get things done ?
You take action and do them .
You may need to do some planning , but do n’t get lost in that stage or in over thinking things .
Planning or thinking wo n’t get you any results in real - life if you do n’t take action too .
So take action and just try something .
Maybe you ’ll succeed .
Maybe you ’ll fail , but if you do then failure can always teach you a bunch of things .
The worst thing is not failure , it ’s to just sit on your hands and do nothing .
Developing a “ just do it ” habit – where you learn to do what you know you want to do despite how you feel or what your thoughts are telling you at the moment – can be difficult .
But it ’s rewarding not only because you ’ll get actual results and – sooner or later – success .
It also builds real confidence in yourself , in your capabilities and in your own personal power to achieve what you want in life .
5. Do. Fail . Learn .
Do .
“ The first draft of anything is shit . ”
So you have to keep your eyes on where you are going and do the right things to get yourself there .
However , you will not always get what you want on your first try .
No worries though , if you have the right attitude .
What attitude is that ?
The attitude of the much younger you .
The kid who learned to walk and ride a bike .
A younger you that does n’t put so much value into a failure .
But instead just gets up after falling down , learns a lesson or two from what happened and then tries again .
And again .
By cultivating that way of thinking about failure – instead of the more usual , more grown up one where you may think that the world will come to an end just because you failed – you can over time achieve some pretty awesome things .
6 . Find strength through your tough times .
“ The world breaks everyone , and afterward , some are strong at the broken places . ”
This is a really interesting point .
Because it ’s really easy to let yourself fall into a frame of mind where you think that no - one has had it worse than you and that this and this happened and that ’s why you are like you are .
And of course , some people have had a much worse time than others .
But I think it ’s easy to let yourself fall into a kind of victim thinking where you let your troubles in the past act as reasons why you ca n’t do something now .
But one must remember : that is the past .
And people ’s problems are rarely as unique as we may think .
Everyone has had bad stuff happen to them .
People may not talk about it and you may assume that it ’s just you that has have these bad experiences .
But as Hemingway says , everyone has been broken in a kind of way throughout their life .
It ’s kinda unavoidable .
But the question is what you do now .
Do you let those old things hold you back and allow them help the ego to build an even stronger victim identity ?
Or can you let them go and live in the present – as the person you are now rather than who you were – with plans for the future ?
Everyone has to handle such a thing in their own way .
But it is up to just one person to decide on how handle it .
And that ’s you .
7 . Do n’t get hung up on the small things in life .
“ The man who has begun to live more seriously within begins to live more simply without . ” 
When you start to take life more seriously you may realize that you can let a whole lot of things just go .
You do n’t have the patience , time or energy to worry about the small and petty things anymore .
You do n’t get wrapped up in things that are totally unimportant .
You start simplifying your life because you realize that your time is n’t unlimited .
You remove a lot of the less important things to have more time and energy for the really exciting and important stuff .
Have a look at what ’s really important in your life .
If you are unsure about if it ’s really important , try asking yourself :
Will this matter 5 years from now ?
Then simplify , simplify , simplify .
You may be surprised at how much kinda unimportant important stuff that there is in your mind and life .
You may also feel lighter after having done some decluttering because you are no longer bogged down by boatloads of stuff that you have now realized is pretty irrelevant .
8 . Do n’t let your imagination hold you back .
“ Cowardice … is almost always simply a lack of ability to suspend the functioning of the imagination . ”
Your imagination can really play tricks on you .
By thinking about something over and over you and your imagination can come up the most elaborate and horrifying ways things can go wrong .
But if / when you finally take action and do what you wanted to do it may be a little anticlimactic .
Even if you fail and things do n’t work out the way you hoped for you may think to yourself :
Is this it ?!
There are no monsters under your bed .
And the monsters and disaster scenarios you construct in your mind rarely come into life .
Now , some situations may actually be quite scary and create a lot of pressure within .
The best way that I have found to deal with those situations is to reconnect with the present .
When you are present you are just focused on what is happening right now .
As Hemingway says , you are suspending the functioning of your imagination because your mind is no longer lost in possible future scenarios .

The Power of Now and A New Earth plus this article of mine for tips on how develop the habit of being able to step into the now .
It can allow you to find a stillness and peace within despite calamity outside of you .
9 . Do n’t judge .
“ The writer ’s job is not to judge , but to seek to understand . ”
I think this is not just a great piece of advice for writers but for anyone really .
Seeking to understand rather than judging is hard but is something that can help you and the people around you a great deal .
And this also goes back to the first tip , the one about listening .
To be a good listener you must have the intent to understand the other person rather than judging him / her .
Instead of going into interactions or just life with a bunch of judgments that you apply on everything and everyone try acceptance .
This is not easy if you are used to making judgments about everything .
And the thing is , by making a judgment you can often strengthen you ego .
You get a small ego boost and you feel good for a while .
But just like with caffeine this wears off pretty quickly and you soon need to judge again to feel good .
Accepting may not feel so appealing or “ normal ” but I have found that when I just accept things I feel a relief and stillness inside .
You just feel good .
I ’m still working on this though .
Accepting someone ’s opinion does n’t mean that you surrender and let them “ win ” .
Nor does it mean that you need to just sit back and cannot take any action .
You can accept and still take action to change something if that is what you ’d like to do .
Accepting just means that you let that person think and feels as s/he likes without judging it .
When you just accept and let your judgments rest it ’s easier to really understand each other and connect .
US crude oil rose $ 5.50 to $ 140.05 a barrel in New York on Thursday afternoon , passing the record of $ 139.89 a barrel reached on June 16 .
Earlier , Chakib Khelil , president of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries ( Opec ) , had said oil prices could rise as high as $ 170 a barrel this year before declining later in the year .
Oil prices also rose on the London markets on Thursday , with crude oil rising $ 5.33 to $ 139.66 a barrel .
US stocks were down more than 350 points on Thursday following the news , with the Dow Jones Industrial Average closing at 11,457.41 , its lowest level in two years
The fourth time was the charm apparently .
After having her first three complaints rejected by the judge presiding over the case , former RIAA defendant Tanya Andersen 's fourth complaint in her malicious prosecution lawsuit has been green - lighted by the judge .
The defendants have just filed their replies to the fourth amended complaint , and , as expected , they paint quite a different picture than does Andersen .
The RIAA and record companies associated with the original Atlantic v. Andersen case filed a 19 - page response , while MediaSentry 's parent SafeNet filed a nine - page reply .
In it , the defendants categorically deny all of Andersen 's accusations and ask for the judge to dismiss the lawsuit and award them costs and attorneys ' fees .
The RIAA also says that Andersen 's attempts to turn the case into a class- action are " inappropriate , " arguing that the " factual issues " raised are " wholly unique " to the lawsuit .
In her complaint , Andersen accused the RIAA and record labels of a number of misdeeds .
Those include civil conspiracy , malicious prosecution , abuse of the legal process , and negligence .
Not so , says the RIAA , which denies being responsible for some of the more troubling aspects of the case against Andersen .
One such event was a phone call to then - eight - year - old Kylee Andersen 's school by someone purporting to be her grandmother , made in an attempt to speak to her directly about the file - sharing allegations .
The RIAA denies " Plaintiff ’s false suggestion that they had anything to do with the alleged phone call in which someone purportedly claimed to be Kylee ’s grandmother , if any such phone call actually occurred . "
Andersen has fingered a 30 - year - old Washington man who had used the " gotenkito " handle online as the person behind the account that led to the RIAA 's original lawsuit .
She said she provided his name and address to the RIAA , an allegation the RIAA denies .
All the labels say is that they " had knowledge " of someone using that nickname on " a single web site . "
They specifically deny that Andersen passed on contact information to them .
The RIAA also denies refusing to pass on the results of the forensic examination of Andersen 's hard drive to her .
SafeNet 's response contains a similar string of denials .
The company , which recently removed all references to the investigative services it performs from its web site , admits to not having an Oregon state private investigator 's license .
It also admits to having received a cease - and - desist letter from the Massachusetts State Police regarding some of its activities in that state .
The RIAA believes the licensing issue is irrelevant , saying that Andersen " cannot demonstrate that the investigator licensure statute will support a negligence per seclaim against MediaSentry . "
There 's nothing really unexpected in the RIAA 's response .
But after covering the RIAA 's legal campaign against P2P users for a few years , it 's very odd seeing the record labels on the wrong end of a lawsuit , denying claims of wrongdoing .
With both the complaint and responses filed , the stage should be set for discovery to begin .
Lory Lybeck , Andersen 's attorney , has pledged to use the discovery process to have a look inside the " zone of secrecy " he says the RIAA has been operating in since the inception of its campaign .

Buffett also told CNBC's Becky Quick that while stocks are " not cheap " now , they 're not extreme , either .
He says he 's waiting for when stocks become " very cheap . "
He does , however , " find more things to look at now than I did six months or a year ago . "
The best opportunities he sees right now are in bonds rather than stocks .
Buffett says his offer to guarantee $ 800 billion dollars in municipal bonds now backed by Ambac , MBIA and FGIC is " not on the table " any longer .
" We tossed our hat into the ring , and they tossed it right back . "
The big bond insurers soundly rejected the offer Buffett made first made public last month on Squawk Box , saying their prospects would be severly damaged if Buffett took over the relatively solid muni bond guarantees , while not also backing the other very risky investments that threaten the bond insurers ' financial footing .
Berkshire created its own bond insurance subsidiary late last year .
In response to an email question about why his annual letter to shareholders does n't mention the bond insurance business , Buffett said he had already written the letter before getting into bond insurance .
He expects to have something to say about it at Berkshire 's annual meeting in early May .
In his letter to Berkshire shareholders on Friday , Buffett said he had identified four people who could take over making Berkshire 's investment decisions , should he reluctantly give up that role .
Today he told Becky that none of those candidates are female , in part because not many women expressed interest in the job .
Buffett 's current role will be broken apart when he leaves Berkshire .
The company had already identified candidates for Buffett 's CEO role .
Buffett predicted that while agricultural commodities may not continue to rise , the price of oil will probably go higher because he sees supply as essentially finite while consumption continually grows .
While alternative energy efforts will help , he says they are not the " big answer . "
A growing number of privacy and civil rights advocates are calling on a federal court to reconsider its decision two weeks ago ordering the controversial Wikileaks.org whistleblower Web site to be disabled .
In a motion filed Wednesday in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California , the Electronic Frontier Foundation , the American Civil Liberties Union , the Project on Government Oversight ( POGO ) and a Wikileaks user asked the court for permission to intervene in the case .
In a 20 - page brief , the groups said they were asking to intervene in a bid asking the court to dissolve its permanent injunction disabling the Wikileaks.org Web site .
They claimed that the court 's action violated their First Amendment right to access the contents of the Wikileaks Web site .
" The First Amendment encompasses the right to receive information and ideas , " the groups said in the brief .
" The documents and materials posted on the Wikileaks website concern matters of great public interest " which each of the parties filing the motion had regularly accessed , they said .
Expressing similar support was Harvard Law School 's Berkman Center for Internet & Society 's Citizen Media Law Project ( CMLP ) .
On Wednesday the center filed a brief opposing the court 's injunctions against Wikileaks and its domain registrar Dynadot LLC .
The amici curiae ( friend of the court ) brief , which was developed in collaboration with several media and public interest organizations , asked the court to take back its decision and cited First Amendment concerns .
" Under established First Amendment law , prior restraints , if constitutional at all , are permissible only in the most extraordinary circumstances , " David Ardia , director of the CMLP said in a statement .
" In this case , you have court orders that effectively shut down a website that has been at the forefront of exposing corruption in governments and corporations around the world , " he said .
The groundswell of support for Wikileaks comes in the wake of two injunctions issued by U.S. District Court Judge Jeffrey White on Feb 15 .
The injunctions were in response to a lawsuit filed by the Julius Baer Group , a Swiss bank that , according to documents on Wikileaks , was involved in offshore money laundering and tax evasion in the Cayman Islands for customers in several countries , including the U.S .
Wikileaks claimed the documents had been leaked by a bank employee .
In its complaint , the Swiss bank claimed that Wikileaks published hundreds of illegally obtained documents and confidential and copyrighted information belonging to the bank .
The bank sued both Wikileaks and its domain registrar Dynadot .
In response , White issued a permanent injunction ordering Dynadot to immediately disable the wikileaks.org domain name and lock it to prevent the domain from being transferred to another registrar .
The injunction also required Dynadot to immediately remove all DNS hosting records for the wikileaks.org domain name .
The court asked Dynadot to prevent the domain name from resolving to the wikileaks
Web site or any other Web site or server " other than a blank park page . "
The judge also issued a temporary restraining order that forbade Wikileaks from displaying , posting , publishing or distributing any material pertaining to the bank on any site that it directly owned or over which it had any control .
The order instructed Wikileaks to ensure that all of the bank 's information was removed from all Web sites it owned or controlled , to disable links to the material on such sites and to provide the court with proof that it had complied with the orders .
The judge 's order even enjoined everyone who read the order or received notice of it from publishing or even linking to the documents .
The rulings drew scathing criticism from privacy and civil rights groups who saw it as an unprecedented violation of First Amendment rights .
Several felt the court had overreacted in ordering the entire domain shut down , just because a relatively small number of documents it hosted were being disputed .
This week 's friends - of - the - court briefs and the move to intervene by the EFF and the ACLU have been the most visible manifestations of that concern .
Matt Zimmerman , senior staff attorney at the EFF said his organization decided to file a motion to intervene because the case raises several troubling issues .
For instance , the Swiss bank 's strategy of getting Dynadot to disable the Wikileaks domain and the court 's endorsement of that tactic could set a dangerous precedent if allowed to stand , he said .
" The strategy of going after the registrar is an attempt in a collateral way to get at the remedy , " he said .
" It should n't be a remedy that plaintiffs think is acceptable or that the courts think is acceptable .
It 's overkill to say the least , " he said .
It should serve as a warning to others of how vulnerable their Web presence can be if their domain registrars or service providers are unable or unwilling to stand up to legal pressure , he said .
Similarly , Julius Baer 's attempt to block access to all materials on Wikileaks because it wanted to protect its own documents , and the court 's acceding to that strategy , is unwarranted , Zimmerman said .
For one thing , it violates Wikileaks ' First Amendment rights , he said .
The court 's action also violates the First Amendment rights of Web users who might have had a legitimate interest in reading all of the other material posted on Wikileaks , he said .
A hearing on the case if scheduled for Friday .

In humans , the eyes are said to be the ' window to the soul ' , conveying much about a person 's emotions and intentions .
New research demonstrates for the first time that birds also respond to a human 's gaze .
Predators tend to look at their prey when they attack , so direct eye - gaze can predict imminent danger .
Julia Carter , a PhD student at the University of Bristol , and her colleagues , set up experiments that showed starlings will keep away from their food dish if a human is looking at it .
However , if the person is just as close , but their eyes are turned away , the birds resumed feeding earlier and consumed more food overall .
Carter said " This is a great example of how animals can pick up on very subtle signals and use them to their own advantage " .
Wild starlings are highly social and will quickly join others at a productive foraging patch .
This leads to foraging situations that are highly competitive .
An individual starling that assesses a relatively low predation risk , and responds by returning more quickly to a foraging patch ( as in the study ) , will gain valuable feeding time before others join the patch .
Responses to obvious indicators of risk -- a predator looming overhead or the fleeing of other animals -- are well documented , but Carter argued that a predator 's head orientation and eye - gaze direction are more subtle indicators of risk , and useful since many predators orient their head and eyes towards their prey as they attack .
This research describes the first explicit demonstration of a bird responding to a live predator 's eye - gaze direction .
Carter added : " By responding to these subtle eye - gaze cues , starlings would gain a competitive advantage over individuals that are not so observant .
This work highlights the importance of considering even very subtle signals that might be used in an animal 's decision - making process . "
Do these birds understand that a human is looking at them , and that they might pose some risk ?
As yet , this question has not been answered .
But whether or not the responses involve some sort of theory of mind , and whether or not they are innate or acquired , the result is that starlings are able to discriminate the very subtle eye - gaze cues of a nearby live predator and adjust their anti-predator responses in a beneficial manner .
These results are published online April 30 in Proceedings of the Royal Society B .
@ Geth :
And a parent who showers with a child is not necessarily getting off on it either .
I 'd say probably not .
But the reason a lot of them do n't do that is because if an 8 - year - old were to go to school and say " Oh I shower with my mom / dad and we are all naked in there " , that the reaction they'd get is one that assumes it would be sexualized .
We live in a society .
It is not just whether it is sexualized for this mother and for these children .
They are exposed to other people too .
Plus , when the child is sharing the breasts with dad , she is not just learning that breasts are the way a mother nourishes her children , she is also learning that breasts are something her father gets off on sucking .
Either that or she is assuming her mother gave birth to her dad too , which is even ickier than the other possibility .
So it is impossible to make a " it is not sexual " argument here when the kids see the same " non-sexual " tits being sucked on by dad .
Analysis : DHS ' troubled transport contract
by Shaun Waterman
Washington ( UPI ) Sep 28 , 2007
The company awarded a $ 25.4 million contract by the Department of Homeland Security for transportation services around the capital is not licensed to operate in the Washington area and does not pay its employees in line with federal wage determinations -- which should make it ineligible for the work .
Transcom Inc. of Germantown , Md. , got the largest of three awards made under the contract , which was bid out by Homeland Security after scrutiny from lawmakers on the previous contractor , Alexandria , Va. - based Shirlington Limousine and Taxi .
But Transcom has no license from the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Commission and has been fined for operating without one , according to legal documents and a letter from a GOP congressman .
Affidavits from two employees seen by United Press International also allege that the company was not paying its staff in line with federal contract requirements .
Another company awarded a $ 3.9 million piece of the contract , U.S. Trans Logistics Inc. , " has a prior history of poor performance as a government contractor , and was recently replaced on a contract to provide similar services to the State Department , " reads the letter from Rep. Roscoe Bartlett , R - Md .
Neither company responded to requests for comment .
Bartlett wrote to Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff as co-chairman of a group of lawmakers concerned with the Historically Under - utilized Business Zone , or HUB - Zone , program -- a set - aside for small businesses in economically disadvantaged neighborhoods .
Shirlington won the transportation contract in April 2004 when it ended up the only qualified bidder after the work was set aside under the HUB - Zone program .
Shirlington ran shuttle bus services between the various legacy office sites in the Washington area where Homeland Security staff worked and provided drivers for the sedans in which senior officials traveled .
The contract eventually grew to a $ 4 million - a- year business .
But Shirlington , and its owner Chris Baker , came under scrutiny in April 2006 after the firm was reported to have driven prostitutes to parties thrown by corrupt defense contractors .
After hearings on the topic held by the House Homeland Security Committee at which members lambasted the department 's procurement staff and procedures , the transportation contract was re-bid in a revised form earlier this year and Shirlington -- after its proposal had been disqualified -- lost to Transcom , U.S. Trans Logistics and a third company , RHG Group Inc .
" It has come to our attention , " wrote Bartlett on behalf of the HUB - Zone Caucus , " that the issuance of these contracts was not done in a manner consistent with the spirit and intent of the HUB - Zone regulations . "
Bartlett complained that , by deciding to switch the new contract award out of the HUB - Zone program , Chertoff 's department had set " a dangerous precedent that endangers the viability of this program . "
Homeland Security officials pointed out that Shirlington had already sought to challenge the award in court and lost .
The department " conducted a fair and open competition consistent with the requirements of the acquisition regulations , " spokesman Larry Orluskie said in a statement .
He said officials were " clear on the methodology and processes used to conduct the evaluation and select that company that provides the best value to the government . "
" We considered all of the appropriate factors in our evaluation and found no reason that would preclude the award of the contracts , " he concluded .
House Homeland Security Chairman Rep. Bennie Thompson , D - Miss. , warned the department he would be watching them .
" This committee has repeatedly told the department that it must conduct due diligence , " Thompson told UPI in a statement .
If officials " unwittingly awarded a contract to a company that was fired for a history of documented poor performance or knowingly awarded a contract to such a company , the department has once again failed to ask the right questions and wait for the correct answers . "
( CNN ) -- Sen. Barack Obama and his wife , Michelle , each donated $ 2,300 Thursday to the campaign of his former opponent , Sen. Hillary Clinton , which is millions of dollars in debt .
Sen . Barack Obama will make his first campaign appearance with Sen. Hillary Clinton on Friday .
In addition , Obama 's national finance chairman , Penny Pritzker , and her husband donated another $ 2,300 each , said Obama communications director Robert Gibbs .
The $ 2,300 is the maximum individual contribution allowed .
" [ Obama ] wrote a check himself , as well as his finance chairman , so I got two checks in my pocket for Hillary , " said Clinton adviser Terry McAuliffe .
Asked how much the checks were for , he responded , " They maxed out . "
Obama communications director Robert Gibbs confirmed the Obamas ' donations .
The move comes nearly three weeks after Clinton suspended her campaign and endorsed Obama , the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee .
This week , Obama asked top contributors to help Clinton retire her campaign debt of $ 22 million , about $ 12 million of which she loaned to her own campaign .
The two Democrats met Thursday night in Washington with her top fundraisers .
Watch CNN 's Candy Crowley report on the donation »
On Friday , they are to appear together at a rally in Unity , New Hampshire , a town on the state 's western border where they tied in the January primary .
Clinton and Obama endured a protracted and , at times , fierce primary season .
After months of divisive contests that took them through every state , the two are focused on uniting their party in order to defeat the Republicans in November .
Concern about the division in the party arose because the two candidates appealed to such different segments of the electorate .
Clinton did well with working - class voters and the elderly .
Obama rallied the support of affluent , well - educated voters , African - Americans and the younger generation .
Watch what Clinton and Obama hope to accomplish »
In exit polls conducted throughout the primary season , many Clinton backers said they either would not vote or would vote for Sen .
John McCain , the presumptive Republican candidate , should Obama become their party 's nominee .
Clinton has said it would be a " grave " mistake for her supporters to cast their votes for McCain .
" Anyone who voted for me has very little in common with the Republican party .
If you care about the issues I care about , and the future that I outlined during my campaign , then you really have to stay with us in the Democratic Party and vote for Sen .
Obama to be our next president , " she said in Washington on Tuesday .
Since Clinton endorsed Obama this month , she has been urging her supporters to follow suit .
" The way to continue our fight now to accomplish the goals for which we stand is to take our energy , our passion , our strength and do all we can to help elect Barack Obama the next president of the United States , " she said as she suspended her campaign .
Obama and Clinton have appeared on good terms in recent weeks .
Obama has repeatedly praised Clinton while on the trail .
Obama has shied away from any talk of a possible joint ticket , although he 's said Clinton " would be on anyone 's short list . "
The senator from Illinois has made it clear , however , that he wants Clinton 's help .
" I want her campaigning as much as she can .
She was a terrific campaigner .
She I think inspired millions of people , and so she can be an extraordinarily effective surrogate for me , and the values and ideals that we share as Democrats , " Obama said Wednesday in Chicago .
" I think we will have a terrific time together in New Hampshire .
And I think that she will be very effective all the way through the election , " he said .
But voters are n't quick to forget what was , at times , a contentious race for the Democratic nomination .
Clinton labeled Obama an " elitist " for saying some small - town Pennsylvanians were " bitter " people who " cling to guns and religion " in the days leading up to that state 's primary .
Obama accused Clinton of acting like " Annie Oakley ... packin' a six - shooter " in her attempts to connect with gun owners .

In the video clip here , Michael Reagan suggests killing Arab and Muslim babies in the most cruel and inhumane fashion , thus revealing the disgusting and mentally depraved mindset of the neocons .
For Reagan and the neocons , there will be peace “ when everybody in the Middle East is dead . ”
Is it possible Reagan wants to one up another scurrilous neocon , Ann Coulter ?
“ We should invade their countries , kill their leaders and convert them to Christianity , ” said Coulter after the September 11 attacks .
Coulter ’s comment was so crazed and psychotic , the neocons at the National Review fired her , but Coulter did not blink .
“ I am often asked if I still think we should invade [ Muslim ] countries , kill their leaders , and convert them to Christianity .
The answer is : Now more than ever ! ” she said in October , 2004 .
Indeed , Reagan did Coulter one better , or that should be worse , when he called for killing everybody in the Middle East , that is to say every Arab and Muslim .
Colorado Congress critter Tom Tancredo was following the neocon script when he suggested bombing Mecca and Medina .
But Reagan ’s vividly demented imagination appears to be second to none with his grenade inserted in a child ’s rectum comment .
However , what is really amazing is the fact Reagan was not fired on the spot or in short order like Don Imus , but then Imus ’ “ nappy - headed hos ” comment was politically incorrect whereas , in Bushzarro world , it is fully acceptable to discuss murderous perversion over the public airwaves if the threats are directed at Arabs and Muslims .
Not that it matters .
Because millions of Americans are apparently unconcerned by the horrific fact the neocons have murdered well over a million Iraqis and have condemned to a slow and painful death by way of cancer millions of others , thanks to the profligate use of depleted uranium .

Locals call it the shadow district : a strip of waterfront at the bottom of a hill , a short walk from Reykjavik 's main shopping street .
It used to be largely warehouses but today is home to some of the most expensive real estate in the city .
Towering apartment blocks have sprung up , with views across the bay to snow - capped mountains .
Flats cost up to £ 1.5 m apiece .
Where a cluster of new blocks is going up , the bright yellow cranes against the dazzling blue Icelandic sky look like a patchwork of Swedish flags flying above the city .
For much of the past decade , Iceland , with its tiny population of little more than 313,000 , has been one of the fastest growing economies in Europe , making Icelanders the sixth richest people in the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development .
Its big banks , Kaupthing , Landsbanki and Glitnir , have become international players and a new breed of companies has been buying up businesses overseas , led by Baugur , which owns much of Britain 's high street , including Warehouse , Whittard of Chelsea and Karen Millen .
Signs of the new wealth in Reykjavik are hard to miss .
Expensive four - wheel drives creep down the narrow main street , announced by the crunching sound of metal - studded tyres , for better grip on Iceland 's frosty roads .
Overhead is the near constant hum of private jets .
There is building work throughout the city .
On the harbour , a £ 50 m concert hall will have spectacular views when it is finished this year .
For the first time , Iceland has had an influx of foreign workers .
House prices have doubled since 2001 and a generation has known nothing but the good times .
But those good times have come to a juddering halt .
Iceland has become the latest flashpoint in the global financial crisis .
Critics have compared the country to a " toxic hedge fund " built on debt that could be about to go spectacularly wrong .
Unscrupulous
Officials in Iceland argue that the country is under siege by unscrupulous speculators looking for the next quick buck .
Despite its size , a meltdown in Iceland has the potential to severely damage confidence in the markets ; one economist compares it to the canary in the coalmine .
The concern is that the banks and corporations that have put Iceland on the map expanded too rapidly , borrowing during the years of readily available money .
Now they face problems refinancing that debt .
The banks in particular have been facing astronomical costs for insuring their debt ( credit default swaps or CDSs ) as the markets speculate that they could be in deep trouble .
Based on recent prices in the credit markets , Kaupthing was seven times more likely to default than the average European bank .
The chief worry appears to be whether or not the Icelandic Central Bank would have the muscle to rescue one of the banks if things went wrong .
Iceland is facing some unfavourable comparisons .
Bear Stearns recently suggested the tiny nation was about as safe an investment as Kazakhstan .
Asgeir Jónsson , chief economist at Kaupthing , sees the spiralling cost of insuring the bank 's debt as a modern version of a bank run .
" Instead of seeing people queueing in lines you see speculators , hedge funds , betting against the banks in anticipation that the central bank in Iceland would not be able to supply the liquidity support .
The Icelandic banks have not experienced any losses , they are extremely well capitalised , but if you see a line in front of a bank , you go and join it . "
Risk - averse investors have begun pulling out .
Since the beginning of the year , the Icelandic krona , the smallest independent currency in the world , has fallen by 25 % .
The main stockmarket index has fallen by about 40 % from its peak last summer , inflation in the overheated economy is running at 6.8 % and interest rates reached 15.5 % last week .
The country has also been running a large trade deficit , partly because of rampant consumer spending .
But in Reykjavik , people have suddenly stopped spending .
A Mercedes - Benz dealership that opened on the outskirts of downtown in 2004 , claims to have sold more of the top - of - the - range marque last year than were sold in the whole of Sweden .
But sales have ground to a halt .
" The prices for a new car have gone up between 25 % and 30 % , " says Leifur Orn Leifsson , general manager of the dealership .
" All people are talking about right now is the krona . "
Glyfi Magnussen , an economist at the University of Iceland , says : " I think it is fair to call it a crisis .
What we have is a country or an economy that has gone a little too far in some respects , especially the banking system .
The growth of the banking system was very rapid and until last year the banks did n't really have trouble financing themselves and rolling over their debt at quite favourable rates , but the international financial crisis has hit Iceland very adversely and made this situation very rapidly almost unsustainable . "
Iceland has been dramatically transformed in the past 20 years .
After financial markets were deregulated and banks privatised in 2003 , Icelandic companies that previously had only meagre access to funds were able to expand rapidly .
In a country the size of Iceland , the only option for an ambitious company is to look overseas - the reason so many have appeared in Britain .
The banks have moved into foreign markets with their clients , investing alongside them and building investment bank capabilities .
Landsbanki bought stockbrokers Teather & Greenwood and Bridgewell in London while Kaupthing bought Singer & Friedlander .
The food group Bakkavör owns Geest in Britain .
The Icelandic billionaire , Björgólfur Gudmundsson , the chairman of Landsbanki , backed the takeover of West Ham Football Club , where he is also now chairman .
There has been little evidence of the banks experiencing trouble so far .
An Icelandic investment firm , Gnúpur - a big shareholder in Kaupthing - was forced to announce an emergency refinancing earlier this year .
Another , FL Group , a big investor in Glitnir and the owner of House of Fraser , has also been liquidating assets , including the sale of an 8 % stake in American Airlines .
But while profits at the three big banks are down , none has taken the kind of hits that the big US and European banks have suffered during the credit crunch .
Analysts who think the current fear is unwarranted argue that the mini-crisis that struck Iceland in 2006 was a timely wake up call that has cushioned the banks from the wider international crisis .
At the time , the Icelandic banks shifted much of their financing from short to long term , broadened the markets they borrowed from , unravelled some of their cross-holdings and increased deposits , partly , in the case of Kaupthing and Landsbanki , by trawling for UK savers .
The banks all claim to have enough liquidity to refinance debts for at least a year and have passed stress tests devised by Icelandic regulators .
" It was a wake - up call , " says Magnusson .
" I am sure if they had n't done that they would be in much deeper trouble than they are now .
We would probably be seeing a real financial crisis with a non-functioning institution if they had n't done what they did . "
Gudjón Rúnarsson , at the Icelandic Financial Services Association , says : " The banks have ample liquidity .
Our belief is these problems will clear out this year .
For the Icelandic banks to get into real difficulties , that would only happen if these conditions continue for a long , long time and then you will not be focused on the Icelandic banks , then you will just have deep , deep problems all around . "
The government has blamed the crisis variously on the media , a lack of understanding among international investors and the scourge of speculators and hedge funds attacking Iceland in pursuit of a quick profit .
The prime minister , Geir Haarde , has gone on a charm offensive and was in New York at the end of last month to steady investors ' nerves while the financial supervisory authority in Iceland has launched an investigation into whether certain hedge funds are spreading misinformation in an effort to drive Icelandic markets down .
Vegas
" There are always people out there who are looking out for an opportunity to make a profit , and they are scouting for something like this , " says the minister of finance , Arni Mathiesen .
" Some of these financial transactions that are going on sound more like they are betting at a table in Las Vegas than operating financial institutions . "
Mathiesen insists the government would be able to bail out its banking system if the worst happened .
The state , he points out , is virtually debt - free .
Still doubts persist .
" The banks need better backing , " says a senior Icelandic banker .
" If these were UK banks or Norwegian banks in their current position , there would not be an issue .
It is more a political macro issue than a banking operational issue .
If we solve this crisis it will be only short term because the banks will continue to grow . "
Ten years ago , Iceland would have been at the tail end of a global downturn .
Today , with its companies and banks locked into world markets , it has become a lead indicator and questions are being asked about whether it can maintain its economic independence .
" This crisis will be solved - there is no question that the sovereign could recapitalise the banks , " says Jónsson .
" But in the future this will be an issue .
There are several things that could be done : joining the euro would put much more stability into the system - I think a lot of our problems now can be tied to being a part of such a small currency area .
Looking further into the future some of the Icelandic banks could move their headquarters .
That would n't be very good for Iceland but that might very well happen . "
In the past week or so the krona has gained a little , CDS spreads have narrowed and the stockmarket come off its lows .
For ordinary Icelanders , these remain worrying times .
Truck drivers have been striking and blocking roads and last week they met the minister of finance to protest at the cost of fuel .
" The price of oil is so high we are trying to make a point , " says one of the drivers , Sturla Jónsson .
" It is very tough .
Your salary is not moving anywhere and inflation is much higher than the government is saying . "
Hylnur Thór Audunsson , 33 , is a dentist in Reykjavik , and like many had taken foreign currency loans to avoid punitive Icelandic interest rates , but he has been hammered by the falling krona .
He bought an Infiniti four - wheel drive in January using Japanese yen and Swiss francs and his monthly payments have risen by around 30 % .
His mortgage is also partly financed with foreign currency loans .
He has already cancelled a holiday in May and will work instead .
" This is a typical story , " he says .
" My best friend is in a worse position , he just bought a company using yen and Swiss francs .
I will manage because I have a flexible job , but I do n't know how people on fixed incomes will cope . "
He says that he has noticed an increasing number of people cancelling appointments in the past three weeks .
" This is a new experience for people of my age .
People just want to join the euro now .
They want more stability .
This is pretty tiring . "

The 911 stink that wont go away
Considering the extensive body of verifiable evidence that sharply contradicts the official version of the 911 attacks , if you were one person in a group that is preparing to address a large audience of fence - sitters , what single aspect of the crime would you find most compelling and choose to explore ?
Oddly collapsing buildings , mysterious pre-impact flashes , missing aircraft debris , puddles of once molten steel and / or videotape anomolies .

Cindy McMealTicket , can you ever stay out of the news ?
You 're stealing all of John Sidney McGoldDigger 's thunder :
When you 're poor , it can be hard to pay the bills .
When you 're rich , it 's hard to keep track of all the bills that need paying .
It 's a lesson Cindy McCain learned the hard way when NEWSWEEK raised questions about an overdue property - tax bill on a La Jolla , Calif. , property owned by a trust that she oversees .
Yes , this is the story that I posted about earlier .
That little trollop .
She just can't stay out of trouble
San Diego County officials , it turns out , have been sending out tax notices on the La Jolla property , an oceanfront condo , for four years without receiving a response .
Everyone knows it 's impolite not to return your messages .
Cindy , Cindy , Cindy , where are your manners ?
[ A ] n elderly aunt of Mrs. McCain 's lives in the condo , and the bank that manages the trust has not been receiving tax bills on the property . [...]
County officials say the trust still owes an additional $ 1,742 for this year , an amount that is overdue and will go into default July 1 .
J Sid must have been too busy not voting and not campaigning to remind his better half to get her swirly McHairStyle to the ol ' United States Post Office .
Or maybe he was just napping .
" We do hear an awful lot of excuses for why people do n't pay , " [ Dan McAllister , treasurer - tax collector for San Diego County ] said .
" Under the law , the property owner is responsible for keeping the address current .
We 're only as good as the information we are given . "
John McCain , January 2008 : I do n't " really understand economics . "
No , apparently he does n't
Killer stingray found off British coast as experts warn of mass invasion due to global warming
A stingray that kills its prey with a giant electric shock has been found off the coast of Britain , it emerged today .
The ocean monster , which generates a power surge so strong it is like being plugged into the mains , normally lives in the warmer waters of the Mediterranean .
Now experts fear shoals of marbled stingray - a relative of the fish that killed Australian crocodile hunter Steve Irwin - will invade Britain this summer due to global warming .
Shocking : A stingray like the one landed by fishermen near Shoreham , West Sussex
One of the predators , which can grow up to 5ft long and kill a man with a single touch , was discovered by fishermen off the coast of Shoreham , West Sussex .
Skipper Brian Davey told the Daily Star : " I was n't quick enough to warn my younger crew member Lee before he handled it .
" But luckily for him I think it had discharged on its way up .
Otherwise he could have found himself flat on the deck wondering what him . "
The captured stingray , which can deliver a charge of up to 240 volts , is now recovering at Brighton 's Sea Life centre .
Ray victim : Steve Irwin swimming off the Great Barrier reef just before the attack in September 2006
Staff there have nicknamed her Carmen , after the former Baywatch star Carmen Electra .
Experts expect more of the fish to arrive during the summer and warned swimmers to be careful .
Sea Life curator Alex Gerrard said : " Where there 's one electric ray , it 's quite likely that there are more .
" Rising sea temperatures may well have brought an influx of warm water visitors . "
Tornadoes , the man -made variety , have just gotten more interesting with the Mercedes - Benz Museum ’s latest show / smoke elimination device .
Continue reading to see more .
Click here for first picture in gallery .
Overview
You may have seen this man-made wonder before , but Guinness World Records has now proclaimed it to be the world ’s “ strongest artificially generated tornado ” .
At 34.43 - meters high , it uses over 140 separate jets to inject 28 - tons of air into the courtyard , generating an artificial tornado .
It ’s not just for show , this also serves to eliminate smoke in the event of a fire according to the museum ’s manager .

HIGH work demands are to blame for more than 21,000 cases of depression in Victoria each year , according to a new Melbourne University study .
The study , led by the university 's Associate Professor Tony LaMontagne , found that almost one in six cases of depression among working Victorians were caused by job stress .
Associate Professor LaMontagne said employers  including Prime Minister Kevin Rudd , who last week warned reportedly overworked public servants that they should expect their work load to only increase  must be mindful of the strain unreasonable work demands can have on workers ' mental health .
He said unless moves were made to moderate job demands and provide support for supervisors and colleagues to better understand the problem , mental health issues would continue to put enormous pressure on the public purse through Medicare .
" ( Jobs ) can be challenging .
I 'm not talking about making it easy for everybody , people do n't necessarily want that , " Associate Professor LaMontagne , from the university 's VicHealth Centre for the Promotion of Mental Health and Community Wellbeing , said .
The latest code can be found on github ?
It 's a merge with a previous version of DocTest ?
What did you add ?
Are n't you satisfied with all the Ruby test frameworks ?
Yes , that 's the latest code .
Earlier this week , I forked Tom Locke 's project at github.com / tablatom / rubydoctest , and then merged my changes into his project once he gave permission .
I found Tom 's code to be very readable , and his approach to comparing results by evaling ( rather than direct string testing , as in Python 's doctests ) was compelling .
This allows ruby 's unordered hashes to be compared successfully , for example .
I also took Roger Pack 's idea of putting doctests into comments right in the ruby source file .
I did n't borrow any of Roger 's code ( at code.google.com ) but I borrowed his ideas .
Now , Ruby DocTest gives the option of both the " inline doctest " style of Roger 's package , with the " separate documentation in a markdown file " style of Tom 's package .
Yes and no .
I still like rspec quite a bit .
But for my own workflow , I always find that I 'm trying to catch up with the actual code written because I 'm too lazy to switch to another file ( or create a file ) and write the tests .
Often , I have this little niggling feeling that I should test some edge case of a method I 'm working on , but I forego it because so many other things are on my mind at the time .
If I could just put an irb session in there , I thought , that would cover 90 % of my needs .
So I did .
DocTest is outside the BDD cycle ?
Is DocTest supposed to be a replacement for the other unit test framework or just an additional tool ?
Yes , that 's correct .
This is not a test - first approach .
My current needs , as mentioned above , are in documenting an already - existing project that is not well - tested .
Is n't the way DocTest annotates code polluting the reading ?
I imagine the migration path of doctest to go something like this :
1 . You write some code , and then add an inline doctest comment or two .
2 . You make some other code modifications , and later come back to the original code .
3 . You add more test cases , but the number of tests ( or length ) gets unwieldy , so you move them into a separate *. doctest file .
To be honest , I do n't know yet .
It 's a new way of writing tests for me , so I 'll be playing with it to find the answer soon .
I imagine my 90 % target above is close ... there will probably be some places where it makes more sense to rely on traditional rspec or Test : : Unit cases .
BEIJING ( Reuters ) - China prepared to tackle more unrest in its ethnic Tibetan enclaves on Monday , after crushing Lhasa protests against Chinese rule in which Tibet ’s exiled representatives say as many as 80 people were killed .
Lhasa , the capital of the remote Himalayan region , was under tight police watch , but reports and officials said demonstrations by ethnic Tibetans flared in at least two Chinese provinces , widening the worries of the Communist authorities .
“ We are completely capable of protecting the security of the Tibet people .
Right now the overall situation in Tibet is very good , ” the mayor of Lhasa , Doje Cezhug , said from Beijing , in remarks posted on the Tibet government ’s Web site .
But protests hit ethnic Tibetan areas in the Chinese provinces of Sichuan and Gansu on Sunday , reducing the chances of an early end to the instability that is a major challenge to China ’s leaders just months before it hosts the Olympic Games .
In the Sichuan county town of Aba , a police officer said a crowd of Tibetans had hurled petrol bombs and burned down a police station and a market .
In Gansu ’s Machu town , a crowd of 300- 400 carried pictures of Tibet ’s exiled spiritual leader , the Dalai Lama , and shouted slogans as they marched on government buildings , breaking windows and doors and setting fire to Chinese shops and businesses , the Free Tibet Campaign said .
The London - based group said 100 Tibetan students staged a sit-in at Northwest Minority University in Gansu ’s capital , Lanzhou , a worry for a country with a history of student unrest , notably the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989 that ended in a military crackdown .
In Lhasa , the situation was quiet but tense and police locked down the region as a midnight deadline loomed for protesters to give themselves up to the police .
The government advised foreign tourists to leave and confirmed it had stopped granting foreigners tourist permits .

Western governments have called for restraint in China ’s response to the violent protests , and Chinese official media tried to defend the security measures used in quelling them .
“ Throughout the incident , Lhasa police officers exercised great restraint .
They remained patient , professional and were instructed not to use force , ” Xinhua news agency said .
The Dalai Lama , who has lived in India since 1959 , the year of a failed uprising against Chinese rule in Tibet , called for an investigation into what he called cultural genocide .
Chinese troops entered Tibet in 1950 after the Communists took power in Beijing .
A Nobel peace prize winner , the Dalai Lama is revered in the Tibetan community but reviled as a traitor in China , where authorities stepped up the rhetoric against him .
Xinhua quoted Tibetan officials as saying the Dalai Lama ’s charge was “ downright nonsense ” and trumpeted its development policies in the region .
Critics say those policies helped fuel the protesters ’ anger by favoring Han Chinese migrants to the region , contributing to a huge wealth gap between Chinese and Tibetans .
All the straw from rice in China could get turned into an inexpensive new renewable source of biofuel , new research shows .
In fact , three facilities in China already are making use of the approach .
China is the world 's largest producer of rice , a crop that leaves behind roughly 230 million tons of rice straw each year — the stem and leaves are left behind after harvesting the grains .
Although there some uses available for rice straw , such as animal feed or papermaking , a significant amount of it remains unused and burned in open fields , boosting air pollution and the risk of disastrous fires .
All that biological matter , or biomass , could in theory get converted into biofuel with the aid of germs that break it down into useful chemicals .
An approach like this already is used in more than 30 nations worldwide to help convert corn , sugarcane and other crops into ethanol fuel , a type of biofuel .
Scientists have not tapped rice straw to make biofuel because bacteria cannot easily break down its cellulose , due to the complex physical and chemical structures making up this biomass .
Now researchers in China have developed a pre-treatment for rice straw that increases its potential for biofuel production .
They mix the straw with lye , or sodium hydroxide , before giving it to bacteria to ferment .
The lye helps make the straw more biodegradable .
All this is done at ambient temperature , without need to spend extra energy , and just minimal amounts of water , helping make the process " simple , fast , cost - effective , and environmentally friendly , " said researcher Xiujin Li at the Beijing University of Chemical Technology .
All told , the lye technique allowed researchers to boost production of biogas — a mixture of methane fuel and carbon dioxide — by up to roughly 65 percent .
Three prototype facilities using this technology have been built in China .
The plan is to build centralized biogas stations for towns , which would feed the biofuel to each household through underground pipelines .
The rice straw residues left afterward will go back to the fields as organic fertilizer .
" This way , the rice straw will be completely recycled , " Li said .
While carbon dioxide is a byproduct of this process — of concern since it traps heat from the sun , leading to global warming — " rice will absorb back the carbon dioxide from air during rice growing , " Li said .
" The carbon dioxide is actually recycled completely and the net carbon dioxide contribution to global is zero . "
Although there have recently been rice shortages worldwide , leading to deadly riots in Haiti , there is so much rice straw around that " we can not use so much straw using this technology alone at present , " Li told LiveScience .
" Although the planting area of rice was decreased recently , the reduction was limited , therefore the recent rice shortage will not affect our research . "
In principle , this process could be widely used for many different kinds of straw , and therefore " be widely applied in all the countries who plant crops , including both developed and developing countries , and provide renewable and clean energy , " Li said .
The scientists are set to detail their findings in the July 16 issue of the journal Energy & Fuels .
They were financially supported by the Hi-tech Research and Development Program of China .
With all the worries of today , would you like to find a digital escape ?
The Frog Concept mask envisions to act as the connection between the real world and a digital one .
Those wearing the frog mask would be able to feel their digital world ’s preferences such as smells , sounds , and visuals .
As their facial expressions change , others wearing an identical mask would view a digital image as an interactive avatar .
This may be so science fiction it is completely crazy , but with global warming , pollution , and other environmental problems , I think many would flock to wear a mask such as this for a temporary escape .
Heck , why would n’t we all want to escape a little and draw the world we actually want to see and feel ?

A man who opened fire on colleagues at a plastics factory in Kentucky warned his girlfriend two hours before that he would kill his boss , police said .
Wesley Higdon , 25 , shot dead five fellow workers and injured another before turning the handgun on himself .
He opened fire at the Atlantis Plastics factory in Henderson city after arguing with a male supervisor .
Higdon killed his 30 - year - old supervisor , two other male workers and two females , police told the BBC .
A sixth victim , a woman , was in a stable condition in hospital .
The 22 - year - old was being treated at St Mary 's Hospital in Evansville , Indiana , Det Preston Herndon of Henderson 's police force told BBC News .
' Total shock '
Higdon , a night - shift worker , had a row with his supervisor about wearing safety goggles on Tuesday night , then called his girlfriend and said he was going to kill him , police said .
Higdon shot the supervisor outside the plant before re-entering the building to open fire on other colleagues , Det Herndon told the BBC .
" We 're still piecing together events but we believe the gunman had an altercation with a supervisor and went out to his vehicle to retrieve a firearm , " he said .
" We believe he then had another altercation outside with the supervisor and opened fire .
" He then went into the building to a break room with lunch tables set up where other colleagues were and continued his shooting spree . "
Atlantis Plastics chief executive officer Bud Philbrook told the Associated Press news agency that the killings were a " total shock " .
The rampage happened at about 0015 local time ( 0415 GMT ) on Wednesday .
Staff at the plant , which employs about 150 people and makes refrigerator parts , were sent home .
OPW INTEVIEW -- June 21 -- Chinese internet dating sites use mobile billing as their primary billing mechanism .
But the government threw a spanner in the works and capped the amount providers could bill each month .
Too many mobile companies were tricking users into signing up for monthly dues .
So , there was a big change in the fees that the government was allowing to be charged through telephones .
It went from 30 RMB to 10 RMB a month .
I recently heard there has been another change ; anybody who charges through the phone has to get permission again from the user before they can rebill every month .
It has had a big impact on all the websites which were using mobile .
Baihe.com used reacted by switching its business model to become a real world matchmaker with an online dating element .
- Mark Brooks
How are other dating sites dealing with the imposed limitations for mobile billing ?
Actually they do n't have a good way to deal with it .
Most of the services which are relying on the mobile are now leaving the space .
Their profits are shrinking very fast .
Mobile payment as a major payment method for online dating companies is shrinking quickly .
However , at the same time , online payment is growing fast with ecommerce growing and the banks efforts .
In the last year , online payments doubled and it 's still growing quickly .
Of course , it 's still much more complex compared with mobile payments .
With online payment growing , we can predict the payment environment will improve for online dating companies .
When we last spoke you have moved very significantly and quickly through to offering real world matchmaking services .
How have things changed in the last year since we spoke ?
We have made significant progress in offline matchmaking business .
Our price increased two times and we are profitable .
Our average price is now $ 1,200 .
What services are you offering ?
For every candidate we verify their identity and do some communication before they meet each other .
We make sure the candidates are a good match .
A lot of the customers are afraid that they will be refused by the other candidate .
So we provide the pre-date communication and then we arrange the date .
Do you offer any coaching services as well ?
We provide some coaching in how to communicate and this is also a paid service .
We have one - to - one coaching and some training calls for groups of people .
We also published a book this month .
Lots of TV stations and newspapers are very interested in this book : " Women Must Marry a Good Husband " .
How do you charge for the coaching services ?
It 's now based on the training class .
We charge $ 40 US per class .
At this time , we are designing a new service .
We will provide clients with one year of coaching .
Who does the matchmaking ?
For VIP customers , the matchmaking is done by the consultant .
They are using our back end assistants to filter the candidates from our user base .
For the new product we designed , we will provide a coach to the customer and they will find the candidates by themselves .
What regions do you serve ?
We have offices in Beijing and Shanghai .
Also we provide remote services for other big cities in China .
What have been the major challenges that you 've encountered as you have created this matchmaking service ?
We have solved a lot of problems and there are still a lot of challenges .
The first challenge was how to build trust .
As time passes , more and more customers start to recognize that we are serious about providing this matchmaking service .
Almost 50 % of our current users are referred by their friends who already used our service .
The second challenge is that there are not enough qualified matchmakers .
And the third one is in balancing profitability and service quality .
The profitability depends on how many customers are served by one matchmaker at the same time .
If you assign too many customers to the matchmakers , they cannot handle the workload and the service quality drops down quickly .
How do you determine pricing ?
Some customers are very difficult to serve because they are very critical and need a lot of attention .
So we developed a system which gives out an estimated cost , the best price to close the deal .
The system helps us identify potential personality issues .
Actually we cannot decide very accurately for every single person .
We can only make the system fair on average .
We have some very profitable customers and there are also some customers who are difficult and we lose money .
That 's much like insurance companies .
How do you measure service and success on an ongoing basis ?
The first factor is success rate .
Is the client getting married ?
Are they engaged ?
Have they decided to terminate the service because they have some commitment with someone ?
Secondly , sometimes they do n't find their right person through Baihe , but still we like to know if our coaching helped them .
We measure our service profit , and monitor the attitudes of the matchmakers and whether the service is delivered in time and is meaningful .
So we do customer satisfaction surveys every month and decide if the performance is adequate from the service team .

PARIS - Europe 's large unmanned space tugis undergoing final preparations for a maiden flight to the International SpaceStation sometime between Feb. 22 and March 9 , with docking at the stationlikely to occur during windows of March 15 - 19 or March 30 - April 5 , programmanagers said Tuesday .
At abriefing at European Space Agency ( ESA ) headquarters here , ESA and industryofficials said the Automated Transfer Vehicle ( ATV ) , has passed most of its key pre-launch milestones atEurope 's Guiana Space Center spaceport in French Guiana .
The ATV isdesigned to carry food , water , fuel and other supplies to the space stationonce every 18 months or so .
It will also reboost the station into its operatingorbit .
Flying at between 217 and 267 miles ( 350 and 430 km ) in altitude , thestation gradually loses altitude because of the force of the Earth 's gravityand because of atmospheric drag at that altitude .
The ATV hasthree times the cargo capacity of Russia 's Progress vehicle and is beingdeveloped by ESA as part of a barter arrangement with NASA .
Instead of payingcash for its share of the station 's common operating costs , and also to secureadditional astronaut access , ESA is providing ATV and other gear .
So far , ESAnations have spent some 1.3 billion euros ( $ 1.9 billion ) on developing the ATV , a figure that includes the first launch .
The agency currently plans to buildfour other ATVs , with the second due for launch in 2010 - assuming the firstflight occurs without a hitch .
Forthis first ATV , called Jules Verne , ESA , NASA and Russia 's Roskosmos spaceagency have agreed on a go - slow approach as the 42,108 - pound ( 19,100 - kg ) tug , operating automatically , nears the station and docks to it .
To be surethe vehicle responds to commands , it will be ordered to stop at variousdistances from the station , then withdraw and wait for further instructions .
Programmanagers estimate that following ATV's launch aboard a specially designedEuropean Ariane 5 rocket , it will take about 10 days for the vehicle to climbto the station 's orbiting altitude .
Dependingon the traffic at the station , ATV may be sent into a parking orbit to wait forthe U.S. space shuttle , or a Russian Progress vehicle , or a Russian Soyuzmanned capsule to complete its mission at the station and depart .
JohnEllwood , ESA 's ATV mission manager , said ATV operations require the use ofNASA 's Tracking and Data Relay Satellite System , TDRSS , whose capacity will befully used during shuttle launches .
The next shuttle launch , of Europe 'sColumbus space station laboratory , is currently scheduled for Feb .
7 .
ATV 's needfor TDRSS is minimal if the vehicle is parked at a safe distance from thestation while waiting for a docking opportunity , Ellwood said , meaning that thelaunch date is not directly dependent on whether the Feb . 7 shuttle launch is further delayed .
In additionto needing to steer clear of other traffic to and from the station , ATV 'srendezvous and docking schedule is governed by the position of the sun relativeto both ATV and the station , Ellwood said .
ATV 's finalapproach to the station is guided by lasers .
Ellwood said mission managers wantto avoid having direct sunlight in front of the vehicle as it chases thestation to avoid confusing the laser guidance .
Inaddition , the station 's astronauts will be monitoring the approach of ATV usinga small camera mounted on board the station .
To maintain a clear view , themaneuver must occur when the sun is not shining directly into the camera , Ellwood said .
Why does n't the All England Club market itself as " the birthplace of the upskirt " ?
You know the upskirt : it 's that staple of modern paparazzi photography that teeters over into rogue , unsolicited gynaecology , and though it is usually deployed on the likes of Britney Spears as she leaves a nightclub / psychiatric hospital , it had a very early outing at the 1949 Wimbledon championships .
That year , the American women 's star Gertrude " Gorgeous Gussie " Moran wore a dress short enough that her frilly lace knickers protruded beneath it , and the photographers literally lay on the ground at the back of the court so they could get the raciest shots .
Ah , austerity years fun - you took it where you could .
Yet now that the opportunities to get a look at a woman 's knickers are not exactly limited , the hope always lingers that professional athletes could be excluded from the desperate trouser - rubbing of yesteryear .
Consider the hope extinguished , for this year at least .
It actually seems like the situation is getting worse , with women players struggling to get a mention if they do n't conform to some picture editor 's exacting arse standards .
Never mind the talent round , here 's the swimsuit contest .
Yesterday , the Daily Telegraph explained that " to regard the top seeds in the women 's draw as no more than eye candy is to do them a great disservice " .
You think ?
But readers learned that while all the men on the tour dine happily with each other after noble contest , " women are different " .
And yet all the same , apparently .
" Women bear grudges . "
And the headlines : " Serbs serving up sexy tennis " ; " Maria 's pants of a lifetime " ( what ? ) .
" New balls , please ! " is somehow the tragi- cheesiest of them all .
It usually appears over a spread of pictures of the designated hot babes , and it's redolent of the moment in porn films when it becomes clear that the pretty pretend lesbians wo n't be able to totally pleasure each other and an ugly , fat short guy has to come along and unleash final satisfaction upon them .
New balls , please !
Only in this climate could it be written - as it was at the French Open - that the American Ashley Harkleroad had " upstaged " Serena Williams because she had decided to pose for Playboy .
Williams had just crushed her in two sets , but whatever .
Harkleroad 's first - round draw here is Amélie Mauresmo , in a match swiftly billed by some commentators as the clash between the lesbian and the Playboy model .
More than any other sport , tennis attracts this kind of thing - and perhaps most disturbingly the LTA are buying right into it .
They recently launched their Think Pink campaign , a new initiative " to raise awareness of women in tennis , and sport in general " .
A couple of weeks ago they got lots of promising nine - to 11 - year - old girl players to dress up in pink clothes and demonstrate their skills .
" We 're looking to bring out the glamorous side of the game , " explained Think Pink ambassador Claire Curren , " and really tap into what appeals to girls growing up these days . "
Wait : that 's the big idea ?
To wear baby pink and emphasise " the glamorous side " of tennis ?
Why , we 'll be producing Grand Slam champions inside a decade .
It 's a little - known fact that as ambitious tweens , Venus and Serena Williams raised their game by repeatedly asking themselves , " What would Malibu Stacy do ? "
Others vehemently dispute the LTA 's assertion that " we have to sell women 's tennis in a different way to men's tennis " .

Dees fumed : " [ Think Pink ] tells girls - once again - that they are not tough enough to really compete ; it tells them that women 's sports are somehow different from men's ; and it tells them ' Do n't worry , you 'll still be " feminine " , even if you play this sweaty sport ' . "
Still , there are plenty who 'll be on hand to defeminise them - dehumanise them if necessary .
Former pro Justin Gimelstob , a Sports Illustrated writer these days , was last week moved to discuss Anna Kournikova with the Washington Post .
He would n't touch her , he explained , but " I would n't mind having my younger brother , who 's kind of a stud , nail her and reap the benefits of that " .
Speaking of a mixed doubles event at which he 'll face Kournikova , he declared : " She 's going to be serving 40 miles an hour and I 'm just going to be plugging it down her throat . "
He would n't aim at her head , he added .
" I 'm going to just serve it right into the body , about 128 , right into the midriff . "
There are those who say that some female players court this stuff by doing lucrative ad campaigns .
But so do the guys .
Professional male sports are full of manscaped ad - whores who are happy to look sultry if some high - end watchmaker or underwear designer is paying .
But when they 're on the field , they get to do their job without having humpy headlines slapped above their photo .
Women deserve the same .
Hi Monks , I will be extremely thankful if the monks here could help me understanding regex in Perl .
Suppose I have a text file that has these lines :
This is line one .
Line
Two is this .
Third line starts here .
This is line four .
This is line five .
This is line six .
This is the seventh line .
This is line eight .
[ download ]
If the record contains the word " third " our " four " , I want it to print the whole record , meaning the stuff between the empty lines , not just lines with those words in it .
But I am not able to write it correctly .
Here is what I have tried : use strict ; use warnings ; open my $ fh , " +< " , " testlines.txt " ; while ( < $ fh > ) { if ( $ _= ~ /( third | four ) / si ) { chomp ; local $ / = "
" ; print " line is : $_
" ; } } [ download ]
And it prints : > perl regex.pl line is :
Third line starts here .
line is :
This is line four .
[ download ]
But what I want is :
This is line one .
Line
Two is this .
Third line starts here .
This is line four [ download ]
Where am I going wrong ?
Please guide .
Please note , this is just an example .
Depending on the data supplied the other lines in the file may contain some different words .
Not sure if this matters , but I 'm on Windows 10 with Strawberry Perl version 5.32 .
Enlightened Brothers , I am having bit (! ) trouble with telling DBIx :: Class to match records where a specific column of integer type ( actually BIGINT ) has specific bit (s ) set .
The equivalent SQL is something like : select * from TABLE where ( roles & 4 ) = 1 ( Edit : the RHS of this where expression , i.e. : =1 was written rather hastily and it does not make sense for checking if the 2nd LSbit is set .
roles =4 is much clearer and probably faster .
Instead , ( roles &4 ) = 4 , ( roles &4 ) > 0 . ( roles &4 ) =0 make more sense in my particular scenario )
Since we are on the topic , I have not yet understood how to use the column - name in a search with DBIx : : Class .
For example how to DBIx : : Class this : select * from TABLE where ( roles & 4 ) = ( roles & 2 ) ?
I can also settle for someone telling me how to pass a custom WHERE - in- SQL using DBIx :: Class :: ResultSet : : search ( ) , if possible .
Oh !

Hi .
I am studying regular expressions and wanted to write a script that searches a DNA string for the longest substrings that consist of repeating letters .
For example : CCCCC or GGG or AAAA etc .
I managed to do that , but i am not very happy with the end resuslt .
I was hoping to get most of the work done with a regex , in that regard i have failed .
Furthermore there are statements in the while loop that look doubtful , and the idea of using an array to store the substring along with its length might not be good .
Any advice is welcome .
Thank you .
use strict ; use warnings ; my $ string = " AAATTTAGTTCTTAAGGCTGACATCGGTTTACGTCAGCGTTACCCCCCAAGTTATT + GGGGACTTT " ; my @substrings ; while ( $ string =~ /( [ ACTG ] ) ( \ 1 + ) /g ) { my $ comb = $ 1. $ 2 ; my $ len = length ( $ 1 ) + length ( $ 2 ) ; push @substrings , [ $ comb , $len ] ; } my @sorted = sort {$b - > [ 1 ] < => $ a ->[ 1] } @substrings ; foreach my $ substring ( @sorted ) { foreach my $ element ( @$ substring ) { print " $element " ; } print "

Hi
How I can visualize a Perl program ?
For example I like to see all the perl variables and the line - numbers or subroutines where it is used .
I understand that variables can be created on the fly with eval and $ $ and even another name - space but let 's ignore for them for now , as my current code base does n't have that .
Thanks .
I 'm trying to do some Excel hacking and Excel : : Table looks like the perfect module .
but I can't get it to open a spreadsheet .
my ' open ' subroutine is simple : sub getWB { my ( $ dir , $ excel ) = $ _ [ 0 ] =~ /(.*)\/(.*)/ ; my $ xs = Excel : : Table -> new ( dir => $ dir ) ; $ xs -> open ( $ excel ) ; return $ xs ; } [ download ] and when I try to open the spreadsheet with ' getWB ( " D:myexcel.xlsx " ) '
I get Log4perl : Seems like no initialization happened .
Forgot to call init ( ) + ? no such path [ D:\myexcel.xslx ] at D: \Perl\spreadsheet.pl line 55 . [ download ]
Any advice at what I 'm missing / getting wrong ?

Hi , I have a simple 30 line perl script which basically just compares a bunch of numbers in a list .
I 'm a little rusty with perl as I have n't used it in a few years now , but no matter what I try , I can't get past the syntax error which is complaining about the line where I compare two numbers out of my array .
I 've given up and just can't see what is wrong .
Is there a monk out there who could guide me please ?
I hate to post up on such a simple thing , but I 'm totally stuck .
Running the script complains of a syntax error : $ ./perlAnalyzeDailyStats.pl syntax error at ./perlAnalyzeDailyStats.pl line 29 , near " @array ( " Execution of ./perlAnalyzeDailyStats.pl aborted due to compilation err + ors. [ download ]

Hi everyone , I have the following script : my ( $ query ) = our $ connect -> prepare ( " SELECT number , name FROM TableNam + e " ) ; $ query -> execute ( ) ; my $ data = $ query->fetchall_arrayref ( ) ; $ query -> finish ; foreach $ data ( @$data ) { my %row_data ; # get a fresh hash for the row data my ( $ variable1 , $ variable2 ) = @$data ; $ row_data{number} = " $ variable1 " ; $ row_data{name} = " $ variable2 " ; } push ( @loop_data , \ %row_data ) ; } [ download ]
Not the most efficient way of doing this but achieves what I want .
I would like to be able to do a similar thing , but for an unknown number of columns in the SQL Table .
So : my ( $ query ) = our $ connect -> prepare ( " SELECT * FROM TableName " ) ; $ query -> execute ( ) ; my $ data = $ query->fetchall_arrayref ( ) ; $ query -> finish ; foreach $ data ( @$data ) { my %row_data ; # get a fresh hash for the row data foreach my $ data_item ( @$data ) { $ row_data {NAMEOFSQLCOLUMN} = " $ data_item " ; # How do I get the name + of the SQL column that the data_item belong to ?
} } push ( @loop_data , \%row_data ) ; } [ download ]
Any help would be very much appreciated !
I feel like this is a really stupid question , but I 'm sort of at my wit 's end and really hoping someone can point out what it is that I 'm missing .
I have a subroutine and have some variables that are not in scope as I expected and can't figure out why , any wisdom on what I 'm missing would be greatly appreciated sub make_ap_stanza ( ) { my $ policy = $ _ [ 0 ] ; my $ vsname ; my $ vsowner ; my $ owner ; my $ group ; my $ regexp ; my $ volumeset ; my $ volumeset_owner ; print " Policy : $ policy

" ; } elsif ( ( $ vsowner ) = ( $_ =~ / vs_owner =\s + ( .* ) / ) ) { print " VSOWNER : $vsowner
" ; } elsif ( ( $ filter ) = ( $_ =~ / filter_name =\s + ( .* ) / ) ) {
# print " FILTER : $ filter
" ; my @attrs = @{ $ RegexHoA{ $ filter} } ; foreach ( @attrs ) { if ( ( $ regexp ) = ( $ _ =~ / REGEXP =\s + (.* ) / ) ) { print " REGEXP : $ regexp

" ; } elsif ( ( $ group ) = ( $_ =~ / GROUP =\s + (.* ) / ) ) { print " GROUP : $ group
" ; } } } } print " foo $ vsowner
" ; } [ download ]
So I declared a bunch of variables in the beginning of the code block , the nested routines populate them , but outside of the foreach loop , the variables are uninitialized ??? [ test1 ] change_timeout = 10 comment = foobar logmask = 0 xffffff parent = thanos policy = perms policy = foobar queue_depth = 32 supports_hsm = yes path = / test1 Policy : perms REGEXP : image . ( [ 0 - 9 ] + ) . ( [ 0 - 9 ] + ) OWNER : ANY GROUP : ANY VSNAME : dyn{2}{1} VSOWNER :root
Use of uninitialized value $ vsowner in concatenation (. ) or string at + ./ getconf line 395. foo [ download ]
It looks like no matter how long I stare at this , I just can't understand why my variables are not properly declared
The test I needed help with in Can Test :: MockObject mock a file ? is finished .
I would like to know how I did writing it .
I got some advice on looping I did not quite get a handle on , but this is a short test for a little module .
Here are links to the Fancy : : Open module and Fancy : : Open pod ( unfinished ) .

Guillermo del Toro Chats with TORN About ‘ The Hobbit ’ Films !
at 7:58 am by - April 25 , 20087:58 am by xoanon
In an exclusive interview with TheOneRing.net , Guillermo del Toro talks about Ian McKellen , Andy Serkis , Howard Shore , Animatronics vs CGI , the ‘ tone ’ of the upcoming ‘ Hobbit ’ films and much more !
We had the opportunity to chat with Guillermo del Toro this morning from his current HQ in London .
He ’s hard at work putting the finishing touches on ‘ Hellboy II : The Golden Army ’ and taking interviews from news outlets about that film , and the recent announcement that he ’ll be doing ‘ The Hobbit ’ and a subsequent Hobbit sequel down the line .
First things first , YES , that is him on our message boards , he told me he intends to post there as often as he humanly can .
And yes , he is as cool and approachable as he sounds .
Take a look at my interview !
How did this whole process get started ?
GDT : I met Peter ( Jackson ) a long time ago when we were planning on doing ‘ Halo ’ together , I really love how they have that setup in New Zealand , I call it ‘ Hollywood the way God intended it ’ .
New Zealand has all the technical advantages when doing a big movie and you are shooting it in paradise , both in terms of artistic freedom and commitment .
When ‘ Halo ’ did n’t happen , Peter and I stayed in contact on a regular basis , and last winter I started getting inklings that ‘ The Hobbit ’ may come this way , mainly from the studio .
The first thing I said was that I would only be interested if Peter was involved and the ( New Line Lawsuit ) problem gets resolved .
When that issue was resolved I got a call from Peter and we chatted , and it started from then , it was my Christmas gift !
Fans are all abuzz about ‘ The Second Film ’ , can you tell some of your plans for it ?
GDT : You know , I traveled to New Zealand just a little while ago , and one of the main reasons for going was to sit down and talk about the second film .
‘ The Hobbit ’ , the book , is really one self - contained film , so for the second movie we sat down and worked it out .
When we did this we got really excited because this second film is not a ‘ tag on ’ , it ’s not ‘ filler ’ , it ’s an integral part of telling the story of those 50 years of history lost in the narrative .
There will be certain things that we will see from the first movie but from a different point of view , but it will feel like a volume , in the 5 volumes of the entire story .
It will not feel like a bridge , I ’ve been hearing it called ‘ a bridge film ’ , it ’s not , it ’s an integral chapter of the story , and I think we ’re all on the same page .
You will be moving down to New Zealand for 4 years , is that right ?
GDT : Approximately , my whole family , but the first stages of design and R&D will be done with me going back and fourth from LA and New Zealand because there are a lot of things I need to put to bed before I finally move to New Zealand .
I ’m going much sooner than my relatives would like !
We will officially be doing a lot of prep on ‘ The Hobbit ’ this summer , there is so much to do , its amazing .
Just the reforestation of The Shire , re planting all those trees and plants will take months , and we ’re going to be as exact as possible .
Films like ‘ Pan ’s Labyrinth ’ used a few studio sets to simulate outdoors , will you be doing the same for ‘ The Hobbit ’ or will you be making use of New Zealand ’s wilderness like Peter did ?
GDT : I think green screen photography is exactly like CGI , it is a tool , I do n’t think it should be overused .
Things like ‘ Pan ’s Labyrinth ’ and ‘ The Devil ’s Backbone ’ are incredibly dependent on location , we shot on location for more than half the time .
Those locations can be enhanced by technology however , both digital and physical .
What I would like to avoid is the recreation of the natural environments in CG , I do n’t like doing that .
The movie is essentially a journey movie , I think you need to use locations as much as possible .
You ’ll be using WETA Digital for the effects ?
GDT : Yes , the essential elements for keeping continuity are on track , in the last few weeks I ’ve been chatting with a ton of people via email , phone , and in person from the previous films .
People like Andy Serkis , Sir Ian McKellen , Howard Shore , John Howe , Gino Acevedo , Richard Taylor next week I ’m meeting Alan Lee .
I ’m doing this to ensure that whatever we do we keep continuity with the other films , yes it ’s a world that is slightly more golden at the beginning , a very innocent environment .
What I ’m trying to do is keep the elements in place but allow you to feel a progression from ‘ The Hobbit ’ until ‘ The Return of the King ’ .
I believe ‘ The Hobbit ’ is a very crucial volume in The Lord of the Rings , it is a narrative that starts out very much in an innocent and golden way .
It is permeated from England going through World War One , so there is a loss of innocence and a darker tone as the book and the film progresses .
We ’ll be doing that in the first film , taking you from a time of more purity to a darker reality throughout the film , but I think that is in the spirit of the book .
All these guys , Alan Lee , John Howe , these guys are integral for us to map out that progress in the two movies , and allow you to completely blend in to the universe that is already in place .
But this will be a progression , it should not feel at the start of the film that this is the same time ( as the beginning of ‘ Fellowship ’ ) .
50 years in Shire time , is not the same as 50 years in human time , if you think about how our world has changed in only 7 or 8 years , you can think of it as decades of turmoil , those 50 years in Middle - earth .
Do you have any roles cast ?
GDT : Well , I had the most charming meeting with Sir Ian , and all bureaucracy pending , he ’s on board , as is Andy Serkis .
We will continue giving you progress reports as the occur .
It is our intention that we will not lose any of the key elements .
What will differ from your films versus Peter’s ?
The only thing I will be pushing for more in these films that the other three are full animatronics and animatronic creatures enhanced with CGI , as opposed to CGI creatures themselves .
We really want to take the state - of - the - art animatronics and take a leap ten years into the future with the technology we will develop for the creatures in the movie .
We have every intention to do for animatronics and special effects what the other films did for virtual reality .
Another thing people will notice , at the beginning of the film will be the palette , that will be slightly different , the world will be the same but it will be a more ‘ golden ’ world , a more wide - eyed world .
But by no means will we depart from the canon , we will take the three previous films as canon .
When I become part of a world that I love , such as this , I really come with a lot of enthusiasm and hard work , and we know we are recreating and creating a world that is part of the mythos of millions of people and we will approach it as passionately and respectfully as it needs to be taken .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - More than 400 people have been charged in a nationally coordinated probe of mortgage fraud that involved an estimated $ 1 billion in losses , the U.S. Justice Department said on Thursday .
The department , disclosing a 3 1/2 month “ Operation Malicious Mortgage , ” said fraud schemes mostly involved lending fraud , foreclosure rescue scams and mortgage - related bankruptcy schemes .
The 144 cases involved individual examples of mortgage fraud , but the U.S. Corporate Fraud Task Force established in 2002 was also “ responding to issues raised by mortgage fraud in the corporate sector . ”
WASHINGTON  Conservative Republicans in the House plan to urge their colleagues to rally behind a new manifesto that mixes antispending initiatives and tighter restrictions on government benefits as the party seeks a fresh message after a string of election defeats .
Leaders of the Republican Study Committee intend to use a closed - door party meeting on Tuesday to present a seven - point proposal calling for a constitutional limit on federal spending , a new simplified income tax alternative and a proposal to require recipients of food stamps or housing aid to meet work requirements .
“ Clearly , we have been sobered by three special election losses in a row , ” said Representative Jeb Hensarling of Texas , chairman of the group of more than 100 Republican lawmakers .
“ We are sobered by the massive cash advantage that Democrats have to get their message out . ”
Mr. Hensarling said that getting off the political defensive would “ take unity , and it is going to take unity behind a handful of messages . ”
NEW YORK -
The pen , once mightier than the sword , has been getting trounced by the keyboard in the computer era .
Now and then there 's a push toward " pen-based computing " that does n't get very far .
But in a test of the latest crop of pens that combine ink with digital technology , at least one stands out as a useful tool and a complement to the keyboard .
All three pens I tested record what the user writes , and can transfer an image of those notes to a PC .
The standout of the group is the LiveScribe Pulse , which also records audio as you 're writing .
Later , you can tap a place in your notes , and the pen will play back what it was hearing when that was written .
As you can imagine , this is something of a Holy Grail for journalists , who run around with notepads and voice recorders .
A classic problem for us is finding the right place in an audio recording without listening through the whole thing .
The Pulse solves this problem .
Students also should pay attention to this pen .
There is probably no better gadget for taking notes in class , except perhaps a Tablet PC , which allows you to write on the screen .
But Tablet PCs are expensive and more difficult to use than the Pulse , which works with standard Windows PCs .
You can also use it in a more limited fashion without a PC .
A Pulse with 1 gigabyte of memory costs $ 149 from LiveScribe 's Web site .
A model with twice as much memory costs $ 199 , but the cheaper model has room for 35 hours of audio at the highest quality setting , or more than 100 hours at a lower setting , so it 's a good value .
The greatest limitation of the Pulse is that it only works with special paper , preprinted with a pattern of dots .
These are picked up by a small camera in the pen ( this is the reason the pen is about as thick as a cigar ) , which lets it figure out where it is on a page .
The pen comes with a 100 - sheet college - ruled notebook .
You can buy a four - pack of additional notebooks from the site for $ 19.95 .
Later this summer , LiveScribe hopes to make it possible for users to print their own paper .
The dot - sensing technology in the pen comes from a Swedish company , Anoto , and has been incorporated in a number of pens from other companies .
Another example is the Nokia Digital Pen SU - 27W , which uses Bluetooth technology to transfer notes to a cell phone .
Dash off a message on one of the small notepads that come with the $ 299.95 pen , and you can send it as a text message or as picture message through the phone .
The utility of this is hard to grasp .
For your note to be converted to a text message , the phone needs to guess at what your handwriting means .
If you use block letters , it does a decent job , but any sort of cursive will confuse it , and no wonder — even powerful computers can have a hard time interpreting handwriting .
You can bypass the text conversion by sending the note as a picture , but you really do n't need a $ 299.95 pen and a special notepad to do that , just a cell - phone with autofocus camera .
Write your note on any kind of paper , photograph it and send it off .
Not as legible as text message , but more personal , for sure .
The Nokia pen can also transfer the notes to a PC , and does a decent job of this , but I really missed the audio - recording feature of the Pulse .
The third pen , the Iogear Mobile Digital Scribe , uses a completely different technology .
It does n't need preprinted paper .
Instead , you attach a small " clip " with an LCD screen to the notepad you 're using .
The pen , which is the size of a regular ballpoint , signals its position to the clip using ultrasonic pulses and invisible infrared light .
Connect the clip to your computer to transfer the notes .
The major virtue of this is that it can be used with any notepad .
But as with the Nokia pen , the utility is questionable .
If you need to save your notes on the PC , you can photograph them or scan them without using a digital pen .
The pen does make the process easier , and the notes are clearer , but here and there I found that the clip missed part of a letter .
By tethering the clip to the computer , you can use the pen to control your mouse cursor , much like the dedicated pen tablets graphics artists use .
This looks fun , but again , it 's not very useful , and dedicated tablets do a better job .
The software that comes with the $ 129.95 Digital Scribe had the supremely annoying habit of launching when the computer started , and sending up an alert bubble every time , saying that the clip was not connected .
This feature could not be turned off .
The LiveScribe Pulse software also had some odd limitations .
I was unable to install it on my work computer because the " My Documents " folder was on another computer in the network .
There 's no way to convert the notes into a text file , or turn notes into e-mail , but you can upload your notes to LiveScribe 's Web site to share them , with audio included .
The LiveScribe , like the other pens , comes with Windows software only .
But at least the Pulse demonstrated that pens can still be relevant .
Sure , you can bring a laptop to a lecture to take notes , but that means you need one eye on the screen .
When writing by hand , it 's much easier to pay attention to the speaker ( and you can draw diagrams too ) .
This is even more important in interviews , where taking notes by hand allows you to maintain more eye contact .
Even in a digital world , that 's important .

The Next 5 Extreme Research Machines You Need to Know
We 've all heard the airport warnings not to leave our bags unattended or accept anything from strangers , so when a priest ran up to my wife , Elaine , as we were waiting to board a plane , and asked her to watch his bags for a minute , an alarm went off in my head .
Perhaps I 'd seen too many action movies , but my first thought was " terrorist ! "
She , of course , had thought nothing of it ; had smiled and nodded and said she'd be happy to look after them .
So it came as a shock when I told her that we had to tell the man at the check - in counter what had happened .
" It 's expressly forbidden , " I said .
" He should know better than that . "
" But he 's a priest , " she said .
" You mean he looks like a priest , " I said .
" What better disguise could you have ? "
Reluctantly , Elaine went over to the counter and told the airline representative what had happened , and he came and took the bags .
I did n't really expect sirens to go off or a SWAT team to come rushing over , but I was surprised to notice that he simply put the bags behind the counter and called someone on the telephone .
Perhaps five minutes went by .
Gradually , I became aware that a large man sitting across from us was staring at me .
" He looked like a regular priest to me , " he finally said .
I nodded and smiled , not wanting to be drawn into an argument .
The bags were still behind the counter where the man had put them .
Why was n't something being done about them ?
And where was the priest ?
I was beginning to feel both foolish and angry at the same time .
When airport security started being tightened up a few years ago , I had joked about an umbrella I was carrying .
" Do n't you want to examine this ? "
I 'd said .
" After all , it could be full of illegal drugs – or high explosives . "
Another security guard rushed over and told me that I could be taken in for questioning for saying such a thing , that it was no joking matter .
And he was dead serious .
When the priest appeared a few minutes later , Elaine ushered him over to where they 'd put his bags .
I could see , the flight representative was chewing him out , but nicely .
They were n't going to drag him off somewhere or even , apparently , search his bags .
I was beginning to feel more and more foolish .
The priest looked befuddled .
He was an older man – thin , ascetic - looking .
The airline representative seemed to be having a tough time explaining the situation to him .
When the priest came over with his bags and sat down , both Elaine and I avoided eye contact with him .
Later , as we were sitting in the plane , the priest walked past us .
" I 'm sorry , " Elaine said to him , but he did n't acknowledge her in any way .
Was he deaf , perhaps ?
Or just angry ?
Disillusioned ?
Disappointed that even a priest is no longer above suspicion ?
So what are you supposed to do ?
I thought .
Use your own judgment ?
And what if he had been a terrorist ?
Was n't it better to have embarrassed the man , slightly , not to mention Elaine and myself , than to have us all go up in smoke ?
Of course .
And yet if I had to set up a good airport security system , I 'm not certain just what I 'd do .

Polymorphic relationships in Ruby on Rails are great .
If you do n't know what they are , check them out here :
Understanding Polymorphic Associations
John and I were curious about the speed of these relations , since the linking between objects searches on both the ID of the foreign object , and a string which is the model name .
So if you have two tables , ChildA and ChildB , your parent has a reference to child which is acutally the combination of child_id ( the ID in the ChildA or ChildB table ) and child_type ( equal to " ChildA " or " ChildB " ) .
The old - school way of doing this involves creating a lookup table and using integer IDs for type , instead of strings .
So you 'd have another table mapping " ChildA " to " 1 " and " ChildB " to " 2 " , then when you do your query , you are matching against the number " 1 " and not the string " ChildA " .
The down side of doing it that way is that you do n't get to use Rails ' snazzy polymorphism , which makes life a lot easier .
So we decided to run some tests to see how much faster it would be , and therefore , if it was worth it .
I created a Rails application that sets up four tables in the database :
A table with an Integer ID and a String Type
A table with an Integer ID and a String Type and an index on the type
A table with an Integer ID and an Integer Type
A table with an Integer ID and an Integer Type and an index on the type
My benchmarking procedure is as follows :
Setup the number of records , N Setup the number of types , T Create N records , such that for each type there is an entry with ID 1 , 2 , 3 and so on .
So you have
Type 1 : ID 1
Type 2 : ID 1
Type 1 : ID 2
Type 2 : ID 2
etc Insert all of these records in a random order Retrieve the records in a different random order via
Model.find ( : first , : conditions= > { : id => id , : type => type} )
I made use of the Ruby benchmarking library to time this process for each table .
I have some preliminary results from running the test quickly , which shows a 500 % speedup for using an index , and a 5 % speedup for using integers instead of strings .
In my opinion , polymorphism in Rails is worth 5 % .
And adding an index is definitely worth 500 % .
I mean , what is n't worth 500 % ?
That was based on just 1,000 records .
I am running it on 100,000 records now , but each table takes 1 - 2 hours to run .
If you 'd like to play with my code , here is a link to it on GitHub :

The Dust Bowl drought of the 1930s was arguably one of the worst environmental disasters of the 20th century .
New computer simulations reveal the whipped - up dust is what made the drought so severe .
Scientists have known that poor land use and natural atmospheric conditions led to the rip-roaring dust storms in the Great Plains in the 1930s .
Climate models in the past few years also have revealed the effect of sea surface temperatures on the Dust Bowl .
" What is new and what had not been done before is to work out whether the dust storms from the drought and land use had any impact on the drought , " said Richard Seager of Lamont - Doherty Earth Observatory ( LDEO ) in New York .
And they did .
" You had dust storms that were unprecedented in the recent historical record , " said lead researcher Benjamin Cook of NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies .
" So it was on the level of dust emissions that nobody in living memory and probably much before that had ever seen . "
Using computer simulations , Cook , Seager and Ronald Miller of LDEO found the " black blizzards " exacerbated the drought and pushed it northward into the Great Plains .
The airborne dust particles reflected sunlight back into space , leading to cooler surface temperatures .
As temperatures dipped , so did evaporation .
" You basically cut off the moisture source to clouds and precipitation , " Cook said .
Following the Dust Bowl disaster , agencies enacted land - use rules to reduce soil erosion and prevent further such catastrophic dust storms in the United States .
Even so , the researchers say , global warming and an increased pressure to expand agriculture in light of a possible food crisis are creating conditions ripe for dust storms in other regions worldwide .
" This is the type of phenomenon that potentially we could start seeing in places like China , " Cook told LiveScience , " where you 're having some desertification problems , and you 're having a lot of land degradation . "
The study , detailed online in the journal Geophysical Research Letters , was funded by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration ( NOAA ) , National Science Foundation ( NSF ) and NASA .

Those of you who play our puzzles may already know of " asmit " as the name at the top of many of our leader boards .
Asmit , real name Arian Smit , clearly knows a thing or two about Scrabble , and he 's been investigating a question for us that many players have pondered : " What is the highest possible scoring Scrabble move ? "
What follows is Arian 's findings , and how in a single move you can score a whopping 2044 points !
In the " Atlantic Monthly " of June 1987 Barry Chamish wrote an article " Masters of the Tile " .
He mentioned that ' The Scrabble Players News in 1982 asked its readers to find the highest possible score for one turn using words that appear in the OSPD .
All across America players worked on the problem ' and came up with a high score of 613 points .
Somehow no player had considered using the triple - triple - triple word score !
One reader responded to Barry a few weeks later that with the word " sesquioxidizing " , and a bit of luck , you could score around 1960 points .
According to Wikipedia , Gyles Brandreth 's 1984 book " The Scrabble Omnibus " reports this word already , and may have been the source of this reader 's response .
Barry 's article and its reader responses set me off to find a 2004 point play with " sesquioxidizing " .
This was some time ago , and with the availability of downloadable word lists , this job is now much easier .
Googling for high scrabble scores , you 'll find many links to fun -with - words , which contains a 1962 point theoretical play credited to the New Zealand top Scrabble player Jeff Grant .
It uses no fewer than 11 words neither in SOWPODS , nor the Oxford English Dictionary , nor at onelook.com .
The main word " benzoxycamphor " used in this solution does n't make sense as a chemical and may be " benzyloxycamphor " misspelled .
The highest score they report using only words found in the massive SOWPODS word list is 1682 points .
A far more serious attempt can be found here , which reports 1778 points for the word " oxyphenbutazone " using the smaller American Scrabble dictionary ( TWL06 ) only .
Using only words from TWL06 and only possible though unlikely moves for the entire game , I found a 1780 points play with the rack ABEOPXZ to make oxyphenbutazone :
1780 points with TWL words only
Just 2 points higher than the previous record , but hey .
With the SOWPODS dictionary there are several ways to reach a somewhat disappointing 1785 points with the same rack , including :
1785 points with SOWPODS words only and Another 1785 points with SOWPODS words only
Sesquioxidizing is not in any official scrabble dictionary , but should be , even if only for its magically positioned q , x and z .
The word lives on the web , it can be found in " The Archive of Endangered , Special , or Fun Words " , with the text : ' the word is derived from the word " sesquioxide " , and thus not found in the dictionary directly ' .
Using sesquioxidizing and otherwise TWL06 words only , on a day that things go your way and with the rack DGIQSXZ one can get 2015 points :
2015 point move with TWL and sesquioxidizing
This time , the bigger SOWPODS dictionary makes a difference .
Words like ' jabberwock (s ) ' , ' talaq ' , ' leylandi( i ) ' , ' highfaluting ' and ' acidulent ' , none of which are in the TWL06 , allow a 2044 points move with the rack DGQSZXI :
2044 point move using SOWPODS and sesquioxidizing sesquioxidizing 27x62 = 1674 jabberwocks 3x31 = 93 talaq = 24 leylandii = 13 portmanteaux 3x23 = 69 overcompensated = 25 fritz = 27 highfaluting 3x23 = 69 7 - letter bonus = 50 ____ Total 2044
Quite possibly some of these above records can still be improved .
There are unconfirmed reports that a 2069 point play was found in 1982 by Josepha Heifez Byrne using sesquioxidizing .

Last night 's ABC News interview with former CIA Agent John Kiriakou has raised more than a few eyebrows .
Perhaps Steve Benen at The Carpetbagger Report gets it exactly right when he wrote :
As a matter of crass politics , Kiriakou ’s assessment seems to offer a little something for everyone .
For the right , Kiriakou is saying that torture produced intelligence that saved lives and thwarted possible attacks .
For the left , Kiriakou is conceding that the Bush administration authorized and utilized torture ( i.e. , committed a felony ) , and he now believes the U.S. should stop using these “ enhanced interrogation techniques . ”
There is , however , one angle that warrants a closer look : whether torturing Zubaydah actually produced actionable intelligence .
The answer is far from clear .
It may be that Kiriakou is merely a plant to help the CIA 's battered reputation , and that if investigations should ever go anywhere ( as they just might ) the blame will go elsewhere .
Judge for yourself in this excerpt in what was a lengthy interview .
Khaled al - Masri says he has been traumatised by his experiences A German citizen has gone to court in an attempt to force his government to seek the extradition of 13 suspected CIA agents who allegedly kidnapped him .
Khaled al - Masri says he was abducted in December 2003 , flown to a US detention centre in Afghanistan and tortured .
Mr Masri was released in May 2004 after his captors allegedly told him he had been mistaken for someone else .
In September , the justice ministry decided not to pursue arrest warrants issued for the suspected CIA agents .
A spokeswoman , Eva Schmierer , said the ministry had been told by Washington that any extradition would jeopardise " American national interests " .
I just want the German government to acknowledge what happened to me
Khaled al - Masri
Q&A : CIA jails allegations
The new civil suit launched by German and US civil rights lawyers representing Mr Masri seeks to force the German government to reconsider the extradition requests it issued in January 2007 .
Mr Masri said that he was angry that , four years after the incident , no government had recognised his ordeal .
" I just want the German government to acknowledge what happened to me , " he told reporters .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel has said the US government has acknowledged making a mistake with Mr Masri .
However , in October the US Supreme Court dismissed Mr Masri 's appeal against the ruling of lower courts not to hear his case on national security grounds .
' Salt pit '
Mr Masri says his case is an example of the US policy of " extraordinary rendition " - a practice whereby the US government flies foreign terror suspects to third countries without judicial process for interrogation or detention .
He says he was kidnapped in the Macedonian capital , Skopje , in 2003 , flown to a secret prison in Afghanistan , nicknamed the " salt pit " and tortured there .
On his flight to Afghanistan , he says , he was stripped , beaten , shackled , made to wear nappies and drugged .
Mr Masri says he was finally released in Albania five months later after the CIA realised they had got the wrong man .
He told the BBC in February 2007 he had been " traumatised " by his experiences .

Clinton urging delegates to back Obama , not releasing them [ Corrected ]
Hillary Clinton told her convention delegates on a conference call last night that they should support Barack Obama .
" She did a call with delegates to thank them for all of their hard work during the campaign , to celebrate all we accomplished , and to urge them -- as she did on Saturday -- to do everything they can to elect Barack Obama , " Clinton spokesman Mo Elleithee confirmed .
UPDATE : I 'd initially failed to grasp a technicality here : Clinton has not formally released her delegates .
Harold Ickes started the call , a Clinton aide said , saying they were n't being released , citing historical precedence we discussed and saying we wanted everyone to stay united to keep fighting for the issues .
A pledged delegate from San Francisco who was on the call , David Serrano Sewall , emails while Clinton expressed her support for Obama , Ickes said " delegates can do what they want , any delegate can , but wanted us to hang with Hillary for now . "
The Clinton aide said there 's no power play here : Clinton just wants to make sure her supporters are slated in state delegates and sent to Denver .
Her camp pointed to precedent : Bradley in 2000 and Dean in 2004 did n't formally release their delegates until the convention itself .
A Japanese student abducted last year in Iran has been freed , Tehran 's intelligence minister has said .
The 23 - year - old was travelling alone in south - eastern Iran when he was kidnapped by an armed group in October .
He had crossed into Iran after travelling in Pakistan and at the time he called the Japanese embassy in Tehran to say he had been captured .
Iran 's lawless border regions with Afghanistan and Pakistan are a major smuggling route for drugs .
Iran 's Intelligence Minister Gholam Hossein Mohseni Ejeie told the official Irna news agency that the release was the work of Iranian intelligence personnel .
" A Japanese tourist who was kidnapped by drug smugglers and armed bandits in the east of the country ... was released , " he said
" The main elements behind the kidnapping were arrested and those bandits on the run in Pakistan were forced to release the Japanese citizen . "

When it comes to notorious Bush political appointees , Daniel Troy ’s name does n’t usually make the top - 10 list , overshadowed as he is by more high profile cronies such as FEMA ’s Michael Brown .
But for three years in the president ’s first term , Troy served as the chief counsel to the Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) , where he quietly advanced a legal revolution that is playing out in earnest in the U.S. Supreme Court this year .
This revolution has the potential to affect the health and safety of the nation ’s citizens for years to come , all while making Troy a rich man .
In fact , his career is an illustration of how the Bush administration ’s revolving door has allowed industry lawyers to radically reshape regulatory agencies to benefit the big businesses they once represented and then profit from those changes when they return to the private sector .
Back in 2001 , when the president tapped Troy for the FDA , Bush made history for turning the general counsel ’s job into a political appointment , when most of the previous occupants of the position had been civil servants .
The appointment was a sign that the president intended to impose a political agenda on the agency .
A former clerk to Robert Bork , Troy was a die - hard conservative who had spent most of his career suing the FDA on behalf of drug and tobacco companies over regulations those industries did n’t care for .
Before going to the FDA , he had worked at the D.C. powerhouse law firm of Wiley , Rein & Fielding , where he represented a number of pharmaceutical companies , including Pfizer , which paid the firm more than $ 350,000 for Troy ’s services the year he was appointed to the FDA .
A year after the ban on working on matters involving former clients had passed , Troy quickly got to work helping out the drug companies who used to pay his fees .
Under Troy ’s leadership , the FDA started showing up in state courts , offering briefs in civil cases on the side of drug companies being sued by people who ’d been injured by dangerous prescription drugs and other medical devices .
In an unprecedented move , agency lawyers argued that because those products had been approved by the FDA , such lawsuits were “ preempted ” by federal law and should be dismissed .
Troy ’s FDA was promoting the idea that tort lawsuits in state court interfere with federal regulatory authority by letting judges and juries second - guess decisions over drug labeling and approval made by the experts in federal agencies .
The drug companies were arguing , with the agency ’s help , that FDA approval for a product should be the gold standard and that if companies meet that standard , they should n’t be subjected to the rules of 50 different states trying to impose their own health and safety standards through lawsuits .
Promoting preemption is a radical new policy for the FDA , which has long believed that , far from interfering with its mission , state tort lawsuits actually enhanced public safety by providing a financial incentive for companies to comply with federal regulations .
Troy ’s predecessor , Margaret Porter , a career official , wrote in 1997 that the agency had a long - standing policy against preemption , because “ even the most thorough regulation of a product such as a critical medical device may fail to identify potential problems presented by the product … .
Preemption of all such [ tort liability ] claims would result in the loss of a significant layer of consumer protection . ”
The Bush administration has embraced preemption largely because it allows the White House to use its regulatory power to achieve what big businesses have n’t been able to do through legislation , which is immunize themselves from lawsuits over defective products .
In recent years , federal agencies , dominated by industry insiders , have written preemption language into safety regulations , from rules issued by the Consumer Products Safety Commission governing mattress flammability to those introduced by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration on seat - belt placement and automobile - roof strength .
In fact , while the NHTSA was run by a former lawyer for DaimlerChrysler , it issued a roof - strength regulation that was so weak the only possible explanation for its issuance was that it was designed to help auto manufacturers head off lawsuits .
Even the EPA has gotten into the act , once filing a brief on behalf of Dow chemical supporting its preemption defense in a case before the Supreme Court in 2005 .
But no federal agency has pursued a preemption agenda as aggressively as the FDA did when Troy worked there .
In 2003 , he appeared at a conference of defense lawyers and in - house legal counsels from drug companies and publicly invited them to contact his office if they had a case the FDA could help them out with .
“ We ca n’t afford to get involved in every case , ” he said , according to an affidavit written by someone who was there .
“ We have to pick our shots … so make it sound like a Hollywood pitch . ”
During Troy ’s tenure , between August 2001 and November 2004 , the FDA participated in several private lawsuits , including one involving Pfizer , and argued that state courts and juries were illegally usurping federal regulatory power by trying to impose safety standards on drugs or medical devices approved by the FDA .
The results of Troy ’s intervention in the state court suits were mixed , but , to be sure , the FDA ’s position bolstered the drug companies ’ position .
Troy ’s work at the FDA did n’t go unnoticed .
In 2004 , after he attracted some negative publicity for coming to the aid of his former client Pfizer in a lawsuit , Rep. Maurice Hinchey ( D - N.Y. ) attempted to defund his office .
In November of that year , Troy retreated to private practice , where he continues to counsel companies regulated by the FDA .
But before he left , he ensured that the preemption doctrine was firmly enshrined at the FDA in regulatory language covering drug labeling .
The “ preemption preamble , ” as it ’s known , states that this rule preempts all state tort lawsuits against manufacturers who make drugs approved by the FDA .
The regulation allows drug companies to invoke the FDA ’s approval to beat back lawsuits without actually having to get the agency to enter the case .
This is a hedge against future Democratic presidents who might want to institute a change of course .
The preamble was inserted into the regulation without any public input .
Since then , lawyers have repeatedly invoked it when defending companies against personal - injury lawsuits .
The courts have not swallowed Troy ’s work whole hog .
Several courts have rejected the preemption argument outright , and as a result the Supreme Court , which has not been especially sympathetic to injured plaintiffs , recently decided to clear up the confusion .
Its most significant ruling arrived in late February in Riegel v. Medtronic .
The case was filed by the family of Charles Riegel , who was injured when a balloon catheter burst during an angioplasty .
He later died , and his wife sued the manufacturer , alleging that the catheter was defective .
The court ruled for the manufacturer in an 8 - 1 decision , siding with Troy , who filed an amicus brief on behalf of the medical - device industry arguing that because the device had received premarket approval from the FDA , private lawsuits in state court were preempted .
The decision effectively wipes out pending litigation over everything from faulty pacemakers to defective insulin pumps .
But the decision is a huge boon to Medtronic , a company whose conduct in the marketplace has hardly been stellar .
Not only has it been accused of bribing surgeons to use its products , but the FDA has recalled a host of the company ’s products .
Now , people who have been injured by some of Medtronic ’s products will have no way of forcing the company to pick up the tab .
Last week , the Supreme Court heard arguments in a second preemption case , Kent v. Warner - Lambert , which was filed by Michigan residents injured by the recalled diabetes drug Rezulin .
Michigan bans lawsuits against drug and medical - device manufacturers for products approved by the FDA , but it has an exemption allowing suits to proceed if the manufacturer won approval of a product by engaging in fraud .
Troy ’s firm represents Warner - Lambert in the case .
On behalf of the government , the U.S. solicitor general argued that even conning the FDA into approving a product was n’t a good enough reason to allow a suit proceed .
On Monday , the court upheld a Second Circuit court decision permitting the case to move forward .
But the decision was hardly a reason for plaintiffs and consumer advocates to rejoice .
The only reason the defendants did n’t prevail was because Chief Justice John Roberts owns stock in Warner - Lambert ’s parent company , Pfizer , and had to recuse himself .
In all likelihood , he would have voted with the other conservatives in favor of the manufacturer .
The 4 - 4 decision does n’t bode well for the plaintiffs in another coming drug case that the justices decided to take up , much to the surprise of veteran court watchers .
The plaintiff in Wyeth v. Levine is a musician who won a multimillion - dollar jury verdict after her arm was amputated due to an improperly administered drug .
The drug company , Wyeth , is arguing that the verdict should be overturned because the FDA ’s 2006 preemption preamble on drug labeling bans such lawsuits .
If Wyeth wins , essentially all private , state - court lawsuits over dangerous drugs and medical devices will be wiped out — and a window into the workings of the companies poorly regulated by the FDA will be boarded up .
Indeed , the underlying assumption behind preemption is that federal regulatory agencies actually do a good job of protecting the public , when there is a host of evidence suggesting that ’s not the case .
In fact , it ’s been the very private lawsuits that big companies want to eliminate that have often led to major efforts to strengthen the nation ’s health and safety net .
If the Supreme Court follows Troy ’s lead , it wo n’t just be pharmaceutical and medical - device lawsuits that are affected .
A ruling for the drug company in Levine could also limit lawsuits over everything from toxic chemical exposure to tainted beef — a pretty grim scenario for the average consumer .
And there ’s reason to believe the court will do just that .
During the oral arguments in the Kent case last week , Justice Stephen Breyer , one of the high court ’s most liberal justices , showed little sympathy for the plaintiffs or confidence in juries .
“ Who would you rather have make this decision as to whether this drug is , on balance , going to save people or , on balance , going to hurt people ? ” he asked .
“ An expert agency , on the one hand , or 12 people pulled randomly for a jury role who see before them only the people whom the drug hurt and do n’t see those who need the drug to cure them ? ”
The arguments showed how successful Troy and other preemption advocates have been in changing the focus on the legal debate , from providing recourse to those injured by faulty products to protecting the companies that make them .
They have launched a legal revolution that is as profound as the consumer protection movement Ralph Nader touched off in the 1960s and ’ 70s , only the beneficiaries are the big corporations that want to escape the last remaining check on their work : private lawsuits .
The Supreme Court ’s decision in Riegel and its move to take up the other preemption cases suggests that the revolution is indeed having a transformative effect .

The cliche is that “ one man ’s trash is another man ’s treasure ” but the author of that phrase probably never realized how strangely true it could turn out to be in the form of artistic upcycling .
In today ’s world of weird and amazing art some of the most compelling and creative works have been born out of the simplest and most abundant of materials : garbage .
These seven trash - obsessed artists may have had a similar starting point but have managed to create an inspiring variety of art from abandoned refuse .
And see more under our collection of 70 Works of Recycled Art and Design .
HA Schult ’s haunting ‘ trash people ’ have graced the streets of many of the world ’s most major cities … silently open to interpretation as they travel the world and sit everywhere from the parks of New York City to the Great Wall of China .
It took Schult 6 months and 30 assistants to create these strange sculptures from crushed cans , computer parts and virtually anything else he could appropriate to assemble them .
What is their purpose and meaning ?
It is difficult to say , but they are certainly trans - cultural and intended to engage , inspire and engender reflection in those who see them and are a foil to see the reactions of different nations and groups of people .
Tim Noble and Sue Webster are an incredible artistic duo based in England who have worked on a variety of related projects experimenting with trash and projected shadows .
From looking at the rubbish they collect from the streets of London it is virtually impossible to determine a rhyme or reason to the apparent mess .
However , once a projector is set up at just the right angle the art pops to life and animated shades are created with crisp and clear outlines delineating the controlled forms hidden with chaos .
Robbie Rowlands is one of a number of artists who had a rare opportunity to do whatever they wanted to a building that was soon to be demolished .
The Depot project questions the nature of the world around us and the everyday stable objects we take for granted – such as the interior structure of our dwelling spaces .
He ( quite literally ) peels back the layers of everyday reality to reveal surfaces not typically meant to be seen .
Based in Melbourne , Robbie studied at the Pratt Institute in New York and has been working ever since .
Dr. Evermor ‘s Forevertron ( previously featured as a work of insane architectural genius ) has elements of trash dating back to Thomas Edison and the Apollo space missions .
These are combined to create one of the most amazing metal sculpture parks in the world – which also features the world ’s largest metal sculpture ( 120 feet by 60 feet and 50 feet tall , weighing 320 tons ) .
It should come as no surprise that , prior to retirement , this eccentric artist was a professional wrecking and salvage expert .
Of course using trash as a basis for art does n’t have to mean creating works from the objects themselves .
An additive approach can also work as in the graffitied pieces of furniture shown above .
In fact , the Wooster Collective encourages you to graffiti the urban objects around you and turn your own local trash into art ( see the link above for more information ) .
The above trash sculpture was created from recycled carrier bags as part of the Eden Project near Cornwall .
Of course , trash ‘ art ’ is n’t limited to strange sculptures and architectural deconstructions .
There is also a great deal of creative recycled urban furniture to keep an eye on not to mention some amazing works of recycled architecture created from bottles , cans , tires and basically any scrap that one can find in bulk .
Petrol is a product derived from petroleum through a process called fractional distillation .
Petroleum includes crude oil and many other fuels and needs to be separated through what is known as a fractionating column .
Petroleum is found when drilling for oil and is then taken and distilled into many fuels such as petrol , kerosene to chemicals used to make plastic .
It is estimated that we use around 95 million barrels of oil a day worldwide .
Engines that use petrol work in a different way to diesel engines .
Petrol engines are spark ignition internal combustion engines , meaning that the fuel is ignited through a spark from a spark plug .
If the ignition happens early or is mistimed then a metallic pinging noise is heard , known as knocking .
This can damage the engine badly , and if you notice it let your garage know so they can advise on the next step .
The petrol that we see on the forecourts is a product of petroleum and is a different fuel to diesel , even though it is made from the same base product .
Petrol types are measured in octane numbers and ratings depending on the resistance to autoignition .
A Deadly Philosophy
Humans are the only species that systematically murders its own for ideological reasons .
More than 50 million people were victims of mass murder in the 20th century , making it the deadliest century on record .
That included the Ottoman Turks ’ murder of 1.5 million Armenians , the Nazis ’ extermination of six million Jews , Mao ’s murder of 30 million Chinese , and the Khmer Rouge ’s destruction of 1.7 million Cambodians .
The list goes on .*
Some of these deaths had to do with land and water and such , but most did not .
Most were over philosophy .
Why would this be ?
Philosophy is not threatening in any literal sense ; it ca n’t maim or make you die , even when it ’s very different from your view .
Psychologists are very interested in this paradox :
Why is philosophy — or worldview , or ideology — so threatening ?
Put another way , what are the cognitive and emotional underpinnings of mass murder and genocide ?
One emerging theory suggests that genocide may make sense , at least on an emotional level .
Think of it this way .
Besides being the only animal to murder on principle , humans are also the only animal cognitively advanced enough to understand mortality .
We all know we are going to die , and there is absolutely nothing we can do to prevent this .
That fact should be utterly terrifying , so terrifying that we should be paralyzed by fear and trembling .
But we ’re not .
We get up every morning , dress and groom ourselves , go to work , play with the kids , and so forth .
How do we manage this ?
Well , one way we manage is by constructing meaning , and we do that by imagining a meaningful world .
That ’s called philosophy — or religion , or whatever .
Humans are meaning - making creatures .
The problem occurs when our carefully constructed philosophy is threatened .
And the greatest threat to a belief system is , well , an alternative belief system .
To put it bluntly , your unfamiliar worldview makes me keenly aware of my mortality ; it threatens my very existence .
So why should n’t I wish you dead ?
Philosophy is personal .
Scientists have actually been studying this entanglement of personal mortality and cultural hatred in the lab , with some interesting results .
Here ’s a recent experiment by Joseph Hayes and his colleagues at the University of Alberta , Canada .
These psychologists wanted to explore whether a philosophical threat could indeed conjure up thoughts of death , and further whether those thoughts might be quelled by actual annihilation of the philosophical “ enemy . ”
To explore this , they recruited devout Christians for an experiment .
They had these Christians read an actual news story about the “ Muslimization of Nazareth ” :
The article described how Jesus ’s birthplace had become largely a Muslim city , and how the dominant ( and militant ) Muslim population was marginalizing the Christians who remained .
The idea was that this unwelcome news about a holy Christian landmark would threaten the Christian readers ’ worldview — and in turn their personal security .
And indeed it appears it did .
After they had read about Nazareth , they all took a psychological test that gauges preoccupation with thoughts of death and dying .
As reported in the May issue of the journal Psychological Science , those who had read the report were much more morbid in their imagery than those who had not .
They were also much more derogatory toward Muslims than were Christians who had not read the news .
So that ’s pretty unsettling in itself .
But here ’s where it gets really interesting .
Hayes and his colleagues then told half of the participants another bit of news , only in this case it was made up .
They told them that an airplane had crashed on its way to Nazareth , killing all 117 devout Muslims aboard .
When they crunched the data , they found that those who had “ witnessed ” the annihilation of the Muslims were significantly less morbid in their thinking and significantly less derogatory toward Muslims .
Put another way , knowing of the violent death of the Muslims effectively undid the perceived threat to the Christians ’ philosophy and well - being .
It restored meaning and security to their lives .
Is n't it possible that the plane crash simply made the Christians more sympathetic toward the Muslims , at least temporarily ?
The psychologists actually considered and rejected this idea , based on a surprising finding .
The Christians who read about Nazareth became increasingly negative not only toward Muslims , but also toward Buddhists and Hindus and atheists .
That is , they became antagonistic toward any worldview that questioned the absolute validity of Christianity .
What 's more , those who read the fabricated story about the plane crash were less disparaging of all these worldviews .
Since no Hindus or Buddhists or atheists perished in the crash , there would be no reason for the Christians to feel sympathy toward these people .
So our brain fights death with death .
It reasons that if an enemy dies , his philosophy must have been perverse or weak or just plain wrong , and thus no real threat to our superior worldview — nor to our life and limb .
It ’s a powerful psychological defense .
In real life , of course , it just raises the ante .
It ’s tit for tat , and the new century starts counting its genocide victims .

( CNNMoney.com ) -- Wachovia Corp. is being investigated by Federal prosecutors as part of a probe into alleged drug money laundering by Mexican and Colombian money - transfer companies , according to a Wall Street Journal report Saturday morning .
A Wachovia ( WB , Fortune 500 ) official said the bank is cooperating in the probe , which is also scrutinizing several other large U.S. banks , according to the newspaper .
The bank severed its ties to these money transfer firms in December and January , when the investigation began .
The U.S. banking industry has pursued a foothold in the remittance industry , which transmits more than $ 50 billion from the U.S. to Latin America annually - primarily on behalf of immigrants sending money back to their families .
The industry charges high fees to transfer these funds .
But , the Journal said , remittance outfits can also be used by narcotics traffickers seeking to move the proceeds of drug sales between the U.S. and Latin America .
Tough times
The probe comes at a difficult time for the bank , which announced on Friday that it will pay $ 144 million to settle federal charges that it failed to stop telemarketers from taking advantage of thousands of elderly consumers .
On April 14 , the North Carolina - based bank posted a $ 350 million loss in the first quarter - its first quarterly loss since 2001 .
Wachovia took a $ 2 billion charge for " market - disruption " losses in the quarter , and also signaled difficulties with Golden West Financial , which Wachovia acquired in 2006 for $ 24.6 billion .
Golden
West was a leading issuer of so - called option adjusted rate mortgages ( ARMs ) - loans that give borrowers the right to pay less than the full bill .
Wachovia boosted its reserve for possible loan losses on Golden West 's portfolio , valued at roughly $ 120 billion , to $ 1.1 billion , as late payments nearly doubled to 3.1 % of the loans .
In the wake of these problems , the bank cut its dividend and said it plans to raise $ 7 billion in capital .
When Taco Trucks Are Outlawed , Only Outlaws Will Have Tacos
James Joyner · · 13 comments
Los Angeles County has strengthened its law against taco trucks and other mobile food vendors at the insistence of brick - and - mortar restaurant owners , Jonathan Gold reports .
Last week , led by Gloria Molina , the L.A. County Board of Supervisors passed a law basically outlawing taco trucks , making it a crime for them to linger at one location for more than an hour , punishable by a $ 1,000 fine or up to six months in prison .
( An old law directed trucks to move every half - hour , but the fine was low and the law largely ignored . )
Taco trucks , at least the better - known ones , tend to be anchored to a specific location , often outside a nightclub .
( If you are on Lexington at Western , you are eating at El Matador ; if on Eagle Rock south of York , probably at Rambo ’s Tacos . )
Owners of brick - and - mortar restaurants are always complaining about unfair competition from vendors with lower overhead and fewer taxes to pay , although most of the really successful trucks seem to flourish in neighborhoods without many restaurants : on industrial strips , along stretches dominated by auto shops , light manufacturing and discount upholsterers .
California has seen squabbles like this before — it took extensive legal action to get taco trucks back on the streets of Salinas after restaurant owners there managed to get them banned .
One would think that people seeking to have a nice , sit - down meal are unlikely to be siphoned off by the lure of mobile tacos and that , conversely , those seeking a quick , cheap bite to eat are unlikely customers for a full service restaurant .
Presumably , though , fast food restaurants would feel the pinch .
I ’m not a fan of rent seeking of this sort but can at least understand why tax paying restaurateurs would organize against competitors who are given relatively preferential treatment by the state .
It would seem , though , that the construction of this law is too broad .
Why not simply require comparable licensing for “ permanent ” mobile establishments and stationary restaurants ?
Or restrict the application of the law as currently written only to trucks operating within , say , a half mile of a fixed facility ?

It appears the relentless promotional blitz surrounding Sex And The City movie has reached saturation point for some - and it has n't even opened in cinemas yet .
New York 's Time
Out magazine , which has a reputation for capturing the city 's Zeitgeist , has hit stands promising a Sex And The City free edition ( albeit using an image of the women on the cover ) .
With Sarah Jessica Parker and co's mouths all taped up under the strap line " No Sex ! " , the magazine declares " Enough already - we love 'em , but it 's just too much . "

Boycott : the latest edition of New York 's Time Out has promised a ' Carrie - free ' edition
It goes on to give New Yorkers suggestions for " guaranteed Carrie - free " ways to enjoy their city .
A Big Apple backlash has been brewing since the city was passed over for the world premiere of the movie in favour of London , which took place in Leicester Square on Monday night .
Organisers were forced to defend the decision , with a spokesperson saying : " It was simply a question of logistics and scheduling .
We 're still planning the big premiere to be in New York . "

Here ’s some “ shocking ” news for those of you who still believe in the tooth - fairy or that substantial “ principled differences ” exist between Democrats and Republicans .
Politico reported Tuesday ,
House Democrats who flipped their votes to support retroactive immunity for telecom companies in last week ’s FISA bill took thousands of dollars more from phone companies than Democrats who consistently voted against legislation with an immunity provision .
( Chris Frates , “ Dems Who Flipped on FISA Immunity See More Telecom Cash , ” Politico , June 24 , 2008 )
According to MAPLight , a watchdog group “ that tracks the connection between campaign contributions and legislative outcomes , ” the 94 Democrats who changed their position on telecom immunity “ received on average $ 8,359 in contributions from Verizon , AT&T and Sprint from January , 2005 , to March , 2008 . ”
Despite congressional bromides about “ national security ” and “ keeping America safe , ” what it all comes down too is cold , hard cash .
Considering that legislation passed last week by the House will effectively quash some 40 lawsuits pending against telecom giants –with potential savings for these corporate grifters running into the billions –it does n’t take a rocket scientist to conclude its a rigged game .
And despite efforts Wednesday by Senators Christopher Dodd ( D - CT ) and Russ Feingold ( D - WI ) to mount a filibuster against this onerous legislation , the Associated Press reports that 80 senators voted in favor of beginning debate while “ only 15 senators tried to kill the bill by blocking debate . ”
And with Senate “ leaders ” such as Harry Reid ( D - NV ) and Dianne Feinstein ( D - CA ) pressing for a Thursday vote , passage is a near certainty .
How do Democratic “ leaders ” spin the fabulous prizes showered on “ team players ” in the House ?
Politico ’s Chris Frates reports ,
Nick Papas , spokesman for the House Democratic Caucus , said , “ Many members of the caucus opposed the earlier version of this legislation and ultimately supported better legislation that was the product of bipartisan negotiations .
Months of hard work , not campaign contributions , earned the support of many members . ”
But MAPLight executive director Daniel Newman told Politico , “ unlike pressure from constituents , campaign cash is not a ‘ democratic influence ’ . ”
Indeed !
But just for kicks , let ’s take a peek at a list of the Top 10 Democrats who changed their vote to support telecom immunity .
MAPLight breaks it down by boodle received and congressional district :
PAC contributions from Verizon , AT&T , and Sprint ( January 2005 - March 2008 ) .
01 . $ 29,500 ; James Clyburn , ( SC - 6 ) .
02 . $ 29,000 ; Steny Hoyer , ( MD - 5 ) .
03 . $ 28,000 ; Rahm Emanuel , ( IL - 5 ) .
04 . $ 27,500 , Frederick Boucher , ( VA - 9 ) .
05 . $ 26,000 , Gregory Meeks , ( NY - 6 ) .
06 . $ 24,000 , Joseph Crowley ( NY - 7 ) .
07 . $ 24,500 , Nancy Pelosi , ( CA - 8 ) .
08 . $ 24,000 , Melissa Bean , ( IL - 8 ) .
09 . $ 22,500 , Thomas Edwards , ( TX - 17 ) .
10 . $ 22,100 , Joe Baca , ( CA - 43 ) .
While such “ contributions ” may seem like a windfall to the folks back home struggling with high gas prices , for Congress ’ well - connected industry “ friends ” its so much chump change .
As Washington Technology ’s “ 2008 Top Government IT Contractors ” detailed in May , telecoms fishing for taxpayer dollars have found the Bush regime a rather generous “ partner ” indeed .
With contracts running the gamut from the Department of Defense to the 16 agencies comprising America ’s intelligence “ community ” –overseen by Booz Allen Hamilton alumnus Michael McConnell ( No. 11 on Washington Technology ’s “ Top 100 ” with some $ 2,401,528,741 in government payouts ) –its a sure bet the telecoms got exactly what they wanted , immunity , and at bargain basement prices to boot !
Clocking in at No. 14 , ITT Corporation raked in $ 1,800,281,433 ; at No. 18 , Verizon Communications Inc. “ earned ” $ 1,320,637,982 ; at No. 25 , Sprint - Nextel scooped - up $ 839,946,000 ; at No. 51 , Qwest Communications International Inc. “ generously received ” $ 306,617,000 ; at No. 60 , Comtech Telecommunications Corporation “ handled ” $ 276,880,406 in generous donations ; at No. 77 , ViaSat Inc. , hardly a slouch , “ merited ” $ 192,844,980 in NSA and “ defense - related ” largess .
As MAPLight ’s Daniel Newman averred , “ Who ’s more likely to get a meeting you or AT&T , which donates million of dollars and has the legislator ’s ear ? ”
Good question .
But no matter how you divvy - up the spoils for gutting the Constitution and stripping Americans ’ of privacy rights , you ’d have to agree it ’s still the best Congress money can buy !
UPDATE
We now believe we have a full rendering pass ( but not necessarily an animation smoothness pass yet ) .
See the bottom of the post for details .
UPDATE
The Windows nightly is now available for download .
See below for details .
With r31342 WebKit has become the first publicly available rendering engine to achieve 100/100 on Acid3 .
The final test , test 79 , was a brutal torture test of SVG text rendering .
Details of the bugs we fixed will follow .
Indeed , we found a critical bug in the test itself that would have forced a violation of the SVG 1.1 standard to pass , so until a few hours ago it was not possible to get a valid 100/100 .
Acid3 test editor Ian Hickson has the details .
Note : this does not indicate a full pass of Acid3 .
We have a slight glitch in the text rendering that is likely to be fixed soon ( patch in progress ) .
Also , the animation is required to be smooth .
On typical machines , if you look really closely , you can see a small glitch in the animation on test 26 because 26 is designed to be a performance test .
However , we think we are faster than all other browsers on test 26 .
What constitutes a smooth animation is somewhat subjective .
This is not just a screenshot , you can pull live from SVN and build to see it yourself , and a fresh nightly build is coming soon .
Update :
Thanks to our own Dan Bernstein , as of r31356 we believe we have a pixel - perfect match for the reference rendering .
Get the fresh hot bits of the latest Mac and Windows nightly builds which include the full reference rendering pass .
Extra special bonus update : Alp Toker reports that the Gtk port now gets 100/100 , although it does not yet match the reference rendering .
Oil at $ 135 ?
That was just the opening skirmish in the " peak oil " wars .
The latest smart money ?
$ 200 oil in 2010 , with gasoline at $ 7 a gallon .
And that is going to turn Americans into car - shunning Europeans once and for all �poor Americans , at least .
That 's the latest gloomy forecast from Jeff Rubin at Canadian brokerage CIBC World Markets , who just a few months ago figured $ 200 oil would be a thing of the distant future �like 2012 .
Attention - grabber ...
I ran into Lowell a couple of days ago down at the HIVE where he was helping out with the BikeMe ! open hours .
Lowell knows bikes ; when he came to Greensboro three years ago he brought with him the bicycle he had bought in Artesia , New Mexico in 1983 — he would still be riding that bike today if it had n’t been demolished when a car ran into him last year .
He came to Greensboro in the spring of 2005 with the bike , some clothes , and a guy who skipped town shortly after he dropped Lowell off in a patch of woods near the Coliseum .
That ’s where Lowell lived for the first summer and winter , in a makeshift shelter of plywood and shingles .
After the police started coming around too often , he moved further out — “ further out ” is the only address I have for him , and the only address I want to have — and that ’s where he ’s been ever since .
I was glad to see Lowell .
Homelessness almost by definition makes people hard to track down , and Lowell is more difficult than some because he refuses to use email .
“ How do you communicate with people then ? ” I asked him once .
He answered the question with patience .
“ I talk to them . ”
I had asked Lowell a couple of months ago if I could interview him for this blog , and he had told me to go ahead and tell him when I was ready .
With all that ’s happening at the HIVE and Food Not Bombs — Lowell is deeply involved in both — and with all the talk in Greensboro about the need for a day center , this seemed like a good time to write some more about homelessness .
I told Lowell I wanted to share some of his ingenious survival tactics .
“ Not survival , ” he corrected me .
“ I do a lot more than survive . ”
“ How about thrival tactics , ” I said .
“ That ’s better , ” Lowell said .
“ I thrive . ”
We made an arrangement to meet early at Food Not Bombs to talk .
The weather on Tuesday was lovely .
There must be a term in poetics or in physics for the feeling it gave me , for the strange way certain kinds of light can rearrange chronology .
The clear , warm afternoon sunlight that filled the high - ceilinged room at St. Mary ’s House belonged to a sequence of early summer afternoons that stretch all the way back to those first breathless days of summer vacation .
It could have been 1958 or 1978 or last year ; it could have been New Hampshire or Massachusetts or North Carolina .
It had a floating , expansive quality that disengaged the day from Monday and Wednesday and strung it on a longer and more tender string .
“ I ’m not really homeless , you know , ” Lowell said as we settled into the little nest of sofas by the front door , “ I ’m just houseless .
I like the spot where I am . ”
I asked him what he did about the necessities — drinking water , for instance .
“ You always boil the water — that ’s not hard , ” he said .
You ca n’t burn wood or they ’ll find you .
You use a candle . ”
“ A candle ?
That ’s hot enough ? ”
“ Sure — all you need is a candle and a pot from Goodwill or the dumpster .
You can use any kind of candle , anything but natural beeswax ; paraffin burns the hottest .
Then you make a grid out of green sticks to hold the pan and you shelter the candle from the wind .
Long butane lighters , the kind people use on gas grills , are best .
Matches are hard to keep dry — even if you seal them in a plastic bag , the bag has a tendency to sweat on the inside .
The only exception is waxed matches designed for camping . ”
“ Then what ? ” I said .
“ Oh , once you have boiling water there ’s a lot you can make — ramen noodles , instant oatmeal , soup .
Or you can heat food right in a can . ”
Danny came over with a plastic bag full of peppers and tomatoes from the kitchen — we encourage people to come into the kitchen and take whatever food is n’t going into that night ’s meal .
“ You know what that means , ” he said , hoisting the bag .
“ A pot of beans . ”
Danny is one of the people participating in the new Housing First program — he ’s living in his own apartment again for the first time in a couple of years .
He sat down on the other sofa .
“ Where does the canned food come from ? ” I asked Lowell .
“ Sometimes the dumpster , sometimes a food pantry , ” he said .
“ Urban Ministry is hard , ” Danny said .
“ They wo n’t give you a bag of food unless you arrive in a car . ”
“ A car ? ” I said .
Mike sat down next to Danny .
“ They ’re afraid you ’ll sell it , ” he said .
“ If you ’re homeless Urban Ministry will give you an overnight bag , something like a packet of crackers , a can of tuna — a dinky little can , not even one of the regular ones , ” Danny said .
“ I had a couple of overnight bags , and then when I got my own place I got a ride over there and tried to sign up but they said I could n’t because I ’d already had four overnight bags this year . ”
“ There ’s not a limit on overnight bags , ” Mike said .
“ Apparently there was for me .
They wanted my ID and my social .
When they looked me up they told me I could n’t get a full bag because I ’d been there before .
They told me and they told my caseworker . ”
Mike shook his head .
“ They do what they want to do . ”
“ That , ” said Danny “ about sums it up , ”
Lowell does n’t have an ID or a social security card , and he does n’t have the paperwork to get them .
He lost them back in New Mexico .
“ You did better than I did , ” he said .
“ All I got from them is ‘ I do n’t know what to tell you ’ and ‘ I do n’t care ’ . ”
“ How do you open the can ? ” I said .
“ P38 , ” Lowell and Danny said at the same time .
“ What ’s a P38 ? ”
Danny reached into his pocket and pulled out a small flat piece of metal about the size of a razor blade .
“ Army can opener , ” he said .
“ That and a plastic spoon out of the dumpster and you ’re set , ” Lowell said .
“ The first thing I did after I ’d made that shelter in the woods was start collecting stuff out of the dumpster — candles , food , LED lights from behind the drugstore .
I slept on couch cushions .
I found a tarp and put it over the opening of the shelter .
I spent one winter in that little shelter — with the tarp down I could light a candle inside and not even see my breath . ”
“ So what are the basics that somebody needs ? ”
Lowell stood up and reached into his pockets : bike key , small Swiss Army knife , a neat packet of folded papers —
Lowell calls them his “ memory papers ” , folded notes and flyers that are the equivalent of a daytimer — an LED flashlight from the dollar store .
“ I prefer the LED , ” Lowell said .
” Much brighter than a regular flashlight and it runs on AAA batteries , which are cheaper . ”
“ It ’s best to keep only the bare necessities , ” Danny said .
“ When I was homeless I carried a military backpack .
If it did n’t fit into the backpack I did n’t keep it . ”
“ Is there something you wish you had but did n’t ?
Something like , I do n’t know , like an axe or something ? ”
Lowell shrugged .
“ A woodsman ’s machete would be nice , ” he l said .
“ It would make it easier to clean raccoons . ”
Mike made a face and shifted on the sofa .
He ’s from Brooklyn .
“ It ’s hard to clean a raccoon with something this size , ” Lowell went on , holding the diminutive Swiss Army knife on the flat of his palm .
“ Why do you carry such a small knife ? ” I asked .
“ You ca n’t bring anything bigger into Urban Ministry . ”
“ But how do you sneak up on a raccoon ? ”
“ You do n’t need to — they come to you , ” Lowell said , and Danny nodded .
“ You hit them right behind the head with a big stick and break their neck . ”
“ You use your light , ” Danny said .
“ Everything freezes when you shine your light on them . ”
“ That ’s usually just long enough , ” Lowell said .
“ Then what ? ”
“ The first thing after that is to cut both ends off and throw them out as far as you can .
That ’s to keep the other raccoons away .
They ’ll eat the head and the tail and leave you alone .
Then you just skin it and clean it and cook it . ”
“ Do you do anything with the skin ? ” I had a brief internal picture of Lowell sitting cross-legged in the woods stitching himself a raccoon - skin comforter .
“ Throw it out same as the tail and the head . ”
“ You do n’t make anything out of it ? ”
“ Not if I do n’t want the fleas .
And I ’m careful about the raccoons I eat — I do n’t eat the raccoons that eat out of people ’s garbage cans , or the ones that come out of the sewer . ”
“ I eat out of people ’s garbage cans , ” I said .
“ Not the kind of garbage cans I ’m talking about , ” Lowell said .
When the raccoon is cleaned and skinned Lowell fries the meat over a candle , or adds it to a can of stew .
“ It ’s the same with snakes , squirrels , rabbits–even the occasional chicken will wander in down there . ”
“ Possum , ” Danny said .
“ The only thing I ’ve had any problem catching is the frogs . ”
Mike said “ You eat snakes ? ’
“ If they ’re two inches in diameter I do .
Black bull snakes .
Then there ’s the wild fruit .
In town there ’s people ’s fruit trees all over the place hanging out over the sidewalk .
And in the woods strawberries , blackberries , mulberries .
All you have to do is watch what the animals eat .
If they do n’t eat it I do n’t eat it , if they do n’t drink it I do n’t drink it .
The only difference is I boil the water . ”
The smells coming out of the kitchen were growing richer and deeper , filling the space with sonorous tones of garlic and onion .
We had been given a couple of bags of potatoes and Morris was deep frying them — big meaty wedges dusted with chili powder and sea salt .
He brought out some of the first batch and passed them around ; crisp and hot to the touch on the outside , cool and yielding on the inside .
“ To me it ’s like being in the army on bivouac , ” Danny said , brushing the salt off his hands .
“ The only difference is that in the army you do n’t know who the enemy is .
When you ’re homeless you know who the enemy is .
It ’s the guy next to you . ”
Lowell nodded .
“ I have more peace now than I did when I had a home .
I know where my enemies are , and they ’re not where I am . ”
“ What do you mean by enemies ? ” I said .
Like all homeless people Lowell gets stopped a lot by the police when he ’s walking or riding his bike or even just sitting ; it infuriates him .
“ Do you mean the government ?
The police ?
“ Oh no , they ’re everyone ’s enemies , ” Lowell said .
“ I mean the people who have decided they are my enemy , the ones who would rather hurt me than help me .
It could be the agencies , the churches , it could be other homeless .
I did n’t choose to be their enemy , they chose to be mine .
What I ’ve learned is that you should always do the opposite of what they tell you .
Whatever they tell you to do , you go in the opposite direction instantly or you ’re going to wind up in that pit with them . ”
I still was n’t sure I entirely understood , but Danny was speaking .
“ There are people who make the rest of the homeless look bad . ”
Mike nodded .
“ One person can ruin it for everyone else .
Because of those selected few things happen to all of us . ”
Stan had been standing a little outside the circle .
He came in and sat down .
“ They ’ll use any reason to stop you .
Any reason . ”
“ You know , though , when you ’re homeless there are a lot of headaches you do n’t have , ” Danny said .
“ How you ’re going to pay the electric bill , how you ’re going to hold onto your job , all that .
With homelessness , once you get used to it , it ’s actually better . ”
“ It ’s like Will Rogers said : anything will work if you ’ll let it , ” Lowell said .
“ But a lot of people just do n’t know .
They do n’t know that you ’re set up to fail .
They do n’t know that there ’s no way you can succeed under this system . ”
“ You want to know something ? ” Danny said “ All those people in the middle class , upper middle class , all the people that look down on us , if we do n’t get somebody worthwhile up there –I do n’t care if it ’s Hillary or Obama , anybody that ’s not what we ’ve got right now –there are going to be a lot more of them out here with us .
And when that happens I think you ’re going to start seeing the suicide rate go up .
They ’re not going to be able to take it . ”
Stan shook his head .
“ It ’s too late .
It does n’t matter any more who ’s up there .
Four years is n’t enough , forty years is n’t enough , to undo what ’s been done .
Basically the way it is now , we either live together or we ’re going to die together . ”
But it was six o’clock .
There was a rustling at the other end of the room as people lined up next to the tables that had been set up with stir - fried vegetables and fruit and bread and Morris ’s deep - fried potatoes .
The sun was level now through the windows , glinting off the water pitcher and the forks and the stack of china plates .
I was n’t staying that night to eat , but I did take another one of Morris ’s potatoes .
People were eating , sitting and talking and eating , as I closed the door behind me .

As she glides through the water , Winter the dolphin appears to be completely normal .
But she is the world 's first bionic sea creature after being fitted with an artificial tail .

How to Choose a Resume Writing Service
Having an attention - grabbing resume is one of the most important parts of the job search .
Your resume and cover letter are your introduction to a potential employer ; and without a strong introduction , you may never get another chance to make a good impression .
As a result , the success of your job hunt can hang on how well your resume is written .
Maybe you are entering the work force after graduating from college .
Or maybe you just need to find a new job .
Regardless of why you are looking for work , a skilled resume writer has the power to help you get your foot in the door .
Why Should You Use a Professional Resume Writer ?
Resume services are more than just a word processing or proofreading service .
A writer takes your work experience , education , your strengths and weakness , and ties it all up into one well articulated package .
Although people usually think of their resume as a simplistic listing of their education and experience , it is actually more like a sales document .
In order for your resume to effectively sell you , it not only has to be well written and visually appealing , but also has to present the goods ; you in the best possible light .
Sound easy ?
Of course not .
Why is it , then , that so many people attempt to write their resumes on their own ?
You would n’t try to write a legal contract when the outcome could impact the rest of your life ; you would hire a lawyer .
By the same token , you should entrust your resume to a professional service that has written hundreds of resumes .
What Does a Resume Writing Service Do ?
A good resume writing service ’s goal is to convince potential employers that you are perfect for the job .
In order to sell your strengths , a resume writer will :
Discuss your career focus and gear your resume to your unique goals
Choose the best resume format to highlight your strengths
Write an attention - getting summary or list of objectives
Use convincing language to maximize your strengths and minimize your weaknesses
Personalize your resume in a way that shows you off to your best advantage
Make your resume available in different file formats if needed
Make changes as necessary
Of course , a resume does n’t really stand by itself .
Your career decisions , where and how you search for jobs , and the quality of your cover letter all impact how your resume is received .
In other words , if you are looking for work in the wrong places , or do n’t introduce your resume properly in the cover letter , it wo n’t matter how dazzling your resume is .
CV writing services often offer a whole package approach to resume writing .
To ensure that you land your dream job , your resume writer may offer additional services , such as :
Career consultation
Job search consultation
Cover letter writing
Resume distribution
Interview preparation
What Should You Look for in a Resume Writing Service ?
A good service is one that offers you everything necessary to get the attention of potential employers .
When shopping for a resume service , you should look for :
Convincing literature on their services .
Whether you are browsing a website or looking at an informational pamphlet , pay close attention to how convincing the literature is .
If they ca n’t sell themselves , they likely wo n’t be able to do a good job of selling you .
A good reputation .
Do n’t forget to Google !
If a professional resume service is worth its salt , you should be able to find good reviews from happy customers .
Even more importantly , if they are n’t any good you are almost certain to find complaints .
Experience .
Your career is in your resume writer ’s hands , so make sure you choose a service with experience .
If your career is in a specialized field , you might even want to look for a writer who specializes in the field .
A resume writer that knows the industry will also know what its employers look for in a resume .
Education .
Submitting a resume with errors is embarrassing enough , but when you ’ve paid to have it done right it ’s downright tragic .
Make sure your resume writer is educated and / or certified , so that you can be sure you ’re getting your moneys worth .
Personal attention .
You do n’t want someone who is going to simply plug your information into a resume writing program , you could do that yourself .
In order for your resume to stand out , it needs a unique touch that can only be achieved if your resume writer has taken the time to discuss it with you .
Resume service reviews .
The best resume writing services will have plenty of satisfied customers out there .
The purpose of this page is to compile resume service reviews so that potential resume customers can more easily choose the best resume service for them .
Of course , when you are shopping for a resume service , do n’t forget to listen to your gut .
You will have to work closely with the writer during the creation of your resume , so it is important to feel comfortable with him or her .
Putting Your Career First Hiring a resume writing service ensures that your resume looks professional and gets attention .
Although the expense may seem unnecessary , consider that you have already invested thousands of dollars into your education so that you could simply get to this point .
When your entire career is at stake , do n’t throw it away over a typo or a passive verb !
A resume writing service can help you make your dream job a reality .

How a Professional Resume Writer Creates a Stand - Out Resume to Land Your Next Job
Crafting a compelling resume or Curriculum Vitae ( CV ) can be one of the most difficult tasks a job seeker faces .
With so many varying standards across different industries , it can be hard to determine exactly what to include – and what to leave out – on this important document .
While the use of color is a personal preference , the “ devil is in the details ” when it comes to crafting a resume that will stand out among the sea the applications that come across a hiring managers desk .
Below are four ways that top notch resume writers use when writing your resume .
Catch their attention with a strong summary
If you had to summarize all of your skills and experiences in one – two sentences , what would you say ?
Fortunately , knowing the type of job you are applying for can help you tailor this section .
For example , if you are applying to a job with a heavy emphasis on project management you would want to acknowledge your experience with a summary statement such as : “ Experienced project manager with demonstrated ability to meet deadlines and exceed client expectations . ”
List your most relevant experience first
Just as you would tailor your summary to appeal to the specific requirements of a job posting , you must also apply the same principle to your description of past experiences .
Bulleting responsibilities and skills may make your resume easier to read but it also limits the amount of space you have to explain your qualifications .
Whether you choose to format your resume with bullets or with paragraphs , make sure the most relevant experience is the first item in your description of responsibilities .
Create multiple versions of a resume tailored to each job posting
Perhaps the most time consuming aspect of searching for a new job is writing a unique cover letter for each job application .
Just as you would not use a generic cover letter for each job , you should apply this same principle to your resume .
Whereas a CV can span multiple pages and is likely to remain the same for various uses , the limited space of a resume ( 1 - 2 pages ) means you must be selective and concise in the skills and abilities you want to showcase .
Check your grammar
A common mistake made among many new and experienced job seekers is the tendency to overlook verb tense in the description of responsibilities .
Past employment responsibilities should include past - tense verbs such as “ managed , ” “ directed , ” “ engaged , ” and so on .
Current employment responsibilities should focus on the present by describing responsibilities as “ managing , ” “ directing , ” and “ engaging . ”
You can use a number of online tools to help check for spelling and grammar errors , like the popular Grammarly .
It is also always a good idea to have a friend or colleague look over your resume before submitting it to hiring managers to catch any mistakes you may have missed .
Last but not least , it is good practice to take a step back and look at your finished document as a whole .
An overcrowded resume in 10pt font is unappealing , no matter how great the content is .
Good luck out there job seekers !
Lou
Ye won the main prize at the Rotterdam Film Festival in 2000
Lou entered romance Summer Palace for competition without clearing it with China 's censors , state media reported .
The film , which features explicit sex scenes , takes place around the Tiananmen Square protests in 1989 .
Lou said at Cannes in June that he would consider changing the film 's content so it could be seen in China .
An official at China 's State Administration of Radio , Film and Television confirmed news of the ban to the country 's official Xinhua News Agency , but declined to give any further comment .
The news agency reported that the film would be confiscated along with any income made from it .
Sensitive
The producer of Summer Palace , Nai An , has also been banned from film - making for five years .
Summer Palace was the only Asian film which competed for the prestigious Palme D'Or at the film festival in France earlier this year .
Hong Kong media reported at the time that Chinese outlets were banned from reporting Lou Ye's appearance at Cannes .
The 1989 protests in Beijing remain a sensitive issue with the Chinese authorities , who still condemn them as " counter - revolutionary " .
